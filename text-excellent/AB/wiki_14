Joaquim José Inácio, Viscount of Inhaúma

Joaquim José Inácio, Viscount of Inhaúma (; 1 August 1808 – 8 March 1869), was a naval officer, politician and monarchist of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>. He was born in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Kingdom of Portugal</a>, and his family moved to Brazil two years later. After <a href="Independence%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian independence</a> in 1822, Inhaúma enlisted in the <a href="Imperial%20Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian navy</a>. Early in his career during the latter half of the 1820s, he participated in the subduing of secessionist rebellions: first the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Equator">Confederation of the Equator</a>, and then the <a href="Cisplatine%20War">Cisplatine War</a>, which precipitated a long international armed conflict with the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20River%20Plate">United Provinces of the River Plate</a>.

Throughout the chaos that characterized the years when Emperor <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a> was a minor, Inhaúma remained loyal to the government. He helped quell a military mutiny in 1831 and was involved in suppressing some of the other rebellions that erupted during that troubled period. He saw action in the <a href="Sabinada">Sabinada</a> between 1837 and 1838, followed by the <a href="Ragamuffin%20War">Ragamuffin War</a> from 1840 until 1844. In 1849, after spending two years in Great Britain, Inhaúma was given command of the fleet that was instrumental in subduing the <a href="Praieira%20revolt">Praieira revolt</a>, the last rebellion in imperial Brazil.

During the 1850s, Inhaúma held a series of bureaucratic positions. He entered politics in 1861 as a member of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28Brazil%29">Conservative Party</a>. He became a cabinet member and was given the position of navy minister. Inhaúma also became the first person to hold the Ministry of Agriculture portfolio, albeit briefly. The first professional <a href="firefighter">firefighter</a> corps in Brazil was formed during his tenure as agriculture minister. In late 1866, Inhaúma was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet engaged in the <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>. During the fighting, he achieved the rank of admiral, the highest in the Brazilian armada. He was also awarded a noble title, eventually being raised from baron to viscount. In 1868, he was elected to the national legislature's lower house, but never assumed office.

Although he successfully prosecuted his operations in the war against <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>, Inhaúma's leadership was encumbered by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior. While in command in the war zone, he became mentally exhausted and contracted an unknown disease. Seriously ill, Inhaúma returned to the national capital in early 1869 and died shortly thereafter. Although historical works have not given much coverage to Inhaúma, some historians regard him among the greatest of the Brazilian navy officers.

Joaquim José Inácio was born in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Kingdom of Portugal</a>. Although the date on his birth certificate was 30 July 1808, his mother claimed that the correct birthdate was two days later, on 1 August. He personally affirmed that the later date was accurate, as did his younger brother, who was his biographer. Regardless, some biographers, including <a href="Joaquim%20Manuel%20de%20Macedo">Joaquim Manuel de Macedo</a> and Carlos Guilherme Haring, have persisted in citing the date mistakenly entered on the birth certificate.

Joaquim Inácio's parents were José Vitorino de Barros and Maria Isabel de Barros. In 1808, the Portuguese Royal family moved to <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, then the largest and wealthiest colony of Portugal. Two years later, on 10 July 1810, José de Barros arrived in the Brazilian capital, <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. As a crew member of the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> "D. Carlota", he was charged with transporting what remained of the personal property of Prince Regent Dom João, later King <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20VI%20of%20Portugal">João VI</a> to Brazil. José de Barros also brought his family on the voyage, including Joaquim Inácio, who was then one year and eight months old. Joaquim Inácio had an older sister named Maria and six younger siblings (who were born after the arrival in Brazil), among them Bento José de Carvalho and Antônio José Vitorino de Barros.

As was common at the time, Joaquim Inácio began his education at home and was later enrolled in "Seminário de São José" (<a href="Saint%20Joseph">Saint Joseph</a> School) and after that, in "Seminário São Joaquim" (<a href="Joachim">Saint Joachim</a> School), which became <a href="Col%C3%A9gio%20Pedro%20II">Pedro II School</a> in 1837. His teachers included <a href="Janu%C3%A1rio%20da%20Cunha%20Barbosa">Januário da Cunha Barbosa</a>, who later became one of the leading figures in the Brazilian independence movement. Joaquim Inácio chose to follow his father, a naval officer who achieved the rank of second lieutenant, in his choice of a career. On 20 November 1822 at the age of 14, Joaquim Inácio was admitted as "aspirante a guarda-marinha" (aspiring midshipman or naval cadet) at the Navy Academy. On 11 December 1823, he graduated from the academy, majoring in mathematics, with the rank of "guarda-marinha" (<a href="midshipman">midshipman</a>). As he had in previous studies at other schools, Joaquim Inácio proved to be a brilliant student. Among his colleagues at the academy was <a href="Francisco%20Manuel%20Barroso%2C%20Baron%20of%20Amazonas">Francisco Manuel Barroso da Silva</a> (later Baron of Amazonas) whom he befriended.

When Prince Dom Pedro (later Emperor Dom <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Pedro I</a>), son and heir of King João VI, led the movement for the <a href="independence%20of%20Brazil">independence of Brazil</a>, Joaquim Inácio was one of several Portuguese-born residents who sided with the Brazilian cause and joined the armada (as the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> was called in the imperial era). On 16 January 1824, he began his service aboard the "D. Pedro I", a <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> and flagship of First Admiral <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Thomas Cochrane, Marquis of Maranhão</a>. Joaquim Inácio did not fight in any battles, as the Portuguese enemy forces had surrendered by that time. His baptism of fire came a few months later with the advent of the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Equator">Confederation of the Equator</a>, a secessionist rebellion in Brazil's northeastern provinces. He was given the command of the <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a> "Independente" and aided in the suppression of rebels in <a href="Ros%C3%A1rio%2C%20Maranh%C3%A3o">Rosário do Itapecuru</a>, a village in the province of <a href="Maranh%C3%A3o">Maranhão</a>. The rebellion was over by early 1825, and on 25 February Joaquim Inácio was promoted to second lieutenant.

In June 1825, Joaquim Inácio traveled to Brazil's far south to quell a secessionist rebellion in the province of <a href="Cisplatina">Cisplatina</a>. The insurgents were aided by the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20River%20Plate">United Provinces of the River Plate</a> (later <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>), which led to the <a href="Cisplatine%20War">Cisplatine War</a>. Joaquim Inácio served as <a href="chief%20mate">first officer</a> aboard the <a href="patache">patache</a> "Pará", which was stationed in Colônia de Sacramento (present-day <a href="Colonia%20del%20Sacramento">Colonia del Sacramento</a>), the second most important town in Cisplatina. By late February 1826, Sacramento was besieged by enemy forces. Joaquim Inácio was sent ashore and placed in charge of the "Santa Rita" battery, composed of sailors and cannons from the Brazilian ships. He took an active part in successfully repelling enemy attacks upon Sacramento on 7 February, 26 February and 14 March.

On the night of 10 March 1826 and in the midst of the siege of Sacramento, Joaquim Inácio boarded a small, unarmed boat accompanied by a single army officer and passed unnoticed through a line of nineteen enemy ships under cover of darkness. He reached the main Brazilian fleet on the morning of the next day and requested assistance from Vice-Admiral <a href="Rodrigo%20Jos%C3%A9%20Ferreira%20Lobo">Rodrigo José Ferreira Lobo</a>, the commander-in-chief of the naval forces operating in the war. Joaquim Inácio returned to Sacramento two days later under heavy enemy fire along with three boats carrying supplies and arms. Although welcomed as a hero in the besieged town, he was passed over for a promotion. Disregard for this achievement was due to his lack of wealth and family connections, a burden which continued to thwart his career for years to come.

In February 1827, Joaquim Inácio was transferred to the crew of the corvette "Duquesa de Goiás", in which he was to take part in the invasion of <a href="Carmen%20de%20Patagones">Carmen de Patagones</a>, a village in the northeast of the United Provinces that served as a port for <a href="Piracy">corsairs</a>. The "Duquesa de Goiás" sank during the expedition, killing several crew members. Joaquim Inácio insisted on being the last officer to leave the vessel. He was next given the command of the <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Constança". The invasion of Carmen was a complete failure, and the Brazilian land forces were defeated and taken prisoner. On 7 March, while Joaquim Inácio awaited news of the invasion, the "Constança" and another schooner were surrounded by enemy vessels. After a desperate battle, he was taken captive after refusing to surrender.

The Brazilian prisoners were placed together aboard a <a href="brig">brig</a> bound for <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, capital of the United Provinces. They suffered severe hardship, starving and almost naked. Under the leadership of Joaquim Inácio, the Brazilians staged an uprising, took control of the ship and made prisoners of their captors. The ship successfully eluded two corvettes and one <a href="Brig">schooner-brig</a> that had pursued them, and sailed on to <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, capital of Cisplatina, which they reached in safety on 29 August 1827. Despite Joaquim Inácio's daring rescue of Brazilian prisoners of war from both the invasion's land-based forces and from the two schooners, he was reprimanded by the commander-in-chief Vice-Admiral <a href="Rodrigo%20Pinto%20Guedes%2C%20Baron%20of%20Rio%20da%20Prata">Rodrigo Pinto Guedes, Baron of Rio da Prata</a> (who had replaced Rodrigo Lobo) for the loss of the "Constança".

Joaquim Inácio returned to Rio de Janeiro in October, his tour of duty having lasted three years. He was then sent back to Cisplatina aboard the frigate "Niterói" and in December he became the first officer of the <a href="barque">barque</a> "Grenfell". On 17 February 1828, he fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Quilmes%20%281828%29">Battle of Quilmes</a>. During the engagement, the Brazilian barque-brig (three-masted barque) "Vinte e nove de agosto" ran aground and was about to be boarded. Seeing this, Joaquim Inácio positioned the "Grenfell" near the threatened vessel and protected her until she could be freed by the rising tide. Both ships returned to the battle, which resulted in a Brazilian victory. Brazil's efforts in the war were ultimately in vain, as it eventually relinquished Cisplatina, which became the independent nation of <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>. In July 1829, Joaquim Inácio again returned to Rio de Janeiro, and on 17 October he was promoted to first lieutenant.

On 17 March 1831, Joaquim Inácio married Maria José de Mariz Sarmento. Her father was an officer in the Portuguese navy whose own father and paternal grandfather had also been military officers. Maria José de Mariz Sarmento belonged to the noble Portuguese family of Mariz and was a parent of <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20de%20Mariz">Antônio de Mariz</a>, one of the founders of <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, as narrated in 1857 by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Alencar">José de Alencar</a> in his novel <a href="The%20Guarani">The Guarani</a>. Joaquim Inácio and Maria José had several children: Ana Elisa de Mariz e Barros, Joaquim José Inácio, <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Carlos%20de%20Mariz%20e%20Barros">Antônio Carlos de Mariz e Barros</a> and Carlota Adelaide de Mariz e Barros. The couple also had a girl and a boy, named Constança and Manuel respectively, both of whom died in infancy.

A month and a half after Joaquim Inácio's marriage, Emperor Pedro I abdicated and sailed to Europe. Since the former emperor's son and heir Dom <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a> was a minor, a <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">regency</a> was formed, and more than a decade of instability and turmoil ensued. On 6 October 1831, navy artillerymen, held under suspicion of plotting a mutiny, escaped the "presiganga" (prison ship) in which they had been confined. Joaquim Inácio commanded the schooner "Jaguaripe" which, along with other vessels, had been guarding the prison ship. Seeing that the artillerymen had set sail for Rio de Janeiro, Joaquim Inácio and a few men took a boat to warn the city. They encountered <a href="musket">musket</a> fire from the artillerymen, who then changed course for the nearby <a href="Ilha%20das%20Cobras">Ilha das Cobras</a> (Island of the Snakes) in the face of strong opposition from the mainland. They were defeated the next day when three columns of men from the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion and Permanent Municipal Guard Corps invaded the island.

In January 1833, strong winds forced the old and poorly built "Jaguaripe" aground off Santa Marta beach in the southern province of <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>, where it sank. Joaquim Inácio was again the last to abandon ship. The entire crew was rescued, though he himself barely survived. Joaquim Inácio and his younger brother Bento José (who was also a navy officer) stayed afloat by holding onto a leather basket until reaching the shore. Afterward, Joaquim Inácio was court martialed and absolved of any wrongdoing. On 5 April 1833, he was given command of the barque-brig "Vinte e nove de agosto" (the same ship he had saved in 1828) and sailed to the province of Maranhão. The last time he had been in the province was in 1825. He remained stationed in the provincial capital (<a href="S%C3%A3o%20Lu%C3%ADs%2C%20Maranh%C3%A3o">São Luís</a>) as chief of the port until his return to Rio de Janeiro on 30 December 1836. He was transferred to the steam barque "Urânia" in 1837 and later, on 19 July of the same year, to the brig "Constança" (a different vessel than the schooner he lost in 1827).

Joaquim Inácio departed Rio de Janeiro on 11 August 1837 for <a href="Salvador%2C%20Bahia">Salvador</a>, capital of the province of <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>. He had been charged with delivering the prisoner <a href="Bento%20Gon%C3%A7alves%20da%20Silva">Bento Gonçalves</a> (leader of the rebellion known as the <a href="Ragamuffin%20War">Ragamuffin War</a> that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul since 1835) to a military fortress. On 7 September 1837, Joaquim Inácio was promoted to <a href="captain%20lieutenant">captain lieutenant</a>. A couple of months later, the <a href="Sabinada">Sabinada</a> rebellion erupted in Salvador. The rebels freed Bento Gonçalves, who escaped back to Rio Grande do Sul. Joaquim Inácio took part in the blockade of that city until the end of the rebellion in March 1838. His lack of family connections and political influence again stymied his career in 1839, when he was passed over for a well-deserved promotion.

On 23 July 1840, Pedro II was declared of age and Joaquim Inácio was among the naval officers representing the armada in the delegation that greeted the young emperor. The rise of Pedro II to head the central government resulted in a slow, but steady, restoration of order in the country. On 17 December, Joaquim Inácio was named "inspetor do arsenal de marinha" (inspector of the navy shipyard) in <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>, the second most important town in Rio Grande do Sul. The province was still troubled by the Ragamuffin rebellion. He led the sailors manning the trenches surrounding Rio Grande and fought the Ragamuffins when they attacked the town in July 1841.

The Ragamuffin menace was halted when the government dispatched field marshal (present-day divisional general) <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Alves%20de%20Lima%20e%20Silva%2C%20Duke%20of%20Caxias">Luís Alves de Lima e Silva</a> (then Baron, later Duke of Caxias) in 1842. The Baron of Caxias had been the second in command of the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion when it put down the mutiny of navy artillerymen in 1831. He and Joaquim Inácio established a close, lifelong friendship. Joaquim Inácio was promoted to <a href="frigate%20captain">frigate captain</a> on 15 March 1844. Soon afterward, Joaquim Inácio was relieved of command, at his own request, after becoming ever more at odds with his superior. On 2 April 1845, he was assigned command of the frigate "Constituição" and in October returned to Rio Grande do Sul, which by that time had been pacified. He escorted the Emperor during his tour of the Brazilian southern provinces. Pedro II was favorably impressed with the character of the ship's captain. Dark-haired and of average height, Joaquim Inácio was joyful and pleasant. He was also hard-working, intelligent and well-learned. In addition to his native <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, he could also speak and write in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, English and French.

In August 1846, Joaquim Inácio sailed the "Constituição" to <a href="Devonport%2C%20Devon">Devonport</a> (then-known as Plymouth Dock) in the United Kingdom, where the ship was to undergo repairs. He paid a visit there to the elderly <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Thomas Cochrane, Marquis of Maranhão</a>, who queried him regarding Brazil's state of affairs. Joaquim Inácio returned to Brazil in May 1847 and was assigned to bureaucratic tasks. In April 1848, he was stationed, again at the helm of the "Constituição", in Bahia province. Later that year, the <a href="Praieira%20revolt">Praieira revolt</a> erupted in the nearby province of <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a>. In early November, Joaquim Inácio assumed the command of the fleet protecting <a href="Recife">Recife</a>, capital of Pernambuco. He sent many of his sailors ashore to aid in the town's defense. Recife was attacked by rebels on 2 February 1849. The insurgent attackers were defeated, and soon afterward the last rebellion of Brazil's imperial era came to an end. Joaquim Inácio, who fought in the streets with his men, later remarked: "It was not a battle, but a diabolical hunt from which I have escaped by miracle." He was awarded with a promotion to <a href="captain%20of%20sea%20and%20war">captain of sea and war</a> on 14 March.

On 26 May 1850, Joaquim Inácio was appointed inspector of the naval shipyard at Rio de Janeiro. He played no role in the <a href="Platine%20War">Platine War</a> that pitted the Empire against the <a href="Argentine%20Confederation">Argentine Confederation</a> (the <a href="Succession%20of%20states">successor state</a> of the United Provinces of the River Plate), which lasted from late 1851 until early 1852. He spent that period in the capital overseeing the construction and repair of several sailing vessels and steamships for the Brazilian armada. He was promoted to chief of division (modern-day <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a>) on 3 March 1852.

Throughout the 1850s, Joaquim Inácio was assigned to a succession of mostly bureaucratic positions. After being removed from the office of inspector on 8 November 1854, eleven days later he was named captain of the port of Rio de Janeiro (for both the city and province). From 1854 until 1860, he was appointed a member of various navy boards that dealt with matters ranging from promotions and equipment purchases to war spoils and standardization of naval uniforms. On 2 November 1855, Joaquim Inácio was named adjutant (equivalent to <a href="adjutant%20general">adjutant general</a>) to the navy minister. On 2 December 1856, he was promoted to chief of fleet (modern <a href="vice%20admiral">vice admiral</a>) and made a "Fidalgo Cavaleiro da Casa Imperial" (Knight Nobleman of the Imperial Household), which raised him to a position ranking above the members of chivalry orders and below the titled nobles (barons, counts, etc.). Joaquim Inácio also became a member and vice-president of the naval council (an advisory board) on 24 July 1858.

As had also been the case with his predecessors, the rank of adjutant was seen by Joaquim Inácio as an embarrassment. Inside the armada administration, it denoted the most important office, as it was filled by an officer who acted as the navy minister's direct representative in the armada. Even so, the title of "adjutant" was itself perceived as demeaning. Joaquim Inácio later complained: "In what part of the world ... does the navy minister have a <a href="general%20officer">general officer</a> as an adjutant? What is an <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>, other than a young officer who transmits orders, and even messages, he receives from his chief?" He concluded: "Thus the title of adjutant cannot encumber an officer who supervises the armada's discipline and answers for it." His request to have the designation for the position changed to a more appropriate title was ignored. He also felt slighted that many of his proposals to the navy boards regarding improvements were not acted on, and on 21 November 1860, he asked to be removed from all positions.

Freed from the demands of his former commissions, Joaquim Inácio spent his time translating Jean-Félicité-Théodore Ortolan's "Et Diplomatie De La Mer" (The Diplomacy of the Sea) from French into Portuguese. He was a cultured person whose penchants included poetry. He was also interested in plays and he was an elected member of the Dramatic Conservatory (which sponsored the national theater) from 8 June 1856. Joaquim Inácio was very religious and he often mentioned <a href="God%20in%20Christianity">God</a> and Catholic <a href="saint">saint</a>s in his letters. During the <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a> in the late 1860s, upon learning that he was being mocked and criticized by the Paraguayans for his religious devotion, Joaquim Inácio merely replied: "Leave me my beliefs and let them call me whatever they want." He was an enthusiastic member of the "Santa Casa de Misericórdia" (Holy House of Mercy), a charitable organization in Rio de Janeiro. When the national capital was ravaged by <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> in 1854, he went from door to door asking for donations to help the sick.

Despite his staunch Catholicism, Joaquim Inácio became a <a href="Freemasonry">freemason</a>, joining the "Loja Integridade Maçônica" (Freemasonry Integrity Lodge) in 1828. He eventually rose to the highest ranks of that <a href="Masonic%20Lodge">lodge</a>, becoming Deputy Grand Master in 1863. He was also accorded membership in other Brazilian lodges, became an honorary member of <a href="Freemasonry%20in%20Portugal">Portuguese Freemasonry</a> and was a representative of the <a href="Grand%20Orient%20de%20France">Grand Orient de France</a> in Brazil. Freemasonry opened new venues for Joaquim Inácio, providing him with connections and influence he had previously lacked and which were essential to advancing his political career. On 2 March 1861, his friend Caxias, also a freemason and staunch Catholic, became prime minister. He invited Joaquim Inácio, who became a member of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28Brazil%29">Conservative Party</a>, to assume the naval ministry's portfolio. It was commonplace in Brazil for high-ranking military officers to engage in politics.

He served as the first head of the newly created <a href="Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%20%28Brazil%29">Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce and Public Works</a> from 2 March 1861 until 21 April. Although created by a decree of 1856 (following a suggestion made by Joaquim Inácio in 1851), the first professional firefighter corps in Brazil was effectively formed under his tenure at the head of the Ministry of Agriculture. The cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's <a href="lower%20house">lower house</a>). Joaquim Inácio returned to his position on the naval council on 2 July and left that post when he became a member of the Supreme Military and Justice Council on 2 October 1864.

In December 1864, the dictator of Paraguay, <a href="Francisco%20Solano%20L%C3%B3pez">Francisco Solano López</a>, ordered an invasion of the Brazilian province of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a> (currently the state of <a href="Mato%20Grosso%20do%20Sul">Mato Grosso do Sul</a>), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>. The invasions resulted in an <a href="Treaty%20of%20the%20Triple%20Alliance">alliance</a> between Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. Following the resignation of Caxias's government in 1862, successor cabinets were headed by the Progressive League, the rival of the Conservative Party. As a Conservative, Joaquim Inácio found himself largely sidelined. He humorously commented that the Progressives "have not lifted my <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> by giving me a better ration of soup [i.e., any command of importance], thus I shall remain on a diet". In October 1865, Joaquim Inácio was sent to the north of Brazil, charged with recruiting volunteers, but soon resigned that commission and opted to devote his time to the Holy House of Mercy.

The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, but their advance by land was blocked by <a href="Fortress%20of%20Humait%C3%A1">fortifications at Humaitá</a> and naval forces faced the obstacle of entrenched defenses along the <a href="Paraguay%20River">Paraguay River</a>. The Progressive cabinet decided to create a unified command over Brazilian land and naval forces operating in Paraguay. It entrusted the command to Caxias, who in turn requested that Joaquim Inácio head the Brazilian fleet in Paraguay. On 22 December, Joaquim Inácio replaced his close friend Vice-Admiral <a href="Joaquim%20Marques%20Lisboa%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Tamandar%C3%A9">Joaquim Marques Lisboa</a> (then-Baron and later Marquis of Tamandaré) as fleet commander. For the sake of appearances, the new position was nominally "<a href="pro%20tempore">pro tempore</a>", since Tamandaré had virtually been forced to resign. On 5 February 1867, Joaquim Inácio was promoted to vice-admiral (equivalent to present-day <a href="squadron%20vice-admiral">squadron vice-admiral</a>), and sixteen days later he was made permanent commander-in-chief.

The allied objective was to encircle Humaitá and force its capitulation by siege. On 15 August 1867, under heavy fire, Brazilian warships forced the passage of Curupayty, an outer line of defense of Humaitá. Joaquim Inácio commanded from the <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> of the <a href="Brazilian%20ironclad%20Brasil">ironclad "Brasil"</a>, which engaged in the operation. Joaquim Inácio was afterwards awarded the noble title of "Barão de Inhaúma" (Baron of Inhaúma) on 27 September. The name came from <a href="Inha%C3%BAma%20%28Rio%20de%20Janeiro%29">Inhaúma</a>, a region (now a neighborhood) near the city of Rio de Janeiro. His wife had grown up there, and he himself owned a coffee farm in the area. Those landowners, including the Baron of Inhaúma, who produced coffee (the most valuable Brazilian export commodity) were the wealthiest and most influential people in Brazil's southeast. They were owners of slaves, and many of them formed the core of the Conservative Party (the ultraconservative wing called "saquarema") and were connected to each other through family and political ties.

After Inhaúma had punched through the defenses at Curupayty, he encountered three large chains stretched across the river at Humaitá that prevented further progress upriver beyond the fortress. He anchored his ships in a <a href="cove">cove</a> that became known as "Porto Elisiário" (Elisiário Port). For six months, the Brazilian warships remained stationed between Curupayty and Humaitá, bombarding both strongholds without causing any serious damage. The encirclement of Humaitá could not be completed until the Allies gained full control of the river. The Allied commander-in-chief, Argentine president <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Mitre">Bartolomé Mitre</a>, had pressed Inhaúma for months to execute that goal. The Brazilian had, however, developed second thoughts about the enterprise and procrastinated. He believed—unfairly—that Mitre would welcome the destruction of Brazil's warships, severely weakening the Empire militarily and geopolitically.

There were other factors that prompted Inhaúma to have second thoughts. The level of the river had fallen and as the encirclement on land had not been completed, even "if the Brazilian ships did manage to get past the batteries they could well become stranded, with little or no fuel and possibly no supporting Allied troops on the banks". Inhaúma also argued that the ironclads were too large and had limited manoeuvrability in the narrow channel at Humaitá, being better suited to seagoing operations than on a river. He preferred to wait for the shallow-draft <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a> that were under construction in Rio de Janeiro.

After a year in Paraguay, Inhaúma had also become ill with a lingering disease (not positively identified, although <a href="malaria">malaria</a> is suspected) and had fallen into <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, becoming what historian Francisco Doratioto themed "no more than a ghost of an admiral". By January 1868 Humaitá had been completely cut off from land reinforcement and the shallow-draft monitors had arrived. Both Inhaúma and his officers balked at putting the new vessels into action. It was Inhaúma's son-in-law, Captain of Sea and War <a href="Delfim%20Carlos%20de%20Carvalho%2C%20Baron%20of%20Passagem">Delfim Carlos de Carvalho</a> (soon Baron of Passagem) who volunteered to lead a squadron. On 19 February, the Brazilian ironclads successfully made a <a href="Passage%20of%20Humait%C3%A1">passage up the Paraguay River</a> under heavy fire, gaining full control of the river and thus isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.

On 2 March 1868, parties of Paraguayans in canoes camouflaged by foliage and brush boarded Brazilian ironclads anchored in Tayí. The imperiled vessels dispatched a boat to warn Inhaúma, who was aboard the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> "Brasil" downriver at Elisiário Port. By the time he arrived, the Brazilians had locked themselves inside their ships and the Paraguayans had taken control of the decks. Inhaúma ordered the "Brasil" and two other vessels to open fire, decimating the Paraguayans and saving the ironclads. A day later he was raised from baron to viscount by Pedro II. On 25 July, the allies occupied Humaitá after the Paraguayans had abandoned it and retreated further upriver.

Unknown to Inhaúma and only a few days before the fall of Humaitá, the Progressive cabinet in Rio de Janeiro had <a href="1868%20Brazilian%20political%20crisis">resigned following a political crisis</a>. The Emperor called the Conservatives, under the leadership of <a href="Joaquim%20Rodrigues%20Torres%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Itabora%C3%AD">Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Viscount of Itaboraí</a>, back into power on 16 July 1868. During the Progressive administration, Inhaúma had developed a trusting friendship with the able, young Navy Minister <a href="Afonso%20Celso%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Ouro%20Preto">Afonso Celso de Assis Figueiredo</a> (later Viscount of Ouro Preto). The return of the Conservatives resulted in Inhaúma's election to the Chamber of Deputies as a representative for the province of <a href="Amazonas%20%28Brazilian%20state%29">Amazonas</a>, although he would never assume office. In the new political climate, Inhaúma was also considered a contender for a senatorial chair representing the province of Rio de Janeiro.

Meanwhile, Caxias had organized an assault on the new Paraguayan defenses which López had thrown up along the Pikysyry, south of <a href="Asunci%C3%B3n">Asunción</a> (Paraguay's capital). This stream afforded a strong defensive position which was anchored by the Paraguay River and by the swampy jungle of the <a href="Chaco%20%28Paraguay%29">Chaco region</a>. Caxias had a road cut through the supposedly impenetrable Chaco, located on the other side of the Paraguayan River where the Allied army was camped. The Brazilian ships carried the Allied troops across the river, where they moved over the road which had been finished in December. The Allied forces <a href="Pikysyry%20maneuver">outflanked the Paraguayan lines</a> and attacked from the rear. The combined allied forces annihilated the Paraguayan army and on 1 January 1869 <a href="Asunci%C3%B3n">Asunción</a> was occupied.

Inhaúma reached the Paraguayan national capital on 3 January 1869, increasingly sick and depressed. He lamented in his private journal that the conflict "cannot be called a war but a killing of people, extermination of the Paraguayan nation". Inhaúma temporarily transferred his command to his son-in-law, the Baron of Passagem, on 16 January. On 28 January, Inhaúma was officially discharged from that post and promoted to <a href="admiral">admiral</a>, the highest rank in the armada. Having received permission from the Conservative cabinet to depart, he left for Rio de Janeiro on 8 February, arriving ten days later. Although welcomed "with the greatest demonstrations of enthusiasm", Inhaúma was so weak that he had to be carried from the docks to his <a href="carriage">carriage</a>. <a href="Alfredo%20d%27Escragnolle%20Taunay%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Taunay">Alfredo d'Escragnolle Taunay, Viscount of Taunay</a> in his memoirs said that Pedro II, upon learning of Inhaúma's arrival, refused to pay a visit to him. It had become common for officers to claim sickness so that they could withdraw from the war. The Emperor soon realized that Inhaúma was indeed very ill and asked for daily updates on his condition.

Inhaúma's health steadily deteriorated, and he died on 8 March at around 04:30 in the morning. According to historian Eugênio Vilhena de Morais, <a href="malaria">malaria</a> was the cause of death. His coffin was placed in a carriage reserved for the funerals of members of the imperial family. It was escorted by three cavalry <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadrons</a> and followed by three hundred carriages, while onlookers crowded both sides of the streets along the procession's route. Tamandaré and the future Viscount of Ouro Preto were among the pallbearers. He was buried in the "São Francisco Xavier" cemetery (popularly known as <a href="Caju%20Cemetery">Caju Cemetery</a>) in Rio de Janeiro.

Soon after his death, the Viscount of Inhaúma was hailed as "one of the greatest figures of the Brazilian armada" in the Brazilian Senate. He was extremely popular in the armada and was fondly called "Uncle Joaquim" by his subordinates. The Brazilian navy's slang phrase, ""andar na Inácia"", which meant to behave correctly, was derived from his name. Since 1870, no comprehensive biography of Inhaúma has been published, even though he, according to Francisco Eduardo Alves de Almeira, "is, and always will be, important to the navy of Brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief". The <a href="Inha%C3%BAma-class%20corvette">Inhaúma-class corvette</a>, built in the 1980s and 1990s, was named after him. Despite the scant attention paid him in historical literature, there are some historians who share a highly positive view of Inhaúma. Américo Jacobina Lacombe said that he was "one of the greatest names in our [Brazilian] military history". Max Justo Guedes regarded him among the greatest imperial navy officers, and Adolfo Lumans considered him one of the greatest navy officers in Brazilian history.

Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book

Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book is a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> by American cartoonist <a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman">Harvey Kurtzman</a>, published in 1959. Kurtzman aimed it at an adult audience, in contrast to his earlier work for adolescents in periodicals such as "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>". The social satire in the book's four stories targets "<a href="Peter%20Gunn">Peter Gunn</a>"-style <a href="detective%20fiction">private-detective</a> shows, Westerns such as "<a href="Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a>", capitalist avarice in the publishing industry, Freudian <a href="Popular%20psychology">pop psychology</a>, and <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynch</a>-hungry <a href="yokel">yokel</a>s in the <a href="Deep%20South">South</a>. Kurtzman's character <a href="Goodman%20Beaver">Goodman Beaver</a> makes his first appearance in one of the stories.

Kurtzman created the satirical "Mad" in 1952, but left its publisher <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> in 1956 after a dispute over financial control. After two failed attempts with similar publications, Kurtzman proposed "Jungle Book" as an all-original cartoon book to <a href="Ballantine%20Books">Ballantine Books</a> to replace its successful series of "Mad" collections, which had moved to another publisher. Ballantine accepted Kurtzman's proposal, albeit with reservations about its commercial viability. It was the first <a href="Paperback%23Mass%20market%20paperback">mass-market paperback</a> of original comics published in the United States. Though it was not a financial success, "Jungle Book" attracted fans and critics for its brushwork, satirical adult-oriented humor, experimental <a href="Speech%20balloon">dialogue balloons</a>, and adventurous page and panel designs.

The full title of the book is "Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book: Or, Up from the Apes! (and Right Back Down)—In Which Are Described in Words and Pictures Businessmen, Private Eyes, Cowboys, and Other Heroes All Exhibiting the Progress of Man from the Darkness of the Cave into the Light of Civilization by Means of Television, Wide Screen Movies, the Stone Axe, and Other Useful Arts". At 140 pages, "Jungle Book" is Kurtzman's longest solo work. Freed from the length constraints of magazine pieces, Kurtzman was able to make inventive use of page and panel rhythms. According to critic and publisher <a href="Kim%20Thompson">Kim Thompson</a>, his satire never had "more pitiless a bite" at any other time in his career. Kurtzman had aimed his "Mad" stories at an adolescent audience; his targeting "Jungle Book" at an adult audience was uncommon in American comics.

Four stories make up the book:

Thelonius Violence speaks in jazz slang while surrounded by beautiful women and jazz background music, which was a parody of the jazz-choreographed fight scenes in the "<a href="Peter%20Gunn">Peter Gunn</a>" television series. Violence's job is to protect a young, vapid woman named Lolita Nabokov who is being blackmailed over her <a href="Adultery">infidelity</a>. Violence suffers the onslaughts of a thug who attempts to keep him away from the young woman, but in the end it is revealed that the thug and Violence are partners in her extortion.

In his parody, Kurtzman retained little from the original "Peter Gunn" aside from the main character. Kurtzman stated he "was trying to get ... that <a href="Henry%20Mancini">Henry Mancini</a> feel to the story". "Thelonius Violence" appears first in the book, but was one of the last stories to be completed. It remained a favorite of Kurtzman's, as he "had "control" of this story. The action and line are good. It took time and practice and effort to get it, but it's there."

<a href="Goodman%20Beaver">Goodman Beaver</a> is an editor hired by Schlock Publications Inc. During his time there, he loses his youthful idealism and succumbs to the corruption he finds in the publishing world. Goodman finds himself sexually harassing the secretaries, just as the other cynical executives at Schlock do, and ends up stealing from the company.

Goodman Beaver was a stand-in for Kurtzman himself in this semi-autobiographical tale. At this point in his career, Kurtzman had had several negative experiences with publishers, and he used this story to satirize the corrupting influence of capitalism and power. Kurtzman's memories of his time at <a href="Timely%20Comics">Timely Comics</a> were a strong influence on the Schlock Publications he portrayed; Timely publisher <a href="Martin%20Goodman%20%28publisher%29">Martin Goodman</a> was Kurtzman's model for the publisher in the story. Kurtzman also used <a href="Burt%20Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a> as his model for the editor of the men's magazine in the story, and <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> was his model for the editor of the "girlie" magazine. As Goodman Beaver did in the story, early in his career Kurtzman worked making crossword puzzles for Goodman. The title is an amalgamation of three bestselling 1950s novels: "<a href="Executive%20Suite">Executive Suite</a>" (1952) by <a href="Cameron%20Hawley">Cameron Hawley</a>, "<a href="The%20Man%20in%20the%20Gray%20Flannel%20Suit%20%28novel%29">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a>" (1955) by <a href="Sloan%20Wilson">Sloan Wilson</a>, and "<a href="The%20Organization%20Man">The Organization Man</a>" (1956) by <a href="William%20H.%20Whyte">William H. Whyte</a>.

"Compulsion on the Range" is a satire that blends <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Westerns</a> and <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freudian</a> <a href="popular%20psychology">pop psychology</a>. In the 1950s, a trend of "adult" Westerns appeared in which characters were given psychological backgrounds to explain their motivations, as in "<a href="The%20Left%20Handed%20Gun">The Left Handed Gun</a>", in which an angst-ridden <a href="Billy%20the%20Kid">Billy the Kid</a> gets his revenge after losing his father figure. In "Compulsion", a psychologist tries to work out why Marshall Matt Dolin (a parody of <a href="James%20Arness">James Arness</a> as <a href="Marshal%20Matt%20Dillon">Marshal Matt Dillon</a> from the popular "Gunsmoke" TV show) insists on trying to outshoot Johnny Ringding, chasing him across the West.

"Compulsion" was the third story in the book, but the first to be drawn, and was Kurtzman's least favorite, as he thought he had yet to perfect the style he had developed for the book. The story recycled ideas from a Kurtzman strip called "Endings to End the Fast Draw" that "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" had rejected in 1958.

One of Kurtzman's favorites, "Decadence Degenerated" is set in a town in the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> called Rottenville, where nothing happens until local beauty Honey Lou is found murdered. A quiet <a href="Bibliophilia">bookworm</a> named Mednick is <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynched</a> for the murder because, as one of the yokels declares, "You "cain not truss" a man who "reads"!" The town sheriff overlooks the lynching, despite the presence of a "Northern" reporter—actually from the northern part of the state.

At the time the story appeared, Hollywood was releasing adaptations of works set in the South by writers such as <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> and <a href="William%20Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>. Kurtzman said his inspiration came from his memories of <a href="Paris%2C%20Texas">Paris, Texas</a>, where he was stationed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He learned the <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern drawl</a> used in the story from what he heard at <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">United Service Organizations</a> (USO) dances. He recalled, "I just wanted a parody of that town. I worked from memory." The scene in which the unemployed townsmen mentally undress Honey Lou affected <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>, who saw the possibilities of the comics medium in the formalities of the scene's portrayal of motion.

The black-and-white art is in loose, fluid, and sketchy brushwork with a gray <a href="wash%20%28visual%20arts%29">wash</a>. The drawings are in an exaggerated cartoon style, with rounded, fluid, elongated figures. The rendering is simple and clean, and faces often have mere circles for eyes. Most of the women lack noses except when drawn in profile. Kurtzman blends the verbal and visual aspects of the work—for example, when an enraged Goodman Beaver confronts his diminutive boss Mr. Schlock, Goodman is graphically overwhelmed by Schlock's <a href="Speech%20balloon">word balloon</a>s, which demonstrates Goodman's helpless subservience and Schlock's effortless psychological dominance over his employees.

Kurtzman <a href="Letterer">lettered</a> the dialogue in an expressive, handwriting-like style. Unlike as in the majority of American comic books, Kurtzman did not letter using <a href="All%20caps">all capitals</a>. His tall and thin dialogue balloons necessitated frequent <a href="Syllabification">hyphenation</a>, which makes the dialogue more difficult to read. Kurtzman experimented with drawing on blue-lined paper; the blue lines were not supposed to reproduce visibly when the book was printed, but the gray wash Kurtzman used unintentionally reinforced them.

Kurtzman used the book to lampoon humankind's inability or incompetence, its failure to reach its supposed aspirations, and its self-delusion. He also targeted <a href="middlebrow">middlebrow</a> entertainment, deflating its pretensions. The women in the stories are extraordinarily curvaceous and are frequently <a href="Sexual%20objectification">objectified</a>—although the character Sam in "Decadence Degenerated" avoids being ogled or groped, it is only because she is depicted as repulsive.

<a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman%27s%20editorship%20of%20Mad">Kurtzman founded</a> the satirical "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>" at <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> as a color comic book in 1952, and turned it into a black-and-white comics magazine in 1955. In 1956, Kurtzman left over a dispute with <a href="EC%20Comics">EC Comics</a> publisher <a href="William%20Gaines">William Gaines</a> about financial control. Kurtzman tried his hand at another magazine in 1957 with the financial backing of Hugh Hefner. The result, "<a href="Trump%20%28magazine%29">Trump</a>", was slick and lavish, and lasted only two issues before Hefner canceled it. Kurtzman then co-founded and co-published "<a href="Humbug%20%28magazine%29">Humbug</a>" along with a group of "Mad" and "Trump" artists. In 1958, after eleven unprofitable issues, "Humbug" also came to an end. Kurtzman was left disillusioned and cynical about the business end of publishing, and with a wife, three children, and a mortgage to take care of, was struggling financially. 

While still at EC, Kurtzman had overseen the first five "Mad" pocket books published by <a href="Ballantine%20Books">Ballantine Books</a>, which became perennial sellers with sales in the millions. When Kurtzman left EC, his <a href="Royalty%20payment">royalties</a> from the books ceased and Gaines had Kurtzman's name removed from them. In 1958 Gaines abandoned Ballantine for <a href="New%20American%20Library">Signet Books</a>. Kurtzman proposed an original paperback to <a href="Ian%20Ballantine">Ian Ballantine</a>, who was looking for something to replace the "Mad" line. Kurtzman was well respected at the Ballantine offices, and it was editor <a href="Bernard%20Shir-Cliff">Bernard Shir-Cliff</a> who provided Kurtzman with the postcard of the gap-toothed character that was to become "Mad"s mascot <a href="Alfred%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BE.%20Neuman">Alfred E. Neuman</a>. Ballantine had earlier published "The Humbug Digest" in the same format with material culled from Kurtzman's "<a href="Humbug%20%28magazine%29">Humbug</a>" magazine, though it fared poorly in the market.

Rather than reprint material cut-and-pasted to fit the narrow pages of the paperback format as had been done with Ballantine's "Mad" books, Kurtzman wanted to create new material designed to fit the page dimensions. Ballantine accepted Kurtzman's proposal on faith, but he had reservations. He suspected it was the "Mad" brand name that sold books rather than Kurtzman's name, although the artist had been the creative force behind "Mad". In January Kurtzman signed a contract with Ballantine that came with an advance of $ with a 4% royalty per copy sold; the deadline was 144 pages by May 1, 1959. The contracted book was to be called "Pleasure Package", for which Kurtzman mocked up a cover, but appeared as "Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book".

When it was published in September 1959, "Jungle Book" was the first mass-market paperback of original comics content in the United States. The 35¢ book had small dimensions at and was poorly printed onto low-quality paper. Ballantine printed copies for the book's first run, a low number for the company. "Jungle Book" sold poorly; after five years and despite an offer of copies with subscriptions to Kurtzman's "<a href="Help%21%20%28magazine%29">Help!</a>" magazine only copies had sold—for Ballantine to break even copies would have to have been sold. Ballantine pulped the remaining copies, and Kurtzman and the company's relationship came to an end.

Kurtzman lamented the book's poor sales as he said he "truly liked the format". He had been developing at least one other story, a <a href="Science%20fiction">science-fiction</a> parody, but abandoned it after two pages. If "Jungle Book" had been a market success, Kurtzman had intended to continue producing books in the format. He reprinted "Decadence Degenerated" in the second issue of "Help!", a magazine he edited in the 1960s. "Compulsion on the Range" was reprinted in the <a href="Underground%20comix">underground comic book</a> "<a href="Yellow%20Dog%20%28comics%29">Yellow Dog</a>" in 1969.

<a href="Kitchen%20Sink%20Press">Kitchen Sink Press</a> reprinted "Jungle Book" in 1986 in a deluxe hardcover format with the pages reproduced at the size in which they were drawn. The reprinting includes an introduction by Art Spiegelman. <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> reprinted "Jungle Book" in 2014 as the first volume of its "Essential Kurtzman" series. The volume was produced by <a href="Denis%20Kitchen">Denis Kitchen</a> and edited and designed by John Lind; it includes an article by Kitchen, a foreword by cartoonist <a href="Gilbert%20Shelton">Gilbert Shelton</a>, the Spiegelman essay from the 1986 edition, and an interview with cartoonists <a href="Robert%20Crumb">Robert Crumb</a> and <a href="Peter%20Poplaski">Peter Poplaski</a> about the book.

"Jungle Book" sold poorly, but developed a fan following and became a collectors' item. Admirers included pioneering underground cartoonists such as <a href="Joel%20Beck">Joel Beck</a>, Denis Kitchen, <a href="Jay%20Lynch">Jay Lynch</a>, <a href="Spain%20Rodriguez">Spain Rodriguez</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20Shelton">Gilbert Shelton</a>, Art Spiegelman, <a href="Skip%20Williamson">Skip Williamson</a>, and Robert Crumb, who wrote "[s]ome of [Kurtzman's] greatest stuff was done in a little Ballantine Book called "Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book"". Goodman Beaver later appeared in a series of stories drawn by <a href="Will%20Elder">Will Elder</a> in Kurtzman's "Help!", and Kurtzman and Elder later adapted the strip into "<a href="Little%20Annie%20Fanny">Little Annie Fanny</a>" in "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine.

Biographers Denis Kitchen and Paul Buhle see the book as a precursor of the <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>. In 1962, Kurtzman made another aborted attempt at this form with "Marley's Ghost", an adaptation of "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>" by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, a project he had conceived in 1954. He finished seven of the project's projected 100 pages, and had long-time collaborator <a href="Jack%20Davis%20%28cartoonist%29">Jack Davis</a> reinterpret one of the pages as part of the proposal. The project failed to interest a publisher. Graphic novels did not start to become widespread until 1978, a year which saw the publication of <a href="Don%20McGregor">McGregor</a> and <a href="Paul%20Gulacy">Gulacy</a>'s "<a href="Sabre%20%28Eclipse%20Comics%29">Sabre</a>" and <a href="Will%20Eisner">Eisner</a>'s "<a href="A%20Contract%20with%20God">A Contract with God</a>", the latter a book also made up of four short stories. By the time of the publication of these books a well-organized comics fandom had developed whose conventions, fanzines, and <a href="Direct%20market">comic shops</a> provided a more receptive environment for such innovations.

"<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>" placed "Jungle Book" 26th on its 1999 list of "Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century", along with four other works with which Kurtzman was involved. Kim Thompson described the book as "the biggest 'if' in comics' history: What if it had been a success?" Thompson speculated on what Kurtzman may have been capable of if he had not had to resort to teaching, illustration, and "Little Annie Fanny". Thompson called the book "one of the most stunning successes, and one of the field's most heartbreaking failures". Kurtzman's self-portrait from the back cover of the book is used in connection with the <a href="Harvey%20Award">Harvey Award</a>s, named in Kurtzman's honor.

Gudovac massacre

The Gudovac massacre was the <a href="massacre">mass killing</a> of around 190 <a href="Bjelovar">Bjelovar</a> <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a> by the <a href="Croatian%20nationalism">Croatian nationalist</a> <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a> movement on 28 April 1941, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The massacre occurred shortly after the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> and the establishment of the Ustaše-led Axis <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a> known as the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (NDH). It was the first act of mass murder committed by the Ustaše upon coming to power, and presaged a wider Ustaše-perpetrated <a href="World%20War%20II%20persecution%20of%20Serbs">campaign of genocide</a> against Serbs in the NDH that lasted until the end of the war.

The Ustaše used the mysterious deaths of two of their local followers as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from <a href="Gudovac">Gudovac</a> and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">ousted Yugoslav government</a>. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a <a href="firing%20squad">firing squad</a> of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a> for the victims and pour <a href="calcium%20oxide">quicklime</a> on the bodies to speed up <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a>. The following day, relatives of one of the victims informed the Germans of what had transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the mass grave, and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. <a href="Mladen%20Lorkovi%C4%87">Mladen Lorković</a>, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador <a href="Siegfried%20Kasche">Siegfried Kasche</a> that the Croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.

An <a href="ossuary">ossuary</a> and a <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> were erected on the site of the massacre in 1955, as was a monument by the sculptor <a href="Vojin%20Baki%C4%87">Vojin Bakić</a>. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence during the <a href="Croatian%20War%20of%20Independence">Croatian War of Independence</a>, the monument and the mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists, as was another one of Bakić's works, "Bjelovarac" (The Man From Bjelovar). The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the "Bjelovarac" monument erected once again. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.

<a href="Gudovac">Gudovac</a> is a village near <a href="Bjelovar">Bjelovar</a>, about east of the NDH capital, <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>. It was first settled during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, and had an ethnically mixed population through much of its history. In 1931, Gudovac had 1,073 inhabitants living in 330 households. <a href="Croats">Croats</a> formed two-thirds of the population, while the remaining inhabitants were ethnic <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>. The Gudovac municipality had a population of 8,000, including 3,000 Serbs.

Gudovac had been part of a common <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slav</a> state since November 1918, when the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbs%2C%20Croats%20and%20Slovenes">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> was proclaimed. At its creation, the Kingdom included six million Serbs, 3.5 million Croats and one million <a href="Slovenes">Slovenes</a>, among others. Being the largest ethnic group, the Serbs favoured a centralized state; Croats, Slovenes and <a href="Bosnian%20Muslims">Bosnian Muslims</a> did not. The <a href="Vidovdan%20Constitution">Vidovdan Constitution</a>, approved on 28 June 1921 and based on the Serbian <a href="Constitution%20of%20Serbia%23Constitutional%20history">constitution of 1903</a>, established the Kingdom as a <a href="parliamentary%20monarchy">parliamentary monarchy</a> under the Serbian <a href="Kara%C4%91or%C4%91evi%C4%87%20dynasty">Karađorđević dynasty</a>. <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> was chosen as the capital of the new state, assuring Serb and <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christian</a> political dominance. In 1928, <a href="Croatian%20Peasant%20Party">Croatian Peasant Party</a> ("Hrvatska seljačka stranka", HSS) leader <a href="Stjepan%20Radi%C4%87">Stjepan Radić</a> was shot and mortally wounded on the floor of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Yugoslavia">country's parliament</a> by a Serb deputy. The following year, King <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Yugoslavia">Alexander</a> proclaimed the <a href="6%20January%20Dictatorship">6 January Dictatorship</a> and renamed his country Yugoslavia to deemphasize its ethnic makeup. Yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">banates</a> ("banovine"), six of which had ethnic Serb majorities. In 1931, Alexander issued a decree allowing the Yugoslav Parliament to reconvene on the condition that only pro-Yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it. Marginalized, far-right and far-left parties thrived. The Ustaše, a Croatian <a href="fascist">fascist</a> movement, emerged as the most extreme of these. The movement was driven by a deep hatred of Serbs. In 1932, the Ustaše launched the so-called <a href="Velebit%20uprising">Velebit uprising</a>, attacking a police station in <a href="Lika">Lika</a>. The police responded harshly to the attack and harassed the local population, leading to further animosity between Croats and Serbs. In 1934, an Ustaše-trained assassin killed Alexander while he was on a <a href="state%20visit">state visit</a> to France. Alexander's cousin, Prince <a href="Prince%20Paul%20of%20Yugoslavia">Paul</a>, became <a href="regency">regent</a> and took up the king's responsibilities until Alexander's son <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Yugoslavia">Peter</a> turned 18.

Following the 1938 "<a href="Anschluss">Anschluss</a>" (union) between Germany and <a href="First%20Austrian%20Republic">Austria</a>, Yugoslavia came to share a border with the Third Reich and fell under increasing pressure as her neighbours became aligned with the Axis powers. In April 1939, <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Italy%20during%20World%20War%20II">Italy</a> opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Albania">invaded</a> and occupied neighbouring Albania. At the outbreak of World War II, the Yugoslav government declared its <a href="neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">neutrality</a>. Between September and November 1940, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%9346%29">Hungary</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a> joined the <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>, and Italy <a href="Greco-Italian%20War">invaded Greece</a>. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their <a href="satellite%20state">satellites</a>, and her neutral stance toward the war came under tremendous pressure. In late February 1941, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia. Intending to secure his southern flank for the impending attack on the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, Serbian nationalist air force officers deposed Prince Paul in a bloodless <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. The conspirators declared the 17-year-old Prince Peter of age and brought to power a "government of national unity" led by General <a href="Du%C5%A1an%20Simovi%C4%87">Dušan Simović</a>. The coup enraged Hitler. "Even if Yugoslavia at first should give declarations of loyalty," he stated, "she must be considered ... a foe and ... destroyed as quickly as possible." He then ordered the invasion of Yugoslavia, which commenced on 6 April 1941.

The <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> ("Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije", VKJ) was quickly overwhelmed by the combined German, Italian and Hungarian assault. Much of its equipment was obsolete, its military strategy was outdated and its soldiers were ill-disciplined and poorly trained. To make matters worse, many of the VKJ's Croat personnel refused to fight the Germans, whom they considered liberators from Serb oppression. This attitude was shared by many soldiers of the <a href="40th%20Infantry%20Division%20Slavonska">40th Infantry Division "Slavonska"</a>'s largely Croat 108th Regiment, which was stationed in <a href="Veliki%20Gr%C4%91evac">Veliki Grđevac</a>. The regiment had been mobilized in Bjelovar, and on 7 April was marching towards <a href="Virovitica">Virovitica</a> to take up positions, when its Croat members revolted and arrested the Serb officers and soldiers. Led by Captain <a href="Ivan%20Mrak">Ivan Mrak</a>, the regiment disarmed a Yugoslav <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmerie</a> post in <a href="Gare%C5%A1nica">Garešnica</a> and began marching back to Bjelovar alongside a band of Ustaše rebels under <a href="Mijo%20Hans">Mijo Hans</a>. The following morning, elements of the 108th Regiment entered Bjelovar and clashed with the local gendarmerie, sustaining losses of two killed and three wounded. At about noon, the regiment joined up with elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the 40th Infantry Division. At around the same time, <a href="Julije%20Makanec">Julije Makanec</a>, the Croat mayor of Bjelovar, joined Ustaše official Ivan Šestak and HSS representative Franjo Hegeduš in demanding that the VKJ surrender the town to the rebels. When the <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">4th Army</a>'s commander, General <a href="Petar%20Nedeljkovi%C4%87">Petar Nedeljković</a>, learned of the rebel approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised that this would not be possible as local Croat conscripts would not report for duty. Fourth Army headquarters reported the rebels' presence to the headquarters of the <a href="1st%20Army%20Group%20%28Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia%29">1st Army Group</a>, which requested that HSS leader <a href="Vladko%20Ma%C4%8Dek">Vladko Maček</a> intervene with the rebels. Maček agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers, to no avail.

Later in the day, two trucks of rebels arrived at 4th Army headquarters in Bjelovar with the intention of killing the staff. The headquarters guard force prevented this, but the operations staff immediately withdrew from Bjelovar to <a href="Popova%C4%8Da">Popovača</a>. After issuing several unanswered ultimatums, around 8,000 rebels attacked Bjelovar, assisted by Croat <a href="fifth%20column">fifth-columnists</a> within the town. Bjelovar surrendered, and many Yugoslav officers and soldiers were captured by the Germans and Ustaše rebels. Local Croats welcomed the revolt with great enthusiasm. When Nedeljković heard of Bjelovar's capture, he called Makanec and threatened to bomb the city if VKJ prisoners were not immediately released. Detained officers from 4th Army headquarters and the 108th Infantry Regiment were then sent to Zagreb. At about 16:00, Nedeljković informed the <a href="Ban%20of%20Croatia">Ban of Croatia</a>, <a href="Ivan%20%C5%A0uba%C5%A1i%C4%87">Ivan Šubašić</a>, of the revolt, but Šubašić was powerless to influence events. At about 18:00, Makanec proclaimed that Bjelovar was part of an independent Croatian state. This was the only significant pro-Ustaše revolt in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina prior to 10 April. Ustaše propaganda celebrated it as "an uprising of the Croatian people against the April War", claiming it showed that Croats wholeheartedly supported Yugoslavia's destruction.

On 10 April, senior Ustaše commander <a href="Slavko%20Kvaternik">Slavko Kvaternik</a> proclaimed the establishment of the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> ("Nezavisna Država Hrvatska", NDH). The declaration came exactly one week before the VKJ's unconditional surrender to the Axis powers. The leader of the Ustaše, <a href="Ante%20Paveli%C4%87">Ante Pavelić</a>, was in Rome at the time and made arrangements to travel to <a href="Karlovac">Karlovac</a>, just west of Zagreb. He arrived in Karlovac on 13 April, accompanied by 250–400 of his followers. Pavelić reached Zagreb on 15 April, having granted territorial cessions to Italy at Croatia's expense and promised the Germans he had no intention of pursuing a foreign policy independent of Berlin. That same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Pavelić was declared "<a href="Poglavnik">Poglavnik</a>" ("leader") of the Ustaše-led Croatian state, which combined the territory of much of present-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, all of present-day <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and parts of present-day <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>.

Pavelić and his followers intended to create an "ethnically pure" Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Croatia">Jews</a> and other non-Croats. Only about fifty percent of the NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," Croatia's future <a href="Foreign%20Ministry%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Foreign Minister</a> <a href="Mladen%20Lorkovi%C4%87">Mladen Lorković</a> explained. "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." <a href="Dido%20Kvaternik">Dido Kvaternik</a>, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with "<a href="ethnic%20cleansing">cleansing</a>" Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that I should take over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved for the future of the Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.

Immediately after seizing Bjelovar, the Ustaše set about strengthening their hold of the city. <a href="Josip%20Verhas">Josip Verhas</a>, an ethnic <a href="Germans%20of%20Croatia">German</a>, was appointed the acting head of Bjelovar district, <a href="%C4%90uro%20Vojnovi%C4%87">Đuro Vojnović</a> was appointed Ustaše representative to the Bjelovar district, and Hans was named the Ustaše commissioner for Bjelovar county. Alojz Čukman was appointed chief of police. He immediately decreed that all of Bjelovar's Serbs had to wear a red armband with the word "Serb" written in both Croatian and German. Ivan Garščić, a public notary, was appointed acting commander of the Bjelovar armoury and set about reorganizing local Ustaše formations. Mrak, who had distinguished himself as one of the leaders of the 108th Regiment's revolt, was tasked with overseeing the city centre.

Between 9 and 14 April, groups of soldiers from the disbanded 108th Regiment roamed the Bjelovar countryside looking for a way home. Serb officers that had refused to surrender raided Croat homes, hoping to find food, money and civilian clothing that would make it easier for them to pass through German and Ustaše checkpoints. In some villages, Croat peasants disarmed defeated VKJ units and plundered their warehouses. Some of these peasants, especially those in Gudovac, entered local units known as "readiness battalions". On 10 April, the Germans reached Bjelovar and set up a series of command posts but left the Ustaše in "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" control of the city. The Ustaše were wary of the danger posed by the Serb peasantry. Many had been in the VKJ at the time of the invasion, and had simply discarded their military fatigues and taken their rifles home. Mišo Sabolek, a local Ustaše commander, reported: "Bjelovar and its surroundings are besieged by Serbs, who are ... killing and looting homes in the villages of Nart, Gudovac and the Česma forest." In mid-April, Sabolek reported that he had sent 35 gunmen to "quell violence" around Bjelovar. His superiors in Zagreb ordered him to "take any measures necessary to restore order" in the district. The Ustaše searched dozens of Serb homes, hoping to find illegal weapons. This was followed by the arresting of "undesired elements", mostly members of the <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">Communist Party of Yugoslavia</a> ("Komunistička partija Jugoslavije", KPJ). "The disarming of Serbs ... is vital to securing the future of the young Croatian state," wrote <a href="Edmund%20Glaise-Horstenau">Edmund Glaise-Horstenau</a>, the German Plenipotentiary General in the NDH. Julius Eker, the local KPJ chairman, was arrested on 12 April.

On 16 April, Slavko Kvaternik announced that Serb peasants in the NDH had eight days to hand their weapons over to the Ustaše. Another influential communist, Milan Bakić, was arrested in Bjelovar on 20 April. On 22 April, the Ustaše arrested most of the town's remaining KPJ members. Communist organizers such as Stevo Šabić, Franko Winter and Sándor Király were arrested on 24 April. By 25 April, several hundred known or suspected anti-fascists had been arrested by the Ustaše. Some were spared death and given prison sentences, but most were executed without trial. That same day, an Ustaše patrol discovered 80 rifles and several machine guns in the home of a local KPJ member. Forty rifles and two machine guns were found in the home of another local communist.

Alarmed by the prospect of an armed rebellion in Bjelovar and the surrounding countryside, Kvaternik selected a broad area in and around the town where Serbs were to be "cleansed". "For every Croat killed," he said, "we must execute 100 Serbs." The disarming and arresting of VKJ personnel by the Ustaše was accompanied by numerous incidents, in which about 20 armed VKJ troops and Serb civilians were killed. Kvaternik feared that these deaths would only increase the likelihood of an armed revolt and became even more wary when he heard rumours that Bjelovar's Serbs were planning an uprising to coincide with the <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints">feast day</a> of <a href="Saint%20George%27s%20Day">St. George</a> "(Đurđevdan)", on 6 May. <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia%23Minister%20of%20Interior">Interior Minister</a> <a href="Andrija%20Artukovi%C4%87">Andrija Artuković</a> arrived in Bjelovar after hearing such rumours. At a meeting with Verhas and his lieutenants, he stated that "serious action" would have to be taken to "send a message to the enemies of the Ustaše and the NDH". On 26 April, Kvaternik and his closest assistant, <a href="Ivica%20%C5%A0ari%C4%87">Ivica Šarić</a>, organized the mass arrest of 530 Serb villagers from <a href="Grubi%C5%A1no%20Polje">Grubišno Polje</a>. Thirty Ustaše took part in the arrests. The detainees were transported to the <a href="Danica%20concentration%20camp">Danica camp</a>, near <a href="Koprivnica">Koprivnica</a>, and from there taken to Ustaše camps at <a href="Gospi%C4%87">Gospić</a>, <a href="Pag%20%28island%29">Pag Island</a>, <a href="Jasenovac%2C%20Sisak-Moslavina%20County">Jasenovac</a> and <a href="Stara%20Gradi%C5%A1ka">Stara Gradiška</a>, where most were killed.

On 25 April, the Ustaše arrested a Serb named Milan Radovanović when he stopped by the Bjelovar police station to hand over his rifle. He had fought with the VKJ at the time of the invasion and spent two weeks hiding in the forests before returning to his home in Prgomelje. His relatively late return prevented him from handing over his rifle before the Ustaše deadline on 24 April. On the morning of 26 April, as Radovanović and another Serb prisoner were being escorted from the county jail by two Ustaše guards, two unidentified gunmen opened fire on the detainees and guards. A skirmish ensued, and Radovanović and one of the guards were killed. The second guard was wounded. That afternoon, a <a href="Croatian%20Home%20Guard%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Croatian Home Guard</a> (or "domobran") was killed by a stray bullet in his yard while on leave. Kvaternik immediately blamed the deaths on "Serb agitators". In their internal documents, the Ustaše attributed the deaths to "local <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a>", a claim that has never been proven. Some historians have hypothesized that the attack on the county jail and the death of the Home Guard were <a href="false%20flag">false flag</a> attacks intended to rally Croats against local Serbs. This allegation has also never been proven.

Upon hearing news of the attack at the county jail, Kvaternik ordered the arrest of 200 Serb peasants from Gudovac and the neighbouring villages of Veliko and Malo Korenovo, Prgomelje, Bolč, Klokočevac, Tuk, Stančići and Breza. The arrests occurred in the early morning hours of 28 April. The action was personally supervised by Kvaternik and carried out by members of the local <a href="Croatian%20Peasant%20Guard">Croatian Peasant Guard</a>, which had been turned into a "quasi-military unit" under the command of <a href="Martin%20%C4%8Ciko%C5%A1">Martin Čikoš</a>, whom the journalist <a href="Slavko%20Goldstein">Slavko Goldstein</a> describes as a "sworn pre-war Ustaša". Most of the more prominent or wealthy inhabitants of Gudovac were arrested, including teachers, businessmen and <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox</a> priests. "Their sole crime," Goldstein writes, "was that they were of the Orthodox faith and perhaps a little more prosperous than their neighbours." Shortly before the killings, Verhas, Čikoš and local Ustaše officials Rudolf Srnak, Nikola Pokopac and Mirko Pavlešić held a meeting where it was decided that the prisoners would be killed.

The prisoners were taken to the Gudovac municipal building and held there for a time. They were told that they would be taken to Bjelovar for interrogation. Instead, they were ordered to march in the opposite direction, towards a field beside the river <a href="Plavnica%20%28river%29">Plavnica</a> where an open-air market was held each week. The prisoners left Gudovac just before sunset, supervised by as many as 70 armed guards. Many of the prisoners sensed the fate that awaited them but were unable to escape. According to one post-war testimony, Čikoš was "upset, uneasy ... and in no mood to talk". As the prisoners were being marched out of Gudovac, he pulled one of his Serb neighbours from the group and told him to "get lost" before ordering the remaining 200 detainees to line up against a wall. Kvaternik appeared before the group and asked if it contained any Croats. Four stepped forward and offered their identification papers; three were permitted to return to their homes upon having their identities verified but the fourth was sent back among the Serbs because he was a communist. Kvaternik, Čikoš and several newly appointed Ustaše officers supervised the march. According to survivors, the guards hurtled insults at the prisoners, and forced them to sing Ustaše songs and chant "Long live Pavelić! Long live Kvaternik!"

The prisoners reached the field just after sunset and were ordered to line up in ranks and make a left face; the guards then raised their rifles and opened fire. Some executioners hesitated before firing, conscious that their friends and neighbours were about to be killed, and many of the victims were initially struck in the legs. Some of the wounded cursed the Ustaše and others cried in agony. Kvaternik observed the massacre from a distance of about , accompanied by Hans, Verhas and Pavlešić. Pavlešić was dissatisfied with the speed of the killings and shouted at Čikoš, telling him to "finish the job". Čikoš's men then went about looking for survivors and bayonetting anyone that moved. Five prisoners escaped before Čikoš's men could kill them and fled to a nearby forest.

The killings were the first act of mass murder committed by the Ustaše upon coming to power. Estimates of the number of victims vary. <a href="Marko%20Attila%20Hoare">Marko Attila Hoare</a>, a historian specializing in the Balkans, puts the figure at 184 killed. The journalist <a href="Tim%20Judah">Tim Judah</a> writes that there were 187 fatalities. Other historians, such as <a href="Ivo%20Goldstein">Ivo Goldstein</a> and Mark Biondich, mention 196 deaths.

Kvaternik and the Ustaše never attempted to conceal the killings, which were deliberately carried out in a relatively public space so as to cause terror among the Serb population. Local Croats were fully aware of what had transpired. Following the massacre, the Ustaše forced Gudovac's remaining inhabitants to dig a <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a> and cover the remains of the victims with <a href="calcium%20oxide">quicklime</a> to speed up <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a>. Once the dead had been buried, the villagers were permitted to return to their homes.

News of the massacre quickly spread through Bjelovar. The following day, the wife and daughter of one of the victims visited a German command post, reported the massacre, and led two German officers to the mass grave. The officers informed their superiors of what had taken place and complained of the "disorder" in their area of responsibility. Their superiors demanded a partial exhumation of the gravesite, ordered that the exhumed corpses be photographed, and requested an investigation, as well as the arrest and punishment, of those responsible. On the orders of a local German commander, 40 suspected perpetrators were arrested on the evening of 29 April. Their weapons were seized and they were temporarily detained in the Bjelovar high school. The same evening, Lorković requested an urgent meeting with German ambassador <a href="Siegfried%20Kasche">Siegfried Kasche</a>. According to Kasche, Lorković told him that 11 Croats had been killed by the Serbs and that a massacre of 192 men from Gudovac and its surroundings was carried out in retaliation. According to Goldstein, the figure of 11 dead Croats was made up by Lorković in order to justify the massacre. The historian Željko Karaula claims that the VKJ marched into several hamlets on 11 April and summarily executed 11 Croats that had refused to report for mobilization several days earlier. Goldstein posits that 25 of the 27 Croats whose deaths the Ustaše attributed to "Serb agitators" prior to the massacre had perished in combat operations during the rebellion of the 108th Regiment. Michele F. Levy, a historian specializing in the Holocaust, agrees that there had been no mass killing of Croats leading up to the massacre. The historians Philip Cooke and Ben Shepherd write that the massacre occurred before any organized Serb resistance had commenced.

Lorković maintained that the massacre in Gudovac was an "internal political issue under the jurisdiction of the Croatian government" and requested that the suspected perpetrators be handed over to the Ustaše. He promised Kasche that Zagreb would carry out a full investigation. Kasche accepted Lorković's proposal, likely at the urging of his superiors. The Ustaše detained at the Bjelovar high school were released and their weapons returned to them. The promised investigation never took place.

The <a href="Croatian%20State%20Archives">National Archive in Bjelovar</a> contains extensive documentation of the massacre, including a list of victims compiled by Ustaše officials in May 1941, in which many prisoners are described as being "shot as Chetniks". A statement describes the "fright" of the Serb population and the "distress" of local Croats. The HSS party leadership distanced itself from the massacre and condemned the actions of the Ustaše, as did the majority of local HSS activists, many of whom ended up joining the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisans</a>. According to some sources, even Makanec tried to distance himself from the killings, and allegedly protested to the "appropriate authorities" in Zagreb. He went on to become the Croatian <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia%23Minister%20of%20Education">Minister of Education</a> in 1943 and served in this capacity until May 1945. He was arrested by the Partisans the following month and subsequently executed. Lorković was implicated in a conspiracy to overthrow the NDH government in mid-1944, arrested, and executed in the last weeks of the war at Pavelić's behest. Kvaternik survived the war and the destruction of the NDH, fled to Argentina with his family and was killed in a car accident in 1962. Pavelić also fled to Argentina, survived an assassination attempt by Yugoslav government agents in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> in 1957, and died of his wounds in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> two years later.

Ustaše killings of Serbs continued throughout the war, and concentration camps were established to detain Serbs, Jews, <a href="Romani%20people">Gypsies</a>, anti-fascist Croats and others opposed to Pavelić's regime. Contemporary German accounts place the number of Serbs killed by the Ustaše at about 350,000. According to the <a href="United%20States%20Holocaust%20Memorial%20Museum">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed by the Ustaše over the course of the war. Most modern historians agree that the Ustaše killed over 300,000 Serbs, or about 17 percent of all Serbs living in the NDH. At the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a>, these killings were judged to have constituted <a href="genocide">genocide</a>.

An ossuary and a mausoleum were built on the site of the massacre in 1955. A monument called "Gudovac—Before the Firing Squad", by the Serb sculptor <a href="Vojin%20Baki%C4%87">Vojin Bakić</a>, was erected on the same spot. In 1991, amid <a href="Croatian%20War%20of%20Independence">inter-ethnic violence</a> caused by the <a href="breakup%20of%20Yugoslavia">breakup of Yugoslavia</a> and the <a href="Yugoslav%20Wars">Yugoslav Wars</a>, the monument and mausoleum were destroyed by <a href="Croatian%20nationalism">Croatian nationalist</a>s. Also destroyed was one of Bakić's most famous monuments, "Bjelovarac" (The Man from Bjelovar). Bakić had dedicated the monument to his brothers, who were killed by the Ustaše. What remained of the ossuary was removed by the local authorities in 2002. That year, residents signed a petition to have a replica of "Bjelovarac" erected at the same spot. The local government promised to supply half the amount needed to restore the monument. In 2005, the Croatian <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20%28Croatia%29">Ministry of Culture</a> advised the petitioners to apply for a tender in order to pay the other half. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.

The program consists of four <a href="Musical%20composition">composition</a>s inspired by war: <a href="Charles%20Ives">Charles Ives</a> "<a href="The%20Unanswered%20Question">The Unanswered Question</a>" (1906), <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a> "<a href="The%20Wound-Dresser">The Wound-Dresser</a>" (1989), <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>'s "<a href="Sinfonia%20da%20Requiem">Sinfonia da Requiem</a>" (1940) and <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Symphony No. 4</a> (1935). The program was performed on May 7, 2011, at the <a href="Arlene%20Schnitzer%20Concert%20Hall">Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, and again the following day. Both concerts were recorded for album release. On May 12, the Oregon Symphony repeated the program at the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>. The performance was broadcast live by <a href="KQAC">KQAC</a> and <a href="WQXR-FM">WQXR-FM</a>, the classical radio stations serving Portland and the New York City metropolitan area, respectively. The concerts marked the Oregon Symphony's first performances of "The Wound-Dresser" as well as guest <a href="baritone">baritone</a> <a href="Sanford%20Sylvan">Sanford Sylvan</a>'s debut with the company.

In October 2011 the recording of the Portland performances was released on <a href="Compact%20Disc">CD</a> by <a href="Pentatone%20%28record%20label%29">PentaTone Classics</a>. The recording debuted at number 31 on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" Classical Albums chart. The album earned three recognitions from the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Recording%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</a> for the <a href="2013%20Grammy%20Awards">2013 Grammy Awards</a>. Producer <a href="Blanton%20Alspaugh">Blanton Alspaugh</a> received the award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Producer%20of%20the%20Year%2C%20Classical">Producer of the Year, Classical</a> for his contributions to "Music for a Time of War" and other recordings.

"Music for a Time of War" contains four 20th-century classical compositions based on the theme of war. Kalmar stated that the program was not inspired by current events and that not every composition was written specifically because of war. He also warned that audiences should not attend the performances anticipating an optimistic conclusion:

The program began with <a href="Charles%20Ives">Charles Ives</a> "<a href="The%20Unanswered%20Question">The Unanswered Question</a>", originally the first of "Two Contemplations", composed in 1906 (along with its counterpart "<a href="Central%20Park%20in%20the%20Dark">Central Park in the Dark</a>"). <a href="Theodore%20Bloomfield">Theodore Bloomfield</a>, who served as music director of the Oregon Symphony from 1955 to 1959, conducted its world premiere at the <a href="Juilliard%20School">Juilliard School</a> in New York in 1946. The second composition was "<a href="The%20Wound-Dresser">The Wound-Dresser</a>", American <a href="Minimal%20music">minimalist</a> composer <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a>' portrayal of <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>'s experience as a <a href="medic">medic</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The program continued with <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>'s "<a href="Sinfonia%20da%20Requiem">Sinfonia da Requiem</a>" (1940), commissioned by the Japanese government to commemorate the 2,600th anniversary of the <a href="History%20of%20Japan">Japanese Empire</a>. The performance ended with <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Symphony No. 4</a>, composed during 1931–1934.

The Oregon Symphony presented the program at the <a href="Arlene%20Schnitzer%20Concert%20Hall">Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall</a> in Portland the evening of May 7 and the afternoon of May 8, 2011. Both performances were recorded for album release by the Boston-based company Soundmirror.

On May 12, the Oregon Symphony repeated the program at the inaugural Spring for Music Festival, marking the orchestra's Carnegie Hall debut. The Symphony raised $300,000 to fund travel and hotel expenses for the concert series. In addition to the Oregon Symphony, the inaugural festival presented seven ensembles within nine days, including the <a href="Albany%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Albany Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="Dallas%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Dallas Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="Montreal%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Montreal Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="Orpheus%20Chamber%20Orchestra">Orpheus Chamber Orchestra</a>, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and <a href="Toledo%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Toledo Symphony Orchestra</a>. Orchestras were invited based on their submitted program proposals. No other ensemble presented a program themed by a single topic. In February 2011, three months before the Carnegie Hall performance, "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>" reported that nearly half of the 1,000 tickets reserved for distribution by the Oregon Symphony had been sold. Kalmar later confirmed that 450 Oregonians traveled to New York City to witness the performance.

The Carnegie Hall performance was broadcast live across the United States. Portland's classical radio station, <a href="KQAC">KQAC</a>, broadcast the concert live throughout the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> as part of an ongoing partnership with the Symphony. <a href="WQXR-FM">WQXR-FM</a>, the classical radio station licensed to <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark, New Jersey</a> and serving the New York City metropolitan area, broadcast the performance live in <a href="Surround%20sound">3D sound</a> in collaboration with the design and engineering consulting company <a href="Arup%20Group%20Limited">Arup</a>. WQXR also hosted a live chat on their website. Prior to the live broadcast, WQXR's
Q2 Music provided their own take on the Oregon Symphony's war-themed concert by airing a program with works by <a href="Lowell%20Liebermann">Lowell Liebermann</a>, Seppo Pohjola, <a href="Steve%20Reich">Steve Reich</a>, <a href="Frederic%20Rzewski">Frederic Rzewski</a>, <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Dmitri Shostakovich</a> and John Adams. KQAC rebroadcast the program in November. In April 2012, the station broadcast the album recording and has since aired individual works.

The concert program received a positive reception. "The Oregonian" David Stabler wrote that during the May 7 performance the orchestra displayed peak condition and "played with a precision and intensity that would have been unattainable a decade ago". He complimented Sylvan's diction and "emotional engagement", but noted that some words were difficult to make out. Stabler called the timpanist's performance during Britten's symphony "fierce" and the orchestra's playing "clear and intentional". In his review of the Carnegie Hall performance, Stabler opined that the Oregon Symphony's program (which he described as one of "rage, brutality and fleeting beauty that required the utmost precision and ferocity from the musicians") focused more on playing, while the programs by other orchestras drew attention to the music. Stabler wrote: "Everyone knows orchestras are fighting to survive, but on this night, the Oregon Symphony breathed long and deep of triumph." In a separate article summarizing reviews by New York critics, Stabler called the Symphony a "virtuosos band" that "now plays with more acute rhythmic precision, more clarity, more informed style ... and more extreme dynamics and tempos". James Bash of Oregon Music News wrote a positive review of the New York performance, describing it as more enhanced, dramatic and intense than the Portland concerts, partly because of the venue's superior acoustics. Bash described the orchestra's performance of "The Unanswered Question" as "compelling and auspicious" and wrote that Sylvan's vocals during "The Wound-Dresser" "conveyed the sensitive text superbly". In addition to complimenting the Symphony overall, Bash singled out solo performers by name. After noting the audience's enthusiastic response to the performance, including multiple bravos and particular recognition for Kalmar, Bash quipped "the Oregon Symphony may be regional in terms of size and budget, but they are world-class when they play".

Following the New York concert, music critic <a href="Alex%20Ross%20%28music%20critic%29">Alex Ross</a> <a href="Twitter">tweeted</a>: "Triumphant Carnegie debut for the Oregon Symphony -- best of Spring for Music so far. Eloquent Sylvan, explosive Vaughan Williams." On his blog, "The Rest Is Noise", Ross called the Symphony's performance "extraordinary", one of the "most gripping events of the current season". In his two-page review of Spring for Music for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", Ross devoted more coverage to the Oregon Symphony than the other featured ensembles and considered "Music for a Time of War" the festival's highpoint. He complimented the orchestra for playing with "controlled intensity" and said of Symphony No. 4: "The Oregonians' furious rendition of that symphony would have been impressive in any context, but as the capstone to a brilliantly worked-out program it had shattering force." The review contained an illustration of Kalmar, "hair flying and all". Sedgwick Clark of "<a href="Musical%20America">Musical America</a>" called the orchestra's performance of the Williams piece "positively searing ... with fearless edge-of-seat tempos ... breathtakingly negotiated by all." After Clark's review was published, Ross posted on his blog that he and Clark concurred: the Symphony's performance was the most "remarkable" of the season. Ross included the Symphony's concert on his list of the most memorable classical performances of 2011. <a href="Allan%20Kozinn">Allan Kozinn</a>, music critic for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", considered the program "pained" and "thought-provoking", and wrote that Sylvan performed with his "characteristic acuity". He called the woodwind and brass playing in "Sinfonia da Requiem" "superb", specifically highlighting the "pointed" percussion in "Dies Irae" and the "haunting" string tone in "Requiem Aeternam". Like Ross, Kozinn thought Symphony No. 4 was performed "with a furious, incendiary energy" that made an ideal ending to the program.

In September 2011, the Symphony confirmed that Kalmar's contract, previously set to expire in 2013, had been extended until 2015. According to the organization, his contract was renewed "in recognition of his significant accomplishments", specifically acknowledging the Carnegie Hall performance. The orchestra was invited to perform again at the 2013 Spring for Music Festival as one of two returning ensembles. Kalmar said of the return invitation, "To be invited once is a thrill. To be invited twice is clear proof that we are in the artistic big leagues." However, in October 2012 the Symphony announced it would not accept the invitation for financial reasons.

"Music for a Time of War" was released on <a href="Compact%20Disc">CD</a> by <a href="Pentatone%20%28record%20label%29">PentaTone Classics</a> on October 25, 2011. It was recorded in hybrid <a href="Audio%20channel">multichannel</a> (<a href="surround%20sound">surround sound</a>) <a href="Super%20Audio%20CD">Super Audio CD</a> format. <a href="Blanton%20Alspaugh">Blanton Alspaugh</a> served as <a href="Record%20producer">producer</a>. John Newton and Jesse Lewis were the recording <a href="Audio%20engineering">engineers</a>; <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastering</a> and <a href="Optical%20disc%20authoring">authoring</a> was conducted by Jesse Brayman. In addition to recording the performances, Soundmirror edited, <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> and mastered the audio.

The album contains nine tracks ("Sinfonia da Requiem" and Symphony No. 4 are divided into separate tracks for each movement) and totals just over 78 minutes in length. Program notes for the recording were written by Steven Kruger. The album's <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> photo is credited to orchestra member Martha Warrington.

"Music for a Time of War" marked the orchestra's first recording in eight years as well as Kalmar's first with the Oregon Symphony. The recording is the first of four albums to be produced by the Symphony and PentaTone through the end of the 2014–2015 season, all under Kalmar's artistic leadership.

The album performed well commercially and received favorable reviews. "Music for a Time of War" debuted and peaked at number 31 on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" Classical Albums chart the week of November 19, 2011. On November 19, <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> reviewed the album on its program "CD Review", which discusses and recommends new classical music recordings. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Mike Brownell awarded the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that the Symphony "prove[d] they can easily stand alongside the world's great orchestras". Audiophile Audition's John Sunier thought the program was "well-chosen to offer great variety in sound and compositional techniques". Michael Miller of "The Berkshire Review" appreciated the "precision and sensitivity" of the playing and Karlmar's "lucid, straightforward, and ... virile" approach to the program. Miller also complimented Sylvan's performance and called the recording "memorable" and "thrilling", recommending it for any classical music library. Brian Horay, a classical music critic for "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>", questioned Kalmar's claim that his selections should not be interpreted as political, writing that listeners "[encounter] a more difficult and nuanced 20th-century musical landscape of existential questions, gruesome descriptions, defiant submissions and cold dissonance." Horay continued, ""Music for a Time of War" serves as a powerful acoustic journey of peaceful resistance and questioning of power". Barry Forshaw of the "<a href="Islington%20Gazette">Islington Gazette</a>" thought the war theme was "tendentious" but called the collection "enterprising". James Bash of Oregon Music News called the album a "brilliant stunner", mirroring his positive review of the Carnegie Hall performance.

Soundmirror also received compliments. Andrew Quint of "<a href="The%20Absolute%20Sound">The Absolute Sound</a>" described the sound as "vivid, highly detailed, and dynamic" as well as avoiding "digital steeliness". Quint called the front-to-back layering outstanding. John Sunier said the recording's "rich surround sonics" bring together excellent performances and "first-rate fidelity". He also noted the lack of audience interference, suggesting either good behavior by attendees or subtle work by audio engineers. Michael Miller complimented the quality of the recording for having "no problems of intonation or ensemble" and said the album "belongs in the reference collection of any audiophile, whether they are inclined to multichannel playback or not". Miller specifically appreciated Alspaugh and the engineers for capturing the loudness and subtleties of "Sinfonia da Requiem". "<a href="International%20Record%20Review">International Record Review</a>" Nigel Simeone recommended the recording, calling it "impressive" and writing that the live sound is "exceptionally vibrant". Kalman Rubinson of "<a href="Stereophile">Stereophile</a>" commended the ensemble, PentaTone and Soundmirror for providing "spacious, transparent, powerful sound". Rubinson, who designated the recording as the year's best concept album, praised the program for being "thought-provoking and restorative" and appreciated the range of emotions it summoned.

Several publications included "Music for a Time of War" on their lists of the best classical recordings of 2011. "<a href="Eugene%20Weekly">Eugene Weekly</a>" recommended the album as a "stocking stuffer" on their list of the best Oregon classical music recordings of the year. Contributor Brett Campbell called the recording one of the year's "most compelling", with "blistering, committed, sharply etched performances" that illustrate the orchestra's quality under Kalmar's leadership. Similarly, "<a href="Portland%20Monthly">Portland Monthly</a>" included "Music for a Time of War" on its list of fifteen "giftable" Portland albums. Alex Ross of "The New Yorker" included the album on his list of the ten most "exceptional" classical music recordings of the year. New York City's "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" included the album as number seven on their list of the ten "Best Classical Albums of 2011". The publication's Steve Smith called the collection "greater than the sum of its parts". James Manishen of the "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" included "Music for a Time of War" as number three on his list of the ten best classical recordings of the year, calling the performances "superbly prepared". The album received its second pressing in February 2012.

Producer Alspaugh received a Grammy award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Producer%20of%20the%20Year%2C%20Classical">Producer of the Year, Classical</a> for his contributions to the album and other recordings.

Pitfour estate

The Pitfour estate, in the <a href="Buchan">Buchan</a> area of north-east Scotland, was an ancient <a href="Scottish%20feudal%20barony">barony</a> encompassing most of the extensive <a href="Longside">Longside</a> Parish, stretching from <a href="St%20Fergus">St Fergus</a> to <a href="New%20Pitsligo">New Pitsligo</a>. It was purchased in 1700 by <a href="James%20Ferguson%2C%201st%20Laird%20of%20Pitfour">James Ferguson</a> of Badifurrow, who became the first <a href="Laird">Laird</a> of Pitfour.

The estate was substantially renovated by Ferguson and the following two generations of his family. At the height of its development in the 18th and 19th centuries the property had several extravagant features including a two-mile racecourse, an artificial lake and an observatory. The original mansion house was extended before being rebuilt. The surrounding parklands were landscaped, major renovations were undertaken, and follies such as a small replica <a href="Temple%20of%20Hephaestus">Temple of Theseus</a> were constructed, in which <a href="George%20Ferguson%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Ferguson</a>, the fifth laird, was thought to keep alligators in a cold bath.

The first three lairds transformed the estate into a valuable asset. <a href="James%20Ferguson%2C%20Lord%20Pitfour">Lord Pitfour</a>, the second laird, purchased additional lands including <a href="Deer%20Abbey">Deer Abbey</a> and <a href="Inverugie%20Castle">Inverugie Castle</a>. Pitfour's son, <a href="James%20Ferguson%20%28Scottish%20politician%29">James Ferguson</a>, who became the third laird, continued to improve and expand the estate by adding the lake and bridges, and establishing planned villages. The third laird died a bachelor with no children, so the estate passed to the elderly <a href="George%20Ferguson%20%28Lt%20Governor%20of%20Tobago%29">George Ferguson</a>, who was only in possession of the property for a few months. George was already a wealthy man, owning lands in Trinidad and Tobago, but despite not directly improving the Pitfour estate he added considerable value to the inheritance passed to his illegitimate son. The extravagant lifestyles of the fifth and sixth lairds led to the <a href="sequestration%20%28law%29">sequestration</a> of the estate, which was sold off piecemeal to pay their debts.

What remained of the estate was sold after the First World War. The mansion house was demolished in about 1926, and its stone used to build council houses in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>. In more recent times some of the remaining buildings, including the temple, the bridges and the stables, have been classified as at high risk by <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> because their condition has become poor. The chapel was fully renovated and converted to a private residence in 2003; the observatory was purchased and restored by Banff & Buchan District Council (now <a href="Aberdeenshire%20Council">Aberdeenshire Council</a>) and can be accessed by the public. The racecourse has been forested since 1926, and the lake is used by members of a private fishing club.

The Pitfour estate in <a href="Mintlaw">Mintlaw</a> extended from <a href="St%20Fergus">St Fergus</a> to <a href="New%20Pitsligo">New Pitsligo</a> and encompassed most of the extensive <a href="Longside">Longside</a> Parish. The meaning of "Pitfour" is given in the 1895 records of the <a href="Clan%20Fergusson">Clan Fergusson</a> as "cold croft", but the historian John Milne breaks the name into two parts and indicates the meaning as "Pit" being place and "feoir" or "feur" being grass. The Pitfour estate is shown on old maps as Petfouir or Petfour. It was formerly one of Scotland's largest and best-appointed estates and was referred to as "The <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">Blenheim</a> of Buchan", "The Blenheim of the North" and "The <a href="Ascot%20Racecourse">Ascot</a> of the North" by the architectural historian <a href="Charles%20McKean">Charles McKean</a>.

Scant early records exist of the lands but Alexander Stewart (Alexandro Senescalli), the <a href="natural%20son">natural son</a> of King <a href="Robert%20II%20of%20Scotland">Robert II of Scotland</a>, was given the Pitfour lands together with those of <a href="Lunan%2C%20Angus">Lunan</a> by his father in 1383. However, writing in 1887 Cadenhead states the lands were sold to Stewart by Ricardus Mouet, also known as Richard Lownan. During the next three centuries the lands had several different owners. Transactions show it passed to a <a href="Burgess%20%28title%29">burgess</a> of Aberdeen in 1477 from Egidia Stewart; Walter Innes of Invermarkie gained feudal superiority to all Pitfour lands in 1493; and in 1506 the land was purchased by Thomas Innes, who died the following year. His son, John, inherited the property. It remained in the possession of the Innes family until at least 1581, when it was owned by James Innes and his wife Agnes Urquhart. Between 1581 and 1667 the lands were bought by George Morrison. His son William inherited the property in 1700, and immediately sold the estate to <a href="James%20Ferguson%2C%201st%20Laird%20of%20Pitfour">James Ferguson</a>, who became the first Laird of Pitfour.

The lands purchased by Ferguson were recorded in 1667 in a charter granted by <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> and were stated as encompassing "the lands and Barony of Toux and Pitfour in the Parish of Old Deer and Sheriffdom of Aberdeen including the towns and lands of Mintlaw, Longmuir, Dumpston in the Parish of Longside, and County of Aberdeen." Several other lands, including "the Barony of Aden with the Tower, Fortaliss, Mains and Manor Place therof and pertinents of the same called Fortry, Rora Mill thereof, Croft Brewerie, Inverquhomrie and Yockieshill" were individually listed. State papers from the reign of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> in the 18th century record the lands in favour of James Ferguson.

1st laird

James Ferguson—known as the Sheriff, reflecting the post he held, recognised by the <a href="Society%20of%20Advocates%20in%20Aberdeen">Society of Advocates</a>—bought the Pitfour estate after selling the lands of Badifurrow. He had inherited Badifurrow after demanding that his uncle <a href="Robert%20Ferguson%20%28minister%29">Robert Ferguson</a> should appear in court if he wished to contest the inheritance. Robert, nicknamed the Plotter, was in hiding to avoid charges of treachery, and after his non-appearance in court James Ferguson's inheritance was confirmed in mid-June 1700. At that time the estate contained only a small country house.

2nd laird

James was laird until his death in 1734, after which the estate passed to his eldest son, also called <a href="James%20Ferguson%2C%20Lord%20Pitfour">James</a>, who was born at Pitfour soon after it was purchased. A solicitor like his father, he was promoted to the bench in 1764 and became Lord Pitfour. He continued to expand and improve the estate until his death in 1777, and set up the planned village of <a href="Fetterangus">Fetterangus</a> in 1752.

Lord Pitfour purchased the lands of the last <a href="Earl%20Marischal">Earl Marischal</a>, <a href="George%20Keith%2C%2010th%20Earl%20Marischal">George Keith</a>, which were adjacent to Pitfour, in 1766. They were considered the Earl Marischal's most significant property and had been forfeited when the Earl Marischal fell out of favour. He had bought it back from the <a href="York%20Buildings%20Company">York Buildings Company</a> for £31,000, but Pitfour only paid £15,000 for it. The of land included <a href="Deer%20Abbey">Deer Abbey</a> and <a href="Inverugie%20Castle">Inverugie Castle</a>, but consisted predominantly of peat bogs, woods and uncultivated land. This addition made the Pitfour estate the largest in the area, at more than stretching from Buchanhaven to <a href="Maud%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Maud</a> along the course of the <a href="River%20Ugie">River Ugie</a>.

3rd laird

The <a href="James%20Ferguson%20%28Scottish%20politician%29">third laird</a>, also named James, inherited the estate in 1777; he was usually referred to as the Member to differentiate him from previous generations. Like his forebears, he was an advocate but also became a Member of Parliament. He too continued to expand and improve the estate; he constructed a lake and a canal, and built the new mansion. He also expanded and altered Longside at the start of the 1800s, founded Mintlaw in 1813, assisted in the extension of New Deer and extended Buchanhaven.

The Member died unmarried, childless and intestate in 1820. In normal circumstances his brother <a href="Patrick%20Ferguson">Patrick</a> would have been his heir, but he died in battle in October 1780.

4th laird

In 1820 the estate was inherited by the Member's younger brother, <a href="George%20Ferguson%20%28Lt%20Governor%20of%20Tobago%29">George Ferguson</a>, who was by then in his seventies. He was known as the Governor, reflecting his appointment as Lieutenant Governor of Tobago. He was laird from September 1820, but died in December that year. The Governor had spent most of his life in Trinidad and Tobago, where he was a principal landowner, and had inherited the Castara Estate on Tobago from Patrick. George was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Tobago in 1779, and after a battle with the French in 1781 surrendered the island to the French on 2 June. The Governor returned to Britain, although the terms of the surrender meant he still owned the Castara estate and all the slaves who worked on it. George had illegitimate children with an unknown woman. He continued to buy estates in the Caribbean and returned there in 1793, staying until 1810.

5th laird

The estate started to deteriorate after it was inherited by the Governor's illegitimate son <a href="George%20Ferguson%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">George Ferguson</a>, known as the Admiral because of his naval career. He was already heavily in debt when he became the fifth laird in 1821, but he still enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and undertook much extravagant construction on the estate, including the erection of follies. To cover his substantial gambling debts, he began to sell parcels of estate land, and upon inheriting Pitfour he began selling furniture, books, farm equipment and other items, realising more than £9,000.

6th laird

After the Admiral's death in March 1867, the estate passed to his son, George Arthur Ferguson, the sixth and final laird. He served in the <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">Grenadier Guards</a> and eventually became a captain. He married Nina Maria Hood, the eldest daughter of <a href="Alexander%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bridport%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Alexander Nelson Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport</a>, in February 1861. Later that year Captain Ferguson was posted to Canada, where he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and where his first two sons, <a href="Arthur%20Ferguson%20%28police%20officer%29">Arthur</a> and Francis William, were born. His eldest son, Arthur, became Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland. Returning to Britain in 1864, the family had a nomadic lifestyle, but the sixth laird and his wife were extravagant and habitual gamblers. In June 1909, a <a href="Protected%20trust%20deed">trust deed</a> was registered, and what remained of the estate was put on the market. After large parts of the land had been sold under the ownership of the sixth laird the estate was listed by Bateman in 1883 as being just over with an income of £19,938; at the height of its development the estate had occupied , and was valued at £30 million.

The last laird died in 1924 and is buried in Luton.

Following its 20th-century decline the estate changed hands several times until local farmer Hamish Watson purchased it in December 2010. The local historian Alex Buchan summed up the demise of the estate: "They thought the estate was here to provide them with money, to gamble, to travel, to simply fritter away and very quickly, within a couple of decades, they had wasted the whole lot." He added, "Eccentricity amounted to just squandering money."

The original small country house was first altered during the early 18th century. In 1809 the Sheriff's grandson James Ferguson, the third laird, employed the architect <a href="John%20Smith%20%28architect%29">John Smith</a> to design new accommodation. The resulting three-storey house, square and high, is reputed to have had 365 windows. When the fourth laird, George (the Governor), died in 1820, the estate was worth £300,000 with almost £35,000 of moveable assets. George Ferguson, the fifth laird (the Admiral) added a large, glazed gallery when he inherited the house. The Admiral had a lavish lifestyle and despite having a healthy income incurred heavy debts.

When the Admiral died after 46 years of managing the estate it was mortgaged for £250,000, despite the sale of a number of the lands originally included in it. The house fell into disrepair under the ownership of George Arthur, the sixth and final laird, who had inherited his father's lifestyle. The entire estate was put on the market in September 1909 but remained unsold until after the First World War; the house and what remained of the estate were finally purchased by a speculator, Edgar Fairweather, from London in 1926. Fairweather bought several other Scottish estates, including those nearby at <a href="Auchmeddan%20Castle">Auchmeddan</a> and <a href="Strichen">Strichen</a>; he habitually reduced the estates into smaller holdings that he then sold on or rented out. The house was sold to an Aberdeen building company and was demolished sometime between 1927 and 1930. After demolition, the mansion's veranda was installed at the front of Kinloch Farmhouse in <a href="St%20Fergus">St Fergus</a>. Other remains from the mansion have been discovered at the farmhouse, including a crest above the conservatory door and tiles inscribed with the Ferguson of Pitfour family crest. The stone from the mansion was transported to Aberdeen and used to construct Torry Junior Secondary School.

The Fergusons were <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Episcopalian</a>, and in 1766, the second laird, Lord Pitfour had a small <a href="Qualified%20Chapel">Qualified Chapel</a> built on the estate at Waulkmill. It was a large, plain building that could accommodate up to 500 people. Saplinbrae, a house that was initially used as a coaching inn after it was built under instruction from Lord Pitfour in 1756, was used as the minister's manse for the first chapel.

A more modern chapel was built in 1850 after the Admiral had an argument with the Reverend Arthur Ranken, the minister at Old Deer. This was a small, private chapel for the use of the Pitfour estate. It was built in the Gothic style from rubble but was recast in 1871. A tower with a battlemented top is at its western end. The chapel fell into disrepair, and by the 1980s it was a roofless ruin.

In 1990 <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> said that Kinloch Farmhouse, in St Fergus featured a bench and chair salvaged from the Pitfour Chapel. In 2003, the second chapel was renovated and converted to a private residence. The chapel restoration won a "Highly commended" award for craftsmanship from Aberdeenshire Council in 2010; the council said the craftsmanship "allowed for the retention of the ecclesiastical spirit and integrity to remain prevalent both internally and externally." It was also "Highly Commended" in the conservation category.

The stables were built in 1820, during the early part of the Admiral's ownership of the estate, based on a design by John Smith; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house. Built in a horseshoe-shape, <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neo-classical</a> design, the two-storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings; grey granite was used for the parapet and <a href="quoin%20%28architecture%29">quoins</a>. The main buildings were originally <a href="harl">harl</a>ed. A corrugated asbestos <a href="hip%20roof">hipped roof</a> was at some point substituted for the original slate roof. It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower, which has a <a href="finial">finial</a> and <a href="dome">dome</a>d copper roof. The <a href="pediment">pediment</a>ed centrepiece of the symmetrical front elevation is a segmental arch and has three panels set back between columns. Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single-bay pavilions.

The stables are connected to an adjoining two-storey house. They provided accommodation for ten horses and included four loose boxes, a harness room and a coachman's house; six bedrooms above were for servants. Two coach houses were later used as garages. The stables building was marketed in 1997 for approximately £70,000. <a href="Charles%20McKean">Charles McKean</a> describes the stables as "straddling the skyline like a palace". The stables are listed by Historic Scotland as being at very high risk, and were described in 1997 sale literature as unused and dilapidated.

An indoor riding school slightly to the north-west of the stables measured by . It was used to entertain guests when the facilities at the mansion house were not large enough. More than two hundred local farmers and other landowners celebrated the wedding of George Arthur, the sixth laird, in the riding school in 1861. In 1883 it was again used to entertain; on that occasion it was decorated with flags and Chinese lanterns, and pine flooring was laid. Later, it was used as indoor tennis courts before being demolished.

James Ferguson, the third laird, owned the estate during the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in Britain. He began work on a canal between Pitfour and Peterhead in 1797, despite fierce opposition from adjoining landowners. The canal was proposed to cover about ten miles following the course of the River Ugie. Pitfour's canal is sometimes called the St Fergus and River Ugie Canal. Ferguson had thought about building the canal since 1793, but it was never completed because of "difficulties in effecting the necessary arrangements with neighbouring heritors." Objections were raised by the Merchant Maiden Hospital, which owned the land on the south side of the Ugie. Despite being advised to take out an interdict to prevent the work, in January 1797 the hospital thought its case was not strong enough. The hospital applied for an interdict four months later however, when of the canal had been dug to the point where the north and south Ugie joined; it was granted in July 1797.

A few years after starting work on the canal, Ferguson had a lake built on flat land to the front of the mansion house. The landscape gardener <a href="William%20Sawrey%20Gilpin">William S. Gilpin</a> was carrying out work on the adjacent <a href="Strichen">Strichen</a> estate at about the same time, and it is assumed he helped with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost and is above sea level. Designed in the same style as the <a href="Virginia%20Water%20Lake">lake</a> in <a href="Windsor%20Great%20Park">Windsor Great Park</a>, the lake was stocked with trout, both rainbow and brown; there were three bridges and four islands. The siting of the lake meant the driveway had to be moved, and ornate bridges were constructed to cross the water. Built from granite, the northern bridge has three arches with <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> <a href="Starling%20%28architecture%29">starlings</a>, the southern bridge has a single arch and the third, smaller bridge crosses a large stream that drains into the lake.

The neighbouring Russell family of Aden were concerned their land would be flooded when the lake was built, and their animosity was fully demonstrated when a bridge had to be jointly constructed by the two landowners over the River Ugie. It was wide enough for carriages on the Pitfour side but too narrow on the Russells' half.

Alongside the lake was a six-bay <a href="Dorians">Greek Doric</a> temple, a small replica styled after the <a href="Temple%20of%20Hephaestus">Temple of Theseus</a>. Its exact date of construction is unknown; it may have been built during the time of James Ferguson, the third laird, or under the instruction of George Ferguson, the fifth laird. The local historian Alex Buchan attributes it to James, the third laird; according to Historic Scotland, it was built "probably circa 1835". Like the mansion house, the temple is credited to the architect John Smith. Measuring by , it has six columns at both ends and thirteen columns down each side. It had a flat roof with an ornate wooden <a href="entablature">entablature</a> and contained a cold-water bath in which George, the fifth laird was believed to have kept alligators. the temple is in a ruinous state; it has been held up by scaffolding since 1992 and is listed by Historic Scotland as being in critical condition.

George Ferguson (the Admiral) had a racecourse about long and wide built near White Cow Woods, an area which is quite flat. This led to the estate being called the "Ascot of the North".

In 1845 the Admiral had an observatory built, again designed by the architect John Smith. It is an octagonal tower with a crenellated parapet and is symmetrical in design. The observatory stands at the top of a hill above sea level. The tower is high and is more than half a mile () from the racecourse. It has three storeys with square windows on the upper floor, and was fully renovated by Banff & Buchan District Council (now Aberdeenshire Council) in 1983.

Sales of country estates became common around the 1920s. The annual tax payable had spiralled and was twenty times greater than in 1870 resulting in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird. The main estate policies including the lake and other land were purchased by Bernard Drake in November 1926 when he bought Saplinbrae, the former minister's house. Drake was a partner in the electrical engineering company, Drake and Gorham.

Sixty years later, in 1986 the <a href="BBC%20Domesday%20Project">BBC Domesday Project</a> does not give any ownership details but indicates many of the buildings are in poor condition. Other surviving structures are used for storage by a farmer who also "manages the land".

At the end of 2012 Aberdeenshire Council gave the go-ahead for the present owner's planned restoration work on the temple and bridges, which he hoped would enhance existing facilities at nearby Drinnies Wood surrounding the Observatory, White Cow Woods and Aden Country Park. The lake is used regularly by local fishermen, and a fishing club with about 120 members was established in 2011. The rest of the estate is seldom used by local residents, many of whom are completely unaware of it.

Goodman Beaver

Goodman Beaver is a fictional character who appears in comics created by American cartoonist <a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman">Harvey Kurtzman</a>. Goodman is a naive and optimistic <a href="Candide">Candide</a>-like character, oblivious to the corruption and degeneration around him, and whose stories were vehicles for social satire and pop culture parody. Except for the character's first appearance, which Kurtzman did alone, the stories were written by Kurtzman and drawn by <a href="Will%20Elder">Will Elder</a>.

Goodman first appeared in a story in "<a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman%27s%20Jungle%20Book">Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book</a>" in 1959; the best-remembered were the five strips the Kurtzman–Elder team produced in 1961–62 for the Kurtzman-edited magazine "<a href="Help%21%20%28magazine%29">Help!</a>" They tend to be in the parodic style Kurtzman developed when he wrote and edited "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>" in the 1950s, but with more pointed, adult-oriented satire and much more refined and detailed artwork on Elder's part, filled with numerous <a href="visual%20gag">visual gag</a>s.

The best-known of the Goodman Beaver stories is "Goodman Goes Playboy" (1962), a satire on the hedonistic lifestyle of <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> using parodies of <a href="List%20of%20Archie%20Comics%20characters">"Archie" comics characters</a>, whose publisher threatened a lawsuit. The issue was settled out of court, and the copyright for the story passed to <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a>. Hefner, the actual target of the strip, found it amusing. Kurtzman and Elder developed a female version of Goodman Beaver for "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine called "<a href="Little%20Annie%20Fanny">Little Annie Fanny</a>" (1962–88).

Goodman Beaver is a naïve and optimistic character, oblivious to the degeneration around him. According to Kurtzman, the character was partially inspired by <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s "<a href="Candide">Candide</a>" and <a href="Harold%20Gray">Harold Gray</a>'s comic strip character <a href="Little%20Orphan%20Annie">Little Orphan Annie</a>, who, like Goodman, was drawn with blank circles for eyes. Art critic <a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> compares Goodman to <a href="Young%20Goodman%20Brown">Young Goodman Brown</a> in <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s tale of the same name—both are pure-souled characters who become disillusioned by the depravity they confront in the world.

Kurtzman wrote five Goodman Beaver stories for his long-time collaborator Will Elder. Most of the stories were in the parodic style Kurtzman had developed as the <a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman%27s%20editorship%20of%20Mad">creator, editor, and writer</a> of "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>", but dealt with more significant issues concerning <a href="modernity">modernity</a>. Published in the Kurtzman-edited "<a href="Help%21%20%28magazine%29">Help!</a>" in the early 1960s, they were drawn in Elder's "chickenfat" style, in which he crammed every panel with humorous detail and throwaway <a href="Visual%20gag">gags</a>. Elder cited the Flemish <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Pieter Bruegel the Elder</a> and the Spanish <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a> as influences on this style.

As an editor hired by Schlock Publications Inc., Goodman loses his youthful idealism when awash in the sea of avarice and selfishness he encounters in the publishing world. In this story Kurtzman used his own personal experiences to satirize the corrupting influence of capitalism and power. Goodman finds himself groping the secretaries, just as the other cynical executives at Schlock do, and ends up stealing from the company.

Goodman was a semi-autobiographical character, reflecting Kurtzman's disillusioning experiences in the publishing industry. Kurtzman's artwork is in an exaggerated cartoon style with round, fluid, elongated characters rendered with loose, fluid, and sketchy brushwork and gray <a href="wash%20%28painting%29">wash</a>. Dialogue is in an expressive, handwriting-like style. Kurtzman blends the verbal and visual aspects of the work—for example, when an enraged Goodman Beaver confronts his diminutive boss Mr. Schlock, Goodman is graphically overwhelmed by Schlock's <a href="Speech%20balloon">word balloons</a>, which demonstrates Goodman's helpless subservience and Schlock's effortless psychological dominance over his employees.

"Goodman Meets T*rz*n" first appeared in the September 1961 issue of "Help!", and was Elder's first take on Goodman Beaver. Set against the backdrop of the fall of European colonialism in the face of the rise of <a href="African%20nationalism">African nationalism</a>, such as in the <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Kenyan Mau-Mau Uprising</a>, and the spread of the Soviet sphere of influence, the story throws a modern 1960s spin on the romance of jungle adventure as exemplified by the <a href="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> tales. Kurtzman sends up T*rz*n's attitude of superiority, as when T*rz*n (Tarzan) confronts an African tribe, or when J*ne (<a href="Jane%20Porter%20%28Tarzan%29">Jane</a>) gives T*rz*n basic English lessons.

Elder's first efforts had Goodman depicted with more monkey-like features—thick, black eyebrows, a large mouth, and small jaw and chin. Kurtzman and Elder desired to have a more "lovable" Goodman, so Elder reworked Goodman's appearance in later stories, redrawing Goodman's features to conform with this new look for later reprintings of the "Goodman Meets T*rz*n" story.

"Help!"s most famous story was "Goodman Goes Playboy", first published in the February 1962 issue of "Help!" The story satirized <a href="Hugh%20Hefner">Hugh Hefner</a> and his lifestyle while parodying "<a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie</a>" comics in a much more outlandish way than Kurtzman's parody "Starchie" in "Mad" a decade earlier. Kurtzman called this his favorite Goodman Beaver story, and said that Hefner would point people to it when he wanted to explain to people what Kurtzman's work was about.

Goodman has returned to his hometown, and the "Archie" characters, home from college, are drinking, partying, skirt-chasing <a href="Hedonism">hedonists</a>. <a href="Jughead%20Jones">Jughead</a> is a <a href="beatnik">beatnik</a>, and the others are leading glamorous lifestyles. <a href="Archie%20Andrews%20%28comics%29">Archie Andrews</a> parody Archer explains to a behind-the-times Goodman, "You've been away too long. Nowadays, the gang is interested mainly in <a href="Hip%20%28slang%29">hip</a>-ness—awareness", rather than keeping up with how the football team is doing. Archer shows Goodman to his place, which must be entered through a staircase built into an enormous statue of a female abdomen. Archer leads Goodman to a Roman-style <a href="orgy">orgy</a> and has him change into a <a href="toga">toga</a>. The party is Archer's last, as he reveals he has signed a <a href="Deal%20with%20the%20Devil">pact with the Devil</a>, and the debt (Archer's soul) was due that night.

"Goodman Goes Playboy" appeared in altered form in the book collection "Executive's Comic Book" in 1962: in the orgy scene the exposed nipples were covered with white ink and the parody "Archie" characters were altered to obscure the resemblance to characters they were based on in a failed attempt to escape legal action from "Archie"s publishers.

While trying to enjoy a book as he floats in a <a href="swim%20ring">swim ring</a> off a crowded beach, Goodman is interrupted by undersea adventurer Hammer Nelson, who invites Goodman to help him fight underwater crime. <a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>-like, the overeager Nelson sees crime where there is none, interrupting swimmers and boaters at play. The pair set out to find a Russian submarine—and find one, but Nelson mistakes it for a monster to be subdued with his <a href="speargun">speargun</a>. Goodman realizes Nelson's insanity, abandons the adventurer, and returns to his book.

Framed within the story of "Don Quixote", "Goodman, Underwater" satirizes <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> tensions and sets out to deflate the deluded ideals of <a href="do-gooder">do-gooder</a>s while parodying the 1960s television series "<a href="Sea%20Hunt">Sea Hunt</a>", which starred <a href="Lloyd%20Bridges">Lloyd Bridges</a> as Mike Nelson. The illustrations that bookend the story are from 19th-century French artist <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>'s "Don Quixote" illustrations. The story first appeared in "Help!" #14 (May 1962).

In "Goodman Meets S*perm*n", Goodman stumbles across the superhero on a fishing trip. S*perm*n (<a href="Superman">Superman</a>) has gone into hiding from society, sporting a beard and <a href="moccasin">moccasin</a>s. He no longer has the desire to help a society he has lost faith in, and which criticizes him for his good deeds. Goodman takes him back to the city to prove that society is still full of good people. While in the city, Goodman encounters an old woman being attacked by a knife-wielding maniac. Goodman flees in terror, but is stopped by S*perm*n who reveals himself as the old woman in disguise—he had been testing Goodman's selflessness. S*perm*n is horrified and disappointed by the degeneration and corruption he sees in the city, and abandons society again.

First published in "Help!" #15 (August 1962), Elder described "Goodman Meets S*perm*n" and its detailed <a href="Glossary%20of%20comics%20terminology%23Splash">splash page</a> as "<a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a> on paper. You never knew what to expect", referring to the busy wealth of gags it was filled with. With artwork by <a href="Wally%20Wood">Wally Wood</a>, Kurtzman first parodied Superman in "<a href="Superduperman">Superduperman</a>" in the fourth issue of "Mad" in 1953.

Goodman attends a pool party in his hometown Riverdale, fresh from joining the police force. He spots the popular Liz Taylbone, with whom he had been smitten since high school, but he is too passive and timid to draw her attention. After watching a <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> movie on TV in the lounge he is infused with courage and returns to the party imitating Brando's attitude and mannerisms. He draws the attention of Liz Taylbone and the crowd, but not for his Brando impression as he thinks—rather, they are impressed to learn that, as an off-duty police officer, Goodman is carrying a <a href="pistol">pistol</a>. The group coaxes him into going with them to a night club known for its rough clientele. When the rough crowd arrives, Goodman's group expects the gun to serve as their protection—until Goodman lets them know his newfound self-confidence drove him to quit the police force two hours earlier. The group abandons Goodman to a thrashing by the thugs.

"Goodman Gets a Gun" appeared first in "Help!" #16 (November 1962). It was the only Elder-drawn story not to appear in the "Executive's Comic Book" collection of 1962.

Goodman Beaver made his first appearance in "<a href="Harvey%20Kurtzman%27s%20Jungle%20Book">Harvey Kurtzman's Jungle Book</a>" in 1959, in "The Organization Man in the Gray Flannel Executive Suit". "Jungle Book" was the first American book of original comics, a mass-market paperback that was the first in a planned series. The book sold poorly, but has been a favorite among Kurtzman fans.

The first Elder-drawn Goodman story appeared in "Help!" #12 in 1961 and was followed in 1962 with four more stories in "Help!" #13–16. A Goodman Beaver collection called "Executive's Comic Book" appeared in 1962 from <a href="Macfadden%20Publications">Macfadden</a> Books. In this paperback collection of four stories—"Goodman Meets T*rz*n", "Goodman Goes Playboy", "Goodman, Underwater", and "Goodman Meets S*perm*n"—the strips were reformatted to one panel per page. Elder extended the artwork of each panel to fit the page dimensions.

Kurtzman approached Hugh Hefner in 1960 with the idea of a comic strip feature for "Playboy" that would star Goodman Beaver. Until then, "Playboy" had printed many cartoons, but not a comic strip. After exchanging ideas with Hefner the project was approved, but Goodman Beaver was required to be transformed into a voluptuous female. Kurtzman brought in Will Elder as his primary collaborator on "<a href="Little%20Annie%20Fanny">Little Annie Fanny</a>".

In 1984 <a href="Kitchen%20Sink%20Press">Kitchen Sink Press</a> published a collection called "Goodman Beaver", which reprinted four Kurtzman–Elder stories from "Help!"—all the Elder-drawn stories except for "Goodman Goes Playboy", which appeared only in short excerpts permitted by <a href="fair%20use">fair use</a> exemptions under <a href="Copyright%20law%20of%20the%20United%20States">US copyright law</a>. The book reprinted the elongated versions of those strips that had appeared in "Executive's Comic Book". Original artwork for 38 of the 139 reproduced panels were lost; according to Kurtzman, several pages were sent to French magazine "<a href="Charlie%20Hebdo">Charlie Hebdo</a>" for translation and never returned. Kitchen Sink used proofs, photostats, or original magazine appearances for sources from which to reproduce the missing panels.

Kurtzman had avoided drawing legal fire from the litigious <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs%2C%20Inc.">Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.</a> when he parodied their copyrighted properties, but the saturnalian depictions of the "Archie" characters in "Goodman Goes Playboy" provoked legal action from "Archie" publisher <a href="John%20L.%20Goldwater">John L. Goldwater</a>, who had earlier played a role in founding the comics industry's self-<a href="censorship">censorship</a> body, the <a href="Comics%20Code%20Authority">Comics Magazine Association of America</a>.

"Help!" publisher <a href="James%20Warren%20%28publisher%29">Jim Warren</a> received a letter on 6 December 1961 accusing the magazine of <a href="copyright%20infringement">copyright infringement</a> and demanding removal of the offending issue from newsstands. Warren's lawyer believed they could succeed if they fought the suit, but the legal costs would make it a "<a href="Pyrrhic%20victory">Pyrrhic victory</a>", and thus recommended settling out of court. Warren could not have the magazine <a href="Product%20recall">recalled</a>, but he agreed to pay Archie Comics $1000 and ran a note of apology in a subsequent issue of "Help!"—the August 1962 issue, in which appeared another character franchise parody, "Goodman Meets S*perm*n". Warren's action disappointed Kurtzman, who felt that giving in to such censorship set a "terrible precedent", and amounted to a kind of prostitution.

When the story was reprinted in the book collection "Executive Comic Book" in 1962, Elder modified the artwork to obscure the appearance of the "Archie" characters. Archie Comics found the characters' appearances still too close to their copyrighted properties and threatened another lawsuit. Kurtzman and Elder settled out of court by handing over the copyright to the story. Archie Comics held on to the copyright and refused to allow the story to be republished.

The actual target of "Goodman Goes Playboy" had been Hefner, who loved it. Kurtzman began working for Hefner again soon afterwards. The strip Kurtzman produced, "Little Annie Fanny", is often thought of as a compromise—virtuosic in its visuals, but lacking in content in comparison to the Goodman Beaver stories. <a href="R.%20Fiore">R. Fiore</a> and other commentators have considered this ironic in light of the <a href="Faust">Faust</a>ian theme of "Goodman Goes Playboy".

In June 1983 <a href="Denis%20Kitchen">Denis Kitchen</a> requested the right to reprint the story as part of a planned "Goodman Beaver" collection. Archie Enterprises chairman <a href="Michael%20J.%20Silberkleit">Michael J. Silberkleit</a> responded that publishing a story that included the likenesses of the Archie characters would be "a serious breach of copyright and trademark law". When the company learned that Kitchen planned to publish the story with the pages reduced in size and the characters' faces blacked out, Archie Enterprises threatened another lawsuit, and Kitchen dropped the story from the collection, which appeared in 1984. Kitchen went as far as to have the book's cover redone, as the planned one had incorporated a "Goodman Goes Playboy" panel in the background.

Publisher and critic <a href="Gary%20Groth">Gary Groth</a> wrote that Elder's artwork in the Goodman Beaver stories "clinched his reputation as the cartoon <a href="Pieter%20Bruegel%20the%20Elder">Brueghel</a> with his intricate portraits of a world cheerfully going mad". Elder considered the stories to be the funniest of his collaborations with Kurtzman, though he said that towards the end of the run he was getting tired of the painstaking work he put into the drawings. The stories placed sixty-fourth on "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>"s "Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century" in 1999, along with four other works with which Kurtzman was involved. Late-1990s talk of a Goodman Beaver feature film or television series circulated, but the Kurtzman estate was uninterested.

After "Comics Journal" co-owner Gary Groth discovered that Archie Comics had let the copyright on "Goodman Goes Playboy" expire, he had the story reprinted in "The Comics Journal" #262 (September 2004). It was also made available as a <a href="PDF">PDF</a> file on the magazine's website. The story has yet to appear in any reprint collection since the lapse of copyright.

United States</a>" (1919), "<a href="Whitney%20v.%20California">Whitney v. California</a>" (1927), "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Schwimmer">United States v. Schwimmer</a>" (1929), "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20Sullivan">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</a>" (1964), and "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States">New York Times Co. v. United States</a>" (1971).

The title of the book is drawn from the <a href="dissenting%20opinion">dissenting opinion</a> by <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court Associate Justice</a> <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a> in "United States v. Schwimmer". Holmes wrote that "if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate." Lewis warns the reader against the potential for government to take advantage of periods of fear and upheaval in a <a href="Post-9/11">post-9/11 society</a> to suppress freedom of speech and criticism by citizens.

The book was positively received by reviewers, including <a href="Jeffrey%20Rosen%20%28academic%29">Jeffrey Rosen</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Richard H. Fallon in "<a href="Harvard%20Magazine">Harvard Magazine</a>", <a href="Nat%20Hentoff">Nat Hentoff</a>, two <a href="National%20Book%20Critics%20Circle">National Book Critics Circle</a> members, and "<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>". <a href="Jeremy%20Waldron">Jeremy Waldron</a> commented on the work for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>" and criticized Lewis' stance towards freedom of speech with respect to hate speech. Waldron elaborated on this criticism in his book "The Harm in Hate Speech" (2012), in which he devoted a chapter to Lewis' book. This prompted a critical analysis of both works in "The New York Review of Books" in June 2012 by former Supreme Court Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>.

"Freedom for the Thought That We Hate" analyzes the value of freedom of speech and presents an overview of the historical development of rights afforded by the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. Its title derives from Justice Holmes' admonition, in his dissenting opinion in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Schwimmer">United States v. Schwimmer</a>" (1929), that the First Amendment's guarantees are most worthy of protection in times of fear and upheaval, when calls for suppression of dissent are most strident and superficially appealing. Holmes wrote that "if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought—not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate."

The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation that limits free speech or freedom of the press. The author analyzes the impact of this clause and refers to the writer of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, who believed that freedom of the press would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the <a href="Executive%20%28government%29">executive branch</a>. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.

In 1798, the federal government, under President <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>, passed the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, which deemed "any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States" a criminal act. The Alien and Sedition Acts were used for political impact against members of the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Republican Party</a> in order to punish them for criticizing the government. <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> was elected the next president in 1800; Lewis cites this as an example of the American public's dissatisfaction with Adams' actions against freedom of speech. After taking office in 1801, Jefferson issued pardons to those convicted under the Alien and Sedition Acts. Lewis interprets later historical events as affronts to freedom of speech, including the <a href="Sedition%20Act%20of%201918">Sedition Act of 1918</a>, which effectively outlawed criticism of the government's conduct of WW I; and the <a href="McCarran%20Internal%20Security%20Act">McCarran Internal Security Act</a> and <a href="Smith%20Act">Smith Act</a>, which were used to imprison American communists who were critical of the government during the <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthy</a> era.

During World War I, with increased fear among the American public and attempts at suppression of criticism by the government, the First Amendment was given wider examination in the U.S. Supreme Court. Lewis writes that <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justices</a> <a href="Louis%20Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a> and <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a>, began to interpret broader support for freedom of speech imparted by the First Amendment. Holmes wrote in the case of "<a href="Schenck%20v.%20United%20States">Schenck v. United States</a>" that freedom of speech must be defended except for situations in which "substantive evils" are caused through a "<a href="clear%20and%20present%20danger">clear and present danger</a>" arising from such speech. The author reflects on his view of speech in the face of imminent danger in an age of terrorism. He writes that the U.S. Constitution permits suppression of speech in situations of impending violence, and cautions use of the law to suppress expressive acts including burning a flag or using offensive slang terms. Lewis asserts that punitive measures can be taken against speech which incites terrorism to a group of people willing to commit such acts.

The book recounts an opinion written by Brandeis and joined by Holmes in the 1927 case of "<a href="Whitney%20v.%20California">Whitney v. California</a>" which further developed the notion of the power of the people to speak out. Brandeis and Holmes emphasized the value of liberty, and identified the most dangerous factor to freedom as an apathetic society averse to voicing their opinions in public.

In the 1964 Supreme Court case of "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20Sullivan">New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</a>", the court ruled that speech about issues of public impact should be unrestricted, vigorous and public, even if such discussion communicates extreme negative criticism of public servants and members of government. Lewis praises this decision, and writes that it laid the groundwork for a press more able to perform investigative journalism concerning controversies, including the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a> and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He cites the "New York Times Co. v. Sullivan" decision as an example of "Madisonian" philosophy towards freedom of speech espoused by James Madison. The author examines the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case of "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Co.%20v.%20United%20States">New York Times Co. v. United States</a>", and endorses the court's decision, which allowed the press to publish classified material relating to the Vietnam War.

The author questions the actions of the media with respect to privacy. He observes that public expectations regarding <a href="morality">morality</a> and what constitutes an impermissible violation of the right to privacy has changed over time. Lewis cites the dissenting opinion by Brandeis in "<a href="Olmstead%20v.%20United%20States">Olmstead v. United States</a>", which supported a right to privacy.

Lewis warns that, during periods of heightened anxiety, the free speech rights of Americans are at greater risk: "there will always be authorities who try to make their own lives more comfortable by suppressing critical comment." He concludes that the evolution of interpretation of the rights afforded by the First Amendment has created stronger support for freedom of speech.

The book's central theme is a warning that, in times of strife and increased fear, there is a danger of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>" wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a> and the <a href="Sedition%20Act%20of%201918">Sedition Act of 1918</a>, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.

"Freedom for the Thought That We Hate" discusses the capability and liberty of citizens to criticize their government. Lewis asserts that the U.S. has the most unreserved speech of any nation. Law professor <a href="Jeremy%20Waldron">Jeremy Waldron</a> gave the example of his ability to criticize the president or call the vice president and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> war criminals, without fear of retribution from law enforcement for such statements. The book contrasts present-day free speech liberties afforded to Americans and those possessed by citizens in earlier centuries. The author argues that the scope of civil liberties in the U.S. has increased over time owing to a desire for freedom among its people being held as an integral value. Lewis observes in contemporary application of the law, presidents are the subject of satire and denunciation. He notes that it is unlikely a vociferous critic would face a jail sentence simply for voicing such criticism.

"Freedom for the Thought That We Hate" was first published by <a href="Basic%20Books">Basic Books</a>, a member of the <a href="Perseus%20Books%20Group">Perseus Books Group</a>, in New York in 2007, with the subtitle, "A Biography of the First Amendment". For just the second printing, in both New York and London in 2008, the book's subtitle was simplified to "Tales of the First Amendment". That change was reverted for the remaining printings, including the paperback edition in 2009 and a large print edition in 2010. <a href="E-book">E-book</a> versions were released for the first, third and fourth printings; an <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> was released with the second printing, and re-released with the fourth. The book has also been translated into Chinese, and was published in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> in 2010.

The book was positively received by critics. <a href="Jeffrey%20Rosen%20%28academic%29">Jeffrey Rosen</a>, who reviewed the book for "The New York Times", was surprised by the author's departure from traditional civil libertarian views. Rosen pointed out that Lewis did not support absolute protection for journalists from breaking confidentiality with their <a href="Source%20%28journalism%29">anonymous sources</a>, even in situations involving criminal acts. <a href="Nat%20Hentoff">Nat Hentoff</a> called the book an engrossing and accessible survey of the First Amendment. "<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>" considered the book an excellent chronological account of the First Amendment, subsequent legislation, and <a href="precedent">case law</a>.

Richard H. Fallon reviewed the book for "<a href="Harvard%20Magazine">Harvard Magazine</a>", and characterized "Freedom for the Thought That We Hate" as a clear and captivating background education to U.S. freedom of speech legislation. Fallon praised the author's ability to weave descriptions of historical events into an entertaining account. <a href="Robyn%20Blumner">Robyn Blumner</a> of the "<a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" wrote that Lewis aptly summarized the development of the U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.

Writing for the "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>", Bill Williams stated that the book should be mandatory reading for high school and college students. Anne Phillips wrote in her review for "<a href="The%20News-Gazette%20%28Champaign-Urbana%29">The News-Gazette</a>" that the book is a concise and well-written description of the conflicts the country faces when grappling with the notions of freedom of expression, free speech, and freedom of the press. Writing for "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>", Chuck Leddy noted that the author helps readers understand the importance of freedom of speech in a democracy, especially during a period of military conflict when there is increased controversy over the appropriateness of dissent and open dialogue.

Jeremy Waldron reviewed the book for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Review%20of%20Books">The New York Review of Books</a>", and was critical of Lewis' broad stance towards freedom of speech with respect to <a href="hate%20speech">hate speech</a>. Waldron later elaborated this position in his 2012 book "The Harm in Hate Speech", in which he devoted an entire chapter to Lewis' book. Waldron emphasized that the problem with an expansive view of free speech is not the harm of hateful thoughts, but rather the negative impact resulting from widespread publication of the thoughts. He questioned whether children of racial groups criticized by widely published hate speech would be able to succeed in such an environment. Former U.S. Supreme Court Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> analyzed "The Harm in Hate Speech" and discussed "Freedom for the Thought That We Hate", in a review for "The New York Review of Books". Justice Stevens recounted Lewis' argument that an acceptance of hate speech is necessary, because attempts to regulate it would cause encroachment upon expression of controversial viewpoints. He pointed out that Lewis and Waldron agreed that Americans have more freedom of speech than citizens of any other country. In his review, Stevens cited the 2011 decision in "<a href="Snyder%20v.%20Phelps">Snyder v. Phelps</a>" as evidence that the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court supported the right of the people to express hateful views on matters of public importance. Stevens concluded that, although Waldron was unsuccessful in convincing him that legislators should ban all hate speech, "The Harm in Hate Speech" persuaded him that government leaders should refrain from using such language themselves.

On the Job (2013 film)

On the Job (abbreviated OTJ) is a 2013 Philippine <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> <a href="crime%20thriller">crime thriller</a> film directed by <a href="Erik%20Matti">Erik Matti</a>, who co-wrote it with <a href="Michiko%20Yamamoto%20%28screenwriter%29">Michiko Yamamoto</a>. Starring <a href="Gerald%20Anderson">Gerald Anderson</a>, <a href="Joel%20Torre">Joel Torre</a>, <a href="Joey%20Marquez">Joey Marquez</a> and <a href="Piolo%20Pascual">Piolo Pascual</a>, it tells the story of two <a href="contract%20killing">hit-man</a> prisoners (Anderson and Torre) who are temporarily freed to carry out political executions, and two law enforcers (Marquez and Pascual) tasked with investigating the drug-related murder case connected to the prison gun-for-hire business. The film also features <a href="Angel%20Aquino">Angel Aquino</a>, <a href="Shaina%20Magdayao">Shaina Magdayao</a>, <a href="Empress%20Schuck">Empress Schuck</a>, <a href="Leo%20Martinez">Leo Martinez</a>, <a href="Michael%20de%20Mesa">Michael de Mesa</a>, <a href="Vivian%20Velez">Vivian Velez</a>, and <a href="Rayver%20Cruz">Rayver Cruz</a>.

The inspiration for "On the Job" came from a <a href="Viva%20Films">Viva Films</a> crew member who claimed to have been temporarily released from prison to commit contract killings before he was reincarcerated. <a href="Star%20Cinema">Star Cinema</a> initially refused to produce the film in 2010, deeming it too violent compared with their usual <a href="romantic%20comedy">romantic-comedy</a> projects; by 2012, however, they agreed to co-produce it with <a href="Reality%20Entertainment">Reality Entertainment</a> (Matti's independent film company). Filming took place in <a href="Manila">Manila</a> and lasted 33 days, on a production budget of <a href="Philippine%20peso">₱</a>47 million (about US$1.1 million).

"On the Job" was shown as part of the <a href="Directors%27%20Fortnight">Directors' Fortnight</a> at the <a href="2013%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2013 Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 24, where it was praised and received a <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a>. The film was released in the Philippines on August 28, 2013, and in the United States and Canada on September 27 of that year. It received good reviews from foreign and domestic critics. The film's sequel, "<a href="On%20the%20Job%202">On the Job 2</a>", is scheduled to be released on June 12, 2019.

In a <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> rife with violence, corruption and poverty, <a href="Contract%20killing">hitmen</a> Mario and Daniel are prisoners who are frequently released and paid to commit contract killings for their boss, Thelma. Mario spends his earnings on his daughter's law-school tuition and on his estranged wife, Lulette. Daniel (the younger and more-reckless partner) sends <a href="remittance">remittance</a>s to his family and spends the rest on goods and privileges in prison; he has come to see Mario as a mentor and <a href="father%20figure">father figure</a>. After they murder <a href="drug%20lord">drug lord</a> Tiu and return to prison, Tiu's murder case is assigned to <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20%28Philippines%29">NBI</a> Agent Francis Coronel through Congressman Manrique (the agent's father-in-law). Coronel's father, also a police officer, died amid rumors of corruption. When Coronel and his partner, Bernabe, arrive at the local precinct they clash with <a href="Philippine%20National%20Police">PNP</a> Officer Joaquin Acosta, who believes that the case was taken from him for political reasons.

Mario and Daniel carry out a hit on a woman named Linda, whose husband Pol seeks help from Acosta, his former colleague on the force. Pol reveals that Tiu's murder is one of several assassinations ordered by Manrique's close friend General Pacheco, a military officer campaigning for the <a href="Senate%20of%20the%20Philippines">Philippine Senate</a>. Pacheco runs a gun-for-hire operation using prisoners, and kills others involved in the business to protect his campaign. Acosta agrees to protect Pol, and heads to the station; along the way, though, he crosses paths with Coronel and Bernabe. Daniel shoots Pol in the meantime, but his pistol <a href="Firearm%20malfunction">jams</a> before he can fire a fatal shot. The three officers converge on them, forcing Daniel and Mario to flee. At a hospital, Daniel shoots the janitor to create a diversion so Mario can kill the comatose Pol. They split up to escape; Coronel and Bernabe chase Daniel, and Acosta pursues Mario. During the chase Bernabe is shot, and Acosta catches a glimpse of Mario's face.

Coronel confronts Manrique during a campaign meeting, telling him that he intends to arrest Pacheco. Manrique warns Coronel that Pacheco's indictment will cause their downfall; he considers Pacheco his last resort after having exhausted all his other options to remain affluent. Before pursuing politics, Manrique was a client of Pacheco's business twice. Acosta relays Mario's <a href="facial%20composite">composite sketch</a> to the police to be broadcast on television. Coronel decides to work with Acosta, who tells him that his father was not corrupt; on the contrary, he was killed trying to expose corruption. Acosta was also demoted for working to weed out corruption. When Coronel discovers Mario's identity, he visits Lulette and sees her cavorting with Mario's friend Boy. Coronel (whose interrogation of Lulette is unsuccessful) tells Acosta about the affair, and Acosta uses it as leverage when he interrogates Mario. Although Acosta is unsuccessful, Mario later expresses to Daniel his sense of betrayal by his family's abandonment. 

Tiu's father tells Acosta and Coronel that he can give them the evidence they need to arrest Pacheco. Coronel leaves Acosta along the way to visit Pacheco, who admitted killing Coronel's father "to save the country, literally". Coronel uses his cellphone to <a href="Espionage">secretly record</a> a conversation between Pacheco and his men about the murder of Tiu's father.

Coronel's wife Nicky is angry with his intention to take down Pacheco, and incriminates Manrique. Daniel kills Coronel in front of police headquarters for his next hit. The enraged Acosta attacks Pacheco and Manrique's security detail and, after a brief shootout, Pacheco orders them to hold their fire. Mario realizes on the day of his parole that he has no reason to leave, since his family no longer wants anything to do with him. Saddened, he stabs Daniel to death to remain incarcerated. Coronel's death is mourned by many (including Nicky), and Acosta is summarily dismissed. After attending Daniel's wake from afar, Mario goes home, kills Boy in front of his family and returns to prison. Sometime later, a recovered Bernabe looks through Coronel's possessions and requisitions the phone Coronel used against Pacheco as evidence.


Director <a href="Erik%20Matti">Erik Matti</a> was inspired by a <a href="Viva%20Films">Viva Films</a> <a href="chauffeur">service driver</a>, an ex-convict who said that he used to be temporarily freed from prison to commit contract killings and reincarcerated. Matti shelved his idea until he ended his hiatus from directing with "The Arrival", a <a href="short%20film">short film</a> he released to positive response at several <a href="film%20festival">film festival</a>s in 2009. He opened the screenings with an eight-minute trailer for "On the Job", with <a href="Joel%20Torre">Joel Torre</a> attempting to <a href="pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitch</a> the film. The trailer also had a favorable response, particularly from <a href="Twitch%20Film">Twitch Film</a> editor Todd Brown, who asked if the project had entered production. When Matti told him that the film did not yet have a screenplay, Brown encouraged him to write it while he looked for financing. During the script's ninth revision, screenwriter <a href="Michiko%20Yamamoto%20%28screenwriter%29">Michiko Yamamoto</a> helped finalize the remainder of the draft. Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details of the story.

During the writing process and after the final draft was complete, Brown was unable to attract investors; some felt that the story was too nontraditional for Philippine cinema or too large a risk for the overseas market. <a href="Star%20Cinema">Star Cinema</a> (the Philippines' largest production company) refused to make the film in 2010, deeming it too violent compared with their usual romantic-comedy projects. Matti offered the project to two of Star Cinema's talents, who also declined due to the film's violence. The project was again put on hold as Matti entered the <a href="post-production">post-production</a> stage of his <a href="horror%20fantasy">horror fantasy</a> film, "" (2012). He was then contacted by a Star Cinema agent, who requested the revised script; three days later, the studio agreed to fund the film.

<a href="Reality%20Entertainment">Reality Entertainment</a>, an <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a> company co-founded by Matti, co-produced "On the Job" with Star Cinema. Reality Entertainment co-founder Dondon Monteverde, <a href="Lily%20Monteverde">Lily Monteverde</a>'s son, said that many studios were impressed by the script but were reluctant to finance a big-budget <a href="action%20film">action film</a>. Although the production team considered cutting the film's budget, they decided against it in the hope of shifting away from <a href="low-budget%20film">low-budget film</a>s. Monteverde remembered arguing that it was "really time to do something big-budget and showcase it, rather than making something small and claiming budgetary restrictions. This time we didn't give ourselves any excuses. We went all the way". The film's production cost <a href="Philippine%20peso">₱</a>47 million (about <a href="United%20States%20Dollar">US$</a>1.1 million in 2013).

Joel Torre, who plays Mario "Tatang" Maghari in the film, had already been cast before Matti's script revision. Torre said about the role, "[Mario] stuck with me, fought for me. And that gave me a lot of confidence, a Bushido Blade samurai." Matti asked <a href="Piolo%20Pascual">Piolo Pascual</a> to play attorney Francis Coronel Jr. The role of Daniel was originally written for <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Cruz">John Lloyd Cruz</a>, who was interested but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts; it went instead to <a href="Gerald%20Anderson">Gerald Anderson</a>. After a discussion between Pascual and Anderson about the film, Anderson signed for the role. He had only two weeks to film his scenes, since he was involved with a <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> shoot at the time. The role of Sergeant Joaquin Acosta was to be played by <a href="Richard%20Gomez">Richard Gomez</a>, but he decided to pursue a political career in <a href="Ormoc">Ormoc</a>. Matti later cast <a href="Joey%20Marquez">Joey Marquez</a>; although Marquez was seen primarily as a comedian, the director believed that he could play a charming, obnoxious character.

Richard V. Somes was the film's <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a> and <a href="stage%20combat">action choreographer</a>. To prepare for the prison scenes, the production crew built a set in an abandoned building in <a href="Marikina">Marikina</a> and hired 200 <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extras</a> to play convicts. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took 33 days on location in a number of <a href="Manila">Manila</a> areas, including <a href="Manila%20City%20Hall">City Hall</a>, a <a href="Manila%20Light%20Rail%20Transit%20System">Light Rail</a> train station, and <a href="Caloocan">Caloocan</a>. The opening scenes were shot during the annual <a href="Basaan%20Festival">Basaan Festival</a> in <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Metro%20Manila">San Juan</a>. Filming was done in over 70 locations, and the crew sometimes shot in several areas on a given day. On choosing Manila as the film's key location, Matti said:

Francis Ricardo Buhay III, who had also worked on Matti's "Tiktik" and "Rigodon" (2013), was the film's <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a>. Rather than setting up and changing lights for certain shots, Buhay filmed with the <a href="Red%20Digital%20Cinema">Red</a> EPIC camera; with the Red EPIC's available-lighting function (including the ability to light an entire set), the film had a <a href="neo-noir">modern noir</a> style without appearing low-budget.

Erwin Romulo, editor-in-chief of the Philippine edition of "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" until 2013, was "On the Job" musical director. At their first meeting, Matti hired Romulo as the <a href="music%20supervisor">music supervisor</a>; Romulo's role changed, however, since he wanted to produce most of the tracks he had planned for the film. Romulo used lesser-known <a href="Music%20of%20the%20Philippines%23Original%20Pilipino%20music">original Pilipino music</a> tracks from otherwise-prominent Filipino musicians, such as "Maskara" and "Pinoy Blues" by the <a href="Juan%20de%20la%20Cruz%20Band">Juan de la Cruz Band</a>. He approached <a href="Dong%20Abay">Dong Abay</a> and <a href="Radioactive%20Sago%20Project">Radioactive Sago Project</a> bassist Francis de Veyra to perform the songs, which were arranged by <a href="Armi%20Millare">Armi Millare</a>. Additional tracks were performed by <a href="Ely%20Buendia">Ely Buendia</a>, the late <a href="FrancisM">FrancisM</a>, and local band Bent Lynchpin. Bent Lynchpin member Fred Sandoval was also the film's <a href="Music%20editor%20%28filmmaking%29">music editor</a>.

Romulo cited works by <a href="Lalo%20Schifrin">Lalo Schifrin</a> and director <a href="Ishmael%20Bernal">Ishmael Bernal</a>'s longtime composer, Vanishing Tribe, as influences on the soundtrack. He also considered <a href="DJ%20Shadow">DJ Shadow</a>'s album "<a href="Endtroducing...">Endtroducing...</a>" a significant influence, "albeit unconsciously".

"On the Job" had its world premiere in the <a href="Directors%27%20Fortnight">Directors' Fortnight</a> section of the <a href="2013%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2013 Cannes Film Festival</a> on May 24. Although it did not win the <a href="Cam%C3%A9ra%20d%27Or">Caméra d'Or</a> prize, it received a two-minute standing ovation from the audience. The film had its Philippine release on August 28, 2013, and grossed at the box office in three weeks.

It was released in North America by Well Go USA Entertainment on September 27, 2013. Well Go USA had bought the North American rights for the film before its premiere at Cannes, and also acquired its <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a>, and <a href="video%20on%20demand">video on demand</a> distribution rights. The agreement was made by Well Go USA president Doris Pfardrescher and <a href="XYZ%20Films">XYZ Films</a> founders Nate Bolotin and Aram Tertzakian. "On the Job" played at 29 North American theaters in three weeks, grossing $164,620. It was released in France by Wild Side Films, and in Australia by <a href="Madman%20Entertainment">Madman Entertainment</a>. The deals with the French and North American distribution companies secured $350,000 (). The film was also made available on the North American market through <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> by Well Go USA.

It was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Well Go USA on February 18, 2014. Special features include <a href="making-of">making-of</a> footage and <a href="deleted%20scene">deleted scene</a>s. Justin Remer of <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> praised the Blu-ray's video and audio transfers, generally criticizing its special features. Kevin Yeoman of "High-Def Digest" and Jeffrey Kauffman of "Blu-ray.com" rated the release 3.5 out of 5, and agreed about the transfers and special features. "On the Job" amassed $167,128 in North American video sales.

"On the Job" received good reviews from critics; according to an <a href="ABS-CBN">ABS-CBN</a> reviewer, it "certainly brought back the action to Philippine cinema in more ways than one". Several critics praised the cast, with their performances called "well-acted" and "top-notch". Mikhail Lecaros praised the lead actors' "parallel depiction of the relationship between fathers and sons" in <a href="GMA%20News">GMA News</a>; according to <a href="Philippine%20Entertainment%20Portal">Philippine Entertainment Portal</a>'s Mari-An Santos, they "provide the heart of the story". In "Variety", <a href="Justin%20Chang">Justin Chang</a> praised Torre's departure from his usual "good-guy persona with a superbly menacing but very human performance". Santos said that Pascual "holds his own, but with a consistently excellent ensemble, his acting pales in comparison"; according to Lecaros, he "acquits himself well as a law enforcer whose crises of faith would be right at home in a <a href="Johnnie%20To">Johnnie To</a> ("<a href="Election%20%282005%20film%29">Election</a>", "<a href="Breaking%20News%20%282004%20film%29">Breaking News</a>") or <a href="Michael%20Mann">Michael Mann</a> ("<a href="Collateral%20%28film%29">Collateral</a>", "<a href="Miami%20Vice%20%28film%29">Miami Vice</a>") film." Although Santos praised the female roles, "Film Business Asia" <a href="Derek%20Elley">Derek Elley</a> called them "minimal and not especially memorable"; a "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" magazine reviewer called them "essentially talking props, which lessens the impact of developments".

Critics praised the film as engaging and well-made, but considered its plot convoluted. Neil Young, in "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>", found Matti and Yamamoto's script conventional and "many of the dialogue scenes operat[ing] on a functionally prosaic level". Lecaros and Santos praised the script, which Lecaros said "puts traditional notions of right, wrong, family, and loyalty through the wringer—and then some!" Although the <a href="police%20procedural">police procedural</a> subplot was described as "particularly colorful" by <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>, "The A.V. Club" <a href="Ignatiy%20Vishnevetsky">Ignatiy Vishnevetsky</a> called it dull and "occasionally heavy-handed". Young said that Matti's "muscular handling of fast-paced action sequences consistently impresses", and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Jeannette Catsoulis wrote that his "pitiless view of Filipino society may be deadening, but his filming is wondrously alive". Catsoulis made "On the Job" her "critic's pick", and <a href="Rappler">Rappler</a> Carljoe Javier said it "serves as a shot of adrenaline, not only to the hearts of [Filipino] viewers, but hopefully also to mainstream [Philippine] cinema".

The review-aggregation website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gives the film a score of 93 percent (based on 14 reviews) and a weighted average of 6.48 out of 10. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> it has a score of 70 out of 100 (based on 11 reviews), indicating "generally favorable reviews". In the Philippines, members of the <a href="Cinema%20Evaluation%20Board">Cinema Evaluation Board</a> gave the film an "A" grade.

In addition to being featured at the Cannes Film Festival, "On the Job" was screened at the 17th <a href="Puchon%20International%20Fantastic%20Film%20Festival">Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival</a> in <a href="Bucheon">Bucheon</a>, <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>. Joel Torre won the Best Actor award, and the film received the Jury Prize. At the <a href="2014%20FAMAS%20Awards">62nd FAMAS Awards</a>, the film won six of its twelve nominations: <a href="FAMAS%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a href="FAMAS%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> (Matti), Best Screenplay (Matti and Michiko Yamamoto), Best Editing (Jay Halili), Best Story (Matti), and Best Sound (Corinne de San Jose). <a href="Piolo%20Pascual">Piolo Pascual</a> also received the <a href="Fernando%20Poe%20Jr.%20Memorial%20Award%20for%20Excellence">Fernando Poe Jr. Memorial Award for Excellence</a> for his performance. The film received eight nominations at the <a href="37th%20Gawad%20Urian%20Awards">37th Gawad Urian Awards</a>, winning two: <a href="Gawad%20Urian%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> (Torre) and Best Sound (de San Jose).

"<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" reported in December 2018 that filming had begun for "<a href="On%20the%20Job%202">On the Job 2</a>", which is scheduled to be released on June 12, 2019. According to Matti, the sequel would be followed by a five-part miniseries.

An American version of the film was confirmed in June 2013, which would be directed by Icelandic filmmaker <a href="Baltasar%20Korm%C3%A1kur">Baltasar Kormákur</a> and produced by Kormákur's <a href="Blueeyes%20Productions">Blueeyes Productions</a>. <a href="XYZ%20Films">XYZ Films</a>, the production and sales company holding the international rights, will co-produce the film and release it worldwide.

Rochdale Cenotaph

Rochdale Cenotaph is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> on the <a href="Esplanade">Esplanade</a> in <a href="Rochdale">Rochdale</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, in the north west of England. Designed by <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, it is one of seven memorials in England based on his <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London and one of his more ambitious designs. The memorial was unveiled in 1922 and consists of a raised platform bearing Lutyens' characteristic <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> next to a pylon topped by an effigy of a recumbent soldier. A set of painted stone flags surrounds the pylon.

A public meeting in February 1919 established a consensus to create a monument and a fund for the families of wounded servicemen. The meeting agreed to commission Lutyens to design the monument. His design for a bridge over the <a href="River%20Roch">River Roch</a> was abandoned after a local dignitary purchased a plot of land adjacent to <a href="Rochdale%20Town%20Hall">Rochdale Town Hall</a> and donated it for the site of the memorial. Lutyens revised his design, and <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby</a>, unveiled the memorial on 26 November 1922. It is a Grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed structure</a>, having been upgraded in 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Almost all towns and cities erected some form of memorial to commemorate their fallen. The mayor of Rochdale called a public meeting on 10 February 1919, three months after the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">armistice</a>, to discuss proposals for the town's commemorations. Consensus was that the town should have a monument and a fund to provide for wounded servicemen, their families, and the families of the 2,000 war dead from Rochdale. Public subscription raised <a href="%C2%A3sd">£</a>29,443 10<a href="%C2%A3sd">s</a>, covering the £12,611 cost of the memorial.

The public meeting in February 1919 agreed to appoint <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> as architect for the project. He was one of the most prominent designers of war memorials in Britain, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Before the war, Lutyens established a reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy patrons, but the war had a profound effect on him. From 1917 onwards, he dedicated much of his time to memorialising the casualties. He went on to design <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations and subsequently the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a> on <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">the Somme</a> in France and many other memorials in Britain and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">the Commonwealth</a>.

Lutyens proposed a memorial bridge crossing the <a href="River%20Roch">River Roch</a> in front of <a href="Rochdale%20Town%20Hall">Rochdale Town Hall</a>. At that time the river flowed openly through the town centre but has since been <a href="culvert">culvert</a>ed. On either side of the bridge would have been <a href="Tomb%20effigy">recumbent effigies</a> of a soldier lying on a <a href="bier">bier</a> and a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> on the bridge. The plan was abandoned when Alderman William Cunliffe, a former mayor, bought a dilapidated 18th-century house (known as "the Manor House" or "the Orchard") on the opposite side of the river and donated the site for the war memorial. The site had particular poignancy as the building had been used as a recruiting station during the war. Lutyens' new design involved demolishing the Manor House to make way for a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> and a Stone of Remembrance. Lutyens designed the stone for use in <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries but it also features in several of his war memorials. Rochdale's cenotaph is among seven others by Lutyens in England based on the one in Whitehall, and is among the most ambitious of his designs to come to fruition.

The memorial was constructed by Hobson Limited of Nottingham. While many First World War memorials feature sculpture or overt religious symbolism, Rochdale's, like many of Lutyens' memorials, uses abstract and ecumenical shapes inspired by <a href="classical%20architecture">classical architecture</a>. It comprises two elements: a <a href="Pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a> and a Stone of Remembrance formed from light grey Cornish <a href="granite">granite</a> which are raised on a platform (<a href="stylobate">stylobate</a>) of three steps. The cenotaph is raised on six steps on the platform, and rises in diminishing tiers of broadly rectangular cross section, with its long axis oriented southeast to northwest. On the plain first tier are four carved and painted stone flags with gilt bronze poles, two to either side: the <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> and the <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> on the southwest side, and the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Ensign">Royal Air Force Ensign</a> and the <a href="Red%20Ensign">Red Ensign</a> on the northeast. The flags flank a second, smaller, tier which has a semi-column at either end and which culminates in a smaller plinth supporting a <a href="catafalque">catafalque</a>. At the top is a sculpture of a recumbent soldier draped with his coat. The design for the pylon is based on Lutyens' <a href="Midland%20Railway%20War%20Memorial">Midland Railway War Memorial</a>, unveiled in <a href="Derby">Derby</a> in 1921. Painted stone flags are a recurring feature in Lutyens' war memorial designs. He first proposed them for Whitehall's Cenotaph, where they were rejected in favour of fabric flags, but they appear on several of his other memorials including <a href="Northampton%20War%20Memorial">Northampton War Memorial</a> and <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>'s <a href="Arch%20of%20Remembrance">Arch of Remembrance</a>.

The memorial is not strictly a cenotaph as the sculpture at the top is a human figure rather than an empty tomb. By raising the figure above the ground on the pylon, Lutyens gives him anonymity, representing the fallen while allowing onlookers to impart their own emotions onto the memorial. By placing the figure at the top of the pylon, Lutyens also draws attention to the detail at the top of the pylon, connecting the beauty of the design to the memory of the fallen soldier. To either side of the plinth, above the flags, carved wreaths surround Rochdale's coat of arms. The central part of the structure is inscribed in gold lettering: and —a quotation from the <a href="First%20Book%20of%20Samuel">First Book of Samuel</a>, chapter 25, verse 16, selected from suggestions made by readers of the "Rochdale Observer".

The Stone of Remembrance lies to the southeast between the cenotaph and the town hall, raised above the platform by three steps. It is inscribed: . Other inscriptions commemorating the dead of the Second World War were added later, including a bronze plaque reading . The use of a cenotaph with a Stone of Remembrance at its feet is reminiscent of <a href="Southampton%20Cenotaph">Southampton Cenotaph</a>, Lutyens' first to come to fruition. The surrounding memorial gardens are dedicated to the members of the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Fusiliers">Royal Regiment of Fusiliers</a> and serve as Rochdale's memorial to the Second World War.

<a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby</a>, unveiled the memorial on Sunday 26 November 1922 and the <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Rochdale">Archdeacon of Rochdale</a> gave a dedication. Derby was a descendant of a Lancashire family involved in local politics for generations. He served in various public offices during the First World War, including Director General of Recruiting and Secretary of State for War, before being appointed Britain's ambassador to France at the end of the war. Two years after unveiling the Rochdale memorial, Lord Derby presided over the unveiling of <a href="Manchester%20Cenotaph">Manchester Cenotaph</a>, another Lutyens design.

Rochdale Cenotaph was designated as a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 12 February 1985, the designation noting the cenotaph's visual relationship with Rochdale Town Hall, Rochdale Post Office, and a set of lamp posts (each of which are listed in their own right). The status offers legal protection from demolition or modification; Grade II is applied to structures of "special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them", about 92 per cent of listed buildings. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a "national collection". All his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> entries were updated and expanded. As a result, Rochdale Cenotaph was upgraded to Grade I, which is applied to around 2.5% of listed buildings, those of "the greatest historic interest".

Spanish conquest of Petén

The Spanish conquest of Petén was the last stage of the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Guatemala">conquest of Guatemala</a>, a prolonged conflict during the <a href="Spanish%20colonisation%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish colonisation of the Americas</a>. A wide lowland plain covered with dense rainforest, Petén contains a central drainage basin with a series of lakes and areas of savannah. It is crossed by several ranges of low <a href="karst">karst</a>ic hills and rises to the south as it nears the <a href="Guatemalan%20Highlands">Guatemalan Highlands</a>. The conquest of <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">Petén</a>, a region now incorporated into the modern republic of <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, climaxed in 1697 with the capture of <a href="Nojpet%C3%A9n">Nojpetén</a>, the island capital of the <a href="Itza%20people">Itza</a> kingdom, by <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Urs%C3%BAa">Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi</a>. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> fell to European colonisers.

Sizeable <a href="Maya%20peoples">Maya</a> populations existed in Petén before the conquest, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Petén was divided into different Maya polities engaged in a complex web of alliances and enmities. The most important groups around the central lakes were the Itza, the <a href="Yalain">Yalain</a> and the <a href="Kowoj">Kowoj</a>. Other groups with territories in Petén included the <a href="Kejache">Kejache</a>, the <a href="Acala%20Ch%CA%BCol">Acala</a>, the <a href="Lakandon%20Ch%CA%BCol">Lakandon Chʼol</a>, the Xocmo, the <a href="Chinamita">Chinamita</a>, the Icaiche and the <a href="Manche%20Ch%CA%BCol">Manche Chʼol</a>.

Petén was first penetrated by <a href="Hern%C3%A1n%20Cort%C3%A9s">Hernán Cortés</a> with a sizeable expedition that crossed the territory from north to south in 1525. In the first half of the 16th century, Spain established neighbouring colonies in <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Yucatán</a> to the north and Guatemala to the south. Spanish missionaries laid the groundwork for the extension of colonial administration in the extreme south of Petén from 1596 onwards, but no further Spanish entry of central Petén took place until 1618 and 1619 when missionaries arrived at the Itza capital, having travelled from the Spanish town of <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Mérida</a> in Yucatán.

In 1622 a military expedition set out from Yucatán led by Captain Francisco de Mirones and accompanied by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado; this expedition was a disaster, and the Spanish were massacred by the Itza. In 1628 the Manche Chʼol of the south were placed under the administration of the colonial governor of Verapaz within the <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Guatemala">Captaincy General of Guatemala</a>. The Manche Chʼol unsuccessfully rebelled against Spanish control in 1633. In 1695 a military expedition tried to reach Lake Petén Itzá from Guatemala; this was followed in 1696 by missionaries from Mérida and in 1697 by Martín de Ursúa's expedition from Yucatán that resulted in the final defeat of the independent kingdoms of central Petén and their incorporation into the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a>.
The modern <a href="Departments%20of%20Guatemala">department</a> of <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Department">Petén</a> is located in northern Guatemala. It is bordered on the west by the Mexican state of <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>; this border largely follows the course of the <a href="Usumacinta%20River">Usumacinta River</a>. On the north side Petén is bordered by the Mexican state of <a href="Campeche">Campeche</a> and on the northwest by the Mexican state of <a href="Tabasco">Tabasco</a>; Petén is bordered on the east by <a href="Belize">Belize</a> and on the south side by the Guatemalan departments of <a href="Alta%20Verapaz%20Department">Alta Verapaz</a> and <a href="Izabal%20Department">Izabal</a>.

The Petén lowlands are formed by a densely forested low-lying <a href="limestone">limestone</a> plain featuring <a href="karst">karst</a>ic topography. The area is crossed by low east–west oriented ridges of <a href="Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a> limestone and is characterised by a variety of forest and soil types; water sources include generally small rivers and low-lying seasonal swamps known as "bajos". A chain of fourteen lakes runs across the <a href="Pet%C3%A9n%20Basin">central drainage basin</a> of Petén; during the <a href="rainy%20season">rainy season</a> some of these lakes become interconnected. This <a href="drainage%20area">drainage area</a> measures approximately east–west by north–south. The largest lake is <a href="Lake%20Pet%C3%A9n%20Itz%C3%A1">Lake Petén Itzá</a>, near the centre of the drainage basin; it measures . A broad <a href="savanna">savanna</a>h extends south of the central lakes; it has an average altitude of <a href="above%20mean%20sea%20level">above mean sea level</a> with karstic ridges reaching an average altitude of . The savannah features a compact red clay soil that is too poor to support heavy cultivation, which resulted in a relatively low level of <a href="pre-Columbian%20era">pre-Columbian</a> occupation. It is surrounded by hills with unusually steep southern slopes and gentler northern approaches; the hills are covered with dense tropical forest. To the north of the lakes region "bajos" become more frequent, interspersed with forest. In the far north of Petén the <a href="Mirador%20Basin">Mirador Basin</a> forms another interior drainage region. To the south Petén reaches an altitude of approximately as it rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands and meets <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> metamorphic rocks.

The climate of Petén is divided into <a href="wet%20season">wet</a> and <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>s, with the rainy season lasting from June to December, although these seasons are not clearly defined in the south. The climate varies from <a href="tropical%20climate">tropical</a> in the south to <a href="subtropics">semitropical</a> in the north; temperature varies between , although it does not usually drop beneath . Mean temperature varies from in the southeast around <a href="Popt%C3%BAn">Poptún</a> to around <a href="Uaxact%C3%BAn">Uaxactún</a> in the northeast. Highest temperatures are reached from April to June, and January is the coldest month; all Petén experiences a hot dry period in late August. Annual precipitation is high, varying from a mean of in the northeast to in central Petén around <a href="Flores%2C%20El%20Pet%C3%A9n">Flores</a> (Nojpetén). The extreme southeast of Petén experiences the largest variations in temperature and rainfall, with precipitation reaching as much as in a year.

The first large <a href="Maya%20city">Maya cities</a> developed in Petén as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 600–350 BC), and Petén formed the heartland of the ancient <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya civilization</a> during the <a href="Classic%20period">Classic period</a> (c. AD 250–900). The great cities that dominated Petén had fallen into ruin by the beginning of the 10th century AD with the onset of the <a href="Classic%20Maya%20collapse">Classic Maya collapse</a>. A significant Maya presence remained into the <a href="Postclassic%20period">Postclassic period</a> after the abandonment of the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources.
Although there is insufficient data to accurately estimate population sizes at the time of contact with the Spanish, early Spanish reports suggest that sizeable Maya populations existed in Petén, particularly around the central lakes and along the rivers. Before their defeat in 1697 the Itza controlled or influenced much of Petén and parts of Belize. The Itza were warlike, and their martial prowess impressed both neighbouring Maya kingdoms and their Spanish enemies. Their capital was Nojpetén, an island city upon <a href="Lake%20Pet%C3%A9n%20Itz%C3%A1">Lake Petén Itzá</a>; it has developed into the modern town of Flores, which is the capital of the Petén department of Guatemala. The Itza spoke a variety of <a href="Yucatecan%20languages">Yucatecan Maya</a>.

The <a href="Kowoj">Kowoj</a> were the second in importance, and they were hostile towards their Itza neighbours. The Kowoj were located to the east of the Itza, around the eastern lakes: Lake Salpetén, Lake Macanché, <a href="Lake%20Yaxh%C3%A1">Lake Yaxhá</a> and Lake Sacnab. Other groups are less well known, and their precise territorial extent and political makeup remains obscure; among them were the Chinamita, the Kejache, the Icaiche, the Lakandon <a href="Ch%CA%BCol%20people">Chʼol</a>, the <a href="Mopan%20people">Mopan</a>, the Manche Chʼol and the Yalain.

The Yalain appear to have been one of the three dominant polities in Postclassic central Petén, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj. The Yalain territory had its maximum extension from the east shore of Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj in Belize. In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name on the north shore of <a href="Lake%20Macanch%C3%A9">Lake Macanché</a>. At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups. In the late 17th century Spanish colonial records document hostilities between Maya groups in the lakes region, with the incursion of the Kowoj into former Yalain sites including <a href="Zacpeten">Zacpeten</a> on Lake Macanché and <a href="Ixlu">Ixlu</a> on <a href="Lake%20Salpet%C3%A9n">Lake Salpetén</a>.

The Kejache occupied a territory to the north of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of them was <a href="Acalan">Acalan</a>, inhabited by a <a href="Chontal%20Maya%20language">Chontal Maya</a>-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The <a href="Ch%CA%BColan%20languages">Chʼolan Maya</a>-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation among the Spanish. The Xocmo were another Chʼolan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest somewhere to the east of the Lakandon. Never conquered, the Xocmo escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them and their eventual fate is unknown; they may be ancestors of the modern <a href="Lacandon%20people">Lacandon people</a>. The Manche Chʼol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Petén department. The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Petén. The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.

<a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> discovered the Americas for the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile%20and%20Le%C3%B3n">Kingdom of Castile and León</a> in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> and established a centre of operations on the island of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of <a href="Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlan</a> had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a>. The newly conquered territory became <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>, headed by a <a href="List%20of%20viceroys%20of%20New%20Spain">viceroy</a> who answered to the Spanish Crown via the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20Indies">Council of the Indies</a>. Cortés despatched <a href="Pedro%20de%20Alvarado">Pedro de Alvarado</a> with an army to conquer the <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n kingdoms of the Guatemalan <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20de%20Chiapas">Sierra Madre</a> and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at <a href="Santiago%20de%20los%20Caballeros%20de%20Guatemala">Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala</a> and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>, <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated.

A single soldier arriving in Mexico in 1520 was carrying <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and thus initiated the devastating plagues that swept through the native populations of the Americas. The European diseases that ravaged the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas also severely affected the various Maya groups of Petén. It is estimated that there were approximately 30,000 Chʼol and <a href="Ch%CA%BColti%CA%BC%20language">Chʼoltiʼ</a> Maya in western Petén at the start of the 16th century. Between 1559 and 1721 they were devastated by a combination of disease, war and enforced relocations.

When Nojpetén fell in 1696 there were approximately 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a considerable number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of the inhabitants died during the first decade of colonial rule because of disease and war. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, internecine warfare between rival Maya groups and Spanish expeditions also took their toll.

Conquistadors often wore steel armour that included chainmail and helmets. The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the <a href="Ichcahuipilli">quilted cotton armour</a> of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour. Maya weaponry was not sufficiently powerful to justify the discomfort of wearing European armour. Quilted cotton armour, although still uncomfortably hot, was flexible and weighed much less. The Maya armour was adapted by the Spanish, who used knee-length quilted cotton tunics and Spanish-style caps. Horsemen wore long quilted cotton leg protectors; their horses were also protected with padded cotton armour. After the final push to the Petén lakes in early 1697, the Spanish recorded that they left with their garrison over 50 Dutch- and French-made <a href="musket">musket</a>s, three calibre light <a href="History%20of%20cannon">cannons</a> ("piezas") cast from iron and mounted on carriages, four iron and two bronze "<a href="Bombard%20%28weapon%29">pedreros</a>" (2-chambered stone-launchers) and six of at least eight bronze light cannons (known as "esmiriles").

The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, <a href="Fire%20hardening">fire-sharpened</a> poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as "hadzab" that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset <a href="Obsidian%20use%20in%20Mesoamerica">obsidian</a>; these were similar to the Aztec "<a href="macuahuitl">macuahuitl</a>". They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree ("<a href="Apoplanesia">Apoplanesia</a> paniculata") called "chulul" by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were described as almost as high as a man and were made from the same "chulul" wood as the "hadzab", with the bowstring fashioned from <a href="henequen">henequen</a> fibre; the bow was called a "chuhul". Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers. In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a "chulul"-wood handle, they were about long. Maya spears were referred to as "nabte"; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were a similar size as those used by the Spanish.

Distinguished Maya warriors entered battle wearing armour. The upper body was covered by a short jacket that was filled with rock salt, and the forearms and legs were protected with tight bindings of cloth or leather. The salt-packed cotton armour was tough enough that even arrows could not penetrate it. Armour could be decorated and was often adorned with feathers. Commoners did not wear armour in battle, usually only wearing a loincloth and warpaint. Warriors carried shields made from two right-angled wooden bars with deerskin stretched across them.
The Spanish were aware that the Itza Maya had become the centre of anti-Spanish resistance and engaged in a policy of encircling their kingdom and cutting their <a href="Trade%20in%20Maya%20civilization">trade routes</a> over the course of almost two hundred years. The Itza resisted this steady encroachment by recruiting their neighbours as allies against the Spanish advance. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns, or "<a href="Indian%20reductions">reducciones</a>" (also known as "congregaciones"). Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Those that remained behind in the "reducciones" often fell victim to contagious diseases.

In addition to military expeditions, a contract for conquest was issued to the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican Order</a>, which engaged missionaries for the peaceful pacification of native populations so they would accept Roman Catholicism and submit to Spanish rule. This tactic worked in the neighbouring mountains of Verapaz to the south, although their success there was aided by the threat of Spanish garrisons stationed within striking distance. In the lowland Petén this approach was not so successful, since the Maya could disappear easily into the rainforest leaving the Spanish with deserted settlements. Likewise, the <a href="Franciscan%20Order">Franciscan Order</a> engaged in generally peaceful attempts to incorporate the Maya into the Spanish Empire via the attempted Christian conversion of native leaders. The Franciscan Order routinely embraced the practice of missionary violence, including <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> and the defence of the idea of "<a href="religious%20war">holy war</a>" against non-Christians. In many cases the Maya remained Christian only while the missionaries were present, and they would immediately become <a href="apostasy">apostate</a> as soon as the friars left. In Guatemala in the late 17th century, the Franciscan friar Francisco de Asís Vázquez de Herrera argued that war against apostate Indians was obligatory. Missionary penetration of Petén was not risk-free, and many missionaries were killed in the region.

Independent Maya frequently attacked Christianised Maya settlements and encouraged such settlements to abandon their new religion and resist the Spanish. As Spanish military expeditions were launched against the Maya with increasing frequency, independent Maya communities began to request the presence of missionaries to avoid armed conflict. The Itza attempted to use neighbouring Maya groups, such as the Yalain, as a buffer against Spanish encroachment; they may also have instigated rebellions by neighbouring groups that were already undergoing incorporation into the Spanish Empire. With Spanish attempts to penetrate the region divided between mutually independent colonial authorities in Yucatán and Guatemala, at times the Itza would be making peaceful overtures on one front while fighting on the other.

In 1525, after the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20the%20Aztec%20Empire">Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire</a>, Hernán Cortés led an expedition to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom in what is now the northern Petén Department of Guatemala. His aim was to subdue the rebellious <a href="Crist%C3%B3bal%20de%20Olid">Cristóbal de Olid</a>, whom he had sent to <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Honduras%23Crist%C3%B3bal%20de%20Olid%27s%20expedition%20from%20Mexico%2C%201524">conquer Honduras</a>; Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory. Cortés had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. He also had with him 600 <a href="Chontal%20Maya%20people">Chontal Maya</a> carriers from Acalan. They arrived at the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525.

The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass in the presence of <a href="Kan%20Ek%CA%BC">Aj Kan Ekʼ</a>, the king of the Itza, who was said to be so impressed that he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols. Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ekʼ to visit Nojpetén (also known as Tayasal), and crossed to the Maya city with 20 Spanish soldiers while the rest of his army continued around the lake to meet him on the south shore. On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén.

From the lake, Cortés continued south along the western slopes of the <a href="Maya%20Mountains">Maya Mountains</a>, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost more than two-thirds of his horses. When he came to a river swollen with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.

On 15 April 1525 the expedition arrived at the Maya village of Tenciz. With local guides they headed into the hills north of <a href="Lake%20Izabal">Lake Izabal</a>, where their guides abandoned them to their fate. The expedition became lost in the hills and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village on the shore of Lake Izabal, perhaps Xocolo. He crossed the <a href="Dulce%20River%20%28Guatemala%29">Dulce River</a> to the settlement of <a href="Nito">Nito</a>, somewhere on the <a href="Amatique%20Bay">Amatique Bay</a>, with about a dozen companions, and waited there for the rest of his army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.

From 1527 onwards the Spanish were increasingly active in the Yucatán Peninsula, establishing several colonies and towns by 1544, including <a href="Campeche%2C%20Campeche">Campeche</a> and <a href="Valladolid%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Valladolid</a> in what is now Mexico. The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Petén Itzá, within the modern borders of Guatemala.

Dominican missionaries were active in Verapaz and the southern Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century, the Franciscans came to the conclusion that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the "<a href="encomienda">encomienda</a>" system.

The first Catholic missionaries entered southern Petén in 1596 to convert the Manche Chʼol and the Mopan. The <a href="Q%CA%BCeqchi%CA%BC%20people">Qʼeqchiʼ</a> of Verapaz long had close ties with the Manche Chʼol. The colonial Maya towns of <a href="Cob%C3%A1n">Cobán</a> and <a href="Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Cahab%C3%B3n">Cahabón</a>, in Alta Verapaz, traded <a href="resplendent%20quetzal">quetzal</a> feathers, <a href="copal">copal</a>, chile, cotton, salt and Spanish-produced iron tools with their lowland Lakandon and Manche Chʼol neighbours, receiving <a href="Cocoa%20bean">cacao</a> and <a href="Bixa%20orellana">achiote</a> in exchange. Many Qʼeqchiʼ from Verapaz fled Spanish control to settle among the Lakandón and Manche Chʼol. These fugitives strengthened the existing ties between the independent Chʼol and the Spanish-controlled Maya of Verapaz; the constant flow of Maya between colonial Verapaz and independent Petén led to religious <a href="syncretism">syncretism</a> that the Spanish religious authorities were unable to prevent. This relationship did not hinder the Spanish from using the Qʼeqchiʼ to help conquer and reduce the Manche Chʼol.

From the middle of the 16th century the Dominican Order had been tasked with the peaceful conversion of the Chʼol of Verapaz and southern Petén, and their concentration into new colonial towns. The Itza became fearful that the newly converted Manche Chʼol would lead the Spanish to Nojpetén. In 1628 the towns of the Manche Chʼol were placed under the administration of the governor of Verapaz, with Dominican friar Francisco Morán as their ecclesiastical head. Morán favoured a more robust approach to the conversion of the Manche and moved Spanish soldiers into the region to protect against raids from the Itza to the north. The new Spanish garrison in an area that had not previously seen a heavy Spanish military presence provoked the Manche to revolt, which was followed by abandonment of the indigenous settlements. The Itza, worried about the southern approaches to their territory, may have instigated a Manche rebellion that took place in Lent 1633.

Towards the end of the 17th century Spanish priorities changed, and the failure of the peaceful efforts of the Dominicans to convert the Chʼol combined with the increasing British presence in the Caribbean led the colonial authorities to end the Dominican monopoly and allow the Franciscans and other orders to enter the region; military options were also viewed more favourably. Between 1685 and 1689, the Qʼeqchiʼ of Cobán and Cahabón were forced to assist the Spanish in their armed expeditions against the Manche Chʼol and in forcibly relocating them to Verapaz. These actions depopulated the southern Petén and led to the breakdown of the trade routes linking colonial Guatemala with the independent Maya of Petén. From 1692 to 1694, Franciscan friars <a href="Antonio%20Margil">Antonio Margil</a> and Melchor López were active among the Manche and Lakandon Chʼol. They were eventually expelled by the Chʼol; upon their return to Santiago de Guatemala they proposed three invasion routes into southern Petén and neighbouring Chiapas. Throughout the 17th century, Spanish missionaries encountered considerable reticence among the Manche, until the Spanish finally decided to move them to an area where they could be more easily controlled. At the time of contact there were perhaps 10,000 Manche; these were devastated by war and disease, with the survivors relocated to <a href="Rabinal">Rabinal</a> in the modern department of <a href="Baja%20Verapaz%20Department">Baja Verapaz</a>. After 1700 the Manche Chʼol ceased to play any part in the history of Petén.

The Mopan population has been estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 people at the time of contact. In 1692 the Council of the Indies ordered that the Manche Chʼol and the Mopan be dealt with decisively. The population suffered the effects of war and disease, and the few survivors were moved into Spanish "reducciones" in southeastern Petén, before being moved to colonial settlements in other parts of Petén. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to act upon a plan to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and soldiers commanded by <a href="Jacinto%20de%20Barrios%20Leal">Jacinto de Barrios Leal</a>, president of the <a href="Royal%20Audiencia%20of%20Guatemala">Royal Audiencia of Guatemala</a>, conquered several Chʼol communities. The most important of these was Sakbʼajlan on the <a href="Lacant%C3%BAn%20River">Lacantún River</a> in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon, in April 1695. This was one part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Petén and neighbouring Chiapas; a second group joined up with Barrios Leal having marched from <a href="Huehuetenango">Huehuetenango</a>. The third group, under Juan Díaz de Velasco, marched from Verapaz against the Itza. Barrios Leal was accompanied by Franciscan friar Antonio Margil who served as an advisor as well as his personal confessor and chaplain to his troops. The Spanish built a fort and garrisoned it with 30 Spanish soldiers. <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary%20of%20Mercy">Mercederian</a> friar Diego de Rivas was based at Dolores del Lakandon, and he and his fellow Mercederians baptised several hundred Lakandon Chʼols in the following months and established contacts with neighbouring Chʼol communities.

Resistance against the Spanish continued, and hostile Chʼol killed several newly baptised Christian Indians. In early March 1696 such was the success of the friars that captain Jacobo de Alzayaga and the Mercederians decided to try to reach Lake Petén Itzá. They headed eastwards towards the <a href="Pasi%C3%B3n%20River">Pasión River</a> with 150 heavily armed soldiers plus native guides, travelling in five large canoes. They got as far as the savannah to the southeast of the lake before turning back for unknown reasons. Antonio Margil remained in Dolores del Lakandon until 1697. The Chʼol of the <a href="Lacandon%20Jungle">Lacandon Jungle</a> were resettled in <a href="Huehuetenango%20Department">Huehuetenango</a> in the early 18th century.

Nojpetén fell to a Spanish assault on 13 March 1697, more than 150 years after the conquest of the rest of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> and more than 160 years after the conquest of the Guatemalan Highlands. The lengthy delay in conquering the Petén region was due to a combination of its geographical remoteness and inhospitality and the fierce reputation of its Maya inhabitants. During this time the Itza used the Yalain as an eastern buffer against Spanish approach from Belize. The lengthy indirect contact between the Itza and the Spanish invaders allowed the Itza to develop an understanding of Spanish strategy and tactics that was honed over the period of almost two centuries that the Itza were surrounded by European-dominated territories. This understanding distinguished the conquest of Petén from the 16th-century conquests of the Aztecs, Maya and <a href="Inca%20Empire">Incas</a>. In contrast, the Spanish had a very poor understanding of the Itza and their neighbours and viewed them as ignorant savages whose kingdom was protected by <a href="Satan">Satan</a> from the Christianising efforts of the <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a> and the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. From the time that Hernán Cortés crossed Petén in the early 16th century, the Spanish mistakenly believed the king of the Itza (the "Aj Kan Ek"') was the overlord of the entire central Petén region.

Following Cortés' visit, no Spanish attempted to visit the warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida in Yucatán on a mission to attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. Andrés Carrillo de Pernía, a "<a href="Criollo%20people">Criollo</a>" who was the "<a href="alcalde">alcalde</a>" of <a href="Bacalar">Bacalar</a> (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ekʼ. They stayed at Nojpetén for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ekʼ refused to renounce his <a href="Maya%20religion">Maya religion</a>, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ekʼ informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet time for them to convert. In the time since Cortés had visited Nojpetén, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ekʼ.

The friars returned in 1619, arriving in October and staying for eighteen days. Again Kan Ekʼ welcomed them in a friendly manner, but this time the <a href="Maya%20priesthood">Maya priesthood</a> were hostile and jealous of the missionaries' influence upon the king. They persuaded Kan Ek's wife to convince him to expel the unwelcome visitors. The missionaries' lodgings were surrounded by armed warriors, and the friars and their accompanying servants were escorted to a waiting canoe and instructed to leave and never return. Juan de Orbita attempted to resist and was rendered unconscious by an Itza warrior. The missionaries were expelled without food or water but survived the journey back to Mérida.

Before the early 17th century, the western Petén had been heavily populated by Chʼol and Chʼoltiʼ Maya and was an important trade route for the Itza. By the mid-17th century, these populations had been devastated by war, disease and the enforced movement of the inhabitants into colonial settlements, negating the economic importance of the region for the Itza. At the same time the Kejache were becoming important intermediaries between the Itza and Yucatán. The Putun Acalan subgroup of the Kejache had previously traded directly with the Itza but had been relocated by the Spanish. The remaining Kejache, devastated by disease and subject to the intense attentions of Spanish missionaries, were no longer able to supply the Itza directly and became middlemen instead.

In March 1622, governor of Yucatán <a href="Diego%20de%20Cardenas">Diego de Cardenas</a> ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano to launch an assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, where there was a lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from <a href="Tipu%2C%20Belize">Tipuj</a> in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ekʼ, asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, but as soon as the Spanish soldiers let their guard down, the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were <a href="Human%20sacrifice%20in%20Maya%20culture">sacrificed</a> to the <a href="List%20of%20Maya%20gods%20and%20supernatural%20beings">Maya gods</a>, with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town. After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.

Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjKʼin Pʼol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum and slaughtered them. Spanish reinforcements led by Juan Bernardo Casanova arrived too late; the Spanish soldiers had been sacrificed, hanged and beheaded, with their corpses burned and impaled on stakes at the entrance to the village; Mirones and the Franciscan priest had been bound to the church posts and then sacrificed with their hearts cut out. A number of local Maya men and women had also been hanged but not decapitated, and the attackers had burned the town.

Following these massacres, Spanish garrisons were stationed in several towns in southern Yucatán, and rewards were offered for the whereabouts of AjKʼin Pʼol. The Maya governor of <a href="Oxkutzcab%20Municipality">Oxkutzcab</a>, Fernando Kamal, set out with 150 Maya archers to track the warleader down; they succeeded in capturing the Itza captain and his followers, together with silverware from the looted Sakalum church and items belonging to Mirones. The prisoners were taken back to the Spanish captain Antonio Méndez de Canzo, interrogated under torture, tried, and condemned to be <a href="hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered">hanged, drawn and quartered</a>. They were decapitated, and the heads were displayed in the plazas of towns throughout the colonial "Partido de la Sierra" in what is now Mexico's Yucatán state. These events ended all Spanish attempts to contact the Itza until 1695. In the 1640s internal strife in Spain distracted the government from attempts to conquer unknown lands; the Spanish Crown lacked the time, money or interest in such colonial adventures for the next four decades.

In 1692 <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> nobleman Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi proposed to the Spanish king the construction of a road from Mérida southwards to link with the Guatemalan colony, in the process "reducing" any independent native populations into colonial "congregaciones"; this was part of a greater plan to subjugate the Lakandon and Manche Chʼol of southern Petén and the upper reaches of the Usumacinta River. The original plan was for the province of Yucatán to build the northern section and for Guatemala to build the southern portion, with both meeting somewhere in Chʼol territory; the plan was later modified to pass further east, through the kingdom of the Itza.

In December 1695 the Spanish colonial authorities in Mérida received a diplomatic visit sent by the Aj Kan Ekʼ. The diplomatic contact had been negotiated by Spanish captain Francisco Hariza y Arruyo, "alcalde" of Bacalar-at-Chunjujubʼ. Hariza had sent a Christian Maya ambassador to Nojpetén from Tipuj in April 1695, who arrived around the same time that the Itza were preparing to defend themselves against a Spanish party entering from Guatemala; nonetheless the emissary was received in peace and despatched back to Hariza with promises of submission to Spain. In August Hariza travelled to Mérida in the company of a group of seven Tipuj natives offering submission to Spain. Four members of this party were not from Tipuj at all, but were Itza diplomats sent incognito from Yalain to discuss possible peaceful contacts with the colonial authorities. The leader of the Itza delegation was AjChan, a nephew of the Itza king. When friar Avendaño was in Mérida in September 1695 between attempts to reach Nojpetén, he met with the Itza–Yalain delegation and was able to give an account of them when he travelled through Yalain after visiting Nojpetén in January 1696. AjChan and his companions returned to Nojpetén in November but did not stay long before leaving for Mérida again.
In December, Kan Ekʼ despatched AjChan to negotiate peace with Spain, with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to Mérida by a small number of Mopans from the Tipuj region. AjChan, through family ties and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also had family ties with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from <a href="Chichen%20Itza">Chichen Itza</a> in the northern Yucatán. His marriage to a Kowoj woman had been an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza–Kowoj hostility. Kan Ekʼ sent AjChan to Mérida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain. The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery. The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Petén, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Martín Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Martín de Ursúa, governor of Yucatán, acting as his godfather.

The arrival of AjChan and his subsequent baptism was an important diplomatic coup for Ursúa, who used the visit for his own political advancement, promoting the embassy as the peaceful final submission of the Itza kingdom to the Spanish Crown. This formal submission of the Itza kingdom to Spain was a critical turning point, since from a Spanish legal viewpoint the Itza were now subjects and the royal prohibition on military conquest could be sidestepped. AjChan left Mérida with his companions and a Spanish escort in the middle of January 1696 and arrived back at Tipuj around the end of the month. After a few days at Tipuj he learnt of violent events unfolding around Lake Petén Itzá including the battle at Chʼichʼ and the subsequent killing of two Franciscans. Fearing the response of his Spanish escort, he abandoned them and fled back to Yalain.

The governor of Yucatán, <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Urs%C3%BAa%20y%20Arizmendi">Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi</a>, began to build the road from Campeche south towards Petén. At the beginning of March 1695, Ursúa ordered captain Alonso García de Paredes to explore this road; García led a group of 50 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by native guides, muleteers and labourers. García had previous experience from military expeditions around Sajkabʼchen (near modern Xcabacab in southern Campeche state) The expedition advanced some way south of Sajkabʼchen into Kejache territory, which began at Chunpich, about north of the modern border between Mexico and Guatemala. He rounded up some natives to be moved into colonial settlements, but met with armed Kejache resistance. A skirmish ensued at a Kejache village, resulting in the deaths of eight Kejache warriors. Prisoners taken during the skirmish informed García that many independent Maya lived in the area, both Kejache and others. García decided to retreat around the middle of April, probably to escort captured Kejache back to Sajkabʼchen to be put to work on García's "encomienda". Captain García reported back to Ursúa on 21 April 1695.

In March 1695, captain Juan Díaz de Velasco set out from <a href="Cahab%C3%B3n">Cahabón</a> in <a href="Alta%20Verapaz">Alta Verapaz</a> with 70 Spanish soldiers, accompanied by a large number of Maya archers from Verapaz, and native muleteers; four Dominican friars led by "Criollo" friar Agustín Cano accompanied the expedition. Theoretically the Spanish soldiers were provided solely as an escort for the Dominicans. The Guatemalan expedition, under orders of President Jacinto de Barrios Leal, were secretly trying to reach the Itzas before Martín de Ursúa could reach them from Yucatán; the existence of the expedition was carefully concealed during all communications between Guatemala and the governor of Yucatán. It formed a part of a three-pronged attack against the independent inhabitants of Petén and neighbouring Chiapas; the other two expeditions were launched against the Lakandon.

The expedition proceeded northwards through Chʼol territory and into Mopan territory; there they camped at Mopan town (modern <a href="San%20Luis%2C%20El%20Pet%C3%A9n">San Luis</a>). Due to their fear of their warlike Itza neighbours, both the Chʼol and the Mopans claimed not to know of any paths to Lake Petén Itzá. The Spanish were held up at Mopan for several days by supply problems and desertions among their native carriers. The Dominicans took advantage of the delay to proselytise the Mopans and Cano wrote that he had converted four "<a href="cacique">cacique</a>s" (native chiefs) there, although Taxim Chan, king of the Mopans, had fled with many of the local inhabitants. Cano believed that the Mopans were ruled by the king of the Itzas.

The Spanish believed that by pressing ahead to Lake Petén Itzá they would link up with a simultaneous expedition headed by President Barrios himself, unaware that Barrios had not reached the region. Díaz de Velasco sent out a scouting party of 50 musketeers accompanied by native archers on 6 April. They soon found evidence of recent Itza camps in the area, estimated to be a month old. The scouts found a clear road heading north to the Itza kingdom, and the army set off along it. The main force camped about ten <a href="league%20%28unit%29">leagues</a> (26 miles or 42 km) south of the lake, while a smaller scouting party was sent off ahead; this consisted of two Spanish soldiers, two archers and two muleteers from Verapaz, with two Chʼol-speaking native interpreters. The scouting party advanced to the savannah just to the south of Lake Petén Itzá, where they encountered about 30 Itza hunters armed with spears, shields and bows, accompanied by hunting dogs. The hunters drew their weapons and prepared to fight, but the Mopan interpreter was instructed to explain that the Spanish party were traders who came in peace, accompanied by missionaries. The Spanish began to suspect that the interpreter was plotting against them with the Itza hunters, and one of the Verapaz archers dragged him out from among the hunters. The encounter degenerated into a scuffle, and the Itzas once again drew weapons. The Spanish fired their muskets, fatally wounding two hunters, and a Verapaz Indian charged the Itzas with a machete. The hunters fled, leaving the scouting party in possession of the food and arrows at the hunting camp.

Five days after this skirmish, Antonio Machuca led a party of 12 musketeers, 25 archers and 13 muleteers to try to find President Barrios, to scout a river route to the lake and to capture another interpreter, the previous one no longer being trusted. The main party arrived on the savannah near the lake. The following night one of the advance party came back into camp with an Itza prisoner, captured after a fierce struggle with the scouts. Interrogation of the prisoner revealed that he was from a high-ranking Itza lineage, and that he had been sent out to find the Spanish party and to see if they came as traders or invaders. The rest of Machuca's scouting party soon returned to the main camp, reporting that they had camped four leagues (approximately 10.4 miles or 16.7 km) from the lake, where they encountered another hunting party of about "a dozen" Itzas. The Spanish tried to use their interpreter to talk to them but the Itzas responded with a volley of arrows. The Spanish musketeers tried to respond with musketfire, but found their gunpowder too wet to fire properly. The Itza warriors charged upon them with spears, axes and machetes, and the ensuing hand-to-hand battle lasted an hour, during which six of the Itzas were killed; the rest finally retreated. Thanks to their padded cotton armour, the Spanish party received no injuries from the skirmish. The Spanish pursued the fleeing Itzas and another fierce skirmish ensued, lasting another hour during which most of the remaining Itzas were killed. Three Itzas escaped, and their leader was rendered unconscious with machete blows to the head; he was taken prisoner and later made a full recovery. Machuca's party reached the lakeshore and could see Nojpetén across the water, but saw such a large force of Itzas that they retreated south, back to the main camp.

An Itza account of this encounter reached the colonial authorities in Yucatán via Tipuj. The Itza reported that the Guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of Nojpetén, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered to talk to the intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture of one and yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujubʼ, Yucatán, was in Nojpetén around this time, and reported that the Itza gathered 3,000–4,000 warriors ready to repulse Díaz de Velasco's party.

On 24 April, the first prisoner escaped from the main camp; the same day that the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, who turned out to be an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjKʼixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjKʼixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.

When captain García de Paredes unexpectedly returned to Campeche in early May 1695, governor Martín de Ursúa was already preparing reinforcements for his expedition. With García's arrival, he was immediately allocated the extra soldiers. On 11 May Ursúa ordered García to begin a second expedition southwards and was allotted 100 salaried Maya to accompany him. These workers were to be paid three pesos per month and received a suspension of their obligations to supply "encomienda" work and tribute. García paid for additional Spanish soldiers from his own funds, as did José Fernández de Estenos, a Campeche resident who was to serve as second-in-command. The final force numbered 115 Spanish soldiers and 150 Maya musketeers, plus Maya labourers and muleteers; the final tally was more than 400 people, which was regarded as a considerable army in the impoverished Yucatán province. Ursúa also ordered two companies of Maya musketeers from <a href="Tekax">Tekʼax</a> and Oxkʼutzkabʼ to join the expedition at Bʼolonchʼen Kawich, some southeast of the city of Campeche. Bonifacio Us was captain of the Tekʼax company; Diego Uk was that of the Oxkʼutzkabʼ company. Marcos Pot was overall "cacique captain" of these two Maya companies; all three officers were Maya. A Maya company from Sajkabʼchen served as elite musketeers charged with rounding up forest Maya into the "reducciones"; this company was excused from heavy labour duties. Non-Maya soldiers were a mix of Spanish, <a href="mestizo">mestizo</a>s (mixed race Spanish and native) and <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a>s (mixed race Spanish and black).

On 18 May Ursúa requested three missionaries to support the expedition from the Franciscan <a href="provincial%20superior">provincial superior</a>, friar Antonio de Silva; by 30 May three friars were ready to join the Spanish force, accompanied by a lay brother who had not yet taken vows. In addition, Silva sent another group of Franciscans led by friar Andrés de Avendaño, who was accompanied by another friar and a lay brother. This second group was only to remain with García while convenient for them to do so, and were to continue onwards independently to Nojpetén to make contact with the Itzas, with the tacit approval of Ursúa. In fact Avendaño and his party left Mérida on 2 June, a week before the party assigned to García. On 23 June Ursúa received a message informing him of the occupation of Sakbʼajlan (Dolores del Lakandon) by Guatemalan troops. By this time García was at Tzuktokʼ, near the Kejache border. Although Ursúa's purported plan, as authorised by the Spanish crown, was to build a road uniting Yucatán with Guatemala, he now realised that he was in a race to conquer the Itza kingdom; President Barrios of Guatemala had reached Sakbʼajlan and was returning to Santiago to prepare another expedition, and Guatemalan soldiers had already reached the lakeshore of Petén Itzá. Any linking road to Dolores del Lakandon would have passed through sparsely inhabited territory; instead the Yucatecan surveyor plotted a route due south directly to the lake where it could connect with the south road via Cahabón in Verapaz. This route would leave Dolores del Lakandon and the Lakandon Chʼol isolated to the west. Ursúa issued new orders to García dissimulating his desire to conquer the Itza. His letter ordered García to link up with President Barrios at Dolores del Lakandon, and gave him a precise route that would take him instead to the lake. A short time after receiving these orders, García ordered the construction of a fort at Chuntuki, some 25 leagues (approximately 65 miles or 105 km) north of Lake Petén Itzá. This would serve as the main military base for the "Camino Real" ("Royal Road") project; the supply base was at Kawich, under the command of Juan del Castillo y Arrué. On 27 July Ursúa authorised the creation of three new militia companies of 25 men apiece to reinforce García. Two were Spanish companies and one was a mixed-race company consisting of mestizos and pardos.

The Sajkabʼchen company of native musketeers pushed ahead with the road builders from Tzuktzokʼ to the first Kejache town at Chunpich, which the Kejache had fled, leaving behind a substantial amount of food. The company's officers sent for reinforcements from García at Tzuktokʼ but before any could arrive some 25 Kejache returned to Chunpich with baskets to collect their abandoned food. The nervous Sajkabʼchen sentries feared that the residents were returning en masse and discharged their muskets at them, with both groups then retreating. The musketeer company then arrived to reinforce their sentries and charged into battle against approaching Kejache archers. Several musketeers were injured in the ensuing skirmish, and the Kejache retreated along a forest path without injury, mocking the invaders. The Sajkabʼchen company followed the path and found two more deserted settlements with large amounts of abandoned food. They seized the food and retreated back along the path.

Around 3 August García moved his entire army forward to Chunpich, and by October Spanish soldiers had established themselves near the source of the <a href="San%20Pedro%20River%20%28Guatemala%29">San Pedro River</a>. By November Tzuktokʼ was garrisoned with 86 soldiers and more at Chuntuki; in that month García once again returned to Campeche. By December 1695 Ursúa was under pressure to complete the conquest of the Itza, and he approved the despatch of reinforcements along the "Camino Real" to join the main garrison. The reinforcements included 150 Spanish and pardo soldiers and 100 Maya soldiers, together with labourers and muleteers. An advance group of 150 mixed Maya and non-Maya soldiers met up with García at Campeche and proceeded southwards along the "Camino Real" towards the San Pedro River. The rest of the reinforcements did not leave Campeche until March 1696.

In May 1695 Antonio de Silva had appointed two groups of Franciscans to head for Petén; the first group was to join up with García's military expedition. The second group was to head for Lake Petén Itza independently. This second group was headed by friar Andrés de Avendaño. Avendaño was accompanied by friar Antonio Pérez de San Román, lay brother Alonso de Vargas and six Maya Christians recruited from Mérida and towns en route to Campeche. This latter group left Mérida on 2 June 1695 and made its way to Juan del Castillo y Arrué's supply base at Kawich, set up to support García's military expedition. On 24 June Avendaño's party left Kawich and set off across sparsely inhabited territory. On 29 June they arrived at an abandoned Maya temple, which he referred to by the name Nojku, meaning "Big Temple". The Spanish had already passed through and had broken many "idols" but the friars climbed the temple and managed to find about 50 additional ceremonial sculptures, which they destroyed; they also placed a cross inside. The other group of friars, on their way to join García, passed through Nojku a few days later and found that local Maya had already placed new offerings within. Avendaño's group continued southwards and found increasing signs of habitation and arrived at the military camp of captain José Fernández de Estenos at the deserted Maya town of Nojtʼubʼ, which had been cleared by the Spanish under García some sixteen years previously.

Avendaño continued south along the course of the new road, finding increasing evidence of Spanish military activity, with the rounding up of local inhabitants and raiding of fields and orchards for provisions by Spanish troops. The Franciscans overtook García at Bʼukʼte, about before Tzuktokʼ. Avendaño's party arrived at Tzuktokʼ, near the Kejache border, by 10 July and left two weeks later, around the same time that García arrived there with his captives rounded up at Bʼukʼte for forced labour. Before leaving, the Franciscans protested to García and his officers about the poor treatment of the local inhabitants; the officers promised better treatment of the Maya in future. On 3 August García advanced to Chunpich but tried to persuade Avendaño to stay behind to minister to the prisoners from Bʼukʼte. Avendaño instead split his group and left in secret with just four Christian Maya companions, seeking the Chunpich Kejache that had attacked one of García's advance companies and had now retreated into the forest. He was unable to find the Kejache but did manage to get information regarding a path that led southwards to the Itza kingdom. He met four exhausted Sajkabʼchen musketeers who were carrying a letter addressed to him from captain Fernández de Estenos. This letter explained that further south there were various deserted Maya towns with only rotten maize abandoned by their occupiers. Avendaño returned to Tzuktokʼ and reconsidered his plans; the Franciscans were short of supplies, and the forcefully congregated Maya that they were charged with converting were disappearing back into the forest daily. Additionally, the Spanish officers ignored the concerns of the friars and García was abducting local Maya women and children to be taken back to his "encomienda" for forced labour. The Franciscans set upon a different, ultimately unsuccessful, plan; they would follow the road back north to Jopʼelchʼen near Campeche city and attempt to reach the Itza via Tipuj. This route was blocked when the <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a> prevented the Franciscans from attempting it. Antonio de Silva ordered Avendaño to return to Mérida, and he arrived there on 17 September 1695. The other group of Franciscans, led by Juan de San Buenaventura Chávez, continued following the roadbuilders into Kejache territory, through IxBʼam, Bʼatkabʼ and Chuntuki (modern Chuntunqui near <a href="Carmelita%2C%20Pet%C3%A9n">Carmelita, Petén</a>).

Juan de San Buenaventura's small group of Franciscans had arrived in Chuntuki on 30 August 1695, and found that the army had opened the road southwards for another seventeen leagues (approximately 44.2 miles or 71.1 km), almost half way to Lake Petén Itzá, but returned to Chuntuki due to the seasonal rains. San Buenaventura was accompanied by friar Joseph de Jesús María, lay friar Tomás de Alcoser and lay brother Lucas de San Francisco. With Avendaño's return to Mérida, provincial superior Antonio de Silva despatched two additional friars to join San Buenaventura's group: Diego de Echevarría and Diego de Salas. One of these was to convert the Kejache in Tzuktokʼ, and the other was to do the same at Chuntuki. Although initially reluctant to permit the group to continue into Itza territory, by late October García de Paredes had relented and acquiesced to de Silva's instructions for San Buenaventura and his original companions to continue to Nojpetén, although it appears that this never happened. On 24 October San Buenaventura wrote to the provincial superior reporting that the warlike Kejache were now pacified and that they had told him that the Itza were ready to receive the Spanish in friendship. On that day 62 Kejache men had voluntarily come to Chuntuki from Pakʼekʼem, where another 300 Kejache resided. San Buenaventura sent lay brother Lucas de San Francisco to convince them to relocate to the Chuntuki mission. Lucas de San Francisco destroyed the idols in Pakʼekʼem but the inhabitants were not brought to the mission because of worries about feeding the new arrivals. Instead, in early November 1695, friar Tomás de Alcoser and brother Lucas de San Francisco were sent to establish a mission at Pakʼekʼem, where they were well received by the cacique and his pagan priest. Pakʼekʼem was sufficiently far from the new Spanish road that it was free from military interference, and the friars oversaw the building of a church in what was the largest mission town in Kejache territory. A second church was built at Bʼatkabʼ to attend to over 100 Kʼejache refugees who had been gathered there under the stewardship of friar Diego de Echevarría; a further church was established at Tzuktokʼ, overseen by Diego de Salas.

Franciscan Andrés de Avendaño left Mérida on 13 December 1695, and arrived in Nojpetén around 14 January 1696; he followed the new road as far as possible then continued towards Nojpetén with local Maya guides. He was accompanied by friars Antonio Pérez de San Román, Joseph de Jesús María and Diego de Echevarría, and by lay brother Lucas de San Francisco; some of these he collected on his journey south along the "Camino Real". On 5 January they caught up with and passed the main contingent of the army at Bʼatkabʼ, continuing to Chuntuki. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a watering hole by some ruins, which was recorded as Tanxulukmul by Avendaño. From Tanxulukmul they followed the small Acté River to a Chakʼan Itza town called Saklemakal. They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza.

Unknown to the Franciscans, the northern Chakʼan Itza province of the Itza kingdom was allied with the Kowoj and was at war with the Itza king. The Chakʼan Itzas carried off most of the gifts that the Spanish party had brought for the Itza king, in an effort to hinder friendly relations developing. The following day, the current Aj Kan Ekʼ travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chakʼan Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ekʼ and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ekʼ to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish crown, without success. The Franciscan friar tried to convince the Itza king that the Kʼatun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year <a href="Maya%20calendar">Maya calendrical cycle</a> beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. The king of the Itza, like his forebear, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right. He asked the Spanish to return in four months, at which time the Itza would convert and swear fealty to the King of Spain.

On 19 January AjKowoj, the king of the Kowoj, arrived at Nojpetén and spoke with Avendaño, arguing against the acceptance of Christianity and Spanish rule. The discussions between Avendaño, Kan Ekʼ and AjKowoj exposed deep divisions among the Itza – and the apparent treachery of the Itza king in offering his kingdom to the Spanish undermined Kan Ek's power over his own people. Kan Ekʼ learnt of a plot by the Kowoj and their Chakʼan Itza allies to ambush and kill the Franciscans, and the Itza king advised them to return to Mérida via Tipuj. The Itza king's efforts to save his Spanish guests effectively ended his power to rule; from that point on anti-Spanish sentiment governed Itza responses to the Spanish. The Franciscans were guided to Yalain where they were well received but while they were there the Yalain heard rumours of battle and a Spanish advance towards Lake Petén Itzá. The Franciscans were shown a path that led to Tipuj but their Yalain guides soon abandoned them. The Spanish friars became lost and suffered great hardships, including the death of one of Avendaño's companions, but after a month wandering in the forest found their way back to Chuntuki and from there made their way back to Mérida.

Kan Ekʼ had sent emissaries to Mérida in December 1695 to inform Martín de Ursúa that the Itza would peacefully submit to Spanish rule. By mid-January captain García de Paredes had advanced from Bʼatkabʼ to the advance portion of the "Camino Real" at Chuntuki. By now he only had 90 soldiers plus labourers and porters, with many of his soldiers deserting as the force advanced towards Lake Petén Itzá; they were further delayed by the necessity of building an oar-powered longboat (or "<a href="Pirogue">piragua</a>") to cross the San Pedro River. Soon after Avendaño's flight eastward from Nojpetén, a group of 60 Maya warriors entered Chuntuki in full warpaint and bearing weapons; they claimed to have been sent by Avendaño to collect religious regalia and another friar. This was not the case, and they were almost certainly a scouting party sent by the Kowoj and their Chakʼan Itza allies to see what progress the Spanish army was making along the road. They spoke with García and then rapidly departed without taking any of the items that they had supposedly been sent to collect. García despatched two Kejache scouts to the lakeshore to discover Avendaño's whereabouts; at the same time Avendaño's Kejache guides were returning to Chuntuki from Nojpetén with news of Avendaño's flight. The Itzas at the lake handed over an open letter written by Avendaño before his departure from Nojpetén as a token of friendship between the Itza and the Spanish. Friar Juan de San Buenaventura was enthused by the letter and wished to travel on to Nojpetén himself.

García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, his senior officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also accompanied by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition was approached by two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing him that he could advance safely. The port town of Chʼichʼ was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.

The Spanish party retreated from the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were surrounded by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this point about 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate. A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled at the start of the battle and took news to García that the entire expedition had been slaughtered; Zubiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back into the base camp at Chuntuki two days later. Ursúa later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpetén where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpetén in 1697; AjKʼin Kan Ekʼ, the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out their hearts.

This turn of events convinced Martín de Ursúa that Kan Ekʼ would not surrender peacefully, and he began to organise an all-out assault on Nojpetén. The enlistment of previously authorised reinforcements was now urgent, but was hindered when 70 of 100 soldiers mutinied and never reached García's camp. Work on the road was redoubled and about a month after the battle at Chʼichʼ the Spanish arrived at the lakeshore, now supported by artillery. Again a large number of canoes gathered, and the nervous Spanish soldiers opened fire with cannons and muskets; no casualties were reported among the Itza, who retreated and raised a white flag from a safe distance.

The Guatemalan authorities were unaware of ongoing contacts between the colonial authorities in Yucatán and the Itza. In the second half of 1695 President Barrios began planning another expedition against the Itza from Verapaz, following harsh criticism of Juan Díaz de Velasco's retreat from near Lake Petén Itzá in April of that year. Barrios died in November, and "<a href="oidor">oidor</a>" José de Escals became acting head of the Guatemalan colonial administration. He appointed "oidor" Bartolomé de Amésqueta to lead the next expedition against the Itza. Amésqueta marched his men through torrential rain from Cahabón to Mopán, arriving on 25 February 1696; the Guatemalans were still unaware of the clashes between García's forces and the Itza. Amésqueta's expedition was suffering from shortages of native labour and supplies. Twenty-five of his 150 men were sick, and his advance stalled as the force rested up at Mopán. Captain Díaz de Velasco volunteered to lead a party of 25 men ahead to the lake; he was accompanied by Dominican friars Cristóbal de Prada and Jacinto de Vargas. He was also accompanied by AjKʼixaw, the Itza nobleman who had been taken prisoner on Díaz's previous expedition, who served as a trusted guide, scout and translator. They set out from Mopán on 7 March and left some sick soldiers with some supplies after five days, they then caught up with an advance party of roadbuilders and their military escort at Río Chakal. The two forces combined, giving Díaz a force of 49 soldiers and 34 porters and archers from Verapaz. Once they arrived at IxBʼol, near the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, AjKʼixaw was sent ahead as an emissary to Nojpetén.

Back in Mopán, Amésqueta had received additional supplies and decided to catch up with his advance party. He left Mopán on 10 March 1696 with friar Agustín Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from Díaz or AjKʼixaw. On 20 March Amésqueta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find Díaz's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that Díaz had left behind. They followed Díaz's trail to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that Díaz's party had passed that way, and Amésqueta assumed that they had crossed to Nojpetén. He wrote a letter to Díaz, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with Amésqueta. During various attempts at communication to verify Díaz's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a narrow path and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of Amésqueta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in Díaz's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.

Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjKʼixaw had betrayed them and that this was precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In the early hours of the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4 miles or 37.7 km) north of Mopan.

Writing after the fall of Nojpetén, friar Cano described the ultimate fate of Díaz de Velasco and his companions; he claimed to have received the information from interviews with the soldiers from Yucatán who had stormed the Itza capital and from Chʼol witnesses, although there were no Chʼol at Nojpetén. Díaz's party arrived at the lakeshore and were told by local Itza that Franciscan friars were at Nojpetén. They were wary at first and asked for proof, upon which an Itza messenger brought them a <a href="rosary">rosary</a> as a token. Looking across the lake they saw men dressed as friars calling to them to come across, these were Itza dressed in the habits of the two Franciscans who had recently been killed at the island. Díaz and his companions then boarded the Itza canoes, leaving thirty Maya porters with their mules and supplies.

Once on the lake the Itza overturned some of the canoes and killed some of Díaz's men; others were wounded and dragged ashore to be killed. Díaz, the Dominicans and two other men were in a large canoe that was not overturned and were taken to Nojpetén where a fierce struggle ensued as Díaz attempted to defend himself with his sword, killing several Itzas. The two other men were immediately killed while the friars were beaten and tied to X-shaped crosses before having their hearts cut out. Across the lake, the Itza attacked the porters guarding the expedition supplies and killed all of them. The Itza killed a total of 87 expedition members, including 50 soldiers, two Dominicans and about 35 Maya helpers. The remains of the small group that were killed on Nojpetén were later retrieved by the Spanish after the fall of the city and were taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala for burial.

Over the following weeks scouts were sent out to try to make contact with local Mopan and Chʼol communities, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxBʼol and Manche without success – most of the natives had fled, leaving the forest deserted. At San Pedro Mártir he received news of AjChan's embassy to Mérida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men at Lake Petén Itzá, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned the unfinished fort. Friar Cano recommended to the new Guatemalan president that the Chʼol be moved to Verapaz where they could be properly administered. As a result of the failed expedition, Cano's recommendation was accepted, the fort was dismantled and any Maya that could be captured across a wide swathe of southern Petén was forcibly relocated to Belén near Rabinal in Verapaz. This relocation was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high-ranking colonial officials, including "oidor" José de Escals and even by Amésqueta.

The Itzas' continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all. The final assault was made possible by the gradual opening of the road from Mérida to Petén; by December 1696 this road had reached the lake shore although it was unfinished and still almost impassable in places. By this time the deep divisions between the political leaders of the Itza were such that a unified defence of the Itza kingdom had become impossible.

In late December 1696 the Chakʼan Itza attacked the large Kejache mission town of Pakʼekʼem; they abducted almost all the inhabitants and burned the church. The demoralised Spanish garrison at Chuntuki buried their weapons and ammunition and retreated five leagues (approximately 13 miles or 21 km) back towards Campeche. From late December 1696 to the middle of January 1697 Ursúa sent parties of soldiers and workmen along the road towards the lake; the first group was commanded by Pedro de Zubiaur and had instructions to begin building a "<a href="Galiot">galeota</a>", a large oar-powered warship. This group was followed by reinforcements bringing supplies, including light and heavy weapons, gunpowder and food. On 23 January Ursúa left Campeche with more soldiers and muleteers, bringing the total number of soldiers arriving as reinforcements to 130. The Spanish fortified their positions at Chʼichʼ and deployed heavy artillery for its defence.

Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi arrived on the western shore of lake Petén Itzá with his soldiers on 26 February 1697, and once there built the heavily armed "galeota" attack boat, which was assembled at Chʼichʼ over a space of 12 days in early March. The "galeota" had a <a href="keel">keel</a> of 30 cubits or ; it had 12 oars on each side and a rudder with an iron screw. The "galeota" carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces, including a "pieza" (light cannon) and four "pedreros" (mortars). The "piragua" longboat used to cross the San Pedro River was also transported to the lake to be used in the attack on the Itza capital; this boat had 6 oars and a rudder.

From 28 February onwards the Spanish expedition was repeatedly approached by hostile Itzas, who sometimes shot arrows in the direction of the intruders but inflicted no casualties. At the same time, small groups of curious Itzas mingled freely with the Spanish and received trinkets from them such as belts, necklaces and earrings.

On 10 March, Itza and Yalain emissaries arrived at Chʼichʼ to negotiate with Ursúa. First came AjChan who had already met him in Mérida; he was followed by Chamach Xulu, the ruler of the Yalain. Kan Ekʼ then sent a canoe with a white flag raised bearing emissaries, including the Itza high priest, who offered peaceful surrender. Ursúa received the embassy in peace and invited Kan Ekʼ to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day Kan Ekʼ failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors massed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake.

Ursúa decided that any further attempts at peaceful incorporation of the Itza into the Spanish Empire were pointless, and a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital on the morning of 13 March. The encampment at Chʼichʼ was left defended by 25 Spanish soldiers, three Maya musketeers and several artillery pieces. Ursúa boarded the "galeota" with 108 soldiers, two secular priests, five personal servants, the baptised Itza emissary AjChan and his brother-in-law and an Itza prisoner from Nojpetén. The attack boat was rowed east from Chʼichʼ towards the Itza capital; halfway across the lake it encountered a large fleet of canoes spread in an arc across the approach to Nojpetén, covering about from one shore to another – Ursúa simply gave the order to row through them. A large number of defenders had gathered along the shore of Nojpetén and on the roofs of the city. As the "galeota" approached, more canoes put out from the shore and the Spanish were surrounded. Once they had surrounded the "galeota", Itza archers began to shoot at the invaders. Ursúa gave orders to his men not to fire but arrows wounded several soldiers; one of the wounded soldiers discharged his musket and at that point the officers lost control of their men. The defending Itza soon fled from the withering Spanish gunfire.

The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss of life on the island; the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. Martín de Ursúa planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpetén as "Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza" ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Petén; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties. Kan Ekʼ was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.

Martín de Ursúa had little interest in administering the newly conquered territory and delegated its control to military officers who he did very little to support, either militarily or financially. With Nojpetén safely in the hands of the Spanish, Ursúa returned to Mérida, leaving Kan Ekʼ and other high-ranking members of his family as prisoners of the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, isolated among the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race "<a href="ladino%20people">ladino</a>" civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to Santiago; Ajaw Kan Ekʼ and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the colonial capital.

When the Spanish conquered the Petén lakes in 1697, the Yalain were initially cooperative and assisted in the capture of the king of the Itza. At this time Yalain was ruled by Chamach Xulu. The Yalain leadership encouraged Christian conversion as a means of maintaining peace with the occupying Spanish forces. As time went on, Yalain cooperation with the Spanish appears to have decreased. Soon after the conquest, the Yalain fled their settlements to avoid foraging Spanish parties that were abducting Maya women for "service" at their barracks. At this time, such was the hostility that was felt towards the occupying forces that the inhabitants of the Yalain settlements preferred to burn their fields and break all their pottery rather than leave anything for the Spanish. The Yalain capital is recorded as having been burned in 1698.

In the late 17th century, the small population of Chʼol Maya in southern Petén and Belize was forcibly removed to Alta Verapaz, where the people were absorbed into the Qʼeqchiʼ population. After the conquest, the colonial administration of Petén was divided between the ecclesiastical authorities in Yucatán and secular administration as part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. There was never a strong Spanish presence in the area, which remained remote, although the Spanish built a fortress-prison, the <a href="Castillo%20de%20Arismendi">Castillo de Arismendi</a>; it was finished in 1700.

The distance from Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo (formerly Nojpetén) to Mérida, combined with the difficult terrain and the hostility of the natives led to the road from Yucatán falling into a state of disrepair. In 1701 Ursúa y Arezmendi realised that the road was in such a poor state that the Spanish garrison could not be supplied from Yucatán. He wrote to the King of Spain, requesting that Petén be transferred from the jurisdiction of Yucatán to the "<a href="Audiencia%20Real">Audiencia Real</a>" of Guatemala. In 1703 Ursúa's petition was granted, with the condition that the ecclesiastical authority over Petén would pass to the Dominican Order.

Between 1703 and 1753, "reducciones" were established at San José and San Andrés on Lake Petén Itzá, Santa Ana just south of the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and <a href="Dolores%2C%20Pet%C3%A9n">Dolores</a> in the south (not to be confused with Dolores del Lakandon). Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the "<a href="vicar%20general">vicario general</a>" with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo. In the first decades of the 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andrés, San José and Santo Toribio. The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante. In 1699 there were nine priests in Petén but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Petén. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Petén, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucatán, and it was the Franciscans who oversaw the spiritual welfare of Petén during the colonial period.

AjTut was one of the lords of the northern Chakʼan Itza province of the conquered Itza kingdom; friar Avendaño had met him during his expedition to Nojpetén. After the conquest he relocated from the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá to Mompana, a region lying between Lake Yaxha and the Classic period ruins of <a href="Tikal">Tikal</a>. For some years after the conquest he established the Mompana region as a refuge from the Spanish and engaged in internecine war against the surviving Kowoj to the south.

At the time of the fall of Nojpetén, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war. Although disease was responsible for the majority of deaths, Spanish expeditions and internecine warfare between indigenous groups also played their part.

Catholic priests from Yucatán founded several mission towns around Lake Petén Itzá in 1702–1703. The first towns to be concentrated into colonial "reducciones" were Ixtutz, which became the new town of <a href="San%20Jos%C3%A9%2C%20El%20Pet%C3%A9n">San José</a>, and neighbouring San Andrés, both on the north shore of Lake Petén Itzá. They were first subjugated by one of Ursúa's officers, Cristobal de Sologaistoa, before being passed into the care of the Dominican friars for the Christian conversion of the inhabitants. Surviving Itza and Kowoj were resettled in the new colonial towns by a mixture of persuasion and force. Kowoj and Itza leaders in these mission towns rebelled against their Spanish overlords in 1704 and almost retook Nojpetén, but although well-planned, the rebellion was quickly crushed. Its leaders were executed, and most of the mission towns were abandoned; by 1708 only about 6,000 Maya remained in central Petén. The reductions failed in large part because the missionaries charged with converting the inhabitants could not speak the <a href="Itza%CA%BC%20language">Itza language</a>.

Martín de Ursúa used his conquest of the Itza as a stepping stone to achieving the coveted post of <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Philippines">Governor-General of the Philippines</a>, which he took up in 1709. European-introduced diseases devastated the native population of Petén, with the effects of disease compounded by the psychological impact of defeat. The population around Lake Petén Itzá numbered between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1697. By 1714, a census recorded just over 3,000 individuals in Spanish Petén, including non-Indians. This number would not have included the so-called "wild" Maya living in the forest far from Spanish administration and control. By 1700 the new colonial capital of Petén was mainly inhabited by colonists, soldiers and convicts. During the second half of the 18th century, adult male Indians were heavily taxed, often being forced into <a href="Debt%20bondage">debt peonage</a>. Western Petén and neighbouring Chiapas remained sparsely populated, and the Maya inhabitants avoided contact with the Spanish.

San José, on the northwest shore of lake Petén Itzá, is the home of the last surviving speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and no longer exist as separate ethnicities. In modern times there is a history of conflict between San José (the former Itza town of Chakokʼot) and neighbouring San Andrés (the former Kowoj-allied town of Chakʼan), and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.

Hernán Cortés described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his "", in which he details his crossing of what is now Guatemala's Petén Department. <a href="Bernal%20D%C3%ADaz%20del%20Castillo">Bernal Díaz del Castillo</a> accompanied Cortés on the expedition to Honduras. He wrote a lengthy account of the conquest of Mexico and neighbouring regions, the "<a href="Historia%20verdadera%20de%20la%20conquista%20de%20la%20Nueva%20Espa%C3%B1a">Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España</a>" ("True History of the Conquest of New Spain"). His account was finished around 1568, some 40 years after the campaigns it describes; it includes his own description of the expedition. In 1688 colonial historian <a href="Diego%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Cogolludo">Diego López de Cogolludo</a> detailed the expeditions of the Spanish missionaries Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita in 1618 and 1619 in his "Los trés siglos de la dominación española en Yucatán o sea historia de esta provincia" ("The three centuries of Spanish domination in Yucatán, or the history of this province"); he based it upon Fuensalida's report, which is now lost.

Franciscan friar Andrés Avendaño y Loyola recorded his own account of his late 17th century journeys to Nojpetén, written in 1696 and entitled "Relación de las entradas que hize a la conversión de los gentiles Ytzaex" ("Account of the expeditions that I made to convert the Itza heathens"). When the Spanish finally conquered Petén in 1697 they produced a vast quantity of documentation. Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor was a Spanish colonial official who first held the post of relator of the <a href="Royal%20Audiencia%20and%20Chanciller%C3%ADa%20of%20Valladolid">Royal Chancery of Vallodalid</a> and later as that of the Council of the Indies. As such he had access to the large amount of colonial documents stored in the <a href="General%20Archive%20of%20the%20Indies">General Archive of the Indies</a>. From these he produced his "Historia de la Conquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la de el Lacandon, y otras naciones de indios barbaros, de la mediacion de el Reyno de Guatimala, a las provincias del Yucatan en la América Septentrional" ("History of the Conquest of the Province of the Itza, reduction, and advances in that of the Lakandon, and other nations of barbarous indians, and the intervention of the Kingdom of Guatemala, and the provinces of Yucatan in Northern America"). This was first published in Madrid in 1701 and detailed the history of Petén from 1525 through to 1699.

Ursúa referred to the western port town of Chʼichʼ as "Nich". The modern name for a point on the south side of the bay is Punta Nijtún, which is probably derived from the colonial Yucatec "nix tun", meaning stone ramp. Archaeologists carried out excavations at the lake shore at Punta Nijtún and discovered a stone ramp there, which was probably built by Ursúa's troops to launch his "galeota".

British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War

The United Kingdom began a military intervention in <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> on 7 May 2000 under the codename Operation Palliser. Although small numbers of British personnel had been deployed previously, Palliser was the first large-scale intervention by British forces in the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Civil%20War">Sierra Leone Civil War</a>. In early May 2000, the <a href="Revolutionary%20United%20Front">Revolutionary United Front</a> (RUF)—one of the main parties to the civil war—advanced on the country's capital, <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>, prompting the British government to dispatch an "operational reconnaissance and liaison team" (ORLT) to prepare to evacuate foreign citizens. On 6 May, the RUF blocked the road connecting Freetown to the country's main airport, <a href="Lungi%20International%20Airport">Lungi</a>. The next day, British soldiers began to secure the airport and other areas essential to an evacuation. The majority of those who wished to leave were evacuated within the first two days of the operation, but many chose to stay following the arrival of British forces.

After the effective completion of the evacuation, the mandate of the British forces began to expand. They assisted with the evacuation of besieged peacekeepers—including several British ceasefire observers—and began to assist the <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Sierra%20Leone">United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone</a> (UNAMSIL) and the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Army">Sierra Leone Army</a> (SLA). Despite the mission expansion, it was not until 17 May that British soldiers came into direct contact with the RUF. The rebels attacked a British position near Lungi airport, but were forced to retreat after a series of firefights. On the same day, the RUF's leader, <a href="Foday%20Sankoh">Foday Sankoh</a>, was captured by Sierra Leonean forces, leaving the RUF in disarray. After deciding that the RUF would not disarm voluntarily, the British began training the SLA for a confrontation. During the training mission, a patrol returning from a visit to Jordanian peacekeepers was taken captive by a militia group known as the <a href="West%20Side%20Boys">West Side Boys</a>. Negotiations achieved the release of five of the eleven soldiers, and three weeks into the crisis, British special forces launched a mission codenamed <a href="Operation%20Barras">Operation Barras</a>, freeing the remaining six. The success of Operation Barras restored confidence in the British mission; one academic suggested that its failure would have forced the British government to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.

The overall British operation was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic sanctions, were exerted on <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>—which had supported the RUF in exchange for <a href="conflict%20diamonds">conflict diamonds</a> smuggled out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged the latter to enter the <a href="Disarmament%2C%20Demobilisation%2C%20and%20Reintegration">Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration</a> (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an international force, the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued to be involved in Sierra Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring of Sierra Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests were made by the <a href="Special%20Court%20for%20Sierra%20Leone">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a>. The success of British operations in Sierra Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several <a href="EU%20Battlegroup">European Union Battlegroups</a> for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.

<a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> is a country in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, close to the equator, with an area of 71,740 square kilometres (27,700 square miles)—similar in size to South Carolina or Scotland. It shares land borders with <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a> and Liberia and is bordered to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The country became a <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Colony%20and%20Protectorate">British colony</a> in 1808, though British influence began in the late 18th century when former slaves were settled in the area that became known as <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>, now the capital city. Freetown lies on a peninsula, and is separated from the country's main airport, <a href="Lungi%20International%20Airport">Lungi</a>, by the estuary of the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20River">Sierra Leone River</a>, which is several miles wide. The colony was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1961 and Sir <a href="Milton%20Margai">Milton Margai</a> was appointed its first prime minister. He was replaced in 1962 by his brother, <a href="Albert%20Margai">Albert</a>, who was defeated by <a href="Siaka%20Stevens">Siaka Stevens</a> in the 1967 general election. Stevens was overthrown within hours by the commander of the army, but was later reinstated after the commander was himself overthrown. Sierra Leone became a republic in 1971, and Stevens was installed as its first president.

In 1978, Sierra Leone formally became a one-party state and the <a href="All%20People%27s%20Congress">All People's Congress</a> (APC) became the only legal political party. Stevens retired in 1985 and appointed <a href="Joseph%20Momoh">Joseph Momoh</a> as his successor. Momoh was accused of corruption and abuse of power, and the <a href="Revolutionary%20United%20Front">Revolutionary United Front</a> (RUF) was formed later in the decade with the aim of overthrowing him. Sponsored by Liberia, the RUF began attacking settlements along the border in 1991 and quickly took control of the diamond mines, whose products they smuggled through Liberia and traded for weapons. The following years saw a series of coups and interventions by <a href="private%20military%20companies">private military companies</a>, Nigeria, the <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States">Economic Community of West African States</a>, and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN), while a bloody civil war devastated the country.

On 7 July 1999, the <a href="Lom%C3%A9%20Peace%20Accord">Lomé Peace Accord</a> was signed. Among other provisions, the agreement mandated an immediate ceasefire between the main parties to the civil war and the disarmament of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Sierra%20Leone%20Armed%20Forces">Sierra Leone Army</a> (SLA) and the RUF. It also gave the RUF status as a legitimate political party, a role in the Sierra Leone Government, and four of the twenty-two seats in the cabinet. <a href="Foday%20Sankoh">Foday Sankoh</a>, leader of the RUF, was given responsibility for the diamond mines—an appointment much criticised by observers and the international media given the RUF's history of diamond smuggling. However, <a href="Peter%20Hain">Peter Hain</a>, Minister of State for Africa, suggested that the British government had no choice but to endorse the Lomé agreement given the RUF's dominance, and that the only alternative was continued civil war. A military intervention by the United Kingdom in 1999 was ruled out as the British government had received no request for military assistance and felt it lacked the backing of the international community for a unilateral intervention. An intervention was also deemed to be politically and militarily impractical given the British military's involvement with <a href="NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">NATO operations in Yugoslavia</a>.

The intervention in Sierra Leone was the fourth expeditionary operation and the second significant deployment undertaken by <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Armed%20Forces">Her Majesty's Armed Forces</a> under <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>, who was elected as Prime Minister in 1997. The first two were relatively minor operations: a series of air strikes against Iraq in 1998 codenamed <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Fox">Operation Desert Fox</a>, and a deployment of a company of <a href="Gurkha">Gurkha</a>s and <a href="British%20Special%20Forces">special forces</a> on peacekeeping operations in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> in 1999. The third operation, the first major deployment under Blair, was in Kosovo in 1999, where British forces led a <a href="NATO">NATO</a> intervention in the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a>.

During the British operations in Kosovo, Blair delivered a speech in Chicago, in which he outlined his "Doctrine of the International Community". Blair advocated a greater use of <a href="humanitarian%20intervention">humanitarian intervention</a>—the use of armed force to protect a civilian population, rather than exclusively to protect national interests. Kosovo did not diminish Blair's belief in the use of military force for humanitarian purposes "where a strong moral case could be made", and he outlined a set of criteria for intervention. The intervention in Sierra Leone, according to Andrew M. Dorman of <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a>, "appears to embody much of the ethos contained within [the Chicago speech]".

The intervention in May 2000 was the first major deployment of British forces to Sierra Leone during the civil war, but was not the first time British personnel had served there. In May 1997, a two-man training team from the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> was sent to train SLA officers but discovered that the SLA's strength was much lower than it had reported. The government was overthrown in a coup before any training could take place. Following the restoration of the elected government by the <a href="Economic%20Community%20of%20West%20African%20States%20Monitoring%20Group">Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group</a> (ECOMOG) in February 1998, <a href="HMS%20Cornwall%20%28F99%29">HMS "Cornwall"</a> sailed to Freetown with food and medical supplies. Her crew assisted with infrastructure repairs and her helicopter was used to move people and supplies around Sierra Leone until she left in mid-April. As the security situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated later in the year, the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Spartic over Christmas 1998. Approximately 80 people—predominantly British citizens, many of them staff or dependants from the British High Commission—were evacuated over two days.

In January 1999, the RUF attacked Freetown. They were pushed back to the eastern edges of the city by ECOMOG, after which <a href="HMS%20Norfolk%20%28F230%29">HMS "Norfolk"</a> was sent to offer assistance. On arrival, a team from the <a href="Department%20for%20International%20Development">Department for International Development</a> (DfID) was based on board the ship to assist the crew's efforts. <a href="Peter%20Penfold">Peter Penfold</a>, the British High Commissioner—who had been evacuated to Guinea—temporarily lived on the ship before it was deemed safe for him to return to his residence in Freetown. He flew ashore on the "Norfolk"s helicopter for daily meetings, with a detachment of Royal Marines ensuring security. HMS "Norfolk" was replaced by <a href="HMS%20Westminster%20%28F237%29">HMS "Westminster"</a>, shortly after which Penfold moved back to his residence and the Royal Marines took over security of the compound temporarily.

The fighting was eventually ended by the Lomé Peace Accord, which was signed in July 1999. The United Nations Observer Mission to Sierra Leone was replaced with the <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Sierra%20Leone">United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone</a> (UNAMSIL), which included a force of 260 military observers. The observers were unarmed and tasked with monitoring the ceasefire mandated by the Lomé Agreement. The observer force, like UNAMSIL itself, was primarily made up of personnel from other African nations, but the United Kingdom contributed a small number of officers from the British Army and Royal Marines. In addition to the observers in Sierra Leone, personnel from the <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a> were serving in New York, assisting UNAMSIL with organising air-lifts to bring the mission up to its authorised strength.

In accordance with the Lomé Agreement, UNAMSIL set up disarmament camps throughout Sierra Leone that were intended to disarm the Sierra Leone Army, the RUF, and the militia groups operating in the country. The SLA and some militia groups began to enter the camps but the RUF did not. In April 2000, 10 members of the RUF entered a UNAMSIL camp without the knowledge of the RUF's leadership. Upon locating its fighters, the RUF demanded their return. The military observers refused, and the RUF responded by besieging the camp and attacking other UNAMSIL bases in the area. They took large numbers of UN personnel prisoner, and then began to advance into areas previously controlled by the Sierra Leone government. On 3 May, the RUF took control of the town of <a href="Kambia%20%28Sierra%20Leone%29">Kambia</a>. Foreign diplomats in the country estimated that the RUF could be in Freetown within a week, since the SLA had been confined to barracks and had handed over most of its weapons in accordance with the Lomé Agreement. The United Nations issued a statement condemning the violence, after which Secretary-General <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> told the British representative to the UN that it expected the United Kingdom, as the former colonial power, to intervene in Sierra Leone directly, rather than relying on the international community.

On 5 May 2000, the British government continued to state that it would provide only logistical and technical support to UNAMSIL, but was privately exploring its options for a military deployment. The United Kingdom had a greater level of political involvement in Sierra Leone than in any other African country and, with the country's stability deteriorating, it was reluctant to see that investment wasted. In addition, an estimated 1,000 entitled personnel were in Sierra Leone, and the government feared for their safety. Academics have since suggested that the credibility of UNAMSIL and future UN peacekeeping operations would have been at stake had the mission in Sierra Leone been allowed to fail. The British Armed Forces were not as widely deployed in 2000 as they were to be later in the decade. The British Army had two brigades serving with NATO in the Balkans, and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD) had ongoing commitments to Cyprus, the Falkland Islands, and elsewhere, but the armed forces—particularly units threatened by proposed cuts to the defence budget—were keen to participate in an operation. Senior officers thus advised the government that an operation in Sierra Leone was feasible. Over the following days, there was debate within the British government as to what the aims of a military deployment to Sierra Leone would be. The <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> (FCO) advocated a full-scale intervention to assist UNAMSIL, arguing that a non-combatant evacuation operation would not be sufficient and would undermine the UN, but the MoD believed that the armed forces would be unable to sustain a larger-scale operation.
The British government's emergency committee, <a href="Cabinet%20Office%20Briefing%20Room">COBRA</a>, was convened and presented with three options for an evacuation of entitled persons—deployment of aircraft and special forces to conduct an evacuation via Lungi airport, deployment of regular ground forces for a similar operation, or re-routing the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG). COBRA concluded that it lacked sufficient information to recommend one of the three options and instructed the MoD to continue to develop them, while also recommending that an "operational reconnaissance and liaison team" (ORLT) be sent to Sierra Leone to assess the situation and advise on how the military could be useful. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, approved the ORLT, which was led by Brigadier <a href="David%20Richards%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">David Richards</a>, Chief of Joint Force Operations. Richards had previously visited Sierra Leone twice during the civil war—first on HMS "Norfolk" in early 1999 and again in early 2000—and was familiar with the political leadership of the country. He and his team left from <a href="RAF%20Northolt">RAF Northolt</a> eight hours later accompanied by a close protection force, and arrived in Freetown in the early hours of 6 May. The ORLT established itself in the British High Commission in Freetown, where daily political–military coordination meetings were held throughout the operation.

The readiness of several other assets was heightened on 5 May. Two <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> vessels—the aircraft carrier and the frigate —were ordered to sail to the area, as was the ARG (which had been on exercise in southern France). The standby special forces squadron and <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment</a> (1 PARA), were both ordered to prepare for a potential operation in Sierra Leone; and several RAF transport aircraft were taken off other duties and ordered to be prepared to airlift special forces and/or 1 PARA to Lungi airport. At the same time, four RAF <a href="CH-47%20Chinook">CH-47 Chinook</a>s were ordered to deploy to Sierra Leone—two from the Balkans and two from their base in the United Kingdom. The RAF lacked aircraft large enough to transport Chinooks and so the helicopter crews flew themselves to Freetown. The flight undertaken by the two aircraft based in the UK was the longest self-deployment of helicopters in British history.

On 6 May 2000, the RUF blocked the road connecting <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a> to <a href="Lungi%20Airport">Lungi Airport</a>, prompting <a href="United%20Nations%20Mission%20in%20Sierra%20Leone">UNAMSIL</a> staff to evacuate to the Mamy Yoko Hotel in preparation for a total withdrawal from Sierra Leone if the RUF advance continued towards Freetown. In response to the deterioration Richards requested that British troops be sent to <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, Senegal, to decrease the time required to launch an operation in Sierra Leone. Richards also spoke to the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1 PARA</a> command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the <a href="Duke%20of%20Gloucester%20Barracks">Air Movements Centre</a> in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority to launch an evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, <a href="Alan%20Jones%20%28diplomat%29">Alan Jones</a>.

With the RUF rapidly advancing on Freetown and controlling most of the interior of Sierra Leone, the only means of rapidly evacuating entitled persons or reinforcing UNAMSIL was by air via Lungi airport. Thus, the enhanced 1 PARA was flown to Dakar on 7 May, where C Company and the special forces squadron were almost immediately put aboard RAF <a href="Hercules%20C-130">Hercules C-130</a>s with orders to secure the airport. They arrived at Lungi before sunset and were joined by the remaining elements of 1 PARA the next morning. The soldiers were able to deploy rapidly and with minimal equipment, knowing that they would not have to wait long for the ARG's reinforcements and supplies should they be needed. The soldiers immediately set about securing the areas that would be vital to an evacuation, including the Mamy Yoko hotel, which became the evacuation centre, and Lungi airport. Jones requested in the afternoon of 8 May that Richards commence the evacuation—codenamed Operation Palliser—which Richards did almost immediately. Entitled persons who wished to leave were instructed to assemble at the Mamy Yoko hotel. From there, they would be helicoptered to the airport by Chinooks and then flown to Dakar.

Over the course of a week, British forces evacuated approximately 500 entitled persons from Sierra Leone—almost 300 of whom left in the first two days of the operation. The arrival of British soldiers boosted morale in the country, and many foreign citizens opted to stay. The operation took on a slower pace after the first two days, but personnel and aircraft remained ready to evacuate any entitled persons who had been unable to reach Freetown earlier and to evacuate the British High Commission if the security situation deteriorated.

In <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Westminster</a>, the three government departments concerned with the British role in Sierra Leone—the MoD, the FCO, and DfID—struggled to agree on the objectives of the military deployment beyond the evacuation, which led to delays in issuing orders. Richards did not receive precise instructions until after Operation Palliser had commenced, and <a href="rules%20of%20engagement">rules of engagement</a> (ROEs) were not issued before the start of the operation. Commanders defaulted to the ROEs used in Northern Ireland, their most recent relevant experience.

With the evacuation largely complete, the British government turned its attention to the four British United Nations Military Observers (<a href="United%20Nations%20Military%20Observers">UNMOs</a>) being held by the RUF. British forces in Freetown helped facilitate the escape of four UNMOs (three British and one from New Zealand) from a UNAMSIL camp at <a href="Makeni">Makeni</a>, which had been besieged by the RUF since ten RUF fighters had been accepted into the disarmament process. After consulting with the British command in Freetown, the four officers left the camp and covertly passed the RUF line before trekking west. They arrived at the UN base at <a href="Mile%2091">Mile 91</a> almost 24 hours later, and an RAF Chinook picked them up and flew them to Freetown. No longer having the unarmed observers to protect, the Kenyan UNAMSIL detachment at Makeni fought their way out of the siege and proceeded west to join other UNAMSIL forces. With the three British officers from Makeni freed, only one British UNMO—Major Andy Harrison—remained a prisoner of the RUF, and the British government began discreetly attempting to establish his location. Harrison and ten other UNMOs had initially been held by the RUF at the latter's base until Harrison convinced the RUF to allow the observers to join the Indian UNAMSIL contingent at <a href="Kailahun">Kailahun</a>.

In addition to the missing UNMOs, the British government faced political and diplomatic problems. The deployment of British troops to Sierra Leone had lifted morale and halted the RUF advance on Freetown, and there were concerns that violence would resume once the British left. Another consequence of the British operation was that it effectively sidelined UNAMSIL. The United Nations and several of the contributing nations to UNAMSIL applied pressure on the British government to integrate its forces into UNAMSIL, but the MoD lacked faith in the competence of UNAMSIL headquarters and was unwilling to place its troops under UNAMSIL command. The MoD was also reluctant to deploy the brigade-sized force necessary to take command of UNAMSIL, given the armed forces' commitments elsewhere, and thus the British force in Sierra Leone remained outside UNAMSIL. The British government was also reluctant to commit British troops to an open-ended peacekeeping operation, especially given the opposition in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">House of Commons</a>—particularly from the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>—to the initial deployment to Sierra Leone, and accusations from the British media of "<a href="mission%20creep">mission creep</a>". By contrast, the operation was well-received on the international stage, and met with the approval of the UN Security Council.

On 12 May, <a href="Elizabeth%20Symons%2C%20Baroness%20Symons%20of%20Vernham%20Dean">Baroness Symons</a>, a junior minister in the MoD, told the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the evacuation point in Freetown to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of Freetown in an attempt to reassure residents. HMS "Illustrious", with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from "Illustrious" began flying reassurance patrols over Freetown and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, should it be necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and Freetown might not be able to stand up to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President <a href="Ahmad%20Kabbah">Ahmad Kabbah</a> formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled <a href="Civil%20Defence%20Force">Civil Defence Force</a> and the <a href="West%20Side%20Boys">West Side Boys</a>) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by <a href="Harrier%20Jump%20Jet">Harriers</a> and a <a href="Nimrod%20R1">Nimrod R1</a>.
The RUF continued to advance, resulting in sporadic confrontations with UNAMSIL and government forces, until on 17 May they came into direct contact with British forces. The <a href="Pathfinder%20Platoon">Pathfinder Platoon</a> had stationed itself at <a href="Lungi%20Lol">Lungi Lol</a>, a village north of Freetown close to Lungi airport, and shortly after were <a href="Lungi%20Lol%20confrontation">confronted by a group of RUF members</a>. The resulting series of firefights lasted several hours, after which the RUF withdrew, having suffered 30 casualties. According to Richards, the British success in the confrontation provided an "immense" psychological victory and a deterrent against further attacks. Foday Sankoh, leader of the RUF, was captured later the same day by forces loyal to President Kabbah and handed over to the <a href="Sierra%20Leone%20Police">Sierra Leone Police</a>, but had to be evacuated by an RAF Chinook after a hostile crowd gathered outside the building in which he was held. Sankoh's capture created a power vacuum at the top of the RUF and the subsequent in-fighting provided an opportunity for the MoD to order a rotation of forces deployed in Sierra Leone. The 1 PARA battlegroup was ordered back to the United Kingdom to resume its spearhead role as the permanent stand-by battalion that would form the basis of any emergency deployment, while <a href="42%20Commando">42 Commando</a>, Royal Marines, came ashore to replace the soldiers.

In Whitehall, the British government laid out its longer-term objectives for the military intervention in Sierra Leone on 23 May. These were: to establish sustainable peace and security in Sierra Leone, to support UNAMSIL operations, to prevent another humanitarian disaster in Freetown, to see the release of captive UN personnel, and finally to avoid British casualties and devise an exit strategy that avoided "mission creep" without undermining UNAMSIL or the Sierra Leonean government.

The British government was particularly keen to secure the release of Major Andy Harrison—the last British UNMO being held by the RUF. Harrison's contingent of UNMOs was protected by an Indian Army detachment. The <a href="8%20Gorkha%20Rifles">Indian Army Gurkhas</a>—attached to UNAMSIL—were under siege by the RUF at their base in Kailahun. The British and Indian commands in Sierra Leone had devised a plan to extract the UNMOs. British special forces remained in the country, ready to carry it out, but the UN and the British command feared that the RUF would retaliate against other UNAMSIL forces they had besieged if the UNMOs were extracted. Thus, Major General <a href="Vijay%20Kumar%20Jetley">Vijay Kumar Jetley</a>, Commander of UNAMSIL, was allowed to continue negotiations for the release of the other besieged UNAMSIL contingents.

When the last besieged garrison (aside from Kailahun) was evacuated on 30 May, preparations for a military extraction—should Jetley's negotiations fail—began to increase. The operation (codenamed Operation Khukri) was eventually launched on 10 July. Two RAF Chinooks transported Indian special forces to the outskirts of Kailahun. The helicopters returned to Freetown with Harrison, his fellow UNMOs, and several Gurkhas who had been wounded during the siege. Harrison was safely extracted and the 600 Gurkhas fought their way out of Kailahun, suffering one casualty in the process.

The British government had decided that the RUF could not be trusted, and would have to be confronted and forced to enter the UN's <a href="Disarmament%2C%20Demobilisation%2C%20and%20Reintegration">Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration</a> (DDR) process. They assessed that there were three options available to achieve this—to deploy British forces against the RUF, for UNAMSIL to expand its operations and confront the RUF, or for the Sierra Leonean government to use loyal forces (the SLA, former SLA personnel, the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Revolutionary%20Council">Armed Forces Revolutionary Council</a>, and several other militia groups) to take on the RUF. Richards estimated that a British deployment against the RUF would require at least a brigade-sized force (in excess of 5,000 troops). Nevertheless, British forces' involvement in Sierra Leone was politically unpopular in Westminster and the MoD could not assemble such a force while maintaining its commitments elsewhere, so the use of British forces to directly confront the RUF was ruled out. Also ruled out was a UNAMSIL-led confrontation. Although UNAMSIL's mandate would have allowed it to enter into combat with the RUF, the national contingents were reluctant to leave their bases and its focus remained on peacekeeping rather than the peace enforcement that the British and others believed was necessary.

This left the SLA and the alliance of militia groups—which became known as the "<a href="Unholy%20Alliance%20%28Sierra%20Leone%29">Unholy Alliance</a>", and was directed by a "Joint Military Committee"—the only forces capable of confronting the RUF. The SLA had been disarmed through the UN's DDR process; to restructure it and allow it to re-arm, the UN lifted its arms embargo on Sierra Leone, and the British forces began advising and training the SLA. An international team had been planned to deploy to Sierra Leone to assist the SLA with longer-term development and democratic accountability, and a British Short-Term Training Team (STTT) deployed simultaneously to improve the SLA's infantry skills. The STTT mission was codenamed Operation Basilica and based at the Benguema Training Centre, an abandoned barracks near <a href="Waterloo%2C%20Sierra%20Leone">Waterloo</a> that had been refurbished for the purpose. The first unit to take on the role was based around 2nd Battalion, The <a href="Royal%20Anglian%20Regiment">Royal Anglian Regiment</a>, and comprised approximately 250 personnel, including 45 instructors and a force protection company. The Anglians arrived at Benguema on 15 June to train 1,000 SLA recruits, and the ARG withdrew. The training at Benguema included instruction on the Geneva Convention, unit cohesiveness, and other skills and knowledge to build the SLA into a professional army.

Despite the British training, the SLA was not large enough or strong enough to enter into combat with the RUF while also holding the ground it had recaptured, so the British persuaded UNAMSIL to move forward behind the advancing SLA to defend its recaptured ground. Additional British liaison officers were attached to UNAMSIL, and the British facilitated a daily coordination meeting for SLA and UNAMSIL commanders, while also assisting the UN forces in drawing up a campaign plan.

The Anglians were replaced by a detachment of 1st Battalion, The <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Regiment%20%281992%29">Royal Irish Regiment</a>, formed around C Company. On 25 August, a patrol from the Royal Irish went to visit a militia group known as the West Side Boys (WSB). At the village of Magbeni, where the WSB were based, the Royal Irish were overpowered and taken captive. British officers undertook negotiations with the WSB, leading to the release of five of the eleven soldiers on 31 August.

On 9 September, the WSB's spokesman stated that the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators to conclude that the increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led <a href="Cabinet%20Office%20Briefing%20Room">COBRA</a> to order an extraction mission.

The mission, codenamed Operation Barras, was undertaken by D Squadron of 22 <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> Regiment, who assaulted the village of Gberi Bana to extract the soldiers, while a company group formed around A Company, <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Parachute%20Regiment">1 PARA</a>, assaulted Magbeni, on the opposite side of <a href="Rokel%20River">Rokel Creek</a>. The operation was successful and all the British captives were extracted, along with their <a href="Republic%20of%20Sierra%20Leone%20Armed%20Forces">SLA</a> liaison and 22 Sierra Leonean civilians, while the WSB were defeated as a military force. A British soldier and at least 25 West Side Boys were killed in the operation. Many other West Side Boys fled and later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. The Jordanians had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight. Some of those who surrendered went on to volunteer for the new Sierra Leone Army, and those who were accepted went into the British-run training programme at Benguema. Following Operation Barras, two SLA battalions—graduates of the British short-term training programme—swept the area surrounding the West Side Boys' camp to clear it of any remaining gang members.

The risks of Operation Barras were acknowledged by the MoD and by officers involved in the planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as "not a clinical, black balaclava, <a href="Iranian%20Embassy%20siege">Princes Gate</a> type operation. It was a very grubby, green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Despite the risks, Richard Connaughton observed in "Small Wars & Insurgencies" that the operation showed the Blair government was not averse to the possibility of casualties when they felt the cause was just. During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, the British government came under pressure from opposition politicians to end the deployment to Sierra Leone, and Dorman suggested that the success or failure of Operation Barras was "inextricably linked" to the fate of the wider British operation. He suggested that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.

The capture of the Royal Irish patrol reinforced to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would not be sufficient to bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their objection to the continued presence of British forces in Sierra Leone. The government was seeking an exit strategy that would end a politically unpopular deployment without abandoning Sierra Leone.

In August 2000, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> passed <a href="UNSCR%201313">Resolution 1313</a>, which blamed the RUF for the continuing conflict in Sierra Leone, citing multiple breaches of the Lomé Peace Accord. The resolution authorised an increase in the size of UNAMSIL and strengthened its mandate, which prompted the UN to once again apply pressure to the British government for a troop contribution. Several countries were reluctant to send their own troops to Sierra Leone without contributions from Western nations, and felt that the United Kingdom in particular should be contributing to the UN mission.

Despite the political pressure, the MoD continued to lack confidence in UNAMSIL leadership. Thus, the British government refused to place combat troops under UN command, but did second additional staff officers to UNAMSIL, to the UN headquarters in New York, and to the SLA. The officers attached to UNAMSIL were tasked with assisting its commanders in planning and mounting operations and were led by a <a href="brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">brigadier</a> who became UNAMSIL's chief of staff, while in New York, the officers attached to UN headquarters provided planning support for logistics operations to bring UNAMSIL up to its mandated strength. At the same time, the focus of the British training programme shifted. Although six battalions had been trained, the SLA still lacked many combat support functions as well as command and control capabilities. The STTTs set out to improve the SLA's capabilities in these areas by providing the next set of recruits with more specialised training in addition to basic infantry training provided to the first intake. The British trainers also constructed an operations room at the SLA's headquarters and provided other support to improve the SLA's communications and logistical capabilities.

Resolution 1313 was a significant shift in attitude for UNAMSIL, away from its previous neutrality to support of the Sierra Leone government, a shift that made the governments of several troop-contributing nations uncomfortable. In particular, the governments of Jordan and India—two of the largest contributors, with nearly 5,000 troops between them serving with UNAMSIL—were moved to withdraw their forces. The withdrawal coincided with the end of the rainy season, after which there were fears that the RUF would resume its advance towards Freetown, and the UN and British government feared that UNAMSIL would be vulnerable. As a deterrent, the ARG was once more deployed off the coast, and was instructed to conduct amphibious landing demonstrations as a show of force.

The RUF was coming under increasing pressure from political angles as well as from the British-trained SLA. It was heavily dependent on Sierra Leone's south-eastern neighbour <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, led by <a href="Charles%20Taylor%20%28Liberian%20politician%29">Charles Taylor</a>, and derived the majority of its income from the sale of diamonds smuggled through Liberia, which became known as <a href="blood%20diamonds">blood diamonds</a>. In late 2000, the Sierra Leone government—supported by the British, UNAMSIL, and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)—entered into talks with the RUF. On 10 November, the two parties signed a 30-day ceasefire that provided for UNAMSIL to deploy throughout the entire country (it had previously been prevented from operating in many RUF-controlled areas), for the RUF to return seized weapons and equipment to UNAMSIL, and for the RUF to enter the DDR process. The ceasefire was later extended by a further 90 days. The UN Security Council embargoed Liberian diamonds in <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201343">Resolution 1343</a> in March 2001. Shortly afterwards, the RUF began large-scale disarmament and agreed to a simultaneous disarmament with the Civil Defence Force, a militia group loyal to the government. By September, over 16,000 militia members (including around 6,500 RUF) had been through the DDR process and the combatants in the diamond-producing areas had all disarmed.

By March 2002, over 50,000 people had been through the DDR process and the RUF had been entirely disarmed. A company of <a href="Brigade%20of%20Gurkhas">Gurkhas</a> and a Royal Navy frigate were sent to the area in March 2003 to ensure stability while several prominent people—including Charles Taylor of Liberia, cabinet minister <a href="Samuel%20Hinga%20Norman">Samuel Hinga Norman</a>, and several former RUF leaders—were arrested and indicted by the <a href="Special%20Court%20for%20Sierra%20Leone">Special Court for Sierra Leone</a>.

The last STTT, formed around 2nd Battalion, <a href="The%20Light%20Infantry">The Light Infantry</a>, left Sierra Leone at the end of September 2001. Approximately 8,500 SLA personnel were trained by the STTTs, which were replaced by the International Military Assistance and Training Team (IMATT)—an organisation formed of personnel from countries including Australia, Canada, and the United States, with the UK providing the largest contingent as well as an infantry company for force protection. The STTTs also formed a small <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> unit within the SLA—the Force Reconnaissance Unit (FRU)—to provide a morale boost and to give soldiers something to which they could aspire. Later in 2001, the British Army advised the Sierra Leonean government on a merger of Sierra Leone's armed forces into a unified command, which became the <a href="Republic%20of%20Sierra%20Leone%20Armed%20Forces">Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces</a> in early 2002. In 2008, the permanent British contingent in Sierra Leone was reduced to 100 personnel. British soldiers remained in Sierra Leone as of 2013, continuing to form part of the IMATT, whose size has further reduced in accordance with the increased capabilities of the Sierra Leone armed forces.

According to Penfold, who served as High Commissioner until the week before the deployment of British troops, "The fact that the major country in the region, i.e. Nigeria, and a permanent member of the UN Security Council, i.e. the UK, took an active interest was crucial in resolving the conflict". On the other hand, he believed that the international community had failed to recognise that the Sierra Leone Civil War was part of a larger conflict in the sub-region, and "it was not until the problem of Charles Taylor and Liberia was addressed that the conflict was resolved". In a later book, Penfold praised Richards' leadership of the operation, stating that it was "extremely fortunate that Operation Palliser was under the command of an officer of the calibre of David Richards, with his knowledge of the situation and his experience and commitment. David Richards knew that with the resources available he could do more than just assist an evacuation ... he realised that he could actively stabilise the situation". Richards received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his leadership of British forces in Sierra Leone, while several other personnel received decorations for gallantry or distinguished service.

The intervention in Sierra Leone was the fourth deployment of British forces abroad during the premiership of Tony Blair, and the largest operation undertaken by the United Kingdom alone since the <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a> (1982). It was the second major operation of the Blair government, after Kosovo. During his remaining time in office, British forces undertook operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, but Sierra Leone was the only unilateral operation. Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq, the intervention in Sierra Leone was widely regarded as successful. It became a "benchmark" for successful expeditionary operations, and was cited by Blair in his rationale for later deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. Success in Sierra Leone encouraged the Blair government to continue its support to Africa, particularly with regard to resolving conflicts.

Sierra Leone also encouraged Blair's policy of humanitarian intervention. Critics claimed that it led Blair to see military force as "just another foreign policy option" and that the apparent ease of the success shifted his focus towards the effectiveness of the use of force rather than the political and military risks. In his autobiography, Blair described the operation as one of the least-discussed aspects of his time in office but one of the things of which he is most proud. He was keen to intervene in other African nations where civilian populations were at risk, particularly Darfur and Zimbabwe, but a lack of political support, combined with the pressure of large deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq after the <a href="11%20September%20attacks">11 September attacks</a> on the United States, prevented further interventions in Africa. It was not until 2011—when <a href="Operation%20Ellamy">Operation Ellamy</a> was launched as part of a <a href="2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">multi-national intervention</a> in Libya—that the United Kingdom undertook another military intervention in Africa.

The experience in Sierra Leone proved the effectiveness of relatively small numbers of well trained and equipped soldiers. It inspired the British government to work more closely with European allies, particularly France after the latter led <a href="Operation%20Artemis">Operation Artemis</a>, a UN-mandated intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003. After a summit in 2003, the two governments called on the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU) to develop the capability to rapidly deploy a battle group of around 1,500 personnel able to respond to crises, particularly in Africa. The member states of the EU approved the creation of <a href="EU%20Battlegroup">13 battle groups</a> in 2004.
Sierra Leone convinced Blair and his Defence Secretary <a href="Geoff%20Hoon">Geoff Hoon</a> of the need to alter the focus of British defence policy towards less conventional conflicts and away from more traditional wars between states. The MoD published a <a href="white%20paper">white paper</a> in 2003, "Delivering Security in a Changing World", which revisited aspects of the 1998 "<a href="Strategic%20Defence%20Review">Strategic Defence Review</a>" (SDR). The SDR had focused on the Middle East and North Africa, and had not envisaged a need to deploy troops to sub-Saharan Africa other than for a potential non-combatant evacuation operation in Zimbabwe. Thus, the white paper recommended preparations for relatively short, intense operations against forces with inferior technology, with a particular focus on Africa.

The rapidity with which forces were required to deploy to Sierra Leone emphasised the need for the United Kingdom to retain high-readiness forces. That need also vindicated concepts such as the ARG and the spearhead battalion (the capacity in which 1 PARA was serving when it deployed), and protected 1 PARA in the 2004 review of the infantry structure. The 2004 review reduced the total number of British Army battalions from 40 to 36 and created the <a href="Special%20Forces%20Support%20Group">Special Forces Support Group</a> (SFSG), which was inspired by the success of 1 PARA in Operation Barras. The SFSG—initially formed around 1 PARA—provides specialist capabilities or acts as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. As the largest unilateral operation undertaken by the United Kingdom since their creation, the intervention in Sierra Leone was the first major test of the ORLT and joint task force concepts. Both were created as a result of the 1997 SDR and provide a headquarters staff at very high readiness to command an expeditionary operation at <a href="operational%20level%20of%20war">operational level</a>. According to Richards, both were "thoroughly validated" and were vital in coordinating the large numbers of assets deployed at short notice and reporting back to the <a href="Permanent%20Joint%20Headquarters">Permanent Joint Headquarters</a> in Northwood.

A 2015 study in the "Journal of Strategic Studies" finds that the intervention in Sierra Leone was a success.

Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7

The Leningrad première of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 took place on 9 August 1942 during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, while the city of <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a> (now St. Petersburg) was <a href="Siege%20of%20Leningrad">under siege</a> by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> forces.

<a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Dmitri Shostakovich</a> had intended <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Shostakovich%29">the piece</a> to be premièred by the <a href="Saint%20Petersburg%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, but because of the siege, that group was evacuated from the city, as was the composer himself. The world première of the symphony was held on 5 March in <a href="Samara%2C%20Russia">Kuybyshev</a> with the <a href="Bolshoi%20Theatre">Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra</a>. The Leningrad première was performed by the surviving musicians of the <a href="Leningrad%20Radio%20Orchestra">Leningrad Radio Orchestra</a>, supplemented with military performers. Most of the musicians were suffering from <a href="Effect%20of%20the%20Siege%20of%20Leningrad%20on%20the%20city%23Food%20shortages">starvation</a>, which made rehearsing difficult: musicians frequently collapsed during rehearsals, and three died. The orchestra was able to play the symphony all the way through only once before the concert.

Despite the poor condition of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert was supported by a <a href="Northern%20Front%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Soviet military</a> offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence <a href="Army%20Group%20North">German forces</a> during the performance. The symphony was broadcast to the German lines by loudspeaker as a form of <a href="psychological%20warfare">psychological warfare</a>. The Leningrad première was considered by music critics to be one of the most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and <a href="Music%20and%20political%20warfare">political effects</a>. The conductor concluded that "in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine". Reunion concerts featuring surviving musicians were convened in 1964 and 1992 to commemorate the event.

Soviet composer Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975) completed his <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Shostakovich%29">Symphony No. 7</a> on 27 December 1941 and dedicated it to his native Leningrad. At the time the city was about 16 weeks into its <a href="Siege%20of%20Leningrad">900-day siege</a> by Nazi German forces, which would kill about a third of the city's pre-war population.

Shostakovich wanted the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra to première the symphony, but that group had been evacuated to <a href="Novosibirsk">Novosibirsk</a> as part of the government-led cultural exodus. The world première was instead held in Kuybyshev on 5 March 1942, performed by the Bolshoi Theatre Orchestra under conductor <a href="Samuil%20Samosud">Samuil Samosud</a>. The Moscow première was given by a combination of the Bolshoi and the <a href="Tchaikovsky%20Symphony%20Orchestra%20of%20Moscow%20Radio">All-Union Radio</a> orchestras on 29 March in the <a href="House%20of%20the%20Unions">Columned Hall of the House of Unions</a>.

The microfilmed <a href="Sheet%20music%23Full%20scores%2C%20variants%20and%20condensations">score</a> of the symphony was flown to <a href="Tehran%23Late%20modern%20era">Tehran</a> in April to allow its promulgation to the West. It received its radio première in Western Europe on 22 June, in a performance broadcast by <a href="Henry%20Wood">Henry Wood</a> and the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, and its concert première at a <a href="The%20Proms">Promenade</a> concert at London's <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> on 29 June. The North American première was broadcast from New York City on 19 July 1942 by the <a href="NBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a> under <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>.

The Leningrad Radio Orchestra under <a href="Karl%20Eliasberg">Karl Eliasberg</a> was the only remaining symphonic ensemble in Leningrad after the Philharmonic was evacuated. The Radio Orchestra's last performance had taken place on 14 December 1941 and its final broadcast on 1 January 1942. A log note from the next scheduled rehearsal reads "Rehearsal did not take place. Srabian is dead. Petrov is sick. Borishev is dead. Orchestra not working".

On 2 April 1942, Boris Zagorsky and Yasha Babushkin of the Leningrad city arts department announced preparations for the symphony's performance. The hiatus in musical broadcasts was quickly ended by <a href="Andrei%20Zhdanov">Andrei Zhdanov</a>, a Soviet politician involved in the defence of Leningrad, to allow for rehearsals and provide a morale boost for the city. Performing the symphony "became a matter of civic, even military, pride". According to an orchestra member, "the Leningrad authorities wanted to give the people some emotional stimulation so that they could feel cared for". It was considered an important political act because of its potential value as <a href="Propaganda%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">propaganda</a>.

Of the original 40-member Leningrad Radio Orchestra, only 14 or 15 still lived in the city; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Shostakovich's symphony required an <a href="Orchestra%23Expanded%20instrumentation">expanded orchestra</a> of 100 players, meaning the remaining personnel were grossly insufficient. Eliasberg, at the time being treated for "dystrophy", went door to door to seek out those musicians who had not responded to the orchestra's reassembly due to starvation or weakness. "My God, how thin many of them were," one of the organizers remembered. "How those people livened up when we started to ferret them out of their dark apartments. We were moved to tears when they brought out their concert clothes, their violins and cellos and flutes, and rehearsals began under the icy canopy of the studio." A plane carrying supplies from Kuybyshev airlifted the symphony's 252-page conductor's score into Leningrad.

The first rehearsal in March 1942 was intended to be three hours long, but had to be stopped after 15 minutes because the 30 musicians present were too weak to play their instruments. They frequently collapsed during rehearsals, especially those playing <a href="brass%20section">brass instrument</a>s. Eliasberg himself had to be dragged to rehearsals on a sledge, and was eventually moved by Communist officials to an apartment nearby and given a bicycle for transport. His first attempts at conducting were like a "wounded bird with wings that are going to drop at any moment". A report by Babushkin noted that "the <a href="first%20violin">first violin</a> is dying, the <a href="percussion%20section">drum</a> died on his way to work, the <a href="French%20horn">French horn</a> is at death's door ...". Orchestral players were given additional rations (donated by civilian music enthusiasts) in an effort to combat starvation, and hot bricks were used to radiate heat; nevertheless, three performers died during rehearsals. Posters went up around the city requesting all musicians to report to the Radio Committee for incorporation into the orchestra. Performers were also recalled from the front or reassigned from Soviet military bands with the support of the Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, <a href="Leonid%20Govorov">Leonid Govorov</a>.

In addition to the Seventh Symphony, the makeshift orchestra also rehearsed traditional symphonic works by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>. A concert of Tchaikovsky excerpts was held on 5 April. Some players protested the decision to perform Shostakovich's symphony, not wanting to expend their little strength on an "intricate and not very accessible" work. Eliasberg threatened to rescind the additional rations, quelling any dissent. During the rehearsals, Eliasberg was criticised for his harsh demeanour: musicians who missed rehearsals, were late, or did not perform to expectations lost their rations. One performer lost rations because he had attended his wife's burial and was late for rehearsal. Although some sources suggest a team of copyists was employed, according to other sources musicians were made to copy out their individual parts by hand from the score.

Rehearsals were held six days a week at the Pushkin Theatre, usually from 10 am to 1 pm. They were frequently interrupted by air-raid sirens, and some musicians were required to undertake anti-aircraft or firefighting duties. To enable them to attend rehearsals, performers were granted orchestral ID cards to show at checkpoints. Members of the military orchestra (and some ordinary troops) were dispatched to the rehearsals to supplement the performers. Rehearsals were moved to the Philharmonia Hall in June, and in late July were increased to 5–6 hours a day. Instruments were in poor condition and few repairmen were available; one <a href="oboe">oboist</a> was asked for a cat in exchange for a repair, as the starving repairman had already eaten several.

The orchestra played the entire symphony all the way through only once before the première, at a dress rehearsal on 6 August.

The concert was given in the Grand Philharmonia Hall on 9 August 1942. This was the day German Chancellor <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had previously designated to celebrate the fall of the city with a lavish banquet at Leningrad's <a href="Hotel%20Astoria%20%28Saint%20Petersburg%29">Astoria Hotel</a>. The performance was preceded by a pre-recorded radio address by Eliasberg, aired at 6 pm:

Lieutenant-General Govorov ordered a bombardment of German artillery positions in advance of the concert in a special operation, code-named "Squall". Soviet intelligence personnel had located the German batteries and observation posts a few weeks before, in preparation for the attack. Three thousand high-calibre shells were lobbed onto the enemy. The purpose of the operation was to prevent the Germans from targeting the concert hall and to ensure that it would be quiet enough to hear the music over speakers he ordered to be set up. He also encouraged Soviet soldiers to listen to the concert via radio. Musicologist Andrei Krukov later praised Govorov's actions as providing the "incentive" for the concert, adding that his choice to allow soldiers to participate was "a quite exceptional decision". Govorov himself later remarked to Eliasberg that "we played our instrument in the symphony, too, you know," in reference to the artillery fire. The military contribution to the affair was not widely known until well after the war ended.

There was a large audience for the concert, comprising party leaders, military personnel, and civilians. Leningrad citizens who could not fit into the hall gathered around open windows and loudspeakers. The musicians onstage were "dressed like cabbages" in multiple layers to prevent starvation-induced shivering. Shortly before the concert started, the electric lights above the stage were turned on for the first time since rehearsals had commenced. As the hall fell silent, Eliasberg began conducting. The performance was of poor artistic quality, but was notable for the emotions raised in the audience and for its finale: when some musicians "faltered" due to exhaustion, the audience stood up "in a remarkable, spontaneous gesture ... willing them to keep going".

The performance received an hour-long ovation, with Eliasberg being given a bouquet of Leningrad-grown flowers by a young girl. Many in the audience were in tears due to the emotional impact of the concert, which was seen as a "musical biography of suffering Leningrad". The musicians were invited to a banquet with <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party</a> officials to celebrate.

Loudspeakers broadcast the performance throughout the city as well as to the German forces in a move of psychological warfare, a "tactical strike against German morale". One German soldier recalled how his squadron "listened to the symphony of heroes". Eliasberg later met with some of the Germans who camped outside Leningrad during the performance, who told him that it had made them believe they would never capture the city: "Who are we bombing? We will never be able to take Leningrad because the people here are selfless".

Shostakovich scholar <a href="Laurel%20Fay">Laurel Fay</a> suggests that this concert was "an event of legendary import all by itself". Journalist Michael Tumely calls it "a legendary moment in Soviet political and military history". Critic U.S. Dhuga suggests that this performance "was popularly – and, of course, officially – recognized as the prelude to actual victory over the Germans". The blockade was breached in early 1943 and ended in 1944. Eliasberg concurred with Dhuga's assessment, saying that "the whole city had found its humanity ... in that moment, we triumphed over the soulless Nazi war machine". There was no official recognition of the significance of the concert: one musician noted that afterwards "there was no feedback, nothing until 1945".

Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 enjoyed a measure of popularity throughout the Western world during the war, but from 1945 it was rarely performed outside the Soviet Union. It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after <a href="Solomon%20Volkov">Solomon Volkov</a>'s "<a href="Testimony%20%28book%29">Testimony</a>" suggested it was a critique not of the Nazis, but of the Soviet government. The veracity of Volkov's account, which he claims is rooted in interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated. Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it was inspired by the attack on Leningrad (as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted) or planned earlier and repurposed for propaganda, as well as its artistic merit compared to Shostakovich's other works.

The première made Eliasberg a "hero of the city". Shortly after the concert, he married Nina Bronnikova, who had played the piano part. But once the siege ended and the Philharmonic returned to Leningrad, he fell from favour. The conductor of the Philharmonic, <a href="Yevgeny%20Mravinsky">Yevgeny Mravinsky</a>, had him fired in 1950 because he envied Eliasberg's popular acclaim. Eliasberg was a "poor and largely forgotten" travelling conductor when he died in 1978. However, at the fifty-year anniversary of the première his remains were moved to the prestigious <a href="Volkovo%20Cemetery">Volkovskoye</a> or Alexander Nevsky Cemetery, the result of a campaign by orchestra archivist <a href="Galina%20Retrovskaya">Galina Retrovskaya</a>, conductor <a href="Yuri%20Temirkanov">Yuri Temirkanov</a>, and St. Petersburg mayor <a href="Anatoly%20Sobchak">Anatoly Sobchak</a>. <a href="Sarah%20Quigley">Sarah Quigley</a> fictionalized Eliasberg's wartime career in her historical novel "The Conductor".

Surviving performers participated in reunion concerts in 1964 and 1992, playing "from the same seats in the same hall". Shostakovich attended the first reunion concert on 27 January 1964. Twenty-two musicians and Eliasberg performed the symphony, and instruments were placed on the other chairs to represent those participants who had died since the première. The 1992 performance featured the 14 remaining survivors. The 1942 concert was also commemorated in the 1997 film "". There is a small museum dedicated to the event at School No. 235 in St. Petersburg, which includes a statue of Shostakovich and artefacts from the performance.

Three-cent nickel

The copper-nickel three-cent piece, often called a three-cent nickel piece or three-cent nickel, was designed by US Mint Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a> and struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> from 1865 to 1889. It was initially popular, but its place in commerce was supplanted by the five-cent piece, or <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a>.

With precious metal federal coinage hoarded during the economic turmoil of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, including the <a href="three-cent%20silver">silver three-cent piece</a>, and even the copper-nickel cent commanding a premium, Congress issued paper money in denominations as small as three cents to replace the hoarded coins in commerce. These small slips of paper became ragged and dirty, and the public came to hate "<a href="shinplaster">shinplaster</a>s". After the issuance in 1864 of a lighter bronze cent and a <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> of that metal, both of which circulated freely, there were proposals for a three-cent piece in copper-nickel to replace the three-cent note. The advocates were led by Pennsylvania industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>, who then controlled the domestic supply of <a href="nickel">nickel</a> ore. On the last legislative day of the congressional session, March 3, 1865, a bill for a three-cent piece in copper-nickel alloy was introduced in Congress, passed both houses without debate, and was signed by President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.

The three-cent nickel piece initially circulated well, but became less popular when the five-cent nickel was introduced in 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the <a href="decimal%20currency">decimal system</a>. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces. The issue is not widely collected, and prices for rare dates remain low by the standards of American collectible coinage.

The great influx of <a href="bullion">bullion</a> from the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> and other finds caused the price of silver relative to gold to increase starting in 1848, and silver coins were hoarded or exported for melting. In 1851, a bill for a <a href="three-cent%20piece">three-cent piece</a> in 75% silver and 25% copper was introduced in Congress by New York Senator <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a>, who wanted to lower postage rates from five to three cents. This percentage of silver was less than the normal 90% so that the coins would circulate at a time of hoarding. The copper <a href="Large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">large cent</a> did not circulate in the Pacific Coast region or South due to prejudice against coins that did not contain precious metal, and some means of allowing the purchase of a postage stamp without the use of copper cents was necessary. Dickinson's bill passed on March 3, 1851, and in addition to authorizing the new <a href="three-cent%20silver">three-cent silver</a>, lowered rates for most domestic mails. By 1854, the imbalance had abated, and Congress increased the silver content of the three-cent piece to the standard 90% for silver coins, though its weight was reduced.

The large cent was replaced by <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">a smaller version</a> made of 88% copper and 12% nickel in 1857. In 1861, the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> began, and when efforts to finance the war via borrowing failed, the Treasury stopped paying out gold in December 1861. The United States shifted to a paper money-based economy with little disruption. By June 1862, the price of silver had risen to the point where coins of that metal vanished from circulation, many exported to <a href="Province%20of%20Canada">Canada</a>, where they were both acceptable in circulation, and could be exchanged for gold. This departure of low-value coins was far more disruptive to commerce than the loss of the high-denomination gold coins, and change in transactions was made by a variety of makeshifts. These included currency issues by cities and businesses, <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States%23Encased%20postage%20stamps">encased postage stamps</a>, and federally issued <a href="fractional%20currency">fractional currency</a>—paper notes in denominations as small as three cents. The low-value paper currency, whether issued by government or business, were called <a href="shinplasters">shinplasters</a> by the public, which disliked them. On the Pacific Coast, where paper money was not favored, silver and gold continued to circulate.

Since fractional currency in three-cent denominations did not appear until late 1864, the cent was the only means then circulating of making change from the five-cent note, and came, in 1862 and 1863, to command a premium when sold in lots, of about 4%. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> tried to keep up with demand, limiting public purchases of cents to five dollars, and sending shipments to major cities. Despite these attempts, Mint Director <a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a> noted in his annual reports that cents were almost unobtainable, hoarded despite the fact that their metallic value remained less than one cent each. Numismatist Neil Carothers theorized that they were put aside by the public as the only circulating federal coinage, made of metal at a time when the public was forced to accept flimsy pieces of paper instead of silver and gold.

With cents from the Philadelphia Mint selling at a premium, many private token issues were issued in 1863, and passed as cents in commerce. Mint officials took notice that the tokens, often made of bronze rather than the copper-nickel alloy then being used in the cent, were not hoarded and began to consider issuing bronze coins. When Pollock proposed legislation for bronze one-, two-, and three-cent pieces, it was opposed by industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>, owner of the major source of nickel in the United States at the time, a mine at <a href="Gap%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gap, Pennsylvania</a>. Pollock's bill, as introduced, provided for one- and two-cent pieces of bronze, and the Wharton interests opposed it. According to Carothers,

The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201864">Coinage Act of 1864</a> passed into law on April 22 of that year. After entering circulation several months later, the bronze cent and <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">two-cent piece</a> circulated in trade without being hoarded. The bronze alloy was easier to strike than the copper-nickel one, allowing details to be brought forth sharply and extending the life of coinage dies.

Nickel, formerly used in the cent, now had no place in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock made no mention of further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.
Congress had by the Act of March 3, 1863 authorized fractional currency in the denomination of 3 cents; when these notes reached circulation the following year they proved wildly unpopular. The 1864 law which had substituted bronze for copper-nickel had also outlawed "copperheads" or private token issues. Even though these could now only be issued anonymously, and so could not be redeemed, the copperheads were preferred to the 3-cent shinplasters. Some copperhead tokens even read "Substitute for shinplasters". The notes soon became filthy and ragged, making them even more disliked. They were more difficult to value in quantity than notes with denominations divisible by five. According to <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "This was the moment Wharton's supporters had been waiting for." Wharton and his advocates argued that the three-cent notes should be redeemed with equivalent coins. They contended that were Congress to order a <a href="three-cent%20bronze">three-cent bronze</a> coin, such a piece would be as big as an obsolete large cent, and might be used to deceive the blind into accepting the pre-1857 cent rather than the more valuable coin. Pollock, previously an opponent of nickel coinage, had a change of heart and became a supporter.

There are several slightly varying accounts of why the bill for the three-cent nickel passed. Breen told of the pressure advocates for nickel put on House Coinage Committee chairman <a href="John%20Adam%20Kasson">John Adam Kasson</a>, finally winning him over to the position that even 25% nickel coins (which would be hard on the Mint's equipment) would be better than the continued use of shinplasters, and presenting him with a draft of a bill for a three-cent piece of that alloy. The bill made the new coin <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> to sixty cents. The 1864 act had made the cent legal tender to ten cents, and the two-cent piece to twenty; both limits were reduced to four cents. The bill did not abolish the three-cent silver piece, which was still being struck in small quantities. The new copper-nickel coins would be issued in exchange for three-cent shinplasters—the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Engraving%20and%20Printing">Currency Bureau</a> was instructed to print no more three-cent notes.
The bill passed the House of Representatives on the evening of March 3, 1865. At the time, it was usual to extend the final day of the congressional session in odd-numbered years to noon on March 4, and this occurred. The Senate took up the bill late on the morning of March 4. Action was repeatedly interrupted, first by Ohio Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a> reporting progress on an appropriations bill, then by Iowa's <a href="James%20W.%20Grimes">James Grimes</a> stating that ticket holders for <a href="Second%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">the inaugural festivities</a> at noon were being soaked by rain outside the Capitol, causing some debate as to whether they should be admitted early. Once female guests were admitted (males were left outside), the Senate passed the three-cent nickel bill without debate, and it was shortly thereafter signed by President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.

<a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> said of the sudden passage of the legislation "We can only guess what happened behind the scenes". Carothers wrote that Kasson had opposed nickel coinage, but nevertheless introduced the bill for it during the rush of the final day of the congressional session, "There was no report and no explanation ... The influences that brought about the passage of the measure in this fashion were never revealed." Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> suggested that by March 3, 1865, "the wide circulation of the bronze cent and two-cent piece had made a three-cent coin superfluous."

Mint Chief Engraver <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a> had, since 1849, designed coins with various visages of <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">the goddess Liberty</a>, based on a bust, "Venus Accroupie", he had seen in a Philadelphia museum on loan from <a href="Vatican%20Museums">the Vatican</a>. Although the Liberty as used on the three-cent nickel piece is closest to Longacre's experimental cents of 1857 and quarter eagles of 1860, she resembles most of the Chief Engraver's other depictions of Liberty. On the three-cent piece, she wears a coronet with her name on it, and a ribbon binds her hair. For the reverse, Longacre combined the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> III as rendered on the silver three-cent piece with the laurel wreath used on the 1859 <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a> reverse. Breen suggested that the similarity of design to other Longacre coins has contributed to the low level of collector interest in the three-cent nickel.

According to Lange, "resourceful as always, J.B. Longacre simply revised an existing image of Liberty for the obverse of the nickel three-cent piece. The same classical profile that appears on the Indian Head cent, the gold dollar, and the $3 piece is seen fitted with a new hairstyle and a studded coronet inscribed Liberty." The act that authorized the three-cent nickel contained a provision requiring the use of the motto "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>" on all pieces large enough to bear it, but the new coin was deemed too small. No change was made to the design of the three-cent piece in nickel during its lifetime.

The three-cent nickel piece was very popular when it entered circulation in mid-1865. More convenient than the larger two-cent bronze piece, it largely replaced that coin, starting the two-cent on its way to decreased popularity and abolition in 1873. The hard alloy, though, caused high levels of die breakage. Between 1865 and 1876, some 17 million three-cent pieces were used by the government to redeem the three-cent fractional currency notes.

The Wharton nickel interests were not satisfied by the issuance of the three-cent piece, and soon began to agitate for the passage of a five-cent coin, to be made of the same alloy as the three-cent piece. The Act of May 16, 1866 introduced the five-cent nickel piece, or "<a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a>", as it has come to be known. According to David Lange in his history of the Mint, the five-cent piece has "become one of the mainstays of the country's coinage". The new five-cent coin was legal tender up to a dollar.
The introduction of the five-cent copper-nickel piece greatly decreased the popularity and use of the three-cent piece. The three-cent piece had debuted in 1865 with a mintage of over eleven million and nearly five million in 1866; thereafter strikings declined, falling to under a million by 1871, a figure the coin would thereafter exceed only twice. The public had preferred small bronze coins to paper money, then the three-cent nickel piece rather than the bronze; they now preferred the five-cent nickel to the three. One reason for this was that the <a href="base%20metal">base metal</a> five-cent piece would be redeemed by the government if presented in $100 lots pursuant to a provision in the authorizing legislation. There was no such provision for the three-cent nickel piece; neither was there any for the other base metal coins. Following Pollock's resignation in 1866 over his objections to <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">President Johnson</a>'s <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction policies</a>, the new Mint Director was <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a>, who in his first annual report in 1867, described the redemption clause in the nickel's authorizing legislation as "a most wise and just provision", urging its extension to the cent, two-cent piece, and three-cent piece. Postmasters were compelled to take three-cent nickel pieces in exchange for stamps, but had difficulty in depositing them in the Treasury in payment of their obligations, as the government would take no more than sixty cents worth of them in a single transaction. Private individuals and firms similarly refused them beyond the legal tender limit; those with a surplus of base metal coins often sold them at a discount.

Congress took no action on a redemption bill, and in 1868 Linderman wrote again in his annual report, urging that the public be allowed to redeem small-denomination coins, as commerce was flooded with them. He disclosed that he had been redeeming the old copper-nickel cents with three-cent pieces and nickels. Carothers pointed out that exchanging the copper-nickel pieces for cents violated the 1865 and 1866 acts, that stated the three-cent piece and nickel could not be purchased with cents, but only for <a href="greenback%20%28money%29">greenback</a>s or specie. Linderman strongly advocated a redemption law to relieve the glut of small coins:

In 1866, Treasury Department official <a href="John%20Jay%20Knox">John Jay Knox</a> was sent to examine the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>. After his return to Washington, he submitted a report that recommended many changes to how the Mint did business, including reform of the base-metal coinage. Knox complained that the various enactments for non-specie coinage were "entirely disconnected and incongruous". Linderman submitted legislation to discontinue fractional currency of less than 25 cents, and authorizing copper-nickel coins of one, three and five cents, legal tender and redeemable, and in the case of the three-cent piece, larger and heavier than the existing coin. Linderman's bill was introduced by Pennsylvania Representative <a href="William%20D.%20Kelley">William D. Kelley</a> in February 1868. It passed the House in amended form, but was not voted on in the Senate. Kelley tried again in the following term of Congress, and the bill met the same fate as its predecessor.

Pollock returned to office as Mint Director in 1869. Although Pollock opposed redemption, Treasury Secretary <a href="George%20S.%20Boutwell">George S. Boutwell</a> did not, and a bill allowing for redemption of base-metal coins in lots of at least $20 was signed into law by President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> on March 3, 1871. By then, early versions of what became the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a> were being considered by Congress. This was a major piece of legislation that reformed the laws relating to the Mint. As introduced by Ohio Senator <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a> on April 28, 1870, it included Linderman's proposal for the use of copper-nickel in the minor coins. The debate over the bill stretched over the next three years. The use of nickel was a sticking point for the legislation; some congressmen alleged that the whole point of the bill was to benefit Wharton. Between 1870 and 1872, different versions of the bill, with a larger three-cent piece, twice passed the House and once the Senate, but differences between the houses could not be reconciled. After the second House passage, in May 1872, the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a> struck the provisions for copper-nickel coinage. After a <a href="conference%20committee">conference committee</a> met, both houses passed a version that left the cent, three-cent nickel piece, and nickel unaltered, and it was signed by President Grant on February 12, 1873. The act eliminated the two-cent piece, silver three-cent piece, silver <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a> and the <a href="Seated%20Liberty%20dollar">standard silver dollar</a> (the last denomination was reinstated in 1878). The three-cent piece was made legal tender to twenty-five cents, as were the other two base-metal coins, the cent and nickel (the surviving silver coins were legal tender to five dollars). Numismatic writer Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three-cent piece and the half dime, which might directly compete with the two copper-nickel coins, a favor to Wharton. Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five-cent pieces "a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">revival of silver coinage</a>".

On January 18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner <a href="A.%20Loudon%20Snowden">A. Loudon Snowden</a> formally complained to Pollock that on the new year's coins, the digit "3" too closely resembled an "8". Pollock ordered Chief Engraver <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a> (Longacre had died in office on January 1, 1869) to redo the logotypes for the date. Thus, most denominations of American coinage dated 1873, including the three-cent nickel piece, have varieties: the Close (or Closed) 3 from early in the year, and the Open 3 from after Barber made his modifications. A total of 390,000 Closed 3 and 783,000 Open 3 of the three-cent nickel were minted.

Numismatist Bruce C. Goldstein indicated that several factors combined to keep the nickel three-cent piece in decline after the passage of the 1873 act. Less and less fractional currency was being redeemed, as almost a decade had passed since the issuance of three-cent notes. Rich silver strikes in the West lowered the price of that metal to the point where old silver coins emerged from hoarding and circulated again. These factors, combined with ample stocks of cents and nickels, made the three-cent nickel, a non-silver coin of odd denomination, less desirable. By 1876, the mintage for circulation had declined to 162,000. None were struck for circulation in 1877 and 1878, though some proof coins were minted for sale to the public.

Although more than a million were minted in 1881, another blow to the three-cent piece occurred on October 1, 1883, when <a href="first-class%20mail">first-class mail</a> rates were lowered from three to two cents for the first . Although the rate for pieces weighing up to initially remained at three cents, the two-cent rate was extended to one ounce effective July 1, 1885. Deprived of the original reason for the denomination's existence, no three-cent pieces were struck for circulation in 1886 (though several thousand proof coins were produced), and in the three remaining years of the piece's life, a total of less than 60,000 circulation strikes were minted. As the production of three-cent pieces dwindled, the other non-specie coins prospered, with record numbers of cents being struck in the 1880s to address the need to make change, and for <a href="penny%20arcade">penny arcade</a> machines. The nickel proved popular in slot machines and street railways, which often set fares at five cents. With silver again circulating, the three-cent piece became more unpopular because it was almost the same diameter as the <a href="dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a>, leading to confusion and small frauds.
Beginning in 1880, in their annual reports, the Mint Director and Treasury Secretary appealed to Congress to discontinue the three-cent piece. The last three-cent pieces were struck in 1889, and the denomination was discontinued, along with the <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> and the <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>, by the Act of September 26, 1890. Many of the coins from 1888 and 1889 were still held at the Treasury Department and were melted after passage of the act, the fate of millions more as they flowed back from banks. The resultant metal contributed to large mintages of the <a href="Liberty%20Head%20nickel">Liberty Head nickel</a> between 1890 and 1893.

One proposal to revive the three-cent piece was made in 1911, when Mayors <a href="Brand%20Whitlock">Brand Whitlock</a> of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a>, and <a href="Newton%20D.%20Baker">Newton D. Baker</a> of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a> sent a joint memorial to Congress urging its return. The following year, a subcommittee of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures held a hearing on bills to authorize a copper-nickel three-cent piece and to change the composition of the cent to copper-nickel. Mint Director <a href="George%20E.%20Roberts">George E. Roberts</a> testified and indicated he had no objection to a three-cent piece, as there was at least limited demand for a coin larger than the cent and smaller than the nickel. In 1936, a bill for a three-cent nickel was among various coin legislation considered by the <a href="Senate%20Banking%20Committee">Senate Banking Committee</a>. In 1942, Congress granted the Treasury Secretary the temporary authority to change the composition of the nickel because of wartime metal shortages, and if public demand for the five-cent piece required it, the Mint could strike three-cent pieces. Nothing came of any of the proposals. The three-cent piece was confirmed as fully legal tender by the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201965">Coinage Act of 1965</a>, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since passed from the scene.

According to the 2018 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "A Guide Book of United States Coins", only the pieces from 1882 to 1887 catalog for more than $100 in worn <a href="coin%20grading">Good-4</a> condition; common dates list for $15 to $20 in that condition. The highest value listed is for the 1877, struck only in proof with a mintage of 900, at $2,000. David F. Fanning, in his 2001 article on the three-cent pieces, suggested that rarer specimens of the nickel three-cent piece are relatively inexpensive compared with coins of similar mintage in more popular series, such as the <a href="Morgan%20dollar">Morgan dollar</a>.

The design of the three-cent nickel piece remained stable throughout its run, and there are few <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">varieties</a>. An <a href="Mint-made%20errors%23Overdate%20%28OVD%29">overdate</a> is known, 1887/6. The die that struck those coins was originally dated 1886, when no circulation strikes were made. So the die would not be wasted, the Mint altered the last digit from a 6 to a 7; evidence of both numbers is visible. Some 1865 pieces in proof condition display a wreath on the reverse that comes much closer to touching the rim than on later issues. These were most likely <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>s but they are accepted as issued because the Mint placed them in some 1865 <a href="proof%20set">proof set</a>s. Many of the three-cent nickel pieces were not fully struck, and are missing details of the design; this is because the head of Liberty is directly opposite the III, and the Mint had trouble getting the hard metal alloy to adequately flow to the high points of both sides.

Three-cent silver

The three-cent silver, also known as the three-cent piece in silver or trime, was struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> for circulation from 1851 to 1872, and as a <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a> in 1873. Designed by the Mint's chief engraver, <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, it circulated well while other silver coinage was being hoarded and melted, but once that problem was addressed, became less used. It was abolished by Congress with the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>.

After a massive importation of gold bullion during the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, silver could be traded for increasing amounts of gold, so U.S. silver coins were exported and melted for their metal. This, and the reduction of postage rates to three cents, prompted Congress in 1851 to authorize a coin of that denomination made of .750 fine silver, rather than the conventional .900. The three-cent silver was the first American coin to contain metal valued significantly less than its face value, and the first silver coin not to be <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> for an unlimited amount. The coin saw heavy use until Congress acted again in 1853, making other silver coins lighter, which kept them in circulation. Congress also lightened the three-cent silver, and increased its fineness to 900 silver.

With the return of other denominations to circulation, the three-cent silver saw less use, and its place in commerce was lost with the economic chaos of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, which led to hoarding of all gold and silver coins. A <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent piece in copper-nickel</a> was struck beginning in 1865, and the three-cent silver saw low mintages for its final decade before its abolition. The series is not widely collected, and the pieces remain inexpensive relative to other U.S. coins of similar scarcity.

Although the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> had been striking silver coins since the 1790s, they did not always circulate due to fluctuations in the price of the metal. In 1834, for example, <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollars</a> sold on the market at a premium of one percent. The U.S. was then on a <a href="bimetallism">bimetallic</a> standard, and though Congress had slightly overvalued silver with respect to gold, enough Mexican silver flowed into the country to produce a rough equilibrium.

By early 1849, most of the silver coins in circulation were small coins of the <a href="Spanish%20colonial%20real">Spanish colonial real</a>, including the "levy" (one real) and "fip" (half real). The levy and fip often passed for twelve and six cents respectively in the Eastern U.S. The mint accepted them as payment at a slightly lower figure, but even so, lost money on the transactions as many of the pieces were lightweight through wear. The odd denominations of the levy and fip were a convenience, allowing payment or change to be made without the use of <a href="large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">cents</a>, which were at that time large, made of copper, and not accepted by the government as legal tender due to their lack of precious metal. In the Western U.S., the levy and fip were accepted as the equivalent of the silver <a href="dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dime</a> and <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a>, although the Spanish pieces contained more silver.

Bullion from the <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">California Gold Rush</a> and other discoveries came to the Eastern U.S. in considerable quantities beginning in 1848. By the following year, the price of gold relative to silver had dropped, making it profitable to export American silver coins, sell them as bullion, and use the payment in gold to buy more U.S. coins. Silver coins consequently vanished from circulation, meaning the highest-value American coin actually circulating that was worth less than the <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a> ($2.50 piece) was the half-dollar-sized copper cent, which saw no use in much of the country because of its lack of legal tender status. Early in 1849, Congress authorized a <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> to help bridge the gap. Spanish silver coins were the bulk of what was left in commerce for small change, although there was disagreement as to the value to be assigned to them. Additionally, they were often heavily worn, reducing their intrinsic worth at a time when Americans expected coins to contain metal worth the value assigned to them.

In 1850, New York Senator <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a> introduced legislation for a three-cent piece in .750 fine silver, that is, three parts silver to one part copper (American silver coins were then .900 fine). He proposed to offer it in exchange for the Spanish silver, which would be valued at eight reals to the dollar for the purpose, higher than the going rate. The new coin would weigh three-tenths as much as the dime, but the debasement of the silver would compensate the government for the losses it would take in redeeming the underweight, worn Spanish coins. The three-cent denomination was chosen as it coordinated well with the six and twelve cent values often assigned the fip and levy. The House of Representatives instead considered legislation to reduce the valuation of the Spanish coins to ten cents per real, and to strike a <a href="twenty-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">twenty-cent piece</a>, of .900 silver, to facilitate the exchange. Neil Carothers, in his book on small-denomination American money, suggests that the House's plan would have resulted in the Spanish coins staying in circulation, and any twenty-cent pieces issued being hoarded or melted. No legislation passed in 1850, which saw continued export of America's silver coinage.

Impetus for the passage of a three-cent coin came when Congress, in January 1851, considered reducing postage rates from five cents to three. In 1849, <a href="House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">House Committee on Ways and Means</a> chairman, <a href="Samuel%20Vinton">Samuel Vinton</a>, had written to Mint director <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a> that his committee was considering both reducing the postage rate and instituting a three-cent coin. Although no legislative action was then taken, Patterson had the mint prepare experimental <a href="pattern%20coins">pattern coins</a>. The House committee proposing the 1851 bill included Dickinson's three-cent piece, and provided that it be legal tender up to 30 cents. When the bill was debated in the House on January 13, 1851, New York Congressman <a href="William%20Duer%20%28U.S.%20Congressman%29">William Duer</a> indicated that he felt both coin and stamp should be denominated at 2 cents, and his fellow New Yorker, <a href="Orsamus%20Matteson">Orsamus Matteson</a>, offered an amendment to that effect. The amendment failed, as did every other attempt to change the legislation, including Dickinson's plea, in the Senate, to restore the requirement that the new coin be used to retire some of the Spanish silver. The bill passed both houses, and became the Act of March 3, 1851 when President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> signed it.

Carothers pointed out the precedent-setting nature of the legislation, the first to authorize an American silver coin containing an amount of metal worth considerably less than its face value:

In addition to striking the pattern coins in 1849, officials at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> continued to experiment with three-cent silvers. The matter was caught up in ongoing conflict between Mint chief coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>, and the chief engraver, <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, who each prepared designs. Peale produced a coin depicting a <a href="pileus%20%28hat%29">Liberty cap</a>, based on a design prepared by Longacre's late predecessor, <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>, in 1836. Longacre prepared a design similar to the coin that was eventually released.

On March 2, 1851, the day before the legislation was passed, Longacre, with the reluctant permission of Patterson (a Peale ally) sent <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Thomas%20Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a> samples of his proposed three-cent piece, along with a letter explaining the symbology. Patterson preferred Peale's design, but recommended Longacre's for approval on the ground that it was in lower <a href="relief">relief</a>. Patterson, writing to Corwin on March 7, indicated that if the three-cent were struck in .900 silver, it would be hoarded, but as the silver in the .750 pieces was worth only two and a half cents, the Mint would profit via <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a> from coining the new pieces. Patterson also suggested that the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans Mint</a> could be used to strike the new coin.

Despite the provision of the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201837">Mint Act of 1837</a> entrusting Longacre, by virtue of his office, with responsibility for preparing dies, Peale prepared his own and ran off some sample three-cent pieces. Both types of pattern coin were sent by Patterson to Corwin on March 25, 1851, with the Mint director's recommendation that the chief engraver's design be selected. The next day, acting Treasury Secretary William L. Hodge approved Longacre's design. Knowing there was a large demand for the new coins, Patterson thought it best to build up a stock of 500,000 before beginning distribution.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his book on American coins and medals, considered the silver three-cent piece one of the ugliest U.S. coins, though it "has the redeeming feature of delicate workmanship". Dennis Tucker, head of Whitman Publishing, in 2016 described the coin as "something of a 'Sarah plain and small'." Congress had required, in the authorizing act for the three-cent silver, that the piece bear a design distinct from both the gold dollar and the other silver coins. As Longacre wrote in his letter to Corwin of March 2, 1851,

Longacre's original design for the reverse (type 1) was altered when the fineness of the coin was increased in 1854, to aid the public in distinguishing between them. For the type 2 and type 3, (the reverses of which are identical, the only differences between the two types are on the obverse) an olive sprig, a symbol of peace, was added over the "III", and a bundle of three arrows, a symbol of war, below it. The arrows are bound by a ribbon.

According to numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "the new 3¢ coins were minted in large quantities, went immediately into circulation, and stayed there". Despite mechanical difficulties in striking so small a piece, a total of 5,446,400 were struck at Philadelphia in 1851, and 720,000 at New Orleans—the latter would prove the only mintage of three-cent pieces outside Philadelphia. The coins were shipped directly to post offices for use with stamps. Members of the public who wanted pieces were refused them by mint officials, who advised would-be purchasers to seek them at treasury depository branches.

The small size of the coins, which were dubbed "fish scales", was disliked as they were easily lost. The mint used them to redeem some of the Spanish silver, but the bulk of those foreign coins remained in circulation. A shopper paying for a small purchase with a gold dollar might receive fifteen or so three-cent pieces and the remainder in badly worn fips and other small silver coins. One Philadelphia newspaper reported, derisively, that merchants were reduced to giving ladles full of three-cent pieces in change for a five-dollar banknote.

Silver coins continued to flow out of the U.S. in 1852, and the three-cent silver saw its highest mintage, 18,663,500, all from Philadelphia. The value of these pieces was larger than that of all other silver coins struck by the mints in 1852. The chaotic state of commerce, with no circulating federal coin valued between the three-cent piece and gold dollar, was a source of concern, and mint officials and congressmen corresponded in 1852 concerning a reduction in weight of silver coins such as the half dime and half dollar. Congress at last responded by laws passed on February 21, 1853 and March 3, 1853. These reduced the weight of all silver coins except for the <a href="Seated%20Liberty%20dollar">silver dollar</a>. The three-cent piece had its weight reduced from .8 grams to .75, but its fineness increased to .900. Although the other reduced-weight silver coins were given legal tender limits of five dollars, that of the three-cent piece remained at thirty cents. Carothers theorized, "Congress, probably realizing that the 3 cent piece was a misfit at best, preferred to leave it with a discordant legal tender value". Pursuant to these congressional acts, mintage of the type 1 three-cent silver stopped on March 31, 1853. These changes to the silver coinage alleviated the problem of small change, as the new lightweight coins remained in circulation and were not then hoarded.

The shift to .900 silver for the three-cent silver was intended to help drive the Spanish coins out of circulation. Longacre made changes to both sides of the three-cent silver, engraving a triple line around the star on the obverse and adding an olive branch and bunch of arrows to the reverse. These parallel changes were made to the other silver coins of less than a dollar to distinguish the new, lighter coins from the old. Since it was more urgent to complete work on the modifications to silver coins such as the half dollar and <a href="Quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a>, Longacre left the three-cent piece for last, and did not complete work on the coin until late 1853. The new treasury secretary, <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a>, approved the changes on November 10.

Starting with 1854, small quantities of <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s were struck and apparently distributed in sets with the other silver coins. Beginning in 1858, Mint director <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> made the <a href="proof%20set">proof set</a>s available to the general public.

The 1853 acts had prohibited the mint from buying silver from the public. Since the silver dollar was heavy relative to its value, little silver was presented for striking into that piece. As the statutes did not permit the public to deposit silver and receive it back in the form of subsidiary silver coins (the three-cent piece through half dollar), this effectively placed the U.S. on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a>. Despite the statutes, in 1853 and 1854, Snowden had the mint purchase large quantities of silver bullion at a fixed price, generally above the market rate, and struck it into coin. Since the subsidiary coins were only legal tender to five dollars, and could not be redeemed for gold, this led to a glut of silver coins in commerce. This oversupply, which persisted through 1862, led to lower mintages of silver coins in the mid-1850s, including the three-cent piece. The largest mintage for the type 2 three-cent silver was in 1858, when 1,603,700 were struck for circulation.

Although there is no archival evidence, Breen theorized that in 1858 Snowden ordered Longacre to make changes to improve striking quality, as most type 2 pieces were weakly struck. The changes include removal of one of the outlines around the star, with smaller and more evenly spaced lettering. Breen suggested that the lettering displays the influence of Assistant Engraver Anthony C. Paquet, who likely assisted Longacre. These changes only affected the obverse; the reverse was not altered.

The economic chaos of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> brought the introduction of <a href="Legal%20Tender%20Note">legal tender notes</a>, backed only by the credit of the government, and by mid-1862, gold and silver coins had vanished from circulation in much of the nation, their place taken by such makeshifts as <a href="fractional%20currency">fractional currency</a> and <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a>s. The three-cent silver remained in circulation longer than the other silver coins, apparently because the public thought it was still made of debased silver, but by the autumn of 1862, it too was hoarded. With little point to issuing coins that would not circulate, mintage of the three-cent silver dropped from 343,000 in 1862 to 21,000 in 1863, a figure that would be exceeded only once (22,000 in 1866) during the rest of the series. In March 1863, Treasury Secretary <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> wrote in a letter that the three-cent silver had entirely vanished from circulation, and suggested that it be issued in aluminum to avoid hoarding.

Congress began the task of restoring federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a <a href="Two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> in bronze, and by authorizing a <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent piece in copper-nickel</a> the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a>, as it has come to be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.

In 1870, Treasury Secretary <a href="George%20Boutwell">George Boutwell</a> sent Congress a draft bill to replace the outdated 1837 Mint Act and the bits of legislation passed over the years regarding the mint and coinage. Even in the draft bill, no provision was made for the three-cent silver, though some in Congress wished to retain the coin in anticipation of the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">resumption of specie payments</a>. After much debate in Congress, President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> signed the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a> on February 12 of that year. The law abolished the two-cent piece, three-cent silver, half dime, and standard silver dollar (later restored in 1878). Carothers called the abolition of the silver three- and five-cent pieces "a necessity if the 3 cent and 5 cent nickel pieces were to be continued after the revival of silver coinage". Breen deemed the decision to eliminate the silver three-cent piece and the half dime, which might have directly competed with the two copper-nickel coins, a favor to industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>, whose mines produced much of the nickel ore used in coinage. According to numismatist R. W. Julian, the three-cent silver "had played its part well in the U.S. monetary system, but there was no longer any need for it".

Large quantities of the three-cent silver, including much of the production from 1863 and later, were held by the treasury and were melted after the coin was deauthorized. The three-cent nickel went the way of its silver counterpart. After years of low mintages and decreasing popularity, it was abolished by the Act of September 26, 1890 along with the gold dollar and <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>.

The three-cent silver was made fully legal tender by the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201965">Coinage Act of 1965</a>, which proclaimed all coin and currency of the United States good to any amount for payment of public and private debt. By then, that coin had long since disappeared from circulation.

According to Kevin Flynn and Winston Zack in their book on the three-cent silver, "Lower interest [in that piece] means that it is the type of coin [on] which you can find great deals on pricing, even on dates in which rarity is high." According to <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2017, the ones that catalog the highest are the proof issues from before 1858, with the 1854 issue leading the way, listed at $12,000. Not listed is the 1851 proof three-cent silver, of which only one is known, which was last sold in 2012 for $172,500, and once formed part of the <a href="Louis%20Eliasberg">Louis Eliasberg</a> collection. Flynn and Zack theorize that this was the specimen viewed by Hodge in approving Longacre's design, as there is no record of its return to the Philadelphia Mint.

The 1873 coin, the final issue, was struck in proof only, and is listed at between $825 and $2,000, depending on condition. Most U.S. coins of that year were struck with a "close "3"" in the date, and, following a complaint that the "3" too closely resembled an eight, an "open "3"" variety. The three-cent silver exists only as a close "3". Of coins struck for circulation, Yeoman's highest listings are for the 1868, at $11,000 in near pristine <a href="coin%20grading">MS-66</a> condition.

Yeoman lists all three-cent pieces before 1863 at $40 in worn <a href="coin%20grading">G-4 condition</a>, except the 1851 through 1853 at Philadelphia ($25). All three-cent pieces from 1863 to 1872 are less valuable in proof than in uncirculated MS-63 condition. Much of the mintage of later dates were melted by the Mint after the end of the series.

The <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> appears on the reverse, to the right of the "III", in the opening of the "C" that encloses it.

Kellie Loder (born 1988) is an <a href="Independent%20music">independent</a> singer-songwriter from <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, Canada. She has released two <a href="Contemporary%20Christian%20music">Contemporary Christian music</a> (CCM) albums: "The Way" in 2009 and "Imperfections & Directions" in 2010. With a voice that <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>-based newspaper "<a href="The%20Telegram">The Telegram</a>" has described as "powerful yet serene and soulful", she has been nominated for awards at the annual <a href="MusicNL">MusicNL</a> awards in Newfoundland, as well as at the <a href="Juno%20Award">Juno Award</a>s, Canada's top music prizes.

In 2017 she released "Boxes", which was a break with her earlier work. It is a pre-release of parts of her upcoming album, "Monster".

In 2018 she released "The Benefit of The Doubt". She describes it as a "transitional" album, moving "from a Juno-nominated Contemporary Christian artist to embodying a contemporary folk/pop singer/songwriter's aesthetic." She has also taken on increased control of production. She coproduced eight of its ten tracks.

A new single, "Fearless", is a soundtrack to an <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> trailer.

Loder wrote her first song at age 16 about a cousin who had died in a traffic accident. She was studying nursing at the <a href="Grenfell%20Campus">Grenfell Campus</a> of <a href="Memorial%20University%20of%20Newfoundland">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a> when she released "The Way" in August 2009. Also that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by <a href="YC%20Newfoundland">YC Newfoundland</a>, a Christian youth conference, and, as part of the award, was given time with music professionals who helped her with "Imperfections & Directions", which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase "Imperfections & Directions" by touring. Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards, and then as Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. "Imperfections & Directions" was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the <a href="Juno%20Awards%20of%202012">2012 Juno Awards</a>.

Kellie Loder was born to Christina and Bob Loder in 1988, and was raised in <a href="Badger%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Badger</a>, a town in the Canadian province of <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a>. She considers her first introduction to music to have taken place before she was born; her mother frequently played <a href="Michael%20W.%20Smith">Michael W. Smith</a> songs to her through headphones while she was still in the womb. Loder claims to have "natural rhythm" and that she began emulating the drummer at her <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> church by beating on a <a href="pew">pew</a> with pencils at the age of two. At age 10, Loder was placed in her church's drumming ensemble.

Loder's younger brother taught her three <a href="guitar%20chord">guitar chord</a>s when she was 14, and she received her first guitar later that year. She began writing songs at age 16. Her first song, which was about a cousin who had died in a traffic accident, used lyrics from a poem by one of their mutual friends. With encouragement from her family, Loder concentrated on her singing and songwriting and performed this in addition to another she subsequently wrote for a friend's graduation.

Loder was raised as a Christian by her parents, and considers herself to have become serious about her faith in 2007, when she "started to accept [her] gifts for what they were... and just assumed it was [from] God." After this experience, she began playing piano, and credited God with teaching her how to play. Loder favours the piano, considering it the most beautiful of the instruments she plays. The first song she wrote after beginning the piano was "Giants", also for a graduating class; the song uses the story of <a href="Goliath">Goliath</a> as its theme, generalizing the story to apply to each individual's internal struggles. "Giants" eventually appeared on both of her albums: "The Way" and "Imperfections & Directions".

In 2008, while studying nursing at the <a href="Grenfell%20Campus">Grenfell Campus</a> of <a href="Memorial%20University%20of%20Newfoundland">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a> through the Western Regional School of Nursing, Loder met Devin Robinson, a record producer. The meeting led to him producing her first album, an <a href="Independent%20music">independent</a> release called "The Way", which was recorded at Sweet Music Studios. Loder wrote all 11 songs on the album, which was released in August 2009. The initial run of the album sold out, and she subsequently went <a href="door-to-door">door-to-door</a> in small <a href="List%20of%20communities%20in%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland communities</a> selling a second run of the album. On her most lucrative day selling albums in this manner, she made $1000. Loder later said that this manner of selling her album proved to be a good way to develop a fanbase; people invited her into their homes for meals, prayer, and discussions. Also that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by <a href="YC%20Newfoundland">YC Newfoundland</a>, a Christian youth conference, where she performed "Giants".

As part of the award, which was valued at <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>20,000, Loder was given a membership for both the <a href="East%20Coast%20Music%20Association">East Coast Music</a> and <a href="MusicNL">MusicNL</a> <a href="trade%20association">trade association</a>s, and was given time at a recording studio and advice from music industry and production professionals. She was also engaged in a featured performance slot at the following year's YC Newfoundland. Loder later referred to the music professionals she met (including Scott Mansfield, <a href="Mark%20Peddle">Mark Peddle</a>, and NewManiac Studios' Peter Newman) as "the top players" in the <a href="Music%20of%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">music industry of Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, and the producers helped Loder with "Imperfections & Directions", her second album. She was particularly appreciative of Newman, who produced the album, <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixing</a> "Imperfections & Directions" with Tom Laune in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, Tennessee. Loder originally conceived "Fearless" (one of the album's tracks) as a <a href="techno">techno</a> song, and believes that Newman was the one who made that techno feel a reality.

On November 14, 2009, Loder opened for the <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>-based <a href="Christian%20rock">Christian rock</a> band <a href="Anyday">Anyday</a>, which was launching its debut album, "Got Extraordinary", at a <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a> at <a href="Springdale%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Springdale</a>'s Indian River High School. This concert, which was Loder's first performance in Springdale and her first time performing with Anyday, raised $675 to support David Willis and his family in Willis's battle with <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a> at Daffodil House in <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>, with more than 100 people in attendance. She and Anyday were scheduled to perform together again on November 28 at <a href="Dorset%20Collegiate">Dorset Collegiate</a> on <a href="Pilley%27s%20Island">Pilley's Island</a>.

Loder moved to St. John's in January 2010, and performed alongside <a href="Starfield%20%28band%29">Starfield</a> and Roy Martin later that year at the <a href="Exploits%20Valley%20Salmon%20Festival">Exploits Valley Salmon Festival</a> <a href="Gospel%20music">gospel</a> concert in <a href="Grand%20Falls-Windsor">Grand Falls-Windsor</a>. She also performed at the 2010 One Worship Festival in Springdale, and officially released "Imperfections & Directions", another independent release, at YC Newfoundland that October. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase this album by touring. A reporter for "<a href="The%20Telegram">The Telegram</a>", a St. John's-based newspaper, noted that "Imperfections & Directions" "demonstrates how Loder wears her faith and love of God on her sleeve." Loder was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 MusicNL awards with <a href="Mary%20Barry">Mary Barry</a>; <a href="The%20Ennis%20Sisters">Teresa Ennis</a>; <a href="Irene%20Bridger">Irene Bridger</a>; and <a href="Amelia%20Curran%20%28musician%29">Amelia Curran</a>, the eventual winner. Loder was nominated for another MusicNL award the following year, this time in the Gospel Artist of the Year category; this nomination was, in part, due to "Imperfections & Directions".

In early 2012, Loder made a music video for "Your Love Alone", one of the album's tracks, which was uploaded to YouTube. She later said she had written the song during a difficult phase in her life, and the song's lyrics revolve around the idea that the <a href="Grace%20%28Christianity%29">grace</a> and <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity">mercy of God</a> can be found in the most difficult situations. Through her experience, she became convinced that knowing God is all-important, expressing this concept in the chorus: "Your love alone is sufficient. It needs no company." She stated that she wrote the song "One Name Away" after having watched "<a href="The%20Tyra%20Banks%20Show">The Tyra Banks Show</a>". The episode featured an interview with a girl who had been <a href="Forced%20prostitution">forced into prostitution</a> at a young age; despite smiling on screen, the girl hopelessly declared that she would probably die before she turned 22.

"Imperfections & Directions" was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the <a href="Juno%20Awards%20of%202012">2012 Juno Awards</a>, Canada's top music awards. Loder said the nomination was a surprise; she learned about it in a text message from Newman after missing a call from him. Her fellow nominees in the Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album category were <a href="Jon%20Bauer">Jon Bauer</a>'s "Forevermore", <a href="downhere">downhere</a>'s "<a href="On%20the%20Altar%20of%20Love">On the Altar of Love</a>", Sky Terminal's "Don't Close Your Eyes" and <a href="Hawk%20Nelson">Hawk Nelson</a>'s "<a href="Crazy%20Love%20%28Hawk%20Nelson%20album%29">Crazy Love</a>". Loder travelled to <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, Ontario on March 28 to attend the awards ceremony, which was hosted by <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> at <a href="Scotiabank%20Place">Scotiabank Place</a> on April 1. Her album was one of three Newfoundland nominees at the <a href="Juno%20Award">Juno Award</a>s that year; the other two were rock band <a href="Hey%20Rosetta%21">Hey Rosetta!</a> and <a href="The%20Once">The Once</a>'s <a href="Folk%20music">folk</a> album, "Row Upon Row of the People We Know". Loder said that "on a scale of 1 to 10", her excitement about her Juno nomination was "probably a 10."

Although Loder lost the Juno Award to downhere, an <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band, she said she enjoyed walking down the <a href="red%20carpet">red carpet</a> and would never forget meeting major Canadian musicians such as <a href="Blue%20Rodeo">Blue Rodeo</a> and <a href="Sam%20Roberts">Sam Roberts</a>; Loder had an opportunity to sing and play guitar with Blue Rodeo's <a href="Jim%20Cuddy">Jim Cuddy</a> at the Junos. She competed in the <a href="Juno%20Cup">Juno Cup</a> hockey game, in which, at , she was considerably shorter than most of the other players. Playing for the Rockers team of Juno nominees against the Greats team of former <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> players, she was awarded a <a href="Penalty%20shot%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalty shot</a> after a <a href="Fighting%20in%20ice%20hockey">fight</a> with <a href="Troy%20Crowder">Troy Crowder</a>. The Greats threw their <a href="Ice%20hockey%20stick">sticks</a> in her way as she took the shot, which was stopped with ease by <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a> <a href="David%20Francey">David Francey</a>, a Juno nominee who had been traded to the Greats.

Loder returned to Newfoundland on April 2; the following month, she performed at <a href="Gros%20Morne%20National%20Park">Gros Morne National Park</a>'s Trails, Tails & Tunes Festival with Dave Paddon. That July, she performed alongside Nick Hamlyn at <a href="Corner%20Brook">Corner Brook</a>'s Downtown Days festival. In December 2012, she held two free <a href="Coffeehouse%20%28event%29">coffeehouses</a> in Newfoundland: at the <a href="Clovelly%20Trails">Stavanger Drive</a> <a href="Second%20Cup">Second Cup</a> on the 15th and at Cornerstone Ministry Centre on the 21st. Over the subsequent months into the middle of 2013, she performed on a monthly basis at the Stavanger Drive Second Cup, which is owned by Newman. She also performed at the Majestic Theatre and the Fat Cat Blues Bar in St. John's. In 2013, she was named a showcase winner by the <a href="Christian%20Women%20in%20Media%20Association">Christian Women in Media Association</a> (CWIMA) and was selected to perform at the organization's national conference.

Loder performed six songs live as part of an interview on <a href="CBC%20Radio">CBC Radio</a> in April 2013. She had written five of these songs, and four of them had not been previously released. The unreleased songs were "Playground", "Nursing a Broken Heart", "Like a Flower", and "One Girl", and the fourth song was "On This Drive", which had appeared on "Imperfections & Directions". The fifth song was a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a>'s "<a href="Folsom%20Prison%20Blues">Folsom Prison Blues</a>". She was inspired to write the song "Nursing a Broken Heart" after watching "<a href="George%20Stroumboulopoulos%20Tonight">George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight</a>" on which <a href="Hugh%20Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a> uttered the phrase "nursing a broken heart" as part of an interview. She wrote "Like a Flower" after a friend challenged her to write a song directed at herself as a child.

Listeners unfamiliar with <a href="contemporary%20Christian%20music">contemporary Christian music</a> (CCM) often assume that Loder sings <a href="hymn">hymn</a>-style music. Her career is unusual in that it began in CCM; most young musicians choose <a href="music%20genre">music genre</a>s such as <a href="Country%20music">country</a> and pop, which are generally considered more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music; many of her songs are about God, but they may also be interpreted as being about other subjects.

Loder believes everything that she sings is for God, regardless of the song's subject. She sees her music as a <a href="Christian%20ministry">Christian ministry</a>, the goal of which is to inspire people to live happier, better lives. A reporter for "The Telegram" called Loder's voice "powerful yet serene and soulful". Her songs have been played regularly on <a href="Rogers%20TV">Rogers TV</a> and CBC Radio. Specifically, her song "Raise You Higher" was selected for several song countdowns and was played across Canada by both <a href="Secularity">secular</a> and <a href="Christian%20radio">Christian radio</a> stations. A CBC Radio reviewer called Loder "amazingly talented", her music "gorgeous" and her song "Playground" in particular "absolutely beautiful". In April 2012, Loder said that she had not decided whether she would focus on medicine or music. In April 2013, she said that music was now her focus and that she was considering moving to Toronto in hopes of increasing her opportunities to develop her music career. She was working as a <a href="Child%20and%20Youth%20Worker">Child and Youth Worker</a> at a company called Blue Sky at the time.

Death of Jimi Hendrix

On September 18, 1970, at the age of 27, American musician <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> died in London. One of the 1960s' most influential guitarists, he was described by the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> as "arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>."

For some days prior to his death, Hendrix had been in poor health, in part from fatigue caused by overwork, a chronic lack of sleep, and an assumed <a href="influenza">influenza</a>-related illness. Insecurities about his personal relationships, as well as disillusionment with the music industry, had also contributed to his frustration. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day alive with <a href="Monika%20Dannemann">Monika Dannemann</a>. In the morning hours of September18, Dannemann found Hendrix unresponsive in her apartment at the Samarkand Hotel, 22<a href="Lansdowne%20Crescent%2C%20London">Lansdowne Crescent</a>, <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>. She called for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m., and Hendrix was taken to <a href="St%20Mary%20Abbot%27s%20Hospital">St Mary Abbot's Hospital</a> where an attempt was made to resuscitate him. He was pronounced dead at 12:45 p.m.

The <a href="post-mortem%20examination">post-mortem examination</a> concluded that Hendrix <a href="Pulmonary%20aspiration">aspirated</a> on his own vomit and died of <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a> while intoxicated with <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s. At the <a href="inquest">inquest</a>, the <a href="coroner">coroner</a>, finding no evidence of suicide, and lacking sufficient evidence of the circumstances, recorded an <a href="open%20verdict">open verdict</a>. Dannemann stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed <a href="secobarbital/brallobarbital/hydroxyzine">Vesparax</a> sleeping tablets, 18 times the recommended dosage.

On October 1, 1970, Hendrix was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton, Washington</a>. In 1992, his former girlfriend, <a href="Kathy%20Etchingham">Kathy Etchingham</a>, asked British authorities to reopen the investigation into Hendrix's death. A subsequent inquiry by <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Scotland Yard</a> proved inconclusive, and, in 1993, they decided against proceeding with an investigation.

The American musician <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> (born November 27, 1942) was one of the most influential guitarists of the 1960s. His <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> biography says he "was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>. Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as <a href="Wah-wah%20pedal">wah-wah</a> and <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distortion</a> forever transformed the sound of rock and roll."

During the week before his death, he was dealing with two pending lawsuits, one a paternity case and the other a recording contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, <a href="Michael%20Jeffery%20%28manager%29">Michael Jeffery</a>. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe exhaustion caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be <a href="influenza">influenza</a>-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.

On September 11, 1970, Hendrix gave his final interview in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for "<a href="Record%20Mirror">Record Mirror</a>". During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that <a href="Billy%20Cox">Billy Cox</a>, the bass player in his band, <a href="the%20Jimi%20Hendrix%20Experience">the Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a>, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they say a lot of things about people that, if they let it bother them, they wouldn't even be around today ... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy." Altham also suggested that Hendrix invented <a href="psychedelic%20music">psychedelic music</a>, to which he laughed and replied: "A mad scientist approach ... I don't consider [my music] the invention of psychedelic, it's just asking a lot of questions."

The following day, Hendrix received a phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: "I heard Jimi talk to Devon ... she was mad ... she went into fits ... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor <a href="George%20Lazenby">George Lazenby</a>, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.

Hendrix spent most of the early afternoon and evening of September 14 discussing his career plans with the record producer <a href="Alan%20Douglas%20%28record%20producer%29">Alan Douglas</a>. In the early morning hours of September 15, he went to <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London's Heathrow Airport</a> with Douglas, who was returning to New York. Hendrix's confidante Sharon Lawrence was in London, and spoke with him that day. Lawrence commented: "Jimi tracked me down, detailing his pressures and discussing the 'so-called friends'. He was jittery and angry." According to Lawrence, Hendrix told her: "I can't sleep. I can't focus to write any songs." Later that afternoon, his girlfriend <a href="Monika%20Dannemann">Monika Dannemann</a> arrived at the Cumberland. She and Hendrix then drove to her apartment in the Samarkand Hotel, 22 <a href="Lansdowne%20Crescent%2C%20London">Lansdowne Crescent</a>, <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>.

During the afternoon of September 15, Hendrix was asked by his friend <a href="Eric%20Burdon">Eric Burdon</a>, formerly of <a href="the%20Animals">the Animals</a>, if he wanted to participate in a <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a> at <a href="Ronnie%20Scott%27s%20Jazz%20Club">Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club</a> with Burdon's newly formed band, <a href="War%20%28U.S.%20band%29">War</a>. Hendrix accepted, but when he arrived at the club that evening, he was not allowed to play due to his apparently drug-related disorientation. Burdon commented: "Jimi came down and was well out of it. He ... was wobbling too much to play, so I told him to come back the following night." Hendrix returned the next night and presented a healthier appearance. The crowd was enthusiastic and impressed by his performance despite his uncharacteristically subdued guitar playing when he sat in with War on "<a href="Tobacco%20Road%20%28song%29">Tobacco Road</a>" and "<a href="Mother%20Earth%20%28Memphis%20Slim%20song%29">Mother Earth</a>". This was the last time Hendrix played guitar in public.

Although the details of Hendrix's last day and death are unclear and widely disputed, he had spent much of September 17 in London with <a href="Monika%20Dannemann">Monika Dannemann</a>. He awoke late that morning at Dannemann's apartment in the Samarkand Hotel. By around 2 p.m., he was sitting in a garden area outside the apartment enjoying some tea while she took photographs of him holding his favorite <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> guitar that he called the "black beauty". In the opinion of author Tony Brown, "Jimi doesn't look particularly healthy in these photographs: his face seems a little puffy and on only a few of the pictures does he attempt to smile."

According to Dannemann, by 3 p.m. they had left the apartment to use a bank. They continued on to <a href="Kensington">Kensington Market</a>, where Hendrix signed an autograph for a young boy, purchased a leather jacket, and ordered some shoes. He also briefly spoke with his ex-girlfriend <a href="Kathy%20Etchingham">Kathy Etchingham</a>, inviting her to visit him at his hotel that evening at 8 p.m.; she declined the invitation due to prior engagements and later admitted that she had "regretted it ever since". Hendrix and Dannemann then went to a <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a> antiques market, where Hendrix purchased more clothing. After another stop to buy writing paper, which he used to compose his final lyrics, Dannemann and Hendrix drove to his suite at the Cumberland Hotel, meeting Devon Wilson as she walked down <a href="King%27s%20Road">King's Road</a>. Hendrix asked Dannemann to stop the car so that he could get out and talk with Wilson, who invited Hendrix to a party that evening. Dannemann became jealous, giving Wilson a cold stare during the brief meeting. Later, Phillip Harvey invited Dannemann and Hendrix to tea; they accepted. Prior to their arrival at Harvey's, they briefly stopped by the Cumberland.

While at the hotel, Hendrix made several telephone calls. Dannemann said he phoned his lawyer Henry Steingarten, asking him to find a way out of his contract with his manager Mike Jeffery, and producer <a href="Eddie%20Kramer">Eddie Kramer</a>, for whom Hendrix left a voice message. <a href="Mitch%20Mitchell">Mitch Mitchell</a> said that he called Hendrix at the Cumberland on September 17, after having been asked to do so by tour manager Gerry Stickells, who had spoken to Hendrix just minutes earlier. Mitchell said that during the phone conversation Hendrix agreed to join him around midnight at <a href="the%20Speakeasy%20Club">the Speakeasy Club</a> for a previously arranged jam session, which included <a href="Sly%20Stone">Sly Stone</a>.

After stopping at the Cumberland, Hendrix and Dannemann accompanied Harvey to his apartment, arriving around 5:30 p.m. Hendrix and Dannemann smoked <a href="hashish">hashish</a> and drank tea and wine with Harvey and two of his female companions while discussing their individual careers. Sometime around 10 p.m., Dannemann, apparently feeling left out of the conversation and jealous of the attention Hendrix was giving Harvey's female friends, became visibly upset and stormed out of the flat. Hendrix followed her, and an argument ensued between them during which Dannemann reportedly shouted: "you fucking pig". Harvey, concerned that their yelling would draw unwanted attention from the police, asked them to quiet down.

Harvey, who had remained silent about the incident out of respect for his English nobleman father, <a href="Arthur%20Vere%20Harvey">Arthur Vere Harvey</a>, gave an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a> after his father's death in 1994. In his statement, he claims to have been mildly concerned for Hendrix's safety, worried that Dannemann might "resort to serious physical violence". According to Harvey, Dannemann "verbally assaulted [Hendrix] in the most offensive possible way". Approximately 30 minutes later, Hendrix re-entered the flat and apologized for the outburst before leaving with Dannemann at 10:40 p.m. 
Dannemann said she then prepared a meal for them at her apartment around 11 p.m. and shared a bottle of wine with Hendrix. Sometime after returning to the apartment, Hendrix took a bath, then wrote a poem titled "The Story of Life".

At approximately 1:45 a.m. on Friday, September 18, Dannemann drove Hendrix to the party Wilson had invited him to earlier that day, which was hosted by Hendrix's acquaintance and business associate, Pete Kameron. At the party, Hendrix complained to Kameron about business problems, ate some food, and took at least one <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a> tablet. Approximately 30 minutes later, Dannemann rang the flat's intercom asking for Hendrix. Another guest, Stella Douglas, asked her to return later. According to guest Angie Burdon, the estranged wife of Eric Burdon of the Animals, when Dannemann came back around 15 minutes later, Douglas used an assertive approach with her to the point of being impolite. Undeterred, Dannemann demanded to speak with Hendrix. Burdon recalled: "[Hendrix] got angry because [Dannemann] wouldn't leave him alone." According to Burdon, other guests at the party shouted out the windows at Dannemann, asking her to leave. Hendrix eventually yielded and spoke with Dannemann before unexpectedly leaving the party around 3 a.m.

Dannemann, the only eyewitness to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving back at her basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20 a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18 a.m. and one arrived at 11:27 a.m.

When ambulance crew members Reg Jones and John Saua arrived at the Samarkand, the door to the flat was wide open, the gas fire was on, the curtains were drawn, and the apartment was dark. The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [Hendrix] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the <a href="Aspirator%20%28medical%20device%29">aspirator</a> ... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillow—black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down ... We felt his pulse ... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." At 11:30 a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [Hendrix] off to hospital as quick as we could."

The ambulance crew left the hotel at approximately 11:35 a.m. to take Hendrix to <a href="St%20Mary%20Abbot%27s%20Hospital">St Mary Abbot's Hospital</a> and they arrived at 11:45 a.m. Medical registrar Dr. Martin Seifert stated: "Jimi was rushed into the [resuscitation] room. He was put on a monitor, but it [<a href="ECG">ECG</a> trace] was flat. I pounded his heart [<a href="CPR">CPR</a>] a couple of times, but there was no point, he was dead". According to Seifert, the attempt to resuscitate Hendrix lasted "just a few minutes". The surgical registrar, Dr. John Bannister, commented: "He was cold and he was blue. He had all the parameters of someone who had been dead for some time. We worked on him for about half an hour without any response at all." Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead at 12:45 p.m., on Friday, September 18, 1970; he was 27 years old. He later stated: "On admission he was obviously dead. He had no pulse, no heartbeat, and the attempt to resuscitate him was merely a formality."

During the morning of September 18, Eric Burdon arrived at the Samarkand sometime before the ambulance crew and found that Hendrix was already dead. Burdon immediately became concerned that police would find drugs at the apartment, and as he was collecting incriminating evidence, he found the poem that Hendrix had written hours earlier, "The Story of Life". Burdon, who said he had previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: "I made false statements ... I simply didn't understand what the situation was. I misread the note ... I thought it was a goodbye". Dannemann said Hendrix told her: "I want you to keep this [poem] forever [and] I don't want you to forget anything that is written. It's a story about you and me".

Soon after Bannister pronounced Hendrix dead, a hospital spokesperson told the press: "We don't know where, how, or why he died, but he died of an overdose." By that evening, many newspapers in London and New York had printed sensationalized headlines that exploited the death-from-overdose account. Hendrix's public relations manager, Les Perrin, granted an interview on Dutch radio soon after the hospital announcement. He commented: "Well, all I know is that Mr. Hendrix's body was taken to St. Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London, at 11:45 this morning, and he was certified to be dead on arrival." At 2 p.m., <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> reported: "Jimi Hendrix, regarded by millions as one of the most talented and original performers in modern rock music, is dead." That evening, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described him as "a genius black musician, a guitarist, singer and composer of brilliantly dramatic power. He spoke in gestures and big as he could imagine and create."

On September 19, Dannemann spoke with a journalist for the German <a href="Tabloid%20journalism">tabloid</a> "<a href="Bild">Bild</a>". During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: "I loved him, and Jimi loved me ... We were already engaged ... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records ... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets." On September 20, a reporter from "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" interviewed Dannemann's brother, Klaus-Peter Dannemann, who stated: "[Monika] telephoned me on [September 19] and told me that [Hendrix] took nine sleeping tablets. She said that Jimi had told her that he wanted to sleep for a day and a half before he went to America. She told me that he did not intend to kill himself."

To determine the cause of death, the <a href="coroner">coroner</a>, Gavin Thurston, ordered a <a href="Autopsy">post-mortem</a> examination on Hendrix's body, which was performed on September 21, by Professor <a href="Robert%20Donald%20Teare">Robert Donald Teare</a>, a <a href="Forensic%20pathology">forensic pathologist</a>. Teare reported that Hendrix was "well nourished and muscular", and he identified a quarter-inch scar on Hendrix's left wrist. He said that there were "no stigmata of [intravenous] drug addiction. Once these marks are there [in the skin], they never go away. In this case, there were no marks at all." Although Teare observed that the right side of Hendrix's heart was widely dilated, he found no evidence of <a href="valvular%20heart%20disease">valvular heart disease</a>. He discovered a partially collapsed left lung and 400 ml of fluid in Hendrix's chest. Both lungs were congested, and vomit was found in the smaller <a href="Bronchus">bronchi</a>. According to Teare, Hendrix's stomach "contained a medium-sized partially digested meal in which rice could be distinguished." Teare concluded that Hendrix's kidneys were healthy, and his liver was congested. His "bladder was half full of clear urine." He stated that Hendrix's <a href="blood%20alcohol%20content">blood alcohol content</a> was 100 mg per 100 ml, "enough to fail a <a href="breathalyzer">breathalyzer</a> test ... the equivalent of about four pints of beer." Teare reported that analysis of Hendrix's blood "revealed a mixture of barbiturates consistent with those from Vesparax", and he estimated that drug concentrations translated to ingestion of 1.8 grams of barbiturate, 20 mg of amphetamine, and 20 mg of cannabis. Teare gave the cause of death as: "Inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication." He did not attempt to determine Hendrix's time of death.

Thurston began an <a href="inquest">inquest</a> on September 23, and on September 28 he concluded that Hendrix had <a href="Pulmonary%20aspiration">aspirated</a> his own vomit and died of <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a> while intoxicated with <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s. Citing "insufficient evidence of [the] circumstances", he recorded an <a href="open%20verdict">open verdict</a>. He commented: "The cause of death was clearly inhalation of vomit due to barbiturate intoxication, but there is no evidence as to intention to commit suicide ... If the question of intention cannot be answered, then it is proper to find the cause of death and leave it an open verdict." Dannemann later stated that Hendrix had taken nine of her prescribed <a href="secobarbital/brallobarbital/hydroxyzine">Vesparax</a> sleeping tablets. Intended to be taken in half-tablet doses, nine tablets of the powerful sedative amounted to 18 times the recommended amount.

After Hendrix's body had been embalmed by <a href="Desmond%20Henley">Desmond Henley</a>, it was flown to Seattle, Washington, on September 29. After a service at Dunlop Baptist Church on October 1, he was interred at Greenwood Cemetery in <a href="Renton%2C%20Washington">Renton, Washington</a>, the location of his mother's gravesite. Hendrix's family and friends traveled in 24 limousines. More than two hundred people attended the funeral, including several notable musicians such as the original Experience members Mitch Mitchell and <a href="Noel%20Redding">Noel Redding</a>, as well as <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>, <a href="John%20P.%20Hammond">John Hammond</a> and <a href="Johnny%20Winter">Johnny Winter</a>.

Tony Brown, author of "Jimi Hendrix: The Final Days" (1997), had been in regular contact with Dannemann from 1980 until her death in 1996. He visited with her on multiple occasions and spoke with her numerous times over the phone. Soon after contacting her, Brown came to the conclusion that her account of the events of Hendrix's final days "would change from one call to the next." In the days following Hendrix's death, she gave two significantly different accounts of the morning of September 18.

At approximately 4 p.m. on September 18, Dannemann told Police Sergeant John Shaw: "We went to sleep about 7 a.m. When I woke up at eleven his face was covered in vomit, and he was breathing noisily. I sent for an ambulance, and he was taken to hospital. I also noticed that ten of my sleeping tablets were missing." In a statement given to P. Weyell of the coroner's office on September 24, she said: I made a sandwich and we talked until about 7 a.m. He then said that he wanted to go to sleep. He took some tablets, and we went to bed. I woke up about 11:00 a.m., and saw that Jimi's face was covered in vomit. I tried to wake him but could not. I called an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital in Kensington ... Prior to going with him to the hospital, I checked my supply of Vesparax sleeping tablets and found that nine of them were missing.

In Dannemann's initial statements, she said she awoke at 11 a.m. on September 18. During the inquest she stated that she awoke at 10:20 a.m., and left to purchase cigarettes, something she had previously failed to mention. In 1971, she wrote a manuscript in which she said she awoke at 10 a.m. In 1975, during an interview with author Caesar Glebbeek, Dannemann stated that she awoke at 9 a.m. According to Burdon, Dannemann phoned him as "the first light of dawn was coming through the window." Stickells said he received a phone call regarding a problem with Hendrix "between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m." Mitchell said he waited for Hendrix at the Speakeasy Club until they closed at 4 a.m., and a couple of hours after his hour and a half drive home, he received a phone call from Stickells, who told him Hendrix had died. In her statements to the police and coroner's office, Dannemann never mentioned telephoning Burdon.

Although Dannemann claimed that Hendrix was alive when placed in the ambulance at approximately 11:30 a.m. and that she rode with him on the way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27 a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: "[When] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." Saua stated: "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." Burdon stated: "[Dannemann] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: "When we moved [Hendrix], the gases were gurgling, you get that when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead ... There was really nothing they could do for him." Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi ... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come ... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed ... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital."

In 1992, having arranged for a private investigation of Hendrix's death, Etchingham supplied the results of the effort to UK authorities and requested they reopen the coroner's inquest. After a several-month inquiry by <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a>, during which every interested party to the events was interviewed, officials were confident the request would be granted. The investigation eventually proved inconclusive in 1993, when Attorney General <a href="Nicholas%20Lyell%2C%20Baron%20Lyell%20of%20Markyate">Sir Nicholas Lyell</a> decided that proceeding with the investigation would not serve the public, due in part to the excessive time that had passed since Hendrix's death.

Thirty Flights of Loving

Thirty Flights of Loving is a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="Adventure%20game">adventure</a> video game developed by Brendon Chung's <a href="independent%20video%20game%20development">indie video game</a> studio, <a href="Blendo%20Games">Blendo Games</a>. It was released in August 2012 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and in November 2012 for <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a>. The game employs a modified version of <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s 1997-era <a href="id%20Tech%202">id Tech 2</a> engine—originally used for "<a href="Quake%202">Quake 2</a>"—and incorporates music composed by <a href="Idle%20Thumbs">Idle Thumbs</a> member <a href="Chris%20Remo">Chris Remo</a>. It follows three people as they prepare for an alcohol heist and the aftermath of the operation.

The game is a non-direct sequel to "<a href="Gravity%20Bone">Gravity Bone</a>" (2008) and features the same main character—an unnamed spy. It was developed as part of the <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> campaign for the revival of the Idle Thumbs podcast and included a free copy of its predecessor. "Thirty Flights of Loving" received generally favorable reviews from <a href="Video%20game%20journalism">video game media outlets</a>, scoring 88 out of 100 on aggregate website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. A follow-up, "<a href="Quadrilateral%20Cowboy">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>", was released on July 25, 2016.

"Thirty Flights of Loving" is a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="Adventure%20game">adventure</a> video game that is estimated to take about 15 minutes on average to complete. Using the <a href="Arrow%20keys%23WASD%20keys">WASD keys</a> and mouse, the player controls the main character, an unnamed spy who participates in an alcohol-smuggling operation. The player works alongside <a href="non-playable%20character">non-playable character</a>s Anita, a demolitions expert, and Borges, a forger. The game follows the group as they prepare for a heist and experience its aftermath. The robbery is omitted from the game, although it is revealed that it went wrong.

Unlike "Gravity Bone", "Thirty Flights of Loving" employs <a href="non-linear%20storytelling">non-linear storytelling</a>, forcing the player to piece together the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able to move freely and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.

"Thirty Flights of Loving" begins with the player walking through a small corridor where individual gameplay elements such as movement and key allocations are explained. After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A <a href="smash%20cut">smash cut</a> skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot in a room full of crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.

Anita and the player get drunk on a table while the rest of the characters start dancing and flying across the room. Then the player is taken again to the room where Anita was peeling oranges, and then back to the room where both she and Borges were lying shot. The player is then shown leaving the airport carrying Borges on a luggage cart. They arrive at a small place where the gunfight sequence takes place, followed by the motorcycle ride sequence, which ends with a crash that leads the player into a museum. In this area, there are several plaques showing the game's name and credits. The player leaves the area and goes into a new one where <a href="Bernoulli%27s%20principle">Bernoulli's principle</a> about low and high air pressures is explained. Then, the player is again moved to the motorcycle sequence, where the game ends.

"Thirty Flights of Loving" was developed by Brendon Chung's video game studio <a href="Blendo%20Games">Blendo Games</a>. Chung, who worked as a <a href="Level%20design%23Level%20designer">level designer</a> for <a href="Pandemic%20Studios">Pandemic Studios</a>, has contributed to the development of "<a href="Full%20Spectrum%20Warrior">Full Spectrum Warrior</a>" and "". "Thirty Flights of Loving" was created using a modified version of KMQuake II, a port of <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s <a href="id%20Tech%202">id Tech 2</a>, the <a href="game%20engine">graphics engine</a> for "Quake 2". It incorporates a gameplay enhancement add-on named Lazarus, developed by David Hyde and Mad Dog. Chung acknowledged that although he has worked with newer, "powerful and flexible" engines, he preferred the older engine because it was released as an <a href="open-source%20platform">open-source platform</a>, "so you can redistribute it for free." The source code of "Thirty Flights of Loving" itself has been released under version 2 of the <a href="GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GNU General Public License</a>, making it <a href="free%20software">free software</a>.

The game was first conceived as a prototype to "Gravity Bone", and was scrapped because it was "too dialogue heavy." However, Chung revived the idea after being contacted by <a href="Idle%20Thumbs">Idle Thumbs</a> to develop a game for their Kickstarter campaign. The main development phase, in which content creation took place, was finished within three months. Several more months were spent polishing the game and fixing <a href="software%20bug">software bug</a>s. Chung brought multiple existing assets from "Gravity Bone" to develop "Thirty Flights of Loving", and used a diverse set of tools to create the elements of the game. <a href="Blender%20%28software%29">Blender</a> was picked for the creation of models, while <a href="Audacity%20%28audio%20editor%29">Audacity</a> and <a href="Adobe%20Photoshop">Adobe Photoshop</a> were used for audio and texture work. Another tool, <a href="GtkRadiant">GtkRadiant</a>, was used to create the game's levels.

Chung developed "Thirty Flights of Loving" environment as a way to present the criminal nature of the group. He intentionally avoided the use of voice-overs, and instead modeled the environment to bridge "the disconnect between the player's knowledge and the player's character's knowledge." Characters Anita and Borges were to be introduced using dialogue, but this was removed. However, montages were later added after Idle Thumbs' crew expressed concerns that the characters' relationships were unclear. Chung included a system to automate the generation of non-playable characters to replace the process of manually scripting every person in the game. He explained that although it allows characters to "randomly wander near waypoints," the software is "occasionally glitchy and behaves badly around staircases." This automation code was originally developed for a surveillance game prototype "that never panned out."

A first-person meal simulator was designed for "Thirty Flights of Loving". The sequence included the main characters "enjoy[ing] street noddles." However, the idea was scrapped and replaced with the motorcycle ride featured in the final version. The gunfight scene portrayed in the game was supposed to have a "musical rhythm," inspired by the film "Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka". The last level of the game is modeled from the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History%20%28France%29">French National Museum of Natural History</a>. Chung explained that when developing levels, he first spends time researching and "learning how things work." He elaborated that researching is important in "how it gives specificity and grounding" to a game. "Thirty Flights of Loving" is the seventh "Citizen Abel" game developed by Chung. The first two games were coded in 1999, while the following three were written between 2000 and 2004. The sixth game in the series, "Gravity Bone" (2008), became the first to be published. On the <a href="Idle%20Thumbs">Tone Control</a> podcast, he spoke about how every game he has produced, including "Thirty Flights of Loving", takes place in the same shared universe.

"Thirty Flights of Loving" includes references and <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter eggs</a>, as did "Gravity Bone". Films such as "<a href="Three%20Days%20of%20the%20Condor">Three Days of the Condor</a>" and "<a href="The%20Conversation">The Conversation</a>", film directors <a href="Steven%20Soderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a> and <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>, games such as "<a href="Zork">Zork</a>" and "", and animated shows like "<a href="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a>" and "<a href="TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a>" are referenced in the campaign. Unlike most of Chung's previous games, "Thirty Flights of Loving" was not framed around a certain musical composition.

"Thirty Flights of Loving" was announced in February 2012 as part of the <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> campaign for Idle Thumbs' podcast. The Idle Thumbs team talked to Chung about a possible sequel to "Gravity Bone", which was offered as one of the rewards of their Kickstarter campaign. Those who supported the campaign received "Thirty Flights of Loving" before its official release in August 2012. They also gained access to an exclusive "Goldblum mode" that was not part of the general release. It replaced the character model with ones resembling actor <a href="Jeff%20Goldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a>. The game, alongside a free copy of "Gravity Bone", was made available to early supporters in July 2012 and to the general public a month later via <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. A <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> release followed in November 2012.

"Thirty Flights of Loving" received generally favorable reviews upon release. On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game received an average score of 88 out of 100, based on 10 reviews. <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> Patrick Hancock awarded the game 9.5 out of 10, stating that "you'll never look at linear storytelling the same way again."

<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Carolyn Petit wrote that "the pleasure of "Thirty Flights of Loving" emerges from the things left unshown", allowing the player to infer and imagine the events, such as the heist itself, that are not otherwise shown. Graham Smith of "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" extolled the minimalist storytelling, asserting that "Thirty Flights of Loving" "tells a better story in 13 minutes than most games do in 13 hours". Mark Brown from "<a href="Wired%20UK">Wired UK</a>" classified the game as a "brassy, super-short, cubic heist drama," and stated that Chung "spins a memorable yarn, delivers it with confidence and panache [...] with a 15-year-old engine, without voice acting, in 20 minutes."

<a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Nathan Meunier said the game "gets off to a fascinating start before completely throwing any and all expectations you might form during its first few minutes into the wood chipper." British video game magazine "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" found "Thirty Flights of Loving" to be "an intriguing psychological thriller that feels like <a href="Wes%20Anderson">Wes Anderson</a> taking on <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>." The magazine added that the game had a "wonderfully ambiguous" story, crafted by replacing dialogue with "artful framing and shrewd gestures, and booting out cutscenes in favour of prickly jump-cuts." Greek magazine "<a href="PC%20Master">PC Master</a>" praised the game's storytelling and stated that "Thirty Flights of Loving" "attempts to blur the lines between gaming and art." "Thirty Flights of Loving" was a Narrative Award finalist at the 2013 <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a>. However, Richard Hofmeier's "<a href="Cart%20Life">Cart Life</a>" (2011) became the winner.

A follow-up to "Thirty Flights of Loving", "<a href="Quadrilateral%20Cowboy">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>", was developed by Chung. The game takes place in the same universe as "Gravity Bone" and "Thirty Flights of Loving" but is not a direct sequel. It follows a hacker who oversees agents who infiltrate buildings and steal documents. Unlike its predecessors, "Quadrilateral Cowboy" uses id Software's <a href="id%20Tech%204">id Tech 4</a> engine—originally used for "<a href="Doom%203">Doom 3</a>". According to Chung, the new engine provides "a lot more modern functionality" than the earlier engine used in the first two games.

Political career of John C. Breckinridge

The political career of <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a> included service in the <a href="State%20governments%20of%20the%20United%20States">state government</a> of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">Federal government of the United States</a>, as well as the government of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. In 1857, 36 years old, he was inaugurated as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President of the United States</a> under <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>. He remains the <a href="List%20of%20vice%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20age">youngest person to ever hold the office</a>. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Southern Democrats</a>, but <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">lost the election</a> to the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate Abraham Lincoln.

A member of the <a href="Breckinridge%20family">Breckinridge political family</a>, John C. Breckinridge became the first <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> to represent <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a> in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>, and in 1851, he was the first Democrat to represent <a href="Kentucky%27s%208th%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's 8th congressional district</a> in over 20 years. A champion of <a href="strict%20constructionism">strict constructionism</a>, <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a>, and <a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a>, he supported <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>'s <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a> as a means of addressing <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> in the territories acquired by the U.S. in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. Considering his re-election to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> unlikely in 1854, he returned to private life and his legal practice. He was nominated for vice president at the <a href="1856%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1856 Democratic National Convention</a>, and although he and Buchanan <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">won the election</a>, he enjoyed little influence in Buchanan's administration.

In 1859, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> elected Breckinridge to a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> term that would begin in 1861. In the 1860 presidential contest, he captured the <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">electoral votes</a> of most of the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern states</a>, but finished a distant second among four candidates. Lincoln's election as President prompted the <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> of the Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. Though Breckinridge sympathized with the Southern cause, in the Senate he worked futilely to reunite the states peacefully. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Confederates fired on Fort Sumter</a>, beginning the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, he opposed allocating resources for Lincoln to fight the Confederacy. Fearing arrest after Kentucky sided with the Union, he fled to the Confederacy, joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a>, and was subsequently expelled from the Senate. He served in the Confederate Army from October 1861 to February 1865, when <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate President</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> appointed him <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Confederate States Secretary of War</a>. Then, concluding that the Confederate cause was hopeless, he encouraged Davis to negotiate a national surrender. Davis's capture on May 10, 1865 effectively ended the war, and Breckinridge fled to <a href="Captaincy%20General%20of%20Cuba">Cuba</a>, then <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Great Britain</a>, and finally <a href="Post-Confederation%20Canada%20%281867%E2%80%931914%29">Canada</a>, remaining in exile until President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>'s offer of amnesty in 1868. Returning to Kentucky, he refused all requests to resume his political career and died of complications related to war injuries in 1875.

Historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a> has speculated that, had John C. Breckinridge's father, <a href="Cabell%20Breckinridge">Cabell</a>, lived, he would have steered his son to the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> and the Union, rather than the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, but the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky Secretary of State</a> and former Speaker of the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> died of a fever on September 1, 1823, months before his son's third birthday. Burdened with her husband's debts, widow Mary Breckinridge and her children moved to her in-laws' home near <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, where John C. Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> <a href="John%20Breckinridge%20%28U.S.%20Attorney%20General%29">John Breckinridge</a>. John Breckinridge believed the federal government was created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the <a href="Kentucky%20and%20Virginia%20Resolutions">Kentucky Resolutions</a> of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a> and asserted that states could <a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullify</a> them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. A <a href="strict%20constructionism">strict constructionist</a>, he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>.

Most of the Breckinridges were Whigs, but John Breckinridge's posthumous influence inclined his grandson toward the Democratic Party. Additionally, John C. Breckinridge's friend and law partner, Thomas W. Bullock, was from a Democratic family. In 1842, Bullock told Breckinridge that by the time they opened their practice in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Iowa">Burlington, Iowa</a>, "you were two-thirds of a Democrat"; living in heavily Democratic <a href="Iowa%20Territory">Iowa Territory</a> further distanced him from <a href="Whig%20history">Whiggery</a>. He wrote weekly editorials in the Democratic "Iowa Territorial Gazette and Advisor", and in February 1843, he was named to the <a href="Des%20Moines%20County%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines County</a> Democratic committee. A letter from Breckinridge's brother-in-law related that, when Breckinridge's uncle William learned that his nephew had "become loco-foco", he said, "I felt as I would have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored." On a visit to Kentucky in 1843, Breckinridge met and married <a href="Mary%20Cyrene%20Burch%20Breckinridge">Mary Cyrene Burch</a>, ending his time in Iowa.

Slavery issues dominated Breckinridge's political career, although historians disagree about Breckinridge's views. In "Breckinridge: Statesman, Soldier, Symbol", <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a> argues that, by adulthood, Breckinridge regarded slavery as evil; his entry in the 2002 "Encyclopedia of World Biography" records that he advocated <a href="manumission">voluntary emancipation</a>. In "Proud Kentuckian: John C. Breckinridge 1821–1875", Frank Heck disagrees, citing Breckinridge's consistent advocacy for slavery protections, beginning with his opposition to emancipationist candidates—including his uncle, <a href="Robert%20Jefferson%20Breckinridge">Robert Jefferson Breckinridge</a>—in the state elections of 1849.

Breckinridge's grandfather, John, owned slaves, believing it was a necessary evil in an agrarian economy. He hoped for gradual emancipation but did not believe the federal government was empowered to effect it; Davis wrote that this became "family doctrine". As a U.S. Senator, John Breckinridge insisted that decisions about slavery in <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">Louisiana Territory</a> be left to its future inhabitants, essentially the "<a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a>" advocated by John C. Breckinridge prior to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. John C. Breckinridge's father, Cabell, embraced gradual emancipation and opposed government interference with slavery, but Cabell's brother Robert, a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> minister, became an <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a>, concluding that slavery was morally wrong. Davis recorded that all the Breckinridges were pleased when the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> upheld the ban on importing slaves to Kentucky in 1833.

John C. Breckinridge encountered conflicting influences as an undergraduate at <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a> and in law school at <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>. Centre President John C. Young, Breckinridge's brother-in-law, believed in states' rights and gradual emancipation, as did <a href="George%20Robertson%20%28congressman%29">George Robertson</a>, one of Breckinridge's instructors at Transylvania, but <a href="James%20G.%20Birney">James G. Birney</a>, father of Breckinridge's friend and Centre classmate <a href="William%20Birney">William Birney</a>, was an abolitionist. In an 1841 letter to Robert Breckinridge, who became his surrogate father after Cabell Breckinridge's death, John C. Breckinridge wrote that only "ignorant, foolish men" feared abolition. In an <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> address in Frankfort later that year, he decried the "unlawful dominion over the bodies ... of men". An acquaintance believed that Breckinridge's move to Iowa Territory was motivated, in part, by the fact that it was a free territory under the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a>.

After returning to Kentucky, Breckinridge became friends with abolitionists <a href="Cassius%20Marcellus%20Clay%20%28politician%29">Cassius Marcellus Clay</a>, <a href="Garrett%20Davis">Garrett Davis</a>, and <a href="Orville%20H.%20Browning">Orville H. Browning</a>. He represented <a href="freedmen">freedmen</a> in court and loaned them money. He was a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> and member of the <a href="First%20Presbyterian%20Church%2C%20Lexington">First Presbyterian Church</a>, both of which opposed slavery. Nevertheless, because blacks were educationally and socially disadvantaged in the South, Breckinridge concluded that "the interests of both races in the Commonwealth would be promoted by the continuance of their present relations". He supported the new state constitution adopted in 1850, which forbade the immigration of freedmen to Kentucky and required emancipated slaves to be expelled from the state. Believing it was best to relocate freedmen to the African colony of <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, he supported the Kentucky branch of the <a href="American%20Colonization%20Society">American Colonization Society</a>. The <a href="1850%20United%20States%20Census">1850 Census</a> showed that Breckinridge owned five slaves, aged 11 to 36. Heck recorded that his slaves were well-treated but noted that this was not unusual and proved nothing about his views on slavery.

Because Breckinridge defended both the Union and slavery in the General Assembly, he was considered a <a href="moderate">moderate</a> early in his political career. In June 1864, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>'s <a href="John%20W.%20Forney">John W. Forney</a> opined that Breckinridge had been "in no sense an extremist" when elected to Congress in 1851. Of his early encounters with Breckinridge, Forney wrote: "If he had a conscientious feeling, it was hatred of slavery, and both of us, 'Democrats' as we were, frequently confessed that it was a sinful and an anti-Democratic institution, and that the day would come when it must be peaceably or forcibly removed." Heck discounts this statement, pointing out that Forney was editor of a pro-Union newspaper and Breckinridge a Confederate general at the time it was published. As late as the 1856 presidential election, some alleged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist.

By the time he began his political career, Breckinridge had concluded that slavery was more a constitutional issue than a moral one. Slaves were property, and the Constitution did not empower the federal government to interfere with property rights. From Breckinridge's constructionist viewpoint, allowing Congress to legislate emancipation without constitutional sanction would lead to "unlimited dominion over the territories, excluding the people of the slave states from emigrating thither with their property". As a private citizen, he supported the slavery protections in the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a> of 1850 and denounced the <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>, which would have forbidden slavery in territory acquired in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. As a state legislator, he declared slavery a "wholly local and domestic" matter, to be decided separately by the residents of each state and territory. Because <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, was a federal entity and the federal government could not interfere with property rights, he concluded that forced emancipation there was unconstitutional. As a congressman, he insisted on Congress's "perfect non-intervention" with slavery in the territories. Debating the 1854 <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a>, he explained, "The right to establish [slavery in a territory by government sanction] involves the correlative right to prohibit; and, denying both, I would vote for neither."

Davis notes that Breckinridge's December 21, 1859, address to the state legislature marked a change in his public statements about slavery. He decried the Republicans' desire for "negro equality", his first public indication that he may have believed blacks were biologically inferior to whites. He declared that the <a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott decision</a> showed that federal courts afforded adequate protection for slave property, but advocated a federal slave code if future courts failed to enforce those protections; this marked a departure from his previous doctrine of "perfect non-interference". Asserting that <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry</a> proved Republicans intended to force abolition on the South, he predicted "resistance [to the Republican agenda] in some form is inevitable". He still urged the Assembly against secession—"God forbid that the step shall ever be taken!"—but his discussion of growing sectional conflict bothered some, including his uncle Robert.

Klotter wrote that Breckinridge's sale of a female slave and her six-week-old child in November 1857 probably ended his days as a slaveholder. Slaves were not listed among his assets in the <a href="1860%20United%20States%20Census">1860 Census</a>, but Heck noted that he had little need for slaves at that time, since he was living in Lexington's <a href="Phoenix%20Hotel%20%28Lexington%2C%20Kentucky%29">Phoenix Hotel</a> after returning to Kentucky from his term as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a>. Some slavery advocates refused to support him in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 presidential race</a> because he was not a slaveholder. Klotter noted that Breckinridge fared better in rural areas of the South, where there were fewer slaveholders; in urban areas where the slave population was higher, he lost to <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Unionist</a> candidate <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>, who owned 166 slaves. William C. Davis recorded that, in most of the South, the combined votes for Bell and <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> Senator <a href="Stephen%20Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> exceeded those cast for Breckinridge.

After losing the election to <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a>—authored by fellow Kentuckian <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a> and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, the compromise was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.

A supporter of the <a href="annexation%20of%20Texas">annexation of Texas</a> and "<a href="manifest%20destiny">manifest destiny</a>", Breckinridge campaigned for <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844 presidential election</a>, prompting a relative to observe that he was "making himself very conspicuous here by making flaming loco foco speeches at the Barbecues". He decided against running for <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County</a> clerk after his law partner complained that he spent too much time in politics. In 1845, he declined to seek election to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> from the <a href="Kentucky%27s%208th%20congressional%20district">eighth district</a> but campaigned for <a href="Alexander%20Keith%20Marshall">Alexander Keith Marshall</a>, his party's unsuccessful nominee. He supported <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> for the presidency in mid-1847 but endorsed the Democratic ticket of <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> and <a href="William%20O.%20Butler">William O. Butler</a> after Taylor became a Whig in 1848.

In October 1849, Kentucky voters called for a constitutional convention. Emancipationists, including Breckinridge's uncles William and Robert, his brother-in-law John C. Young, and his friend Cassius Marcellus Clay, nominated "friends of emancipation" to seek election to the convention and the state legislature In response, Breckinridge, who opposed "impairing [slavery protections] in any form", was nominated by a bipartisan pro-slavery convention for one of <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a>'s two seats in the Kentucky House of Representatives. With 1,481 votes, 400 more than any of his opponents, Breckinridge became the first Democrat elected to the state legislature from Fayette County, which was heavily Whig.

When the House convened in December 1849, a member from <a href="Mercer%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Mercer County</a> nominated Breckinridge for Speaker against two Whigs. After receiving 39 votes—8 short of a majority—on the first three ballots, he withdrew, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Assigned to the committees on the Judiciary and Federal Relations, Breckinridge functioned as the Democratic <a href="floor%20leader">floor leader</a> during the session. Davis wrote that his most important work during the session was bank reform.

Breckinridge's first speech favored allowing the Kentucky Colonization Society to use the House chamber; later, he advocated directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and to meet the costs of transporting settlers there. Funding <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> was traditionally a Whig stance, but Breckinridge advocated conducting a state geologic survey, making the <a href="Kentucky%20River">Kentucky River</a> more navigable, chartering a <a href="toll%20road">turnpike</a>, incorporating a steamboat company, and funding the <a href="Eastern%20State%20Hospital%20%28Kentucky%29">Kentucky Lunatic Asylum</a>. As a reward for supporting these projects, he presided over the approval of the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Bowling%20Green%20Railroad">Louisville and Bowling Green Railroad</a>'s charter and was appointed director of the asylum.

Resolutions outlining Kentucky's views on the proposed <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a> were referred to the Committee on Federal Relations. The committee's Whig majority favored one calling the compromise a "fair, equitable, and just basis" for dealing with slavery in the territories and urging Congress not to interfere with slavery there or in Washington, D.C. Feeling this left open the issue of Congress's ability to legislate emancipation, Breckinridge asserted in a competing resolution that Congress could not establish or abolish slavery in states or territories. Both resolutions, and several passed by the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">state Senate</a>, were <a href="Table%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">laid on the table</a> without being adopted.

Breckinridge left the session on March 4, 1850, three days before its adjournment, to tend to John Milton Breckinridge, his infant son who had fallen ill; the boy died on March 18. To distract from his grief, he campaigned for ratification of the new constitution, objecting only to its difficult amendment process. He declined renomination, citing concerns "of a private and imperative nature". Davis wrote that the problem was money, since his absence from Lexington had hurt his legal practice, but his son's death was also a factor.

At an October 17, 1850, barbecue celebrating the Compromise of 1850, Breckinridge toasted its author, Whig Party founder <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>. Clay reciprocated by praising Breckinridge's grandfather and father, expressing hope that Breckinridge would use his talents to serve his country, then embracing him. Some observers believed that Clay was endorsing Breckinridge for higher office, and Whig newspapers began referring to him as "a sort of half-way Whig" and implying that he voted for Taylor in 1848.

Delegates to the Democrats' January 1851 state convention nominated Breckinridge to represent Kentucky's eighth district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Called the "Ashland district" because it contained Clay's <a href="Ashland%20%28Henry%20Clay%20estate%29">Ashland</a> estate and much of the area he once represented, Whigs typically won there by 600 to 1,000 votes. A Democrat had not represented it since 1828, and in the previous election no Democrat had sought the office. Breckinridge's opponent, <a href="Leslie%20Combs%20%28soldier%20and%20politician%29">Leslie Combs</a>, was a popular <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> veteran and former state legislator. As they campaigned together, Breckinridge's eloquence contrasted with Combs' plainspoken style. Holding that "free thought needed free trade", Breckinridge opposed Whig protective tariffs. He only favored federal funding of internal improvements "of a national character". Carrying only three of seven counties, but bolstered by a two-to-one margin in <a href="Owen%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Owen County</a>, Breckinridge garnered 54% of the vote, winning the election by a margin of 537.
Considered for <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>, Breckinridge believed his election unlikely and refused to run against fellow Kentuckian <a href="Linn%20Boyd">Linn Boyd</a>. Boyd was elected, and despite Breckinridge's gesture, assigned him to the lightly-regarded <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">Foreign Affairs Committee</a>. Breckinridge resisted "<a href="The%20United%20States%20Magazine%20and%20Democratic%20Review">United States Democratic Review</a>" editor <a href="George%20Nicholas%20Sanders">George Nicholas Sanders</a>' efforts to recruit him to the <a href="Young%20America%20movement">Young America movement</a>. Like Young Americans, Breckinridge favored westward expansion and free trade, but he disagreed with the movement's support of European revolutions and its disdain for older statesmen. On March 4, 1852, Breckinridge made his first speech in the House, defending presidential aspirant William Butler against charges by <a href="Florida">Florida</a>'s <a href="Edward%20Carrington%20Cabell">Edward Carrington Cabell</a>, a Young American and distant cousin, that Butler secretly sympathized with the <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soilers</a>. He denounced Sanders for his vitriolic attacks on Butler and for calling all likely Democratic presidential candidates except Stephen Douglas "old fogies".

The speech made Breckinridge a target of Whigs, Young Americans, and Douglas supporters. <a href="Humphrey%20Marshall%20%28general%29">Humphrey Marshall</a>, a Kentucky Whig who supported incumbent President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, attacked Breckinridge for claiming Fillmore had not fully disclosed his views on slavery. Illinois' <a href="William%20Alexander%20Richardson">William Alexander Richardson</a>, a Douglas backer, tried to distance Douglas from Sanders' attacks on Butler, but Breckinridge showed that Douglas endorsed the "Democratic Review" a month after it printed its first anti-Butler article. Finally, Breckinridge's cousin, <a href="California">California</a>'s <a href="Edward%20C.%20Marshall">Edward C. Marshall</a>, charged that Butler would name Breckinridge Attorney General in exchange for his support and revived the charge that Breckinridge broke party ranks, supporting Zachary Taylor for president. Breckinridge ably defended himself, but Sanders continued to attack him and Butler, claiming Butler would name Breckinridge as his running mate, even though Breckinridge was <a href="Twelfth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">too young to qualify as vice president</a>.

After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a more active role in the House. In debate with <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>'s <a href="Joshua%20Reed%20Giddings">Joshua Reed Giddings</a>, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's constitutionality and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of <a href="fugitive%20slave">fugitive slave</a>s. He opposed <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> Congressman <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>'s <a href="Homestead%20Act">Homestead Bill</a>, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's <a href="hemp">hemp</a> farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">U.S. Naval Academy</a>, and opposing funds for a sculpture of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a <a href="toga">toga</a>.

Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily visits to an ailing Henry Clay. Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge garnered nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House. Days later, he spoke in opposition to increasing a subsidy to the <a href="Collins%20Line">Collins Line</a> for carrying trans-<a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> mail, noting that Collins profited by carrying passengers and cargo on mail ships. In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited <a href="Commodore%20%28United%20States%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Matthew C. Perry</a>'s opinion that they would be useless in war. Finally, he showed <a href="Cornelius%20Vanderbilt">Cornelius Vanderbilt</a>'s written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.

With Butler's chances for the presidential nomination waning, Breckinridge convinced the Kentucky delegation to the <a href="1852%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1852 Democratic National Convention</a> not to nominate Butler until later balloting when he might become a compromise candidate. He urged restraint when Lewis Cass's support dropped sharply on the twentieth ballot, but Kentucky's delegates would wait no longer; on the next ballot, they nominated Butler, but he failed to gain support. After <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, Breckinridge's second choice, was nominated, Breckinridge tried, unsuccessfully, to recruit Douglas to Pierce's cause. Pierce lost by 3,200 votes in Kentucky—one of four states won by <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>—but was elected to the presidency, and appointed Breckinridge governor of <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a> in recognition of his efforts. Unsure of his re-election chances in Kentucky, Breckinridge had sought the appointment, but after John J. Crittenden, rumored to be his challenger, was elected to the Senate in 1853, he decided to decline it and run for re-election.

The Whigs chose Attorney General <a href="James%20Harlan%20%28congressman%29">James Harlan</a> to oppose Breckinridge, but he withdrew in March when some party factions opposed him. <a href="Robert%20P.%20Letcher">Robert P. Letcher</a>, a former governor who had not lost in 14 elections, was the Whigs' second choice. Letcher was an able campaigner who combined oratory and anecdotes to entertain and energize an audience. Breckinridge focused on issues in their first debate, comparing the Whig <a href="Tariff%20of%201842">Tariff of 1842</a> to the Democrats' lower <a href="Walker%20tariff">Walker tariff</a>, which increased trade and yielded more tax revenue. Instead of answering Breckinridge's points, Letcher appealed to party loyalty, claiming Breckinridge would misrepresent the district "because he is a Democrat". Letcher appealed to Whigs "to protect the grave of Mr. [Henry] Clay from the impious tread of Democracy", but Breckinridge pointed to his friendly relations with Clay, remarking that Clay's <a href="Will%20%28law%29">will</a> did not mandate that "his ashes be exhumed" and "thrown into the scale to influence the result of the present Congressional contest".

Cassius Clay, Letcher's political enemy, backed Breckinridge despite their differences on slavery. Citing Clay's support and the abolitionism of Breckinridge's uncle Robert, Letcher charged that Breckinridge was an abolitionist. In answer, Breckinridge quoted newspaper accounts and sworn testimony, provided by <a href="John%20L.%20Robinson">John L. Robinson</a>, of a speech Letcher made in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> for Zachary Taylor in 1848. In the speech, made alongside <a href="Thomas%20Metcalfe%20%28Kentucky%29">Thomas Metcalfe</a>, another former Whig governor of Kentucky, Letcher predicted that the Kentucky Constitution then being drafted would provide for gradual emancipation, declaring, "It is only the ultra men in the extreme South who desire the extension of slavery."

When Letcher confessed doubts about his election chances, Whigs began fundraising outside the district, using the money to buy votes or pay Breckinridge supporters not to vote. Breckinridge estimated that the donations, which came from as far away as <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> and included contributions from the Collins Line, totaled $30,000; Whig George Robertson believed it closer to $100,000. Washington, D.C., banker <a href="William%20Wilson%20Corcoran">William Wilson Corcoran</a> contributed $1,000 to Breckinridge, who raised a few thousand dollars. Out of 12,538 votes cast, Breckinridge won by 526. He received 71% of the vote in Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters. Grateful for the county's support, he nicknamed his son, John Witherspoon Breckinridge, "Owen".

Of 234 representatives in the House, Breckinridge was one of 80 re-elected to the <a href="Thirty-third%20Congress">Thirty-third Congress</a>. His relative seniority, and Pierce's election, increased his influence. He was rumored to have Pierce's backing for Speaker of the House, but he again deferred to Boyd; <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>'s <a href="Augustus%20R.%20Sollers">Augustus R. Sollers</a> spoiled Boyd's unanimous election by voting for Breckinridge. Still not given a committee chairmanship, he was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Ways and Means Committee</a>, where he secured passage of a bill to cover overspending in fiscal year 1853–1854; it was the only time in his career that he solely managed a bill. His attempts to increase Kentucky's allocation in a rivers and harbors bill were unsuccessful but popular with his Whig constituents.
In January 1854, Douglas introduced the Kansas–Nebraska Act to organize the <a href="Nebraska%20Territory">Nebraska Territory</a>. Southerners had thwarted his previous attempts to organize the territory because Nebraska lay north of <a href="parallel%2036%C2%B030%27%20north">parallel 36°30' north</a>, the line separating slave and free territory under the Missouri Compromise. They feared that the territory would be organized into new free states that would vote against the South on slavery issues. The Kansas–Nebraska Act allowed the territory's settlers to decide whether or not to permit slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Kentucky Senator <a href="Archibald%20Dixon">Archibald Dixon</a>'s amendment to make the repeal explicit angered northern Democrats, but Breckinridge believed it would move the slavery issue from national to local politics, and he urged Pierce to support it. Breckinridge wrote to his uncle Robert that he "had more to do than any man here, in putting [the Act] in its present shape", but Heck notes that few extant records support this claim. The repeal amendment made the act more palatable to the South; only 9 of 58 Southern congressmen voted against it. No Northern Whigs voted for the measure, but 44 of 86 Northern Democrats voted in the affirmative, enough to pass it. The Senate quickly concurred, and Pierce signed the act into law on May 30, 1854.

During the debate on the bill, New York's <a href="Francis%20B.%20Cutting">Francis B. Cutting</a> demanded that Breckinridge retract or explain a statement he had made, which Breckinridge understood as a challenge to <a href="duel">duel</a>. Under the "<a href="code%20duello">code duello</a>", the challenged party selected the weapons and the distance between combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces and suggested the duel be held in <a href="Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland">Silver Spring, Maryland</a>, on the estate of his friend, <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a>. Cutting had not meant his remark as a challenge, but insisted that he was now challenged and selected pistols at 10 paces. While their representatives tried to clarify matters, Breckinridge and Cutting made amends, averting the duel. Had it taken place, Breckinridge could have been removed from the House; the 1850 Kentucky Constitution prevented duelers from holding office.

In the second session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as spokesman for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and <a href="Jesse%20D.%20Bright">Jesse D. Bright</a>, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge was disappointed that the House defeated a measure to pay the <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of an island in the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce <a href="veto">veto</a>ed it.

In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig majority <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a>ed the eighth district, removing over 500 Democratic voters and replacing them with several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and <a href="Jessamine%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Jessamine</a> counties from the district and adding <a href="Harrison%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harrison</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Nicholas</a> counties to it. The cooperation of the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing Party</a>—a relatively new <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife wanted him to retire from national politics.

<a href="Pierre%20Soul%C3%A9">Pierre Soulé</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Spain">U.S. Minister to Spain</a>, resigned in December 1854 after being unable to negotiate the annexation of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and angering the Spanish by drafting the <a href="Ostend%20Manifesto">Ostend Manifesto</a>, which called for the U.S. to take Cuba by force. Pierce nominated Breckinridge to fill the vacancy, but did not tell him until just before the Senate's January 16 <a href="advice%20and%20consent">confirmation</a> vote. After consulting <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William%20L.%20Marcy">William L. Marcy</a>, Breckinridge concluded that the salary was insufficient and Soulé had so damaged Spanish relations that he would be unable to accomplish anything significant. In a letter to Pierce on February 8, 1855, he cited reasons "of a private and domestic nature" for declining the nomination. On March 17, 1855, he announced he would retire from the House.

Breckinridge and <a href="Minnesota%20Territory">Minnesota Territory</a>'s <a href="Henry%20Mower%20Rice">Henry Mower Rice</a> were among the speculators who invested in land near present-day <a href="Superior%2C%20Wisconsin">Superior, Wisconsin</a>. Rice disliked <a href="Governor%20of%20Minnesota">Minnesota's territorial governor</a>, <a href="Willis%20A.%20Gorman">Willis A. Gorman</a>, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 and was unable to campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the eighth district—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising to take a more active role in the 1856 campaigns.

Two Kentuckians—Breckinridge's friend, <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> <a href="Lazarus%20W.%20Powell">Lazarus W. Powell</a> and his enemy, Linn Boyd—were potential Democratic presidential nominees in 1856. Breckinridge—a delegate to the <a href="1856%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">national convention</a> and designated as a <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">presidential elector</a>—favored Pierce's re-election but convinced the state Democratic convention to leave the delegates free to support any candidate the party coalesced behind. To a New Yorker who proposed that Breckinridge's nomination could unite the party, he replied "Humbug".

Pierce was unable to secure the nomination at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>'s nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">general election</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>'s J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>'s <a href="John%20A.%20Quitman">John A. Quitman</a> with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed their votes to make his nomination unanimous.

The election was between Buchanan and Republican <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> in the north and between Buchanan and Millard Fillmore, nominated by a pro-slavery faction of the Know Nothings, in the South. <a href="Governor%20of%20Tennessee">Tennessee Governor</a> Andrew Johnson and "<a href="Congressional%20Globe">Congressional Globe</a>" editor John C. Rives promoted the possibility that Douglas and Pierce supporters would back Fillmore in the Southern states, denying Buchanan a majority in the Electoral College and throwing the election to the House of Representatives. There, Buchanan's opponents would prevent a vote, and the Senate's choice for vice president—certain to be Breckinridge—would become president. There is no evidence that Breckinridge countenanced this scheme. Defying contemporary political convention, Breckinridge spoke frequently during the campaign, stressing Democratic fidelity to the constitution and charging that the Republican emancipationist agenda would tear the country apart. His appearances in the critical state of Pennsylvania helped allay Buchanan's fears that Breckinridge desired to throw the election to the House. "Buck and Breck" won the election with 174 electoral votes to Frémont's 114 and Fillmore's 8, and Democrats carried Kentucky for the first time since <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828</a>. Thirty-six at the time of his inauguration on March 4, 1857, Breckinridge remains the youngest vice president in U.S. history. The Constitution requires the president and vice-president to be at least thirty-five years old.

When Breckinridge asked to meet with Buchanan shortly after the inauguration, Buchanan told him to come to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and ask to see the hostess, <a href="Harriet%20Lane">Harriet Lane</a>. Offended, Breckinridge refused to do so; Buchanan's friends later explained that asking to see Lane was a secret instruction to take a guest to the president. Buchanan apologized for the misunderstanding, but the event portended a poor relationship between the two men. Resentful of Breckinridge's support for both Pierce and Douglas, Buchanan allowed him little influence in the administration. Breckinridge's recommendation that former Whigs and Kentuckians—Powell, in particular—be included in Buchanan's cabinet went unheeded. Kentuckians <a href="James%20Brown%20Clay">James B. Clay</a> and Cassius M. Clay were offered diplomatic missions to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, respectively, but both declined. Buchanan often asked Breckinridge to receive and entertain foreign dignitaries, but in 1858, Breckinridge declined Buchanan's request that he resign and take the again-vacant position as U.S. Minister to Spain. The only private meeting between the two occurred near the end of Buchanan's term, when the president summoned Breckinridge to get his advice on whether to issue a <a href="Presidential%20Proclamation">proclamation</a> declaring a day of "Humiliation and Prayer" over the divided state of the nation; Breckinridge affirmed that Buchanan should make the proclamation.
As vice president, Breckinridge was tasked with presiding over the debates of the Senate. In an early address to that body, he promised, "It shall be my constant aim, gentlemen of the Senate, to exhibit at all times, to every member of this body, the courtesy and impartiality which are due to the representatives of equal States." Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> wrote that, while Breckinridge fulfilled his promise to the satisfaction of most, acting as moderator limited his participation in debate. Five tie-breaking votes provided a means of expressing his views. Economic motivations explained two—forcing an immediate vote on a codfishing tariff and limiting military pensions to $50 per month ($ in present-day currency). A third cleared the floor for a vote on Douglas's motion to admit <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> to the Union, and a fourth defeated Johnson's Homestead Bill. The final vote effected a wording change in a resolution forbidding constitutional amendments that empowered Congress to interfere with property rights. The Senate's move from the <a href="Old%20Senate%20Chamber">Old Senate Chamber</a> to a more spacious one on January 4, 1859, provided another opportunity. Afforded the chance to make the last address in the old chamber, Breckinridge encouraged compromise and unity among the states to resolve sectional conflicts.

Despite irregularities in the approval of the <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a> by <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</a>, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.

By January 1859, friends knew Breckinridge desired the U.S. Senate seat of John J. Crittenden, whose term expired on March 3, 1861. The General Assembly would elect Crittenden's successor in December 1859, so Breckinridge's election would not affect any presidential aspirations he might harbor. Democrats chose Breckinridge's friend <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a> over Linn Boyd as their gubernatorial nominee, bolstering Breckinridge's chances for the senatorship, the presidency, or both. Boyd was expected to be Breckinridge's chief opponent for the Senate, but he withdrew on November 28, citing ill health, and died three weeks later. The Democratic majority in the General Assembly elected Breckinridge to succeed Crittenden by a vote of 81 to 53 over <a href="Joshua%20Fry%20Bell">Joshua Fry Bell</a>, whom Magoffin had defeated for the governorship in August.

After <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>'s admission to the Union in May 1858, opponents accused Breckinridge of rigging a random draw so that his friend, Henry Rice, would get the longer of the state's two Senate terms. <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Senate Secretary</a> <a href="Asbury%20Dickins">Asbury Dickins</a> blunted the charges, averring that he alone handled the instruments used in the drawing. Republican Senator <a href="Solomon%20Foot">Solomon Foot</a> closed a special session of the <a href="Thirty-sixth%20Congress">Thirty-sixth Congress</a> in March 1859 by offering a resolution praising Breckinridge for his impartiality; after the session, the Republican-leaning "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" noted that while the star of the Buchanan administration "falls lower every hour in prestige and political consequence, the star of the Vice President rises higher".

Breckinridge's lukewarm support for Douglas in his <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201858">1858 senatorial re-election bid</a> against Abraham Lincoln convinced Douglas that Breckinridge would seek the Democratic presidential nomination, but in a January 1860 letter to his uncle, Breckinridge averred he was "firmly resolved not to". Douglas's political enemies supported Breckinridge, and Buchanan reluctantly dispensed patronage to Breckinridge allies, further alienating Douglas. After Breckinridge left open the possibility of supporting a federal slave code in 1859, Douglas wrote to <a href="Robert%20Toombs">Robert Toombs</a> that he would support his enemy and fellow Georgian <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Stephens">Alexander H. Stephens</a> for the nomination over Breckinridge, although he would vote for Breckinridge over any Republican in the general election.

Breckinridge asked James Clay to protect his interests at the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1860 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. Clay, Lazarus Powell, <a href="William%20Preston%20%28Kentucky%29">William Preston</a>, <a href="Henry%20Cornelius%20Burnett">Henry Cornelius Burnett</a>, and <a href="James%20B.%20Beck">James B. Beck</a> desired to nominate Breckinridge for president, but in a compromise with Kentucky's Douglas backers, the delegation went to Charleston committed to former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a> of Louisville. Fifty <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Southern Democrats</a>, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, walked out of the convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a <a href="two-thirds%20majority">two-thirds majority</a> of the original 303 delegates. For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority. <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>'s lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck asked that the nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie. Twenty-one more ballots were cast, but the convention remained deadlocked. On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>.

Breckinridge's communication with his supporters between the meetings indicated greater willingness to become a candidate, but he instructed Clay to nominate him only if his support exceeded Guthrie's. Many believed that Buchanan supported Breckinridge, but Breckinridge wrote to Beck that "The President is not for me except as a last necessity, that is to say not until his help will not be worth a damn." After a majority of the delegates, most of them Douglas supporters, voted to replace <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and Louisiana's walk-out delegates with new, pro-Douglas men in Baltimore, Virginia's delegation led another walk-out of Southern Democrats and Buchanan-controlled delegates from the northeast and Pacific coast; 105 delegates, including 10 of Kentucky's 24, left, and the remainder nominated Douglas. The walk-outs held a rival nominating convention, styled the National Democratic Convention, at the Maryland Institute in Baltimore. At that convention on June 23, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>' <a href="George%20B.%20Loring">George B. Loring</a> nominated Breckinridge for president, and he received 81 of the 105 votes cast, the remainder going to <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a> of New York. Oregon's <a href="Joseph%20Lane">Joseph Lane</a> was nominated for vice-president.

Breckinridge told Beck he would not accept the nomination because it would split the Democrats and ensure the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln. On June 25, Mississippi Senator <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> proposed that Breckinridge should accept the nomination; his strength in the South would convince Douglas that his own candidacy was futile. Breckinridge, Douglas, and Constitutional Unionist John Bell would withdraw, and Democrats could nominate a compromise candidate. Breckinridge accepted the nomination, but maintained that he had not sought it and that he had been nominated "against my expressed wishes". Davis's compromise plan failed when Douglas refused to withdraw, believing his supporters would vote for Lincoln rather than a compromise candidate.

The election effectively pitted Lincoln against Douglas in the North and Breckinridge against Bell in the South. Far from expectant of victory, Breckinridge told Davis's wife, <a href="Varina%20Davis">Varina</a>, "I trust I have the courage to lead a <a href="forlorn%20hope">forlorn hope</a>." <a href="Caleb%20Cushing">Caleb Cushing</a> oversaw the publication of several Breckinridge campaign documents, including a campaign biography and copies of his speeches on the occasion of the Senate's move to a new chamber and his election to the Senate. After making a few short speeches during stops between Washington, D.C. and Lexington, Breckinridge stated that, consistent with contemporary custom, he would make no more speeches until after the election, but the results of an August 1860 special election to replace the deceased clerk of the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> convinced him that his candidacy could be faltering. He had expressed confidence that the Democratic candidate for the clerkship would win, and "nothing short of a defeat by 6,000 or 8,000 would alarm me for November". Constitutional Unionist Leslie Combs won by 23,000 votes, prompting Breckinridge to make a full-length campaign speech in Lexington on September 5, 1860.
Breckinridge's three-hour speech was primarily defensive; his moderate tone was designed to win votes in the north but risked losing Southern support to Bell. He denied charges that he had supported Zachary Taylor over Lewis Cass in 1848, that he had sided with abolitionists in 1849, and that he had sought John Brown's <a href="clemency">pardon</a> for the Harpers Ferry raid. Reminding the audience that Douglas wanted the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> to decide the issue of slavery in the territories, he pointed out that Douglas then denounced the "Dred Scott" ruling and laid out a means for territorial legislatures to circumvent it. Breckinridge supported the legitimacy of <a href="secession">secession</a> but insisted it was not the solution to the country's sectional disagreements. In answer to Douglas's charge that there was not "a disunionist in America who is not a Breckinridge man", he challenged the assembled crowd "to point out an act, to disclose an utterance, to reveal a thought of mine hostile to the constitution and union of the States". He warned that Lincoln's insistence on emancipation made him the real disunionist.

Breckinridge finished third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879. He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> of Maryland, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> and <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> came from areas that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from the Deep South, the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election.

Three weeks after the election, Breckinridge returned to Washington, D.C., to preside over the Senate's <a href="lame%20duck%20session">lame duck session</a>. Lazarus Powell, now a senator, proposed a resolution creating a <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Select%20Committee%20of%20Thirteen%20on%20the%20Disturbed%20Condition%20of%20the%20Country">committee of thirteen members</a> to respond to the portion of Buchanan's address regarding the disturbed condition of the country. Breckinridge appointed the members of the committee, which, in Heck's opinion, formed "an able committee, representing every major faction." John J. Crittenden proposed a compromise by which slavery would be forbidden in territories north of parallel 36°30′ north—the demarcation line used in the Missouri Compromise—and permitted south of it, but the committee's five Republicans rejected the proposal. On December 31, the committee reported that it could come to no agreement. Writing to Magoffin on January 6, Breckinridge complained that the Republicans were "rejecting everything, proposing nothing" and "pursuing a policy which ... threatens to plunge the country into ... civil war".

One of Breckinridge's final acts as vice-president was announcing the vote of the Electoral College to a joint session of Congress on February 13, 1861. Rumors abounded that he would tamper with the vote to prevent Lincoln's election. Knowing that some legislators planned to attend the session armed, Breckinridge asked Winfield Scott to post guards in and around the chambers. One legislator raised a <a href="point%20of%20order">point of order</a>, requesting that the guards be ejected, but Breckinridge refused to sustain it; the electoral vote proceeded, and Breckinridge announced Lincoln's election as president. After Lincoln's arrival in Washington, D.C., on February 24, Breckinridge visited him at the <a href="Willard%20InterContinental%20Washington">Willard Hotel</a>. After making a valedictory address on March 4, he swore in <a href="Hannibal%20Hamlin">Hannibal Hamlin</a> as his successor as vice president; Hamlin then swore in Breckinridge and the other incoming senators.

Because Republicans controlled neither house of Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge did not believe Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession. Ignoring <a href="James%20Murray%20Mason">James Murray Mason</a>'s contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian <a href="Montgomery%20Blair">Montgomery Blair</a> as <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a>. He also voted against a resolution to remove the names of the senators from seceded states from the Senate roll.
Working for a compromise that might yet save the Union, Breckinridge opposed a proposal by Ohio's <a href="Clement%20Vallandigham">Clement Vallandigham</a> that the border states unite to form a "middle confederacy" that would place a buffer between the U.S. and the seceded states, nor did Breckinridge desire to see Kentucky as the southernmost state in a northern confederacy; its position south of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> left it too vulnerable to the southern confederacy should war occur. Urging that federal troops be withdrawn from the seceded states, he insisted "their presence can accomplish no good, but will certainly produce incalculable mischief". He warned that, unless Republicans made some concessions, Kentucky and the other border states would also secede.

When the legislative session ended on March 28, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky and addressed the state legislature on April 2, 1861. He urged the General Assembly to push for federal adoption of the Crittenden Compromise and advocated calling a border states convention, which would draft a compromise proposal and submit it to the Northern and Southern states for adoption. Asserting that the states were coequal and free to choose their own course, he maintained that, if the border states convention failed, Kentucky should call a sovereignty convention and join the Confederacy as a last resort.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Battle of Fort Sumter</a>, which began the Civil War, occurred days later, before the border states convention could be held. Magoffin called a special legislative session on May 6, and the legislature authorized creation of a six-man commission to decide the state's course in the war. Breckinridge, Magoffin, and <a href="Richard%20Hawes">Richard Hawes</a> were the states' rights delegates to the conference, while Crittenden, Archibald Dixon, and Samuel S. Nicholas represented the Unionist position. The delegates were only able to agree on a policy of armed neutrality, which Breckinridge believed impractical and ultimately untenable, but preferable to more drastic actions. In special elections held June 20, 1861, Unionists won nine of Kentucky's ten House seats, and in the August 5 state elections, Unionists gained majorities in both houses of the state legislature.

When the Senate convened for a special session on July 4, 1861, Breckinridge stood almost alone in opposition to the war. Labeled a traitor, he was removed from the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Military Affairs</a>. He demanded to know what authority Lincoln had to blockade Southern ports or suspend the writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>". He reminded his fellow senators that Congress had not approved a declaration of war and maintained that Lincoln's enlistment of men and expenditure of funds for the war effort were unconstitutional. If the Union could be persuaded not to attack the Confederacy, he predicted that "all those sentiments of common interest and feeling ... might lead to a political reunion founded upon consent". On August 1, he declared that if Kentucky supported Lincoln's prosecution of the war, "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate." Asked by Oregon's <a href="Edward%20Dickinson%20Baker">Edward Dickinson Baker</a> how he would handle the secession crisis, he responded, "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life ... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States, than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, at the end of which I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom."

In early September, Confederate and Union forces entered Kentucky, ending her neutrality. On September 18, Unionists shut down the pro-Southern "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier</a>" newspaper and arrested former governor <a href="Charles%20S.%20Morehead">Charles S. Morehead</a>, who was suspected of having Confederate sympathies. Learning that <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Bramlette">Thomas E. Bramlette</a> was under orders to arrest him, Breckinridge fled to <a href="Prestonsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Prestonsburg, Kentucky</a>, where he was joined by Confederate sympathizers <a href="George%20W.%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">George W. Johnson</a>, <a href="George%20Baird%20Hodge">George Baird Hodge</a>, <a href="William%20E.%20Simms">William E. Simms</a>, and William Preston. The group continued to <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Virginia">Abingdon, Virginia</a>, where they took a train to Confederate-held <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green, Kentucky</a>.

On October 2, 1861, the Kentucky General Assembly passed a resolution declaring that neither of the state's U.S. Senators—Breckinridge and Powell—represented the will of the state's citizens and requesting that both resign. Governor Magoffin refused to endorse the resolution, preventing its enforcement. Writing from Bowling Green on October 8, Breckinridge declared, "I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier." Later that month, he was part of a convention in Confederate-controlled <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville, Kentucky</a>, that denounced the Unionist legislature as not representing the will of most Kentuckians and called for a sovereignty convention to be held in that city on November 18. Breckinridge, George W. Johnson, and Humphrey Marshall were named to the planning committee, but Breckinridge did not attend the convention, which created a provisional <a href="Confederate%20government%20of%20Kentucky">Confederate government</a> for Kentucky. On November 6, Breckinridge was <a href="indictment">indicted</a> for <a href="treason">treason</a> in a federal court in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>. The Senate passed a resolution formally expelling him on December 2, 1861; Powell was the only member to vote against the resolution, claiming that Breckinridge's statement of October 8 amounted to a resignation, rendering the resolution unnecessary.

Breckinridge served in the Confederate Army from November 2, 1861, until early 1865. In mid-January 1865, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate President</a> Jefferson Davis summoned Breckinridge to the Confederate capital at <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, and rumors followed that Davis would appoint Breckinridge <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Confederate States Secretary of War</a>, replacing <a href="James%20A.%20Seddon">James A. Seddon</a>. Breckinridge arrived in Richmond on January 17, and some time in the next two weeks, Davis offered him the appointment. Breckinridge made his acceptance conditional upon the removal of <a href="Lucius%20B.%20Northrop">Lucius B. Northrop</a> from his office as Confederate <a href="Commissary%20General">Commissary General</a>. Most Confederate officers regarded Northrop as inept, but Davis had long defended him. Davis relented on January 30, allowing Seddon to replace Northrop with Breckinridge's friend, <a href="Eli%20Metcalfe%20Bruce">Eli Metcalfe Bruce</a>, on an interim basis; Breckinridge accepted Davis's appointment the next day.
Some Confederate congressmen were believed to oppose Breckinridge because he had waited so long to join the Confederacy, but his nomination was confirmed unanimously on February 6, 1865. At 44 years old, he was the youngest person to serve in the Confederate president's cabinet. Klotter called Breckinridge "perhaps the most effective of those who held that office", but Harrison wrote that "no one could have done much with the War Department at that late date". While his predecessors had largely served Davis's interests, Breckinridge functioned independently, assigning officers, recommending promotions, and consulting on strategy with Confederate generals.

Breckinridge's first act as secretary was to meet with assistant secretary <a href="John%20Archibald%20Campbell">John Archibald Campbell</a>, who had opposed Breckinridge's nomination, believing he would focus on a select few of the department's bureaus and ignore the rest. During their conference, Campbell expressed his desire to retain his post, and Breckinridge agreed, delegating many of the day-to-day details of the department's operation to him. Breckinridge recommended that Davis appoint <a href="Isaac%20M.%20St.%20John">Isaac M. St. John</a>, head of the Confederate <a href="Nitre%20and%20Mining%20Bureau">Nitre and Mining Bureau</a>, as permanent commissary general. Davis made the appointment on February 15, and the flow of supplies to Confederate armies improved under St. John. With Confederate ranks plagued by desertion, Breckinridge instituted a <a href="conscription">draft</a>; when this proved ineffective, he negotiated the resumption of <a href="American_Civil_War_prison_camps%23Prisoner_exchanges">prisoner exchange</a>s with the Union in order to replenish the Confederates' depleted manpower.

By late February, Breckinridge had concluded that the Confederate cause was hopeless. He opposed the use of <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> by Confederate forces and urged a national surrender. Meeting with Confederate senators from <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, Kentucky, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, he urged, "This has been a magnificent epic. In God's name let it not terminate in a farce." In April, with Union forces approaching Richmond, Breckinridge organized the escape of the other cabinet officials to <a href="Danville%2C%20Virginia">Danville, Virginia</a>. Afterward, he ordered the burning of the bridges over the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> and ensured the destruction of buildings and supplies that might aid the enemy. During the surrender of the city, he helped preserve the Confederate government and military records housed there.

After a brief rendezvous with <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s retreating forces at <a href="Farmville%2C%20Virginia">Farmville, Virginia</a>, Breckinridge moved south to <a href="Greensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a>, where he, <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Naval Secretary</a> <a href="Stephen%20Mallory">Stephen Mallory</a>, and Postmaster General <a href="John%20Henninger%20Reagan">John Henninger Reagan</a> joined Generals <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> and <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a> to urge surrender. Davis and <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Judah%20P.%20Benjamin">Judah P. Benjamin</a> initially resisted, but eventually asked <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="William%20T.%20Sherman">William T. Sherman</a> to parley. Johnston and Breckinridge negotiated terms with Sherman, but President Andrew Johnson (who had assumed the presidency on <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln's assassination</a> on April 15) rejected them as too generous. On Davis' orders, Breckinridge told Johnston to meet <a href="Richard%20Taylor%20%28general%29">Richard Taylor</a> in Alabama, but Johnston, believing his men would refuse to fight any longer, surrendered to Sherman on similar terms to those offered to Lee at <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">Appomattox</a>.

After the failed negotiations, Confederate Attorney General <a href="George%20Davis%20%28Confederate%20States%20politician%29">George Davis</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Confederate Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="George%20Trenholm">George Trenholm</a> resigned. The rest of the Confederate cabinet—escorted by over 2,000 cavalrymen under <a href="Basil%20W.%20Duke">Basil W. Duke</a> and Breckinridge's cousin <a href="William%20Campbell%20Preston%20Breckinridge">William Campbell Preston Breckinridge</a>—traveled southwest to meet Taylor at <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>. Believing that the Confederate cause was not yet lost, Davis convened a <a href="council%20of%20war">council of war</a> on May 2 in <a href="Abbeville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Abbeville, South Carolina</a>, but the cavalry commanders told him that the only cause for which their men would fight was to aid Davis's escape from the country. Informed that gold and silver coins and bullion from the Confederate treasury were at the train depot in Abbeville, Breckinridge ordered Duke to load it onto wagons and guard it as they continued southward. "En route" to <a href="Washington%2C%20Georgia">Washington, Georgia</a>, some members of the cabinet's escort threatened to take their back salaries by force. Breckinridge had intended to wait until their arrival to make the payments, but to avoid mutiny, he dispersed some of the funds immediately. Two brigades deserted immediately after being paid; the rest continued to Washington, where the remaining funds were deposited in a local bank.

Discharging most of the remaining escort, Breckinridge left Washington with a small party on May 5, hoping to distract federal forces from the fleeing Confederate president. Between Washington and <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Georgia">Woodstock</a>, the party was overtaken by Union forces under <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Andrew%20K.%20Campbell">Andrew K. Campbell</a>; Breckinridge ordered his nephew to surrender while he, his sons Cabell and <a href="Clifton%20R.%20Breckinridge">Clifton</a>, James B. Clay, Jr., and a few others fled into the nearby woods. At <a href="Sandersville%2C%20Georgia">Sandersville</a>, he sent Clay and Clifton home, announcing that he and the rest of his companions would proceed to <a href="Madison%2C%20Florida">Madison, Florida</a>. On May 11, they reached <a href="Milltown%2C%20Georgia">Milltown, Georgia</a>, where Breckinridge expected to rendezvous with Davis, but on May 14, he learned of Davis's capture days earlier.

Besides marking the end of the Confederacy and the war, Davis's capture left Breckinridge as the highest-ranking former Confederate still at large. Fearing arrest, he fled to Cuba, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Great Britain</a>, and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, where he lived in exile. Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation of amnesty for all former Confederates in December 1868, and Breckinridge returned home the following March. Friends and government officials, including President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, urged him to return to politics, but he declared himself "an extinct volcano" and never sought public office again. He died of complications from war-related injuries on May 17, 1875.

Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman

Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman (Malay for "Pah Wongso the Righteous Warrior") is a 1941 <a href="detective%20film">detective film</a> from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now Indonesia). The first production by <a href="Star%20Film%20%28Dutch%20East%20Indies%20company%29">Star Film</a>, it was produced by Jo Eng Sek and features camerawork by Cho' Chin Hsin. Starring <a href="L.%20V.%20Wijnhamer%20Jr.">Pah Wongso</a>, <a href="Elly%20Joenara">Elly Joenara</a> and Mohamad Arief, it follows the social worker Pah Wongso as he investigates a murder to clear his protégé's name.

The first film of its genre to be produced in the Indies, "Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman" was made to capitalize on the popularity of Wijnhamer and <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> characters such as <a href="Charlie%20Chan">Charlie Chan</a> and <a href="Mr.%20Moto">Mr. Moto</a>. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer <a href="Saeroen">Saeroen</a> suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, "<a href="Pah%20Wongso%20Tersangka">Pah Wongso Tersangka</a>", was released later in 1941 but is possibly <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

Pah Wongso is a nut seller, social worker, and schoolmaster who lives in <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> and takes care of the local poor. One day his young protégé Wisnoe saves the life of a young woman named Siti when she is almost hit by a carriage. Thankful, her father <a href="Hajji">Haji</a> Abdullah gives Wisnoe a job at his rice mill. Wisnoe's zeal and diligence quickly makes him stand out from his fellow employees and he begins to woo Siti, who returns his affections.

However, Wisnoe's cousin Bardja is envious of his newfound success. A gambler who frequents prostitutes, Bardja is smitten with Siti, who does not love him. Hoping to eliminate his competition, Bardja hires some thugs to kill Wisnoe; this attempt fails, and Bardja's financial situation becomes increasingly desperate. He decides to steal from his rich uncle but is caught in the act. In the ensuing struggle, he kills the older man, then <a href="Frameup">frames</a> Wisnoe for the murder.

Wisnoe is arrested, and soon Pah Wongso – warned by Siti of Bardja's previous treachery – begins to investigate the case. Ultimately he discovers that Bardja is the true murderer and confronts him, resulting in a battle to the death. Wongso emerges victorious, and Wisnoe's name is cleared.

"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman" was produced by Jo Eng Sek, a businessman who had produced the film "<a href="Si%20Tjonat">Si Tjonat</a>" in 1929. Cinematography on this black-and-white film was handled by Cho' Chin Hsin, who had recently immigrated from <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. The film was the first production of <a href="Star%20Film%20%28Dutch%20East%20Indies%20company%29">Star Film</a>, a studio which Jo and Cho' had established in Prinsenland, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta).

At the time, the <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> characters <a href="Charlie%20Chan">Charlie Chan</a> and <a href="Mr.%20Moto">Mr. Moto</a> were popular in the Indies, as were imported <a href="detective%20film">detective film</a>s in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful with <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> audiences. For this, he approached <a href="Pah%20Wongso">L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr.</a>, an <a href="Indo%20people">Indo</a> man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> aid in <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">war-torn China</a>. Wijnhamer accepted the role.

To support Wongso, stage actress <a href="Elly%20Joenara">Elly Joenara</a> was cast as Siti, making her film debut, while Mohamad Arief appeared as Wisnu. Other cast members included Djoenaedi, R. Sukran, and Miss Satijem. To ensure that fight scenes went smoothly, Jo hired members of Primo Oesman's "<a href="silat">silat</a>" and boxing group to perform as criminals; Oesman, a professional boxer, also appeared in the film.

"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman" was rated for audiences over the age of 17. It premiered at the Rex Theatre in Batavia on 1 April 1941, following a short speech by Wijnhamer. It had reached <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> by June, where it was advertised as a film of intrigue, life, and death. Although intended predominantly for domestic consumption, it was also screened in China, Singapore and <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>. When the film reached Singapore in July 1941, it was touted as a "thrilling Malay detective story ... full of thrills and excitement from beginning to end".

The Indonesian film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> records "Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman" as a commercial success. Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the "<a href="Bataviaasch%20Nieuwsblad">Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad</a>" praised the quality of the film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story. In the Malayan magazine "Film Melayu", a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective. The critic and filmwriter <a href="Saeroen">Saeroen</a> expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.

By September 1941, Jo had begun production of a second – and final – film starring Wongso, titled "<a href="Pah%20Wongso%20Tersangka">Pah Wongso Tersangka</a>" ("Pah Wongso Becomes a Suspect"). Directed by Wu Tsun, this late 1941 release featured Pah Wongso in four roles and showed him attempting to clear his name after being framed for a crime. Arief, Primo, and Sukran were also recast in this film, which was billed as the colony's first <a href="comedy%20film">comedy film</a>. Although Joenara did not return for "Pah Wongso Tersangka", she acted in three further films for Star; her acting career continued into the 1950s, and she became a producer in the early 1970s.

"Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman" may be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a>, and after a fire destroyed much of <a href="Produksi%20Film%20Negara">Produksi Film Negara</a>'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the <a href="Netherlands%20Government%20Information%20Service">Netherlands Government Information Service</a>.

Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI

Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI (; Indonesian for "Treachery of G30S/PKI") is a 1984 Indonesian <a href="docudrama">docudrama</a> written and directed by <a href="Arifin%20C.%20Noer">Arifin C. Noer</a>, produced by <a href="Gufran%20Dwipayana">G. Dwipayana</a>, and starring <a href="Amoroso%20Katamsi">Amoroso Katamsi</a>, <a href="Umar%20Kayam">Umar Kayam</a>, and Syubah Asa. Produced over a period of two years with a budget of <a href="Indonesian%20rupiah">Rp</a>. 800 million, the film was sponsored by <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a>'s <a href="New%20Order%20%28Indonesia%29">New Order</a> government. It was based on an official history of the <a href="30%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSeptember%20Movement">30 September Movement</a> (, or G30S) <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> in 1965 written by <a href="Nugroho%20Notosusanto">Nugroho Notosusanto</a> and <a href="Ismail%20Saleh">Ismail Saleh</a>, which depicted the coup as being orchestrated by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Communist Party of Indonesia</a> (, or PKI).

The film depicts the period leading up to the coup and several days after it. In a time of economic turmoil, six generals are kidnapped and killed by the PKI and <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>, purportedly to pre-empt a coup against President <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>. General Suharto destroys the coup and, afterwards urges the Indonesian populace to commemorate those killed and fight against all forms of <a href="communism">communism</a>. The film shows the G30S leadership as ruthless and planning "every move to the last detail", taking joy in using excessive violence and torturing the generals, depictions which have been read as portraying "the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human".

The first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965, "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a>, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers – although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students. Since the <a href="fall%20of%20Suharto">fall of Suharto</a> in 1998, such use of the film has become less common. Although the film's artistic aspects remain well-received, its misrepresentation of history has been criticised.

"Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was based on the version of the coup endorsed by <a href="Suharto">Suharto</a>'s <a href="New%20Order%20%28Indonesia%29">New Order</a> government, in which the <a href="30%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSeptember%20Movement">30 September Movement</a> (, or G30S) <a href="Coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> was orchestrated by the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Indonesia">Communist Party of Indonesia</a> (, or PKI). In the early 1960s the PKI and other <a href="Left-wing%20politics">leftist</a> parties had the support of President <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>, giving them great political power. By 1965 the PKI claimed millions of members, a growing number influenced by <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> and widespread poverty. The <a href="Indonesian%20Army">Army</a>, however, was distrustful of the PKI, a feeling which the PKI reciprocated.
On the night of 30 September–1 October 1965, a group of <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Armed%20Forces">Indonesian National Armed Forces</a> members calling themselves the 30 September Movement captured and killed six Army generals thought to belong to an anti-revolutionary "Generals' Council", including Commander of the Army <a href="Ahmad%20Yani">Ahmad Yani</a>; another target, <a href="Abdul%20Haris%20Nasution">Abdul Haris Nasution</a>, escaped. The bodies, along with those of others captured by the G30S, were dumped down a well at <a href="Lubang%20Buaya">Lubang Buaya</a>, Jakarta. Later that morning, armed forces occupied <a href="Merdeka%20Square%2C%20Jakarta">Merdeka Square</a> in central Jakarta. From the <a href="Radio%20Republik%20Indonesia">Radio Republik Indonesia</a> (RRI) office there, Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Untung%20Syamsuri">Untung Syamsuri</a> of the <a href="Cakrabirawa">Presidential Guard</a> announced that the movement had secured several key locations in the city in an attempt to forestall a coup by the Generals' Council. They also announced that President Sukarno was under their power. The movement's core leadership, later joined by the President, stayed at <a href="Halim%20Perdanakusuma%20Airport">Halim Perdanakusuma Air Force Base</a>.

Major-General Suharto, the interim leader after Yani's death, became aware of the movement on the morning of 1 October. By evening he had convinced a G30S battalion in Merdeka Square and those occupying the RRI building to surrender, without any bloodshed. Army loyalists under Suharto retook Halim Air Force Base early the following morning. By that time the G30S leadership had escaped, while Sukarno had withdrawn to his palace in <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>. In the years that followed, the Indonesian Army and general populace undertook a <a href="Indonesian%20killings%20of%201965%E2%80%9366">campaign of retribution</a>, killing or capturing registered and suspected PKI members – including most of the G30S leadership.

Indonesia is in turmoil. The populace lives in poverty, while the rich flaunt their wealth. President Sukarno (<a href="Umar%20Kayam">Umar Kayam</a>) is ill and may die. Meanwhile, his political concept of <a href="Nasakom">Nasakom</a> (nationalism, religion, and communism) has promoted an explosive growth in the PKI. The party, which <a href="Madiun%20Affair">staged a coup in 1948</a>, has been attacking and killing people throughout the country. The weakened president is also being manipulated by the party. The PKI has manufactured a story, based on the forged <a href="Gilchrist%20Document">Gilchrist Document</a>, that a Generals' Council is preparing for a coup should Sukarno die. <a href="Dipa%20Nusantara%20Aidit">Aidit</a> (Syubah Asa), <a href="Kamaruzaman%20Sjam">Syam</a>, and the Communist Party leadership secretly plan to use this as an excuse for their own coup. The rank and file members of the Party accept the leadership's explanation and, with the help of "forward-thinking" soldiers and officers (mostly from the <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a>), work to gather the Party's forces. They plan to kidnap seven generals (said to be members of the Generals' Council), overtake the city, and secure Sukarno. The newly named G30S begins training. The <a href="rightist">rightist</a> members of the Army are unaware of this upcoming coup, living happily with their families. By the time they realise that something is amiss, it is too late.

On the night of 30 September–1 October, seven units are sent to kidnap the generals associated with the Council. Nasution manages to escape over a wall, while his <a href="Military%20attach%C3%A9">attaché</a> <a href="Pierre%20Tendean">Pierre Tendean</a> comes running out, wielding a gun; Tendean is quickly captured and, when asked where Nasution is, confesses himself to be the general. Yani, who fights back, is killed in his home; Major General <a href="M.%20T.%20Haryono">M. T. Haryono</a> meets a similar fate. Chief Military Prosecutor <a href="Sutoyo%20Siswomiharjo">Sutoyo Siswomiharjo</a>, Major General <a href="Siswondo%20Parman">Siswondo Parman</a>, and Lieutenant General <a href="Soeprapto%20%28general%29">Soeprapto</a> are captured. Brigadier General <a href="Donald%20Izacus%20Pandjaitan">D. I. Pandjaitan</a> goes willingly, but when he prays for too long before entering the truck he is killed. The bodies and prisoners are taken to the G30S/PKI camp in Lubang Buaya, where the survivors are tortured and killed. Their bodies are then thrown into a well. Later that morning, members of the movement take over the RRI office and force the staff there to read a speech by Untung (Bram Adrianto), which states that the G30S has moved to forestall a coup by the Generals' Council and announces the formation of a "Revolutionary Council". Other G30S/PKI men go to the <a href="Merdeka%20Palace">palace</a> to secure the president but find that he has already left. At Halim, the president speaks with the G30S leaders and declares that he will take full control of the Army. Another radio speech is soon read, outlining the composition of the new Revolutionary Council and announcing changes to Army hierarchy. The G30S leaders begin planning their escape from Halim, to be done before midnight.

Suharto (<a href="Amoroso%20Katamsi">Amoroso Katamsi</a>), awoken early in the morning, denies Untung's announcement, stating explicitly that there is no Generals' Council and making an adjunct record notes on the true nature of G30S. As there is a <a href="power%20vacuum">power vacuum</a> with Yani dead, Suharto takes temporary control of the Army and begins planning a counter-assault with his men; he is, however, unwilling to force a fight. He instead states that he will give a radio announcement, which is delivered after forces loyal to him retake the RRI office; it outlines the situation, describes G30S as <a href="counter-revolutionary">counter-revolutionary</a>, and states that the Army will deal with the coup. The G30S leaders flee Halim, and Suharto's troops retake the air base. Some time later, forces under Suharto's leadership attack a G30S/PKI headquarters. While PKI-affiliated soldiers fight, the Party leadership escapes and separates, planning to continue their struggle underground.

Suharto is soon called to the secondary <a href="Bogor%20Palace">palace in Bogor</a> to speak with Sukarno. There, the president says that he has received assurances from Air Marshal <a href="Omar%20Dani">Omar Dani</a> that the Air Force was not involved. Suharto refutes the statement, noting that the movement's arms were like those of the Air Force. The meeting eventually results in Suharto being confirmed as leader of the Army, working together with <a href="Pranoto%20Reksosamodra">Pranoto Reksosamodra</a>. In their investigation of the events, the Army discovers the camp at Lubang Buaya – including the generals' bodies, which are recovered while Suharto delivers a speech describing the coup and the PKI's role in it. The generals are interred elsewhere and Suharto delivers a hagiographic eulogy in which he condemns the G30S and PKI and urges the Indonesian people to continue the fallen generals' struggle.

"Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was directed by <a href="Arifin%20C.%20Noer">Arifin C. Noer</a>, a <a href="Citra%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Citra Award</a>-winning director with a background in theatre. He had previous experience in the genre, having made the <a href="war%20film">war film</a> "<a href="Serangan%20Fajar">Serangan Fajar</a>" ("Dawn Attack"; 1981), which emphasised Suharto's role in the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">National Revolution</a>. Noer was assigned to work on the film by the state-owned <a href="Produksi%20Film%20Negara">National Film Production Company</a> (, or PPFN), which maintained a degree of control over the production. Professors of Indonesian culture Krishna Sen and David T. Hill suggest that Noer's creative input was minimal. Instead, "for all intents and purposes" the film was the work of its producer, Brigadier-General <a href="Gufran%20Dwipayana">Gufran Dwipayana</a>, then the head of PPFN and a member of the presidential staff. However, Noer's wife <a href="Jajang%20C.%20Noer">Jajang C. Noer</a> insists that he had remained independent while making the film.
The screenplay for "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was based on a 1968 book by the military historian <a href="Nugroho%20Notosusanto">Nugroho Notosusanto</a> and the investigator <a href="Ismail%20Saleh">Ismail Saleh</a> entitled "The Coup Attempt of the 30 September Movement in Indonesia". The book, which was meant to counter foreign theories about the coup, detailed the 30 September Movement as the government viewed it. Only Notosusanto, the higher-ranking of the two authors, was credited for his contribution. In adapting the book Noer read much of the available literature (including court documents) and interviewed numerous eyewitnesses; Jajang, in a 1998 interview, said that her husband had not only read the official government version, but also the controversial <a href="Cornell%20Paper">Cornell Paper</a>, which portrayed the coup as entirely an internal Army affair. During filming the crew emphasised realism, "paying great attention to detail" and using the generals' actual homes.

Owing to the large number of roles – including some 100 <a href="bit%20part">bit part</a>s and more than 10,000 <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extras</a> – casting for "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was difficult. Noer attempted to cast actors who resembled the historical figures depicted; <a href="Rano%20Karno">Rano Karno</a> later recalled that he was rejected for the role of Pierre Tendean as the latter did not have a <a href="melanocytic%20nevus">mole</a> on his face. Ultimately the film starred Bram Adrianto as Untung, Amoroso Katamsi as Suharto, Umar Kayam as Sukarno, and Syubah Asa as Aidit; other actors included Ade Irawan, <a href="Sofia%20W.D.">Sofia W.D.</a>, Dani Marsuni, and Charlie Sahetapy. Kayam, then a lecturer at <a href="Gadjah%20Mada%20University">Gadjah Mada University</a> in <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, did not have the time to research Sukarno's mannerisms from his books and speeches; instead, he portrayed the president based on testimonials from the staff at the Bogor palace. Katamsi, on the other hand, studied Suharto's role from books and, by the time filming had commenced, felt as if "was "Pak" Harto, not an imitation of "Pak" Harto." Sanusi, meanwhile, considered his own performance underwhelming.

Production of "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI", originally titled "Sejarah Orde Baru" ("History of the New Order"), took nearly two years, spending four months in <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a> and a year and half in filming. It cost <a href="Indonesian%20rupiah">Rp</a>. 800 million, receiving funding from the government. Cinematography was handled by Hasan Basri, with music by Arifin's brother Embie C. Noer. Editing was done by Supandi. Parts of the film, particularly the final ten minutes, reused <a href="Stock%20footage">archival footage</a> and newspaper clippings contemporaneous to the events.

"Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" portrays the PKI and communism as inherently evil, with its followers "beyond redemption", while the G30S leadership are seen as cunning and ruthless, plotting "every move to the last detail". The historian Katherine McGregor finds this emphasised in the film's portrayal of the G30S leadership as gangsters, sitting in secret meetings amidst clouds of cigarette smoke. She considers an opening scene, where the PKI attacks an Islamic school, as likewise meant to show the "evil" nature of communists.

The PKI are portrayed as enjoying violence, with the film heavily featuring "eye-gouging women and decomposed, tortured bodies". The generals are kidnapped, and in several cases killed, in front of their families; later the captured generals are tortured while the communists dance around a bonfire. The sociologist <a href="Adrian%20Vickers">Adrian Vickers</a> suggests that the film's violence was meant to portray "the state's enemies as outside the realm of the human", similar to monsters in horror films. Yoseph Yapi Taum of <a href="Sanata%20Dharma%20University">Sanata Dharma University</a> notes that members of the leftist women's movement <a href="Gerwani">Gerwani</a> are shown as part of a "crazy" Communist Party, dancing in the nude and cutting off the general's penises. However, Vickers considers these portrayals as ambiguous, suggesting that the New Order government was allowed a monopoly on violence. McGregor suggests that the violence in once-tranquil homes shows the "'destruction' of the family". Sen notes the violence belies a "representation of chaos before order" which is common in New Order films.

Before its commercial release, "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was pre-screened for high-ranking military officers who had been involved in stopping the coup, including Suharto and <a href="Sarwo%20Edhie%20Wibowo">Sarwo Edhie Wibowo</a>. The film was released in 1984, the first commercially released domestic feature film to deal with the events of 1965. It was seen by 699,282 people in Jakarta by the end of 1984, a national record which remained unbroken for over a decade. However, not all audiences attended of their own volition. The Indonesian sociologist <a href="Ariel%20Heryanto">Ariel Heryanto</a> records students as being "required to pay" to see the film during school hours, a fact not reflected in contemporary records. A novelisation by <a href="popular%20fiction">popular writer</a> Arswendo Atmowiloto likewise helped promote the film.

Dwipayana's influence ensured that contemporary reviews, especially synopses, repeated the government's position on the G30S coup. This is not to say all reviews were positive. Marselli of "<a href="Kompas">Kompas</a>", for instance, found that "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was highly detailed, with extensive work and quality acting going to represent events accurately. He felt, however, that the film felt too long and, as viewers knew instantly who the good and bad characters were, it became "nothing but a black-and-white portrait without any complex issues", which ignored the underlying problems which had sparked the G30S movement.

Suharto, after viewing an early screening, stated that the story was unfinished and suggested that a sequel was necessary. Two sequels by PPFN, "Operasi Trisula" "(Operation Trisula; 1987)" and "Djakarta 1966" ("Jakarta 1966"; 1988), followed. "Operasi Trisula", directed by BZ Kadaryono, dealt with the extermination of G30S and PKI members in <a href="Blitar">Blitar</a>, <a href="East%20Java">East Java</a>. "Djakarta 1966", meanwhile, was directed by Noer and showed the lead-up to the signing of <a href="Supersemar">Supersemar</a> on 11 March 1966, in which Sukarno gave Suharto authority to take whatever measures he "deemed necessary"; Kayam and Katamsi reprised their roles for the latter film, which won seven awards at the 1989 Bandung Film Festival.

Beginning in 1984 the New Order government used "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" as a propaganda vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network <a href="TVRI">TVRI</a>, and later on private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine "<a href="Tempo%20%28Indonesian%20magazine%29">Tempo</a>" found 97 per cent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87 per cent of them had seen it more than once.

During the remainder of the 1980s and early 1990s the historical accuracy of "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was little disputed, and the film became representative of canonical history; its version of the 1965 events was the only one allowed in open discourse. By the mid-1990s, however, anonymous <a href="Internet%20in%20Indonesia">internet communities</a> and small publications had begun questioning the movie's contents; one online message, sent anonymously through a <a href="mailing%20list">mailing list</a>, asked "If only a small section of the PKI leadership and military agents knew about [the coup, as in the film], how is it that over a million people were killed and thousands of people who knew nothing had to be imprisoned, exiled, and lost their civil rights?" Heryanto suggests that this resulted from an unintended <a href="Polyphony%20%28literature%29">polyphony</a> in the film, while Sen and Hill opine that Noer may have been aware of the government's intent for propaganda and thus made the film's political message "obviously contradictory".

In September 1998, four months after the <a href="fall%20of%20Suharto">fall of Suharto</a>, the Information Minister <a href="Yunus%20Yosfiah">Yunus Yosfiah</a> declared that the film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto in the centre. "Tempo" reported in 2012 that Saleh Basarah of the <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">Indonesian Air Force</a> (former Chief of Staff of the Air Force) had influenced this decree. The magazine stated that Basarah had called the Education Minister <a href="Juwono%20Sudarsono">Juwono Sudarsono</a> and asked him to not screen "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI", as it was damaging to the Air Force. Two other films, "<a href="Janur%20Kuning">Janur Kuning</a>" ("Yellow Coconut Leaves"; 1979) and "Serangan Fajar", were likewise affected by the decree; "Janur Kuning" portrayed Suharto as the hero behind the 1 March 1949 General Assault while "Serangan Fajar" showed him as a major hero of the revolution. At the time it was suggested that TVRI was attempting to distance itself from the former president. This occurred in a period of desanctifying symbols related to the events, and by the early 2000s non-government versions of the G30S coup were easily available in Indonesia.
"Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" has proven Noer's most controversial film, although until his death in 1995 the director remained publicly ambivalent. The film's visuals have generally received positive reviews, but its use for propaganda and historical accuracy have been widely condemned. The Indonesian director <a href="Hanung%20Bramantyo">Hanung Bramantyo</a> praised the film's style, stating that close-up shots of men smoking were "brilliant" and that, at times, he felt "it's not a film. But real!" The director <a href="Monty%20Tiwa">Monty Tiwa</a> likewise praised the film's shots, citing a scene where Pandjaitan's daughter cries hysterically as her father is shot as "full of drama and using a shot [he had] never seen before in an Indonesian film". Sen and Hill, however, find "none of the aesthetic hallmarks" of the director's other works.

Hilmar Farid, an Indonesian historian, called the film propaganda mixed with "some [of the New Order's] fantasies". The reporter Hendro Subroto, who recorded the retrieval of the generals' bodies from Lubang Buaya, criticised the film's accuracy in 2001; he stated that the bodies did not show any evidence of torture. The former <a href="Lekra">Lekra</a> writer <a href="Putu%20Oka%20Sukanta">Putu Oka Sukanta</a>, meanwhile, described the film as underplaying the suffering of PKI members and other leftists in the events following the G30S coup, thus becoming "a lie to the people". The historian John Roosa contrasts the portrayal of the G30S leadership with a document by Brigadier General M.A. Supardjo, which portrays the coup – led by "flummoxed, indecisive, and disorganized" men – as largely defeating itself.

In a 2012 interview, Katamsi admitted the film was in part overacted and that it had been a potent way to spread and indoctrinate viewers in the New Order's ideology. The "Tempo" survey suggested that it was effective propaganda, leading viewers to "reject all that smelled of the PKI and communism". Although it is no longer broadcast on 30 September, the film remains available. A <a href="video%20CD">video CD</a> edition was released by Virgo in 2001 and the G30S/PKI museum at Lubang Buaya offers regular screenings in an on-site cinema. Both a <a href="35%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm">35 mm</a> and <a href="VHS">VHS</a> copy are stored at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a> in Jakarta.

"Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" received seven nominations at the 1984 <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a> ("", or FFI), winning one Citra Award for Best Screenplay. It was beaten in four categories, for <a href="Citra%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>, Best Cinematography, <a href="Citra%20Award%20for%20Best%20Leading%20Actor">Best Leading Actor</a>, and Best Musical Direction, by <a href="Sjumandjaja">Sjumandjaja</a>'s "<a href="Budak%20Nafsu">Budak Nafsu</a>" ("Slave to Passion"), while <a href="Slamet%20Rahardjo">Slamet Rahardjo</a>'s "<a href="Ponirah%20Terpidana">Ponirah Terpidana</a>" ("Ponirah Convicted") took Best Artistic Direction. At the 1985 FFI "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" received an Antemas Award as the best-selling film of the preceding calendar year. The film scholar Thomas Barker suggests that the film's awards were, in part, a conjunction of state and FFI interests: both were focused on promoting a united national culture.

Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom

Resurrectionists were commonly employed by <a href="anatomy">anatomists</a> in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries to <a href="Exhumation">exhume</a> the bodies of the recently dead. Between 1506 and 1752 only a very few <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s were available each year for anatomical research. The supply was increased when, in an attempt to intensify the deterrent effect of the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">death penalty</a>, <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> passed the By allowing judges to substitute the <a href="gibbeting">public display</a> of executed criminals with <a href="dissection">dissection</a> (a fate generally viewed with horror), the new law significantly increased the number of bodies anatomists could legally access. This proved insufficient to meet the needs of the <a href="hospital">hospital</a>s and teaching centres that opened during the 18th century. Corpses and their component parts became a commodity, but although the practice of disinterment was hated by the general public, bodies were not legally anyone's property. The resurrectionists therefore operated in a legal <a href="loophole">grey area</a>.

Nevertheless, resurrectionists caught plying their trade ran the risk of physical attack. Measures taken to stop them included the use of increased security at graveyards. Night watches patrolled grave sites, the rich placed their dead in secure <a href="coffin">coffin</a>s, and physical barriers such as <a href="mortsafe">mortsafe</a>s and heavy stone slabs made extraction of corpses more difficult. <a href="Body%20snatcher">Body snatcher</a>s were not the only people to come under attack; in the public's view, the 1752 Act made anatomists agents of the law, enforcers of the <a href="death%20penalty">death penalty</a>. Riots at execution sites, from where anatomists collected legal corpses, were commonplace.

Matters came to a head following the <a href="Burke%20and%20Hare%20murders">Burke and Hare murders</a> of 1828. Parliament responded by setting up the 1828 <a href="Select%20Committee">Select Committee</a> on anatomy, whose report emphasised the importance of anatomical science and recommended that the bodies of paupers be given over for dissection. In response to the discovery in 1831 of a gang known as the <a href="London%20Burkers">London Burkers</a>, who apparently modelled their activities on those of Burke and Hare, Parliament debated a <a href="Bill%20%28law%29">bill</a> submitted by <a href="Henry%20Warburton">Henry Warburton</a>, author of the Select Committee's report. Although it did not make body snatching illegal, the <a href="Anatomy%20Act%201832">resulting Act of Parliament</a> effectively put an end to the work of the resurrectionists by allowing anatomists access to the <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> dead.

Human cadavers have been dissected by physicians since at least the 3rd century BC, but throughout history, prevailing religious views on the desecration of corpses often meant that such work was performed in secrecy. The Christian church forbade human dissection until the 14th century, when the first recorded anatomisation of a cadaver took place in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>. Until then, anatomical research was limited to the dissection of animals. In Britain, human dissection was proscribed by law until 1506, when King <a href="James%20IV%20of%20Scotland">James IV of Scotland</a> gave royal <a href="patronage">patronage</a> to the <a href="Barber-Surgeons%20of%20Edinburgh">Barber-Surgeons of Edinburgh</a>, allowing them to dissect the "bodies of certain executed criminals". England followed in 1540, when <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> gave patronage to the <a href="Company%20of%20Barber-Surgeons">Company of Barber-Surgeons</a>, allowing them access to four executed felons each year (<a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> later increased this to six felons each year). <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> granted the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">College of Physicians</a> the right to anatomise four felons annually in 1564.

Several major hospitals and teaching centres were established in Britain during the 18th century, but with only a very few corpses legally available for dissection, these institutions suffered from severe shortages. Some local authorities had already attempted to alleviate the problem, with limited success; in 1694, Edinburgh allowed anatomists to dissect corpses "found dead in the streets, and the bodies of such as die violent deaths ... who shall have nobody to own them". Suicide victims were given over, as were infants who had died while being born and also the unclaimed bodies of abandoned children. But even though they were supported by the <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, anatomists occasionally found it difficult to collect what was granted to them. Fuelled by resentment of how readily the <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">death penalty</a> was used, and imbued with superstitious beliefs, crowds sometimes sought to keep the bodies of executed felons away from the authorities. Riots at execution sites were commonplace; worried about possible disorder, in 1749 the <a href="Sheriffs%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">Sheriff of London</a> ignored the surgeons and gave the dead to their relatives.

These problems, together with a desire to enhance the deterrent effect of the death penalty, resulted in the passage of the <a href="Murder%20Act%201751">Murder Act 1752</a>. It required that "every murderer shall, after execution, either be dissected or hung in chains". Dissection was generally viewed as "a fate worse than death"; giving judges the ability to substitute <a href="gibbeting">gibbeting</a> with dissection was an attempt to invoke that horror. While the Act gave anatomists <a href="Statutory%20law">statutory</a> access to many more cadavers than were previously available, it proved insufficient. Attempting to bolster the supply, some surgeons offered money to pay the prison expenses and funeral clothing costs of condemned prisoners, while bribes were paid to officials present at the gallows, sometimes leading to an unfortunate situation in which corpses not legally given over for dissection were taken anyway.

Documented cases of grave robbery for medical purposes can be found as far back as 1319. The 15th-century <a href="polymath">polymath</a> <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> may have secretly dissected around 30 corpses, although their provenance remains unknown. In Britain, the practice appears to have been common early in the 17th century. For example, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s epitaph reads "Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear, To dig the dust enclosed here. Blessed be the man that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones" and in 1678, anatomists were suspected of being involved in the disappearance of an executed gypsy's body. Contracts issued in 1721 by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons include a clause directing students not to become involved in exhumation, suggesting, according to historian Ruth Richardson, that students had already done the exact opposite. Pupils accompanied professional <a href="body%20snatching">body snatchers</a> as observers, and were reported to have obtained and paid for their studies with human corpses, perhaps indicating that their tutors were complicit. The unauthorised removal of bodies from London graveyards became commonplace and by the 1720s, probably as a direct result of the lack of legally available bodies for anatomical research, fresh corpses had likely undergone <a href="commodification">commodification</a>.
Corpses and parts thereof were traded like any other merchandise: packed into suitable containers, salted and preserved, stored in cellars and <a href="wharf">quays</a> and transported in carts, <a href="waggon">waggon</a>s and boats. Encouraged by fierce competition, anatomy schools usually paid more promptly than their peers, who included individual surgeons, artists and others with an interest in human anatomy. As one body snatcher testified, "a man may make a good living at it, if he is a sober man, and acts with judgement, and supplies the schools".
In London, late 18th-century anatomists may have delegated their grave-robbing almost entirely to body snatchers, or, as they were commonly known, resurrectionists. A fifteen-strong gang of such men, exposed in Lambeth in 1795, supplied "eight surgeons of public repute, and a man who calls himself an Articulator". The report into their activities lists a price of two <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> and a <a href="Crown%20%28British%20coin%29">crown</a> for a dead body, six <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> for the first foot, and nine <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">pence</a> per inch "for all it measures more in length". These prices were by no means fixed; the <a href="black%20market">black market</a> value of corpses varied considerably. Giving evidence to the 1828 <a href="Select%20Committee">Select Committee</a> on Anatomy, the surgeon <a href="Astley%20Cooper">Astley Cooper</a> testified that in 1828 the price for a corpse was about eight guineas, but also that he had paid anything from two to fourteen guineas previously; others claimed they had paid up to twenty guineas per corpse. Compared to the five shillings an <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a> silk weaver could earn each week, or the single guinea a manservant to a wealthy household was paid, these were considerable sums of money and body snatching was therefore a highly profitable business. Surgeons at the Royal College in Edinburgh complained that resurrectionists were <a href="Profiteering%20%28business%29">profiteering</a>, particularly when local shortages forced prices up. One surgeon told the Select Committee that he thought the body snatchers were manipulating the market for their own benefit, though no criticism was made of the "Anatomy Club", an attempt by anatomists to control the price of corpses for their benefit.

Prices also varied depending on what type of corpse was for sale. With greater opportunity for the study of musculature, males were preferable to females, while <a href="freak">freak</a>s were more highly valued. The body of <a href="Charles%20Byrne%20%28giant%29">Charles Byrne</a>, the so-called "Irish Giant", fetched about £500 when it was bought by <a href="John%20Hunter%20%28surgeon%29">John Hunter</a>. Byrne's skeleton remains on display at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons of England</a>. Children's bodies were also traded, as "big smalls", "smalls" or foetuses. Parts of corpses, such as a scalp with long hair attached, or good quality teeth, also fetched good prices—not because they held any intrinsic value to the anatomist, but rather because they were used to refurbish the living.
With no reliable figures for the number of dissections that took place in 18th-century Britain, the true scale of body snatching can only be estimated. Richardson suggests that nationally, several thousand bodies were robbed each year. The 1828 Select Committee reported that in 1826, 592 bodies were dissected by 701 students. In 1831, only 52 of 1,601 death penalties handed down were enacted, a number far too small to meet demand. Since corpses were not viewed as property and could neither be owned nor stolen, body snatching remained quasi-legal, the crime being committed against the grave rather than the body. On the rare occasions they were caught, resurrectionists might have received a public whipping, or a sentence for crimes against public <a href="wikt%3Amores">mores</a>, but generally the practice was treated by the authorities as an open secret and ignored. A notable exception occurred in <a href="Great%20Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a> in 1827, with the capture of three resurrectionists. At a time when thieves were regularly <a href="Penal%20transportation">transported</a> for theft, two of the body snatchers were discharged and the third, sent to London for trial, was imprisoned for only six months. Resurrectionists were also aided by the corpse's anatomisation; since the process also destroyed the evidence, a successful prosecution was unlikely.

Resurrectionists usually found corpses through a network of informers. <a href="Sexton%20%28office%29">Sextons</a>, gravediggers, undertakers, local officials; each connived to take a cut of the proceeds. Working mostly in small gangs at night with a "dark lanthorn", their "<a href="modus%20operandi">modus operandi</a>" was to dig a hole—sometimes using a quieter, wooden spade—down to one end of the coffin. To disguise this activity, the spoil was sometimes thrown onto a piece of canvas at the side of the grave. A sound-deadening sack was placed over the lid, which was then lifted. The weight of soil on the remainder of the lid snapped the wood, enabling the robbers to hoist the body out. The corpse was then stripped of its clothing, tied up, and placed into a sack. The entire process could be completed within 30 minutes. Moving the corpse of a pauper was less troublesome, as their bodies were often kept in <a href="mass%20grave">mass grave</a>s, left open to the environment until filled—which often took weeks.

If caught in the act, body snatchers could find themselves at the mercy of the local population. A violent confrontation took place in a Dublin churchyard in 1828, when a party of mourners confronted a group of resurrectionists. The would-be body snatchers withdrew, only to return several hours later with more men. The mourners had also added to their number, and both groups had brought firearms. A "volley of bullets, slugs, and swan-shot from the resurrectionists" prompted a "discharge of fire-arms from the defenders". Close-quarters fighting included the use of pick axes, until the resurrectionists retreated. In the same city, a man caught removing a corpse from a graveyard in Hollywood was shot and killed in 1832. In the same year, three men were apprehended while transporting the bodies of two elderly men, near <a href="Deptford">Deptford</a> in London. As rumours spread that the two corpses were murder victims, a large crowd assembled outside the station house. When the suspects were brought out to be transported to the local magistrates, the approximately 40-strong force of police officers found it difficult to "prevent their prisoners being sacrificed by the indignant multitude, which was most anxious to inflict such punishment upon them as it thought they deserved."

As many as seven gangs of resurrectionists may have been at work in 1831. The 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy believed that there were about 200 London resurrectionists, most of them working part-time. The London Borough Gang, which operated from about 1802 to 1825, at its peak consisted of at least six men, led first by a former hospital porter named Ben Crouch, and later by a man called Patrick Murphy. Under the protection of Astley Cooper, Crouch's gang supplied some of London's biggest anatomical schools, but relations were not always amicable. In 1816 the gang cut off supplies to the <a href="St%20Thomas%27%20Hospital">St Thomas Hospital School</a>, demanding an increase of two guineas per corpse. When the school responded by using freelancers, members of the gang burst into the dissecting rooms, threatened the students and attacked the corpses. The police were called, but worried about adverse publicity, the school paid their attackers' bail and opened negotiations. The gang also attempted to put rivals out of business, sometimes by desecrating a graveyard (thereby rendering it unsafe to rob graves from for weeks thereafter) and other times by reporting freelance resurrectionists to the police, recruiting them once freed from prison. Joshua Naples, who wrote "The Diary of a Resurrectionist", a list of his activities from 1811–1812, was one such individual. Among entries detailing the graveyards he plundered, the institutions he delivered to, how much he was paid and his drunkenness, Naples diary mentions his gang's inability to work under a full Moon, being unable to sell a body deemed "putrid", and leaving a body thought to be infected with <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>.

Violent mobs were not the only problems body snatchers faced. Naples also wrote of how he met "patrols" and how "dogs flew at us", references to some of the measures taken to secure graves against his ilk. The aristocracy and very rich placed their dead in <a href="triple%20coffin">triple coffin</a>s, <a href="Burial%20vault%20%28tomb%29">vaults</a> and private chapels, sometimes guarded by servants. For the less wealthy, double coffins were available, buried on private land in deep graves. More basic defences included the placing of heavy weights over the coffin, or simply filling the grave with stones rather than soil. Such deterrents were sometimes deployed in vain; at least one London graveyard was owned by an anatomist who, it was reported, "obtained a famous supply [of cadavers] ... and he could charge pretty handsomely for burying a body there, and afterwards get from his pupils from eight to twelve guineas for taking it up again!" Ever more elaborate creations included "The Patent Coffin", an iron contraption with concealed springs to prevent any levering of its lid. Corpses were sometimes secured inside their caskets by iron straps, while other designs used special screws to reinforce metal bands placed around the coffin. In Scotland, iron cages called mortsafes either encased buried coffins, or were set in a concrete foundation and covered the whole grave. Some covered more than one coffin, while others took the form of iron lattices fixed beneath large stone slabs, buried with the coffin. They may not have been secure enough; as one 20th-century writer observed, an empty coffin found beneath a buried mortsafe in <a href="Aberlour">Aberlour</a> had probably been "opened during the night succeeding the funeral, and carefully closed again, so that the disturbance of the soil had escaped notice or had been attributed to the original burial."

Occasionally, resurrectionists paid women to pose as grieving relatives, so that they might claim a body from a workhouse. Some parishes did little to stop this practice, as it reduced their funeral expenditure. Bodies were also taken from <a href="dead%20house">dead house</a>s; Astley Cooper's servant was once forced to return three bodies, worth £34 2s, to a dead house in <a href="Newington%20%28parish%29">Newington parish</a>. Bribes were also paid, usually to servants of recently deceased employers then lying in state, although this method carried its own risks as corpses were often placed on public display before they were buried. Some were taken from private homes; in 1831 "The Times" reported that "a party of resurrectionists" burst into a house in Bow Lane and took the body of an elderly woman, who was being waked' by her friends and neighbours". The thieves apparently "acted with the most revolting indecency, dragging the corpse in its death clothes after them through the mud in the street". Bodies were even removed—with no legal authority—from prisons and naval and military hospitals.

While some surgeons eschewed human cadavers in favour of artificial facsimiles, plaster casts, wax models and animals, bodies were also taken from hospital burial grounds. Recent excavations at the <a href="Royal%20London%20Hospital">Royal London Hospital</a> appear to support claims made almost 200 years earlier that the hospital's school was "entirely supplied by subjects, which have been their own patients".

The moving in 1783 of London's executions, from <a href="Tyburn">Tyburn</a> to <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a>, reduced the likelihood of public interference and strengthened the authorities' hold over felons. However, society's view of dissection remained unequivocal; most preferred gibbeting to the laying open of a corpse. Martin Gray, sentenced to death in 1721 for returning early from transportation, was "greatly frighted, least his Body should be cut, and torn, and mangled after Death, and had sent his Wife to his Uncle to obtain some money to prevent it." Vincent Davis, convicted in 1725 of murdering his wife, said he would rather be "hang'd in Chains" than "anatomiz'd", and to that effect had "sent many Letters to all his former Friends and Acquaintance to form a Company, and prevent the Surgeons in their Designs upon his Body". There are cases of criminals who survived the <a href="short%20drop">short drop</a>, but dissecting the body removed any hope of escape from death's embrace. Anatomists were popularly thought to be interested in dissection only as enactors of the law, a relationship first established by kings James IV and Henry VIII. Thomas Wakley, editor of "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>", wrote that this lowered "the character of the profession in the public mind." It was also thought that the anatomists' work made the body's owner unrecognisable in the afterlife. Therefore, while less hated than the resurrectionists they employed, anatomists remained at risk of attack. Relatives of a man executed in 1820 killed one anatomist and shot another in the face, while in 1831, following the discovery of buried human flesh and three dissected bodies, a mob burnt down an <a href="anatomical%20theatre">anatomy theatre</a> in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>. The theatre's proprietor, Andrew Moir, escaped through a window, while two of his students were chased through the streets.

Some aspects of the popular view of dissection were exemplified by the final panel of <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>'s "<a href="The%20Four%20Stages%20of%20Cruelty">The Four Stages of Cruelty</a>", a series of engravings that depict a felon's journey to the anatomical theatre. The chief surgeon (<a href="John%20Freke%20%28surgeon%29">John Freke</a>) appears as a magistrate, watching over the examination of the murderer Tom Nero's body by the Company of Surgeons. According to author Fiona Haslam, the scene reflects a popular view that surgeons were "on the whole, disreputable, insensitive to human suffering and prone to victimis[ing] people in the same way that criminals victimised their prey." Another popular belief alluded to by Hogarth was that surgeons were so ignorant of the respect due to their subjects, that they allowed the remains to become <a href="offal">offal</a>. In reality, the rough treatment exacted by body snatchers on corpses continued on the premises they delivered to. <a href="Joshua%20Brookes">Joshua Brookes</a> once admitted that he had kicked a corpse in a sack down a flight of stairs, while <a href="Robert%20Christison">Robert Christison</a> complained of the "shocking indecency without any qualifying wit" demonstrated by a male lecturer who dissected a woman. Pranks were also common; a London student who jokingly dropped an amputated leg down a household chimney, into a housewife's stewpot, caused a riot.

In March 1828, in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, three defendants charged with conspiracy and unlawfully procuring and receiving a corpse buried in <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a> were acquitted, while the remaining two were found guilty of possession. The presiding judge's comment, that "the disinterment of bodies for dissection was an offence liable to punishment", prompted <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> to establish the 1828 Select Committee on Anatomy. The committee took evidence from 40 witnesses: 25 members of the medical profession, 12 public servants and 3 resurrectionists, who remained anonymous. Discussed were the importance of anatomy, the supply of subjects for dissection and the relationship between anatomists and resurrectionists. The committee concluded that dissection was essential to the study of human anatomy and recommended that anatomists be allowed to appropriate the bodies of paupers.

The first <a href="Bill%20%28law%29">bill</a> was presented to Parliament in 1829 by <a href="Henry%20Warburton">Henry Warburton</a>, author of the Select Committee's report. Following a spirited defence of the poor by peers in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, it was withdrawn, but almost two years later Warburton introduced a second bill, shortly after the execution of John Bishop and Thomas Williams. The <a href="London%20Burkers">London Burkers</a>, as the two men were known, were inspired by a series of murders committed by <a href="Burke%20and%20Hare%20murders">William Burke and William Hare</a>, two Irishmen who sold their victims' bodies to <a href="Robert%20Knox">Robert Knox</a>, a Scottish surgeon. Even though Burke and Hare never robbed graves, their case lowered the public's view of resurrectionists from desecraters to potential murderers. The resulting wave of social anxiety helped speed Warburton's bill through Parliament, and despite much public opprobrium, with little Parliamentary opposition the <a href="Anatomy%20Act%201832">Anatomy Act 1832</a> became law on 1 August 1832. It abolished that part of the 1752 Act that allowed murderers to be dissected, ending the centuries-old tradition of anatomising felons, although it neither discouraged nor prohibited body snatching, or the sale of corpses (whose legal status remained uncertain). Another clause allowed a person's body to be given up for "anatomical examination", provided that the person concerned had not objected. As the poor were often barely literate and therefore unable to leave written directions in the event of their death, this meant that masters of charitable institutions such as <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>s decided who went to the anatomist's table. A stipulation that witnesses could intervene was also abused, as such witnesses might be fellow inmates who were powerless to object, or workhouse staff who stood to gain money through wilful ignorance.

Despite the passage of the Anatomy Act, resurrection remained commonplace, the supply of unclaimed paupers' bodies at first proving inadequate to fulfil the demand. Reports of body snatching persisted for some years; in 1838, <a href="Poor%20Law%20Commissioner">Poor Law Commissioner</a>s reported on two dead resurrectionists who had contracted an illness from a putrid corpse they had unearthed. By 1844, the trade no longer existed.

Nefarious: Merchant of Souls

Nefarious: Merchant of Souls is a 2011 American <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a> about modern <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a>, specifically <a href="sexual%20slavery">sexual slavery</a>. Presented from a <a href="Christian%20worldview">Christian worldview</a>, "Nefarious" covers <a href="human%20trafficking%20in%20the%20United%20States">human trafficking in the United States</a>, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, alternating interviews with re-enactments. Victims of trafficking talk about having been the objects of physical abuse and attempted murder. Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. The film ends with the assertion that only <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> can completely heal people from the horrors of sexual slavery.

"Nefarious" was written, directed, produced and narrated by <a href="Benjamin%20Nolot">Benjamin Nolot</a>, founder and president of Exodus Cry, the film's distributor. Nolot, who travelled to 19 countries to collect the film's content, said that the purpose of the film is "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." The film was officially released on July 27, 2011, with individual grassroots screenings also taking place. Laila Mickelwait, Exodus Cry's director of awareness and prevention, screened the film in several countries in an attempt to persuade governments to make laws similar to <a href="Prostitution%20in%20Sweden%23The%20Kvinnofrid%20law%20%281999%29">Sweden's "Sex Purchase Act"</a>, which criminalizes the purchasing rather than the selling of sex. The film was released on home video on May 1, 2012.

Interviewees in the film include <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> journalist <a href="Victor%20Malarek">Victor Malarek</a>, <a href="Jerusalem%20Institute%20of%20Justice">Jerusalem Institute of Justice</a> founder <a href="Calev%20Myers">Calev Myers</a>, Christian therapist <a href="Dan%20Allender">Dan Allender</a>, clinical psychologist <a href="Melissa%20Farley">Melissa Farley</a>, Piet Keesman, Baptist missionary <a href="Lauran%20Bethell">Lauran Bethell</a>, <a href="Agape%20International%20Missions">Agape International Missions</a> founder <a href="Don%20Brewster">Don Brewster</a>, anti-trafficking activist <a href="Helen%20Sworn">Helen Sworn</a>, former prostitute <a href="Annie%20Lobert">Annie Lobert</a>, and <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> detective superintendent <a href="Kajsa%20Wahlberg">Kajsa Wahlberg</a>. <a href="Ted%20Baehr">Ted Baehr</a> of "Movieguide", a <a href="Christian%20media">Christian magazine</a>, called the film "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" and commented that it covered the inherently sexual subject matter candidly without displaying nudity. Dan Preston of "Godculture Magazine" praised Nolot's writing and directing. "Nefarious" has won film awards, including the <a href="Honolulu%20Film%20Awards">Honolulu Film Award</a> for best screenplay, the <a href="Urban%20Mediamakers%20Film%20Festival">Urban Mediamakers Film Festival</a> best documentary feature award, and the <a href="Indie%20Fest">Indie Fest</a> feature documentary award of excellence.

"Nefarious: Merchant of Souls" documents modern <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a>, specifically <a href="sexual%20slavery">sexual slavery</a>. While there are men and boys who are trafficked around the world, the United States <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">Department of State (DoS)</a> estimates that about 80% of human trafficking victims are female, and the film focuses on them. Information is presented from a <a href="Christian%20worldview">Christian worldview</a>—despite the subject matter, there is no profanity or nudity in the film, although there are scenes showing alcohol consumption and women wearing skimpy clothing.

"Nefarious" explores how sex trafficking differs from country to country, and suggests that all the victims are both psychologically and emotionally enslaved. One of the initial assertions in the film is that slavery has not been abolished but is increasing, and that half of this slavery is sexual in nature. "Nefarious" identifies <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a> and difficult <a href="Socioeconomics">socioeconomic</a> situations as elements that prevent sex slaves from escaping exploitation, and suggests that most victims do not survive for more than seven years after initially being trafficked. While the violent acquisition of sex slaves depicted in the first sequence of the film does occur in reality, Jimmy Stewart of "<a href="Charisma%20%28magazine%29">Charisma</a>" wrote that most girls who are sexually trafficked in Europe are recruited through a fraudulent offer of employment and an improved lifestyle overseas, neither of which ultimately materializes in the new country.

"Nefarious" asserts that there is a link between the international <a href="sex%20industry">sex industry</a> and <a href="Prostitution%20law">legal prostitution</a> in the Western world, and that those who create the demand for <a href="forced%20prostitution">forced prostitution</a> around the world are of a wide variety of ages and are often considered respectable. The film contrasts the secretiveness and brutality of the sex industry in Eastern Europe with the openness of public <a href="prostitution%20in%20the%20Netherlands">prostitution in the Netherlands</a>. "Nefarious" suggests that sex trafficking in Southeast Asia is fuelled largely by the complicity of the victims' parents, with many in Cambodia <a href="Child%20grooming">grooming</a> and then knowingly selling their daughters into prostitution to pay for luxury goods. The film asserts that 10% of the <a href="Demographics%20of%20Moldova">population of Moldova</a> has been sexually trafficked. "Nefarious" contrasts <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> prostitutes with victims of sex trafficking in Europe, depicting the former as drawn into the sex industry by dreams of a glamorous lifestyle, and the latter as made vulnerable by child abandonment and orphanages.

The film presents human trafficking statistics and assertions from a variety of sources, prominently departments of the United States government and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. These include that human trafficking is growing faster than any other criminal industry, that the average age of those forced into prostitution in the U.S. is 13, that the <a href="commercial%20sexual%20exploitation%20of%20children">commercial sexual exploitation of children</a> victimizes almost two million children globally, that 80% of trafficked women and 50% of <a href="Trafficking%20of%20children">trafficked children</a> are sexually exploited, that 161 <a href="Member%20states%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">UN member states</a> engage in human trafficking, and that modern slavery has an annual revenue of —according to the film, higher than the annual revenues of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>, the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a>, the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> and the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> combined. The film indicates that "trafficking is an exploitation of vulnerability" and expresses the need to "take away the stigma that [prostitutes] choose to be there." <a href="Kevin%20Bales">Kevin Bales</a> of <a href="Free%20the%20Slaves">Free the Slaves</a> is quoted as saying that there are 27 million slaves in the world. The film ends with the assertion that only <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> can free people from sexual slavery.

"Nefarious" covers <a href="human%20trafficking%20in%20the%20United%20States">human trafficking in the United States</a>, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film opens with a re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls in a dark room, lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>'s <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a> <a href="De%20Wallen">De Wallen</a>, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.

One of the scenes in Southeast Asia takes place near a <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> club, and depicts groups of girls, apparently ranging in age from early to late teens, offering sexual services to customers. <a href="Benjamin%20Nolot">Benjamin Nolot</a> interviews a police officer, who says that the bar's owner recently bought eight other similar clubs and controls around 2,000 girls. Another Southeast Asian scene shows Nolot and his crew chasing an American man out of a town where he was trying to purchase <a href="Child%20sexual%20abuse">sex with a child</a>.

The interviewees in "Nefarious" include former traffickers, international humanitarian workers, social workers, psychologists, human rights experts, and former victims of human trafficking. Interviewees include Canadian journalist <a href="Victor%20Malarek">Victor Malarek</a>, <a href="Jerusalem%20Institute%20of%20Justice">Jerusalem Institute of Justice</a> founder <a href="Calev%20Myers">Calev Myers</a>, Christian therapist <a href="Dan%20Allender">Dan Allender</a>, clinical psychologist <a href="Melissa%20Farley">Melissa Farley</a>, Amsterdam police official Piet Keesman, Baptist missionary <a href="Lauran%20Bethell">Lauran Bethell</a>, <a href="Agape%20International%20Missions">Agape International Missions</a> founder <a href="Don%20Brewster">Don Brewster</a>, anti-trafficking activist <a href="Helen%20Sworn">Helen Sworn</a>, former prostitute <a href="Annie%20Lobert">Annie Lobert</a>, and Swedish Detective Superintendent <a href="Kajsa%20Wahlberg">Kajsa Wahlberg</a>.

The film includes an interview with a man referring to himself as "Vlad", who formerly trafficked in humans and drugs in Europe for eleven years. Vlad explains that traffickers control their victims by drugging them, physically abusing them, or threatening to abuse them. He claims that traffickers consider themselves most successful when the exploited girls start responding immediately to shouted, one-word commands. Vlad describes beating girls who tried to run away and says that he felt little remorse after such incidents; the large sums of money involved made him indifferent to the girls' fate. Vlad surmises that the reason global sex trafficking has expanded is that girls can be sold for sex repeatedly, while drugs can only be sold once. When asked how sex trafficking can function on an international scale, Vlad states that the two major contributory factors are organized crime and political corruption.

Another interview features an Amsterdam <a href="pimp">pimp</a>, "Slim", who owns a business allowing passers-by to view scantily clad girls in a <a href="display%20window">display window</a>; they can have sex with them on a mattress in a back room. He initially says that the display window women are not in any danger while with a client in the back room, but later clarifies that the girls should "keep a hand close to the <a href="panic%20button">panic button</a>" located on the wall. When asked by Nolot if these activities are financed by organized crime, Slim hesitates, then says no.

A female human trafficking victim is interviewed with her face hidden. She describes how she and other <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Eastern%20Europe">human trafficking victims in Eastern Europe</a> were held in buildings with security cameras, where they were forced to walk naked down a runway before a group of men who watched under the guise of attending a fashion show. She then describes being auctioned off to the audience members, who she says examined her off the runway as one might examine cattle.

A 55-year-old woman from England tells the story of how she was first prostituted in <a href="Boscombe">Boscombe</a>, near <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> in Dorset, after being raped as a child in the <a href="council%20house">council house</a>s where she grew up. She describes running away, being raped again at the age of 13 and then being locked in a wardrobe in Manchester, and says that she found this situation normal at the time as it was the only life she knew. She eventually became <a href="Opioid%20dependence">addicted to heroin</a>. She then describes a <a href="Visions%20of%20Jesus%20and%20Mary">vision of Jesus</a> that she says gave her the strength to escape sexual trafficking at the age of 40 and heroin six years later. Other victims of trafficking speak about having been the objects of physical abuse and attempted murder. <a href="Prostitution%20in%20Nevada">Nevada prostitutes</a> describe having gone into prostitution in Las Vegas after watching the film "<a href="Pretty%20Woman">Pretty Woman</a>". Several former prostitutes talk about their conversion to Christianity, escape from sexual oppression, and subsequent education or marriage. Some of them cry while telling their stories. Lobert calls prostitution "the greatest acting job", explaining that prostitutes have to constantly feign enjoyment while actually feeling none. Before "Nefarious" was completed, one of the former prostitutes interviewed for the film returned to prostitution, a fact acknowledged in the film.

In her interview, Swedish Detective Superintendent Kajsa Wahlberg describes purchasing sex from a prostitute as paying to <a href="Masturbation">masturbate</a> into someone. The leader of an organization working to rescue girls from <a href="prostitution%20in%20Cambodia">prostitution in Cambodia</a> says that it is not the poorest parents who sell their children into sexual slavery but rather the parents who are looking to buy luxury goods. He therefore argues that sex trafficking is a spiritual and moral issue that cannot be solved by education or money. In another interview, a man <a href="Prostitution%20in%20Thailand">purchasing sex in Thailand</a> says that he believes the girls are happy to be working as prostitutes. Another interview features an American man who had been a <a href="Sex%20tourism">sex tourist</a> in Asia.

"Nefarious" was written, directed, produced, and narrated by Benjamin Nolot, founder and president of Exodus Cry. Exodus Cry, which distributed the film, is headquartered in <a href="Grandview%2C%20Missouri">Grandview, Missouri</a> and is an <a href="List%20of%20organizations%20opposing%20human%20trafficking">organization that opposes human trafficking</a> by raising awareness, by reintegrating victims back into society, and by prayer. Nolot founded Exodus Cry in 2007 after a woman he did not know gave him , saying that God told her to do so in order that Nolot might found an anti-human-trafficking organization. This was founded at a prayer meeting later that year where attendees prayed for human trafficking victims. The organization claims that this prayer meeting occurred on the day before the announcement of the <a href="2007%20international%20child%20pornography%20investigation">2007 international child pornography investigation</a>, which involved approximately 2,400 human-trafficking-related arrests in 77 countries.

Filming of "Nefarious" was started in 2007, marking Nolot's film debut. The initial plan was to create a <a href="short%20film">short film</a>, but the project was expanded when Exodus Cry realized the scope of the issue they were documenting. Nolot, a leader in <a href="Mike%20Bickle%20%28minister%29">Mike Bickle</a>'s <a href="International%20House%20of%20Prayer">International House of Prayer</a>, travelled to 19 countries to collect material for the film. These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia. Nolot attested to having found it difficult to produce the film due to the subject matter; he stated that "there is not a day that goes by that I am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered." He further said that he did not make the film for money or for fame but did so in order to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue that he feels to be of great importance. Nolot said that the purpose of the film is "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." Steve Willis and Matthew Dickey were the film's <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a>s. Willis, founder of Underpin Photography, also served as photographer while Dickey filled the roles of associate producer and <a href="Film%20editing">editor</a>, also directing the re-enactment scenes. Actors in these re-enactment scenes included <a href="Bill%20Oberst%20Jr.">Bill Oberst Jr.</a>, Christian Simpson (as Christian J. Simpson), Allison Weissman, Sarah Agor, and Jess Allen. John Samuel Hanson composed the <a href="film%20score">film score</a> for "Nefarious" after having worked on such other projects as "<a href="16%20Blocks">16 Blocks</a>", "<a href="Constantine%20%28film%29">Constantine</a>", "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Eli">The Book of Eli</a>", and "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>". As of January 2012, Nolot was producing two sequels to "Nefarious".

The film was officially released on July 27, 2011, with individual grassroots screenings also taking place. Nolot appeared at a screening in <a href="Appleton%2C%20Wisconsin">Appleton</a>, <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, and afterwards led a question and answer session with a local police officer. During this time, Nolot promoted the Red Light Campaign, wherein drivers waiting at red lights pray for sex trafficking to end. <a href="Texas%20House%20of%20Representatives">Texas State representative</a> <a href="Todd%20Ames%20Hunter">Todd Ames Hunter</a> attended a screening at the Summit Church in <a href="Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas">Corpus Christi</a>, saying that human trafficking "is a critical issue to the state of Texas that needs education and attention." The Justice Alliance, a Christian nonprofit organization that raises awareness about human trafficking, hosted a screening in the auditorium of <a href="El%20Dorado">El Dorado</a> Middle School in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>. <a href="Florida%20Abolitionist">Florida Abolitionist</a>, a non-governmental organization that also opposes human trafficking, sponsored a screening at the <a href="Full%20Sail%20University">Full Sail University</a> in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Most of the attendees were Christians. The <a href="Australian%20Christian%20Lobby">Australian Christian Lobby</a> (ACL) hosted two screenings of the film in 2012, one of which took place before the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Tasmania">Parliament of Tasmania</a>. The <a href="Government%20of%20Tasmania">Government of Tasmania</a> was considering reforms to the <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>n sex industry at the time and the ACL was disappointed because the only politicians who showed up to the screening were four members of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a>. The ACL planned screenings in the rest of the <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">states of Australia</a> as well, hoping to convince legislators that the criminalization of the purchase of sex is the only effective way of combatting sexual slavery. Another screening was held at <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> headquarters in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in March 2012 during that year's session of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20the%20Status%20of%20Women">United Nations Commission on the Status of Women</a>.

"Nefarious" was released on home video on May 1, 2012. On June 26, the film made its British <a href="premiere">premiere</a>, following which an interactive panel was held in which the audience was encouraged to fight human trafficking by donating funds, raising awareness, and praying. In September, the film was screened at <a href="The%20Rome%20International%20Film%20Festival">The Rome International Film Festival</a> in <a href="Rome%2C%20Georgia">Rome</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, the Midwest Christian-Inspirational Indie Film Festival in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, and the <a href="Atlanta%20International%20Documentary%20Film%20Festival">Atlanta International Documentary Film Festival</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, Georgia. "Nefarious" was screened at <a href="Oaxaca%20FilmFest">Oaxaca FilmFest</a> two months later. The Rose Marine Theater in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a> hosted a screening in celebration of <a href="Human%20Rights%20Day">Human Rights Day</a> in December. Other screenings have taken place in South Korea, Hong Kong, Bermuda, and Canada. The Hong Kong premiere was attended by such people as <a href="Clement%20Cheng">Clement Cheng</a>, <a href="Lori%20Chow">Lori Chow</a>, <a href="Cathy%20Leung">Cathy Leung</a>, <a href="Pamela%20Peck">Pamela Peck</a>, <a href="Nancy%20Sit">Nancy Sit</a>, and <a href="Grace%20Wong">Grace Wong</a>, and the subsequent three weeks of screenings were all sold out. In May 2013, <a href="Katarina%20MacLeod">Katarina MacLeod</a>, a former sex slave, spoke at a screening in <a href="Peterborough%2C%20Ontario">Peterborough, Ontario</a> hosted by Canadian Baptist Women of Ontario and Quebec. Laila Mickelwait, Exodus Cry's Director of Awareness and Prevention, screened the film in several countries in an attempt to persuade governments to make laws similar to <a href="Prostitution%20in%20Sweden%23The%20Kvinnofrid%20law%20%281999%29">Sweden's "Sex Purchase Act"</a>, which criminalizes the purchasing rather than the selling of sex. Because Sweden now has the lowest human trafficking rate in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, Mickelwait argued that such laws decrease the demand for commercial sex and effectively combat related organized crime. At some screenings, Exodus Cry solicited funds for the <a href="halfway%20house">halfway house</a>s it runs in Moldova called LightHouses, where victims of sex trafficking are given help.

Both Jim Uttley of "Indian Life Newspaper" and Pastor Jamie Bagley of "<a href="The%20News%20of%20Cumberland%20County">The News of Cumberland County</a>" called "Nefarious" "hard-hitting". Uttley further asserted that "Nefarious" "is not an easy film to watch because it deals with a subject that most of us would rather ignore", and he went on to highly recommend the film. Jimmy Stewart of "Charisma" reported that the film gives a human face to trafficking statistics and instils a desire in the viewer to put an end to such criminal activity. <a href="Ted%20Baehr">Ted Baehr</a> of "Movieguide", a <a href="Christian%20media">Christian magazine</a>, called the film "a powerful, compelling and transformational documentary about human trafficking and sex slavery" and wrote that it was amazing that the film covered an inherently sexual topic both honestly and without nudity. Baehr praised the <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a>, editing, and filmmaking, but criticized some portions of the film as being repetitive and uncompelling. The "Movieguide" review ends by comparing the film's opposition to modern slavery to the death of <a href="Saint%20Telemachus">Saint Telemachus</a>, which put an end to <a href="gladiator">gladiator</a>ial games in ancient Rome. Erica Yunghans of "Star News Daily" called the film "controversial".

In "<a href="News%20Weekly">News Weekly</a>", Babette Francis called "Nefarious" a "ground-breaking documentary". Tiffany Owens of "<a href="World%20%28magazine%29">World</a>", a Christian magazine, praised the film, describing its storytelling as compelling and vivid. Jamie Rake of "The Phantom Tollbooth" called the film "an engrossing, sometimes appropriately gross, exposé [that] sounds a clarion cry against … modern slavery". Rake praises the re-enactments for being appropriately ominous, and for demonstrating the dehumanization and abuse that characterize sexual trafficking. He suggests that the film is a modern version of "<a href="This%20Is%20the%20Life%20%28TV%20series%29">This Is the Life</a>", a Christian <a href="television">television</a> series that dealt with social issues, and that, if Nolot applied for a <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">Motion Picture Association of America film rating</a>, it would be given a PG-13 rating. Dan Preston of "Godculture Magazine" called the film "a hands-on, grimy, honest, explorative piece of journalism". Preston praised Nolot's writing and directing. Jennifer Cheng of the "<a href="South%20China%20Morning%20Post">South China Morning Post</a>" called the film "unnerving" and wrote that it "offers a glimpse into how organized crime, abuse, greed, lust and humiliation intertwine to make human trafficking possible."

Marcus Ward Lyon Jr.

Marcus Ward Lyon Jr. (February 5, 1875 – May 19, 1942) was an American <a href="Mammalogy">mammalogist</a>, <a href="Bacteriology">bacteriologist</a>, and <a href="Pathology">pathologist</a>. He was born into a military family, and demonstrated an early interest in <a href="zoology">zoology</a> by collecting local wildlife around his father's army posts. He graduated from <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> in 1897, and continued his studies at <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> while working part-time at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">United States National Museum</a> (USNM). At the same time, he taught at <a href="Howard%20University%20College%20of%20Medicine">Howard University Medical School</a> and later <a href="George%20Washington%20University%20Medical%20School">George Washington University Medical School</a>. He received his Ph.D. from <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> in 1913. In 1919, he and his wife, Martha, moved to <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend, Indiana</a> to join a newly opened clinic. Prior to moving, Lyon had published many papers on mammalogy, both during and after his tenure at the USNM. In these papers, he had formally <a href="Species%20description">described</a> six <a href="species">species</a>, three <a href="Genus">genera</a>, and one <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>. Once in South Bend, he began to publish medical studies, too, but continued his work in mammalogy, with a particular focus on the local fauna of Indiana. He published more than 160 papers during his career.

Lyon acquired the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve%23History">Medical Reserve Corps</a> during World War I, and was appointed president of the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Mammalogists">American Society of Mammalogists</a> from 1931 to 1932. He was a member of <a href="Sigma%20Xi">Sigma Xi</a>, the <a href="American%20Society%20for%20Microbiology">Society of American Bacteriologists</a>, the <a href="Indiana%20Academy%20of%20Science">Indiana Academy of Science</a>, and the <a href="Biological%20Society%20of%20Washington">Biological Society of Washington</a>. Lyon became a <a href="Conservation%20movement">conservationist</a> later in life.

Lyon was born on February 5, 1875, in <a href="Rock%20Island%20Arsenal%2C%20Illinois">Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois</a>. His family included his father, Captain Marcus Ward Lyon Sr.; his mother, Lydia Anna Lyon; and his two brothers, Henry S. Lyon and James W. Lyon. Because of his father's military career, Lyon's family moved across the United States throughout his childhood and adolescence. The first hint of the young Lyon's future scientific interests came while they were stationed at <a href="Watertown%20Arsenal">Watertown Arsenal</a>, near <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, where he began collecting insects and animals from the local area. No other details of his early life were documented until 1893, when he graduated from <a href="Rock%20Island%20High%20School">Rock Island High School</a>—his father had evidently been re-stationed at Rock Island Arsenal at about this time. He attended <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a> and completed his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.B.</a> in 1897, which included training in <a href="biology">biology</a>. In 1898, he began his graduate studies at <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a>, obtaining his <a href="Master%20of%20Science">M.S.</a> in 1900, his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Medicine">M.D.</a> in 1902, and his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in 1913.

Upon completion of his first degree, Lyon spent a year (1897–1898) at <a href="VCU%20School%20of%20Medicine">North Carolina Medical College</a>, where he taught <a href="bacteriology">bacteriology</a>. In conjunction with his graduate studies, he moved to Washington, D.C., in 1898 to become a part-time Aid in the Division of Mammals at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">United States National Museum</a> (USNM). Lyon was later promoted to Assistant Curator for Mammals. The USNM sent him to <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> with Lieutenant Wirt Robinson of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in 1899 to collect mammal specimens, and later appointed him as its Chief Special Agent for the 1904 <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a> in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> and the 1905 <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Centennial%20Exposition">Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. He retained his post at the USNM until 1912. Lyon taught <a href="physiology">physiology</a> (1903–04 and 1907–09) and bacteriology (1909–15) at <a href="Howard%20University%20College%20of%20Medicine">Howard University Medical School</a>.

In the latter half of 1915, Lyon began teaching at <a href="George%20Washington%20University%20Medical%20School">George Washington University Medical School</a>, handling courses in bacteriology and <a href="pathology">pathology</a> until 1917, and veterinary <a href="zoology">zoology</a> and <a href="parasitology">parasitology</a> from 1917 until 1918. In 1917, he joined the U.S. Army, serving as a pathologist at the <a href="Walter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center">Walter Reed Army Hospital</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In September 1919, he transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Reserve%23History">Medical Reserve Corps</a> as a <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>. By the end of that year, Lyon's 18 years of medical teaching and practice resulted in a job offer in pathology at the South Bend Clinic in <a href="South%20Bend%2C%20Indiana">South Bend, Indiana</a>. His wife, Martha, was also extended a job offer at the same clinic, and joined as an <a href="Ophthalmology">ophthalmologist</a>. Lyon maintained his offices at the clinic until his death in 1942.

Because of his work as a mammalogist, Lyon is considered the <a href="Biological%20classification">taxonomic authority</a> for the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Ptilocercidae (<a href="pen-tailed%20treeshrew">pen-tailed treeshrew</a>s), as well as the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Anathana" (the <a href="Madras%20treeshrew">Madras treeshrew</a>) and two genera of <a href="Leporidae">leporids</a> (<a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s and <a href="hare">hare</a>s), "Pentalagus" (the <a href="Amami%20rabbit">Amami rabbit</a>) and "Pronolagus" (<a href="red%20rock%20hare">red rock hare</a>s). Lyon was the first to <a href="Species%20description">describe</a> the <a href="Bornean%20white-bearded%20gibbon">Bornean white-bearded gibbon</a> ("Hylobates albibarbis"), the <a href="Gansu%20pika">Gansu pika</a> ("Ochotona cansus"), the <a href="Sumatran%20porcupine">Sumatran porcupine</a> ("Hystrix sumatrae"), the <a href="shadowy%20broad-nosed%20bat">shadowy broad-nosed bat</a> ("Platyrrhinus umbratus"), and two species of <a href="slow%20loris">slow loris</a> from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, "<a href="Nycticebus%20bancanus">Nycticebus bancanus</a>" and "<a href="Nycticebus%20borneanus">Nycticebus borneanus</a>".

His <a href="private%20collection">private zoological collections</a> were incorporated into the collections at the USNM. Lyon created two <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a>s, the first containing plant specimens from <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and the second from the <a href="Indiana%20Dunes%20National%20Lakeshore">Indiana Dunes</a> and lower <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The former was included in the United States National Herbarium, now the <a href="United%20States%20Botanic%20Garden">United States Botanic Garden</a>, and the latter at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Herbarium">University of Michigan Herbarium</a>.

During his career, Lyon published more than 160 papers, roughly 80 of which were in the field of <a href="zoology">zoology</a> and 55 more in pathology. Other publications included four articles in <a href="botany">botany</a>, numerous book reviews, technical reports, and newspaper articles. Until the move to Indiana, Lyon wrote many papers in <a href="mammalogy">mammalogy</a>, focusing primarily on <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, <a href="systematics">systematics</a>, and <a href="zoogeography">zoogeography</a>. In addition to his Ph.D. thesis, entitled "<a href="Treeshrew">Treeshrew</a>s: An account of the mammalian family <a href="Tupaiidae">Tupaiidae</a>", he authored papers about other mammals of the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, with which he had become very familiar through his study of the collections that were sent to the USNM. Following the end of his relationship with the USNM in 1912, Lyon continued to write mammalogy material and began publishing basic medical studies.

After moving to Indiana, the focus of his publications shifted primarily to medical issues and mammalogy within his new home state. Despite his interest in and occupation with medical science, his passion was for the study of living and extinct mammals. He became a regular contributor to the "<a href="American%20Midland%20Naturalist">American Midland Naturalist</a>", publishing a list of plant species native to the Indiana Dunes and notes on <a href="ground%20squirrel">ground squirrel</a>s and <a href="badger">badger</a>s prior to his work "Mammals of Indiana", which spanned all 365 pages of the first issue in 1936. In 1935, he had been invited to join the editorial staff, becoming an associate editor for mammalogy. Near the end of his life, Lyon began to write about <a href="wildlife%20conservation">wildlife conservation</a>.

A private collection of Lyon's papers, along with those of his wife, is held at the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a> Archives. It comprises correspondence, papers, notes, manuscripts, letters, articles, and speeches, as well as articles collected by Lyon and a scrapbook of his wife's college life and more.


Lyon held honorary memberships in <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa%20Society">Phi Beta Kappa</a> and <a href="Sigma%20Xi">Sigma Xi</a>. A member of the organization committee that founded the District of Columbia Chapter of Sigma Xi in 1914, Lyon became the Secretary of both the Organization Committee and Chapter, which held its first annual meeting in 1915. He was appointed secretary of the <a href="Biological%20Society%20of%20Washington">Biological Society of Washington</a> in 1904 and from 1915 through 1919. In 1917, he was elected for membership to the Washington Biologists' Field Club. Lyon was president of the St. Joseph County Medical Society in 1931, as well as the treasurer (1927–1932) and president (1933) of the <a href="Indiana%20Academy%20of%20Science">Indiana Academy of Science</a>. He was also a member of the <a href="American%20Society%20for%20Microbiology">Society of American Bacteriologists</a>. Lyon was the 7th president of the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Mammalogists">American Society of Mammalogists</a> from 1931 to 1932, and received honorary membership a month before he died.

Lyon married Martha Marie Brewer ( 1871) of <a href="Lanham%2C%20Maryland">Lanham, Maryland</a>, in 1902, and together they had one daughter, Charlotte Lyon. Lyon and his wife attended scientific meetings together; in 1911, they traveled to Europe to see museums and to visit famous zoologists. Martha Brewer Lyon obtained her M.S. at Columbian College in 1901 and M.D. from Brown University in 1907. She later worked as an ophthalmologist at the South Bend Clinic with her husband until she opened her own office in 1931. She maintained her office until her death on January 18, 1942. Lyon died on May 19, 1942, at his home in South Bend and was buried on May 27 at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>.

While living in South Bend, Lyon became close friends with Reverend <a href="Julius%20Nieuwland">Julius A. Nieuwland</a>, <a href="Congregation%20of%20Holy%20Cross">CSC</a>, a botanist and <a href="Chemistry">chemist</a> at the University of Notre Dame. They went on field trips and collected plant specimens that were incorporated into Lyon's second herbarium, which he made in his spare time with the help of his wife, Nieuwland, and Austrian botanist <a href="Theodor%20Karl%20Just">Theodor Just</a>. Lyon was known for his love of nature, and in an obituary written by Just, he was noted as being an "ardent <a href="Conservation%20movement">conservationist</a>" later in his life. Lyon criticized poorly managed conservation programs in his paper "Conservation from the Naturalist's Point of View" (1939), and in his final paper, "The Kankakee Area—Its Past and Present", he envisioned life around the <a href="Kankakee%20Outwash%20Plain">Kankakee Outwash Plain</a> before human activities had changed it. Lyon also gave up his cottage in the Indiana Dunes after the wildlife refuge was converted into a vacation destination.

James Hogun

James Hogun (died January 4, 1781) was an Irish-American military officer who was as one of five generals from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> to serve with the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Born in Ireland, Hogan migrated to North Carolina – then <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">a British colony</a> – in 1751. Settling in <a href="Halifax%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Halifax County</a>, he raised a family and established himself as a prominent local figure.

A member of the county's <a href="Committee%20of%20Safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a>, he represented it at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">North Carolina Provincial Congress</a> and helped to draft the <a href="Constitution%20of%20North%20Carolina%23Constitution%20of%201776">first Constitution of North Carolina</a>. Initially a <a href="major">major</a> in the 7th North Carolina Regiment, Hogun advanced quickly in rank during 1776 to become the unit's commanding officer. He participated in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Brandywine</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Germantown</a> in 1777. The <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> promoted Hogun to <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> in 1779, although several congressmen and the <a href="North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly">North Carolina General Assembly</a> wished to see <a href="Thomas%20Clark%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Thomas Clark</a> of North Carolina promoted instead.

Hogun was in command of North Carolina's line brigade during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">Siege of Charleston</a> in the spring of 1780, which ended in the surrender of all but one of North Carolina's regiments of regular infantry as well as more than 5,000 <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> soldiers under Major General <a href="Benjamin%20Lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a>. Hogun was the highest-ranking officer from North Carolina to be captured and imprisoned after the surrender of Charleston, and despite being offered the opportunity to leave internment under a parole that was generally extended to other captured Continental officers, he remained in a British prisoner-of-war camp near Charleston. Hogun likely chose imprisonment in order to prevent the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> from recruiting Continental soldiers for its campaign in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. He became ill and died in the prison on Haddrel's Point, a peninsula in Charleston's harbor.

Much of Hogun's early life remains unknown, due to his relative obscurity until the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. He immigrated to <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> from Ireland, his place of birth, in 1751, and on October 3 that year he married Ruth Norfleet. The couple had a son, Lemuel. Hogun made his home near the modern-day community of <a href="Hobgood%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hobgood</a> in <a href="Halifax%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Halifax County</a>.

In 1774, Hogun became a member of the Halifax County <a href="Committee%20of%20Safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a>, which indicated his rise to prominence since arriving in the colony 23 years prior. Between August, 1775, and November, 1776, Hogun represented Halifax County in the Third, Fourth, and Fifth <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">North Carolina Provincial Congress</a>es, and demonstrated an interest in military matters. As a delegate, Hogun assisted in drafting the <a href="Constitution%20of%20North%20Carolina%23Constitution%20of%201776">first Constitution of North Carolina</a>.

Hogun was named a major in the <a href="7th%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">7th North Carolina Regiment</a> in April 1776, and was given command of the unit on November 26, 1776. Initially, the regiment had some difficulty organizing after several of the officers delayed their military work in order to take care of their personal affairs. Hogun was forced to reprimand his officers sharply, threatening them with the loss of their commissions. At the same time, currents of doubt ran through North Carolina, as <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a> attempted to hinder enlistment of <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriots</a> by spreading rumors about the imminent demise of the Patriot army in the north, and disease that was allegedly ravaging that force.

While commanding his regiment, Hogun fought against the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Brandywine</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Germantown</a>, and was present at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a> in the winter of 1777–78. In 1778, Hogun was given orders to assist in recruiting the so-called "<a href="List%20of%20Continental%20Army%20units%23Third%20establishment%2C%201777-1784">additional regiments</a>" requested by the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> from North Carolina, and afterwards was ordered to <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point</a> with the first regiment so recruited. After his arrival, and throughout the late autumn and winter of 1778–79, Hogun's regiment served on a work detail tasked with building up the fortifications at West Point. Hogun was not satisfied with this task, but his men lacked sufficient weapons to allow them to serve as a combat unit at that time. Approximately 400 muskets had to be requisitioned for the regiment to be fully armed.

In early 1779, Major General <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, then Commandant of <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, requested that General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> send him an additional regiment of Continental soldiers to guard the Patriot stores in Philadelphia. Hogun was sent to Arnold with his newly recruited regiment, arriving on or before January 19, 1779.

On January 9, 1779, while "en route" to Philadelphia, Hogun was promoted to <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> by the Continental Congress. His promotion came about in part as a result of what <a href="Thomas%20Burke%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Thomas Burke</a>, a delegate to the Continental Congress from North Carolina, and a fellow Irishman, termed the "distinguished intrepidity" Hogun had exhibited at Germantown. This caused some controversy, as the <a href="North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly">North Carolina General Assembly</a>, which was customarily consulted for the promotion of generals from that state, had already nominated <a href="Thomas%20Clark%20%28North%20Carolina%29">Thomas Clark</a> and <a href="Jethro%20Sumner">Jethro Sumner</a> for promotion to the rank of brigadier general. Sumner was promoted, but Clark was passed over in favor of Hogun, who received the support of nine of the thirteen states. Hogun's surprising victory was due in large part Burke's lobbying efforts among his colleagues in the Continental Congress. By political conventions governing such matters, Burke was bound by the vote of the North Carolina General Assembly to support the state legislature's recommendations of Clark and Sumner, but he worked to convince other Congressmen to vote for Hogun over Clark. Hogun was appointed to succeed Arnold as Commandant of Philadelphia on March 19, 1779, serving until November 22 that year.

In November 1779, Hogun took command of the <a href="List%20of%20Continental%20Army%20units%20%281777%E2%80%931784%29%23North%20Carolina">North Carolina Brigade</a>, composed of the <a href="1st%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">1st</a>, <a href="2nd%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">2nd</a>, <a href="3rd%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">3rd</a>, and <a href="4th%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">4th North Carolina Regiment</a>s of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Line">North Carolina Line</a>. Through the winter of 1779–80, Hogun led the brigade of about 700 men from Philadelphia to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, where he was placed under the command of Major General <a href="Benjamin%20Lincoln">Benjamin Lincoln</a>. The march was arduous, and Hogun's brigade endured one of the coldest, harshest winters in years.

Hogun's command arrived at Charleston on March 13, 1780, which according to Lincoln gave "great spirit to the Town, and confidence to the Army." The North Carolinians were immediately put to the task of defending the city, which was threatened with a siege by British General <a href="Henry%20Clinton%20%28American%20War%20of%20Independence%29">Henry Clinton</a> in early March. Shortly after Hogun's arrival, many of North Carolina's militia present in the city began to return home because their enlistment terms ended on or about March 24. The militiamen had only agreed to serve limited terms, and as they were not under Hogun's direct command he was powerless to stop them leaving.

Charleston was principally located on a peninsula, and so Lincoln aligned his Continental units in defensive works that barricaded the "neck" of the peninsula, using a line of <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a>s, <a href="redan">redan</a>s, and <a href="Artillery%20battery">batteries</a>. These defensive works were connected by a <a href="parapet">parapet</a>, and commanded from a concrete <a href="hornwork">hornwork</a> jutting out from the defensive line. In front of the fortifications, the Patriot forces dug an 18-foot-wide <a href="moat">moat</a>, and between the moat and parapet they constructed a line of <a href="abatis">abatis</a> to stall any British assault. When the <a href="Siege%20of%20Charleston">siege</a> by the British Army began in earnest on April 1, Hogun and his men were positioned on the right of the Continental Army's lines, near the <a href="Cooper%20River%20%28South%20Carolina%29">Cooper River</a>.

Hogun participated in a <a href="council%20of%20war">council of war</a> on April 20, 1780. Several members of the South Carolina Privy Council, a part of the civilian government, threatened to block the Continental Army's attempts to withdraw from Charleston, if the council of war voted to do so. Although the defending army had only eight to ten days worth of provisions, Lincoln bowed to pressure from civil authorities and delayed evacuation. On April 26, another council of war at which Hogun was present determined that the British presence on all sides of the city prevented the army's escape. For the next two weeks, the British and Patriot forces exchanged artillery and rifle fire at all times of day, and the British bombardment whittled down the American breastworks.

On May 8, Lincoln called another council of war with all his army's general and field officers and ships' captains to discuss terms of surrender that had been proposed by Clinton. Of the 61 officers in attendance at that council, 49, including Hogun, voted to offer terms of capitulation with the British commander. When these were rejected, hostilities continued, and Lincoln called another council of war on May 11 to further discuss terms of capitulation. The council voted to present further terms to Clinton, which he accepted. On May 12, 1780, Hogun was among the officers under Lincoln who formally surrendered to the British Army, along with approximately 5,000 Continental and militia soldiers. The surrender led to the loss of all but one of the regiments of the North Carolina Line then in existence, depriving the state of all regular, non-militia soldiers. As a brigadier general, Hogun held the highest rank of the approximately 814 Continental soldiers from North Carolina who capitulated at Charleston.

Rather than allowing himself to be <a href="Parole%23Prisoners%20of%20war">paroled</a>, Hogun requested he be taken prisoner, and was interned at the British prison camp at Haddrel's Point on Point Pleasant, located in what is now <a href="Mount%20Pleasant%2C%20South%20Carolina">Mount Pleasant, South Carolina</a>, across from <a href="Sullivan%27s%20Island%2C%20South%20Carolina">Sullivan's Island</a>. Hogun's decision was based, in part, on his desire to stifle the recruiting efforts of the British, who sought to enlist captured Continental soldiers to serve in the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a>. The British, however, held only the officers at Haddrel's Point, deciding to house the <a href="Enlisted%20rank">enlisted</a> men in barracks in Charleston.

Officers at Haddrel's Point were subjected to harsh treatment, barred from fishing to catch much-needed food, and threatened with deportation from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. Approximately 3,300 Patriot soldiers were confined in prison camps around Charleston that were similar to the one at Haddrel's Point, and many were destined for cramped, unsanitary prison ships. Because of the conditions, many Continental soldiers agreed to join Loyalist regiments, but Hogun and other officers set up courts martial in the camps and attempted to maintain a dignified military structure. Hogun's health soon declined, and he died in the prison camp on January 4, 1781. He was buried in an unmarked grave.

On March 14, 1786, the North Carolina legislature granted Hogun's son, Lemuel, a tract near modern-day <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, in recognition of his father's service. The elder Hogun was one of twenty-two Patriot generals who perished during the American Revolutionary War, and one of twelve who died from disease or other non-combat causes. In the early 20th century, North Carolina jurist and historian <a href="Walter%20Clark%20%28jurist%29">Walter Clark</a> noted that while the careers of three of North Carolina's other generals—Brigadier Generals <a href="Francis%20Nash">Francis Nash</a> and <a href="James%20Moore%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">James Moore</a>, and Major General <a href="Robert%20Howe%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Howe</a>—were well known to contemporary historians, the story of Hogun's career as well as that of Jethro Sumner had been neglected.

Hogun's personal papers appear to have been destroyed while in the possession of his descendants in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, leaving virtually no surviving correspondence that would shed further light on his life. In 1954, the North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program, a division of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Department%20of%20Cultural%20Resources">North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources</a>, erected a <a href="historical%20marker">historical marker</a> in Hogun's honor near his former home in Halifax County.

History of Lithuania (1219–95)

The history of Lithuania between 1219 and 1295 concerns the establishment and early history of the first Lithuanian state, the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>. The beginning of the 13th century marks the end of the <a href="History%20of%20Lithuania%23Before%20statehood">prehistory of Lithuania</a>. From this point on the <a href="history%20of%20Lithuania">history of Lithuania</a> is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, <a href="List%20of%20early%20Lithuanian%20dukes">21 Lithuanian dukes</a> signed a peace treaty with <a href="Galicia%E2%80%93Volhynia">Galicia–Volhynia</a>. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the <a href="Balts">Baltic tribes</a> were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the <a href="Livonian%20Order">Livonian Order</a> and the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was established and gained some control over the lands of <a href="Black%20Ruthenia">Black Ruthenia</a>, <a href="Polatsk">Polatsk</a>, <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a>.

The first ruler to hold the title of <a href="Grand%20Duke">Grand Duke</a> was <a href="Mindaugas">Mindaugas</a>. Traditionally he is considered the founder of the state, the one who united the Baltic tribes and established the Duchy. Some scholars, however, challenge this perception, arguing that an organized state existed before Mindaugas, possibly as early as 1183. After quelling an internal war with his nephews, Mindaugas was baptized in 1251, and was crowned as <a href="King%20of%20Lithuania">King of Lithuania</a> in 1253. In 1261, he broke the peace with the Livonian Order, perhaps even renouncing Christianity. His assassination in 1263 by <a href="Treniota">Treniota</a> ended the early Christian kingdom in Lithuania. For another 120 years Lithuania would remain a <a href="Baltic%20paganism">pagan</a> empire, fighting against the Teutonic and Livonian Orders during the <a href="Northern%20Crusades">Northern Crusades</a> during their attempts to <a href="Christianization%20of%20Lithuania">Christianize</a> the land.

After Mindaugas' death, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania entered times of relative instability, as reflected by the fact that <a href="list%20of%20Lithuanian%20rulers">seven Grand Dukes</a> held the title over the course of the next 32 years. Little is known about this period, but the <a href="Gediminids">Gediminid dynasty</a> was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the Grand Duchy did not disintegrate. <a href="Vytenis">Vytenis</a> assumed power in 1295, and during the next 20 years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow under the leadership of <a href="Gediminas">Gediminas</a> and his son <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a>. While the Grand Duchy was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.

The Balts were largely driven to unite by external threats from aggressive German religious orders. In 1202, the Order of the <a href="Livonian%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Sword">Livonian Brothers of the Sword</a> was established by <a href="Albert%20of%20Riga">Albert</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Riga">Bishop of Riga</a>, to promote the Christianization and conquest of the <a href="Livonian%20people">Livonians</a>, <a href="Curonians">Curonians</a>, <a href="Semigallians">Semigallians</a>, and <a href="Estonians">Estonians</a> near the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>. The Order waged a number of successful campaigns and posed a great danger to the Lithuanian territories. The Order's progress was halted by its defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saule">Battle of Saule</a> in 1236, after which it almost collapsed. The following year, it merged into the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>.

In 1226, <a href="Konrad%20I%20of%20Masovia">Konrad I of Masovia</a> invited the Teutonic Knights to defend his borders and subdue the <a href="Old%20Prussians">Prussians</a>, offering the Knights the use of <a href="Che%C5%82mno%20Land">Chełmno</a> (Kulm) as a base for their campaign. In 1230, they settled in Chełmno, built a castle, and began attacking Prussian lands. After 44 years, and despite two Prussian uprisings against them, they had conquered most of the Prussian tribes. Afterwards, the Knights spent nine years conquering the <a href="Nadruvians">Nadruvians</a>, <a href="Skalvians">Skalvians</a>, and <a href="Yotvingians">Yotvingians</a>, and from 1283, they were better positioned to threaten the young Lithuanian state from the west.
Further unification of the Lithuanian tribes was facilitated by the social changes that took place in Lithuania during this period. Private land ownership was established (<a href="allodium">allodium</a>s, Lithuanian: "atolai"), which would later evolve into a <a href="feudalism">feudal system</a>. As attested by many chronicles, it was the principal form of organization governing land ownership in the 13th century. Under this system, known in England as <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>, only the eldest son could inherit lands, which allowed dukes to consolidate their holdings. <a href="Social%20class">Social class</a>es and divisions of labor also began taking shape. There were classes of experienced soldiers (<a href="Lithuanian%20nobility">bajoras</a>), of free peasants (<a href="laukininkas">laukininkas</a>), and of "unfree" people (<a href="kaimynas">kaimynas</a> and <a href="%C5%A1eimynyk%C5%A1tis">šeimynykštis</a>). In order to enforce this social structure, a united state was needed. Another force behind unification was the desire to take advantage of <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>n lands, which were suffering from the <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20Rus%27">Mongol invasion</a>. Temporary alliances among Lithuanian dukes often sufficed for military ventures into, and plundering of, these lands (including <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a>, plundered in 1213). Altogether, between 1201 and 1236, Lithuanians launched at least 22 incursions into <a href="Livonia">Livonia</a>, 14 into <a href="Ruthenia">Rus</a>, and 4 into <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. The ongoing administration of conquered territories, however, required a strong and unified central power.

Some evidence suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces at the dawn of the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German <a href="religious%20order">religious order</a>s, and in 1212, <a href="Daugirutis">Daugirutis</a>' treaty with <a href="Novgorod%20Republic">Novgorod</a> shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian <a href="Tomas%20Baranauskas">Tomas Baranauskas</a> argues that a <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Lithuanian state</a> could be said to exist as early as 1183.

However, the first conclusive evidence that the Balts were uniting is considered to be the treaty with <a href="Galicia%E2%80%93Volhynia">Galicia–Volhynia</a> signed in 1219. The treaty's signatories include <a href="List%20of%20early%20Lithuanian%20dukes">21 Lithuanian dukes</a>; it specifies that five of those were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was <a href="%C5%BDivinbudas">Živinbudas</a>, since his name was mentioned first. Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother <a href="Dausprungas">Dausprungas</a>, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were <a href="Daujotas">Daujotas</a> (mentioned second) and his brother <a href="Vilikaila">Vilikaila</a> (mentioned last of the five).

The treaty is important for several reasons. It shows that the Lithuanian Dukes were co-operating; the signatories include Dukes who ruled lands such as <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a>, which probably had no contact with Galicia–Volhynia. Their participation implies a perception of common interest, an indication of a nascent state. However, the designation of five Dukes as "elder" shows that the process of unification was still in transition. The inclusion of 21 Dukes indicates that the various lands in Lithuania were powerful and semi-independent. Historians consider the treaty an interesting documentation of the long and complex process of a state's formation. The progress of unification was uneven; for example, after the deaths of Dukes <a href="Daugirutis">Daugirutis</a> in 1213 and <a href="Stek%C5%A1ys">Stekšys</a> in 1214, fewer raids were organized by Lithuanians.

Mindaugas, the duke who governed southern Lithuania between the <a href="Neman%20River">Neman</a> and <a href="Neris">Neris</a> Rivers, eventually became the founder of the state. Mindaugas is referred to as the ruler of all Lithuania in the <a href="Livonian%20Rhymed%20Chronicle">Livonian Rhymed Chronicle</a> in 1236. The means by which he managed to acquire this title are not well known. Russian chronicles mention that he murdered or expelled various other dukes, including his relatives.
In 1236, Duke <a href="Vykintas">Vykintas</a> led the Samogitian forces to victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saule">Battle of Saule</a>, where the Livonian Order suffered a catastrophic defeat. It seems that Vykintas did not receive support from Mindaugas. Vykintas' personal power grew. The Livonian Order was on the brink of collapse and was forced to become a branch of the Teutonic Knights. The combined Orders focused on the conquest of <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a>, since only this land prevented them from consolidating their territories. The union of these aggressive powers could not have passed without notice in Lithuanian lands, and might have furthered the unification process. In about 1239 Mindaugas took over the weakened <a href="Black%20Ruthenia">Black Ruthenia</a> and appointed his son Vaišvilkas to govern it. During the early 1240s, Mindaugas strengthened and established his power in various Baltic lands. In 1245, Mindaugas sent his nephews <a href="Tautvilas">Tautvilas</a> and <a href="Edivydas">Edivydas</a>, the sons of Dausprungas and Vykintas, to conquer <a href="Smolensk">Smolensk</a>, but they were unsuccessful. In 1249, an internal war erupted as Mindaugas sought to seize his nephews' and Vykintas' lands.

Tautvilas, Edivydas, and Vykintas formed a powerful coalition with the Samogitians, the Livonian Order, <a href="Daniel%20of%20Galicia">Daniel of Galicia</a> (Tautvilas and Edivydas' brother-in-law), and Vasilko of <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a> in opposition to Mindaugas. Only Poles, invited by Daniel, declined to take part in the coalition against the Lithuanians. The dukes of Galicia and Volhynia managed to gain control over Black Ruthenia, an area ruled by Mindaugas' son Vaišvilkas. Tautvilas traveled to Riga, where he was baptized by the Archbishop. In 1250, the Order organized two major raids, one against Nalša land and the other against the domains of Mindaugas and those parts of Samogitia that still supported him.
Attacked from the north and south and facing the possibility of unrest elsewhere, Mindaugas was placed in an extremely difficult position, but managed to use the conflicts between the Livonian Order and the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Riga">Archbishop of Riga</a> in his own interests. He succeeded in bribing Andreas von Stierland, the master of the Order, who was still angry at Vykintas for the defeat in 1236. In 1251, Mindaugas agreed to receive baptism and relinquish control over some lands in western Lithuania, for which he was to receive a crown in return. In 1252, Tautvilas and his remaining allies attacked Mindaugas in <a href="Voruta">Voruta</a>, sometimes considered to be the first capital of Lithuania. The attack failed and Tautvilas' forces retreated to defend themselves in <a href="Tverai">Tverai</a> Castle, in the present-day <a href="Rietavas%20municipality">Rietavas municipality</a>. Vykintas died in or about 1253, and Tautvilas was forced to rejoin Daniel of Galicia. Daniel reconciled with Mindaugas in 1254; the Black Ruthenian lands were transferred to Roman, the son of Daniel. Vaišvilkas, the son of Mindaugas, decided to join a monastery. Tautvilas recognized Mindaugas' superiority and received <a href="Polatsk">Polatsk</a> as a <a href="fief">fief</a>dom.

As promised, Mindaugas and his wife <a href="Morta">Morta</a> were crowned at some time during the summer of 1253, and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lithuania">Kingdom of Lithuania</a>, proclaimed by the pope in 1251, was soundly established. 6 July is now celebrated as "Statehood Day" (Lithuanian: "Valstybės diena"); it is an official holiday in modern Lithuania. However, the exact date of the coronation is not known; the scholarship of historian <a href="Edvardas%20Gudavi%C4%8Dius">Edvardas Gudavičius</a>, who promulgated this date, is sometimes challenged. The location of the coronation also remains unknown.

<a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Pope Innocent IV</a> supported Mindaugas, hoping that a new Christian state could stem the inroads being made by the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a>, a state of the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a>. On 17 July 1251, the pope signed two crucial <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a>s. One of them ordered the Bishop of <a href="Che%C5%82mno">Chełmno</a> to crown Mindaugas as King of Lithuania, appoint a bishop for Lithuania, and to build a cathedral. The other bull specified that the new bishop was to be directly subordinate to the pope. This was a welcome development to the Lithuanians, since they were concerned that their long-standing antagonists, the Livonian Order, would exert too much control over the new state.

It took some time before a Bishop of Lithuania was appointed because of various conflicts of interest. The Bishop of <a href="Gniezno">Gniezno</a> appointed <a href="Vitas%20%28Bishop%20of%20Lithuania%29">Vito</a> (Lithuanian: "Vitas"), a monk of the <a href="Dominican%20Order">Dominican Order</a>, to this position, but he was not recognized by Mindaugas or accepted by the populace. The activities of Vito in Lithuania are unknown, although he is sometimes associated with Mindaugas' Cathedral. Finally, in 1254, Christian (Lithuanian: "Kristijonas") from the Livonian Order was appointed. Mindaugas endowed him with some lands in Samogitia, but not much is known about his activities. Historical sources do not mention any sponsorship of missionaries, education of priests, or construction of churches during that time, and Bishop Christian went back to Germany in 1259, where he died in 1271. The establishment of Mindaugas' Cathedral remains problematic, but recent archeological research found the remains of a 13th-century brick building on the site of the present-day <a href="Vilnius%20Cathedral">Vilnius Cathedral</a>. The general assumption is that the remains are those of Mindaugas Cathedral, built to satisfy the agreement with the pope. However, as later events showed, Lithuanians resisted Christianization, and Mindaugas' baptism had only a temporary impact on further developments.

Immediately after his coronation, Mindaugas transferred some western lands to the Livonian Order – portions of <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a>, <a href="Nadruvians">Nadruva</a>, and <a href="Dz%C5%ABkija">Dainava</a>. There is some discussion as to whether in later years (1255, 1257, 1259, 1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the Order. The deeds might have been falsified by the Order; the case for this scenario is bolstered by the fact that some of the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas. Whatever the case, relative peace and stability was established for about eight more years. Mindaugas used this opportunity to concentrate on expansion to the east. He strengthened his influence in <a href="Black%20Ruthenia">Black Ruthenia</a>, in <a href="Pinsk">Pinsk</a>, and took advantage of the collapsed <a href="Kievan%20Rus%27">Kievan Rus'</a> by conquering <a href="Polatsk">Polatsk</a>, a major center of commerce in the <a href="Daugava%20River">Daugava</a> River basin. He also negotiated a peace with Galicia–Volhynia, and married a daughter to <a href="Svarn">Svarn</a>, the son of <a href="Daniel%20of%20Galicia">Daniel of Galicia</a>, who would later become Grand Duke of Lithuania. Diplomatic relations with western Europe and the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> were also reinforced. In 1255, Mindaugas received permission from <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20IV">Pope Alexander IV</a> to crown his son as King of Lithuania. In the domestic arena, Mindaugas strove to establish state institutions: his own <a href="noble%20court">noble court</a>, administrative systems, a diplomatic service, and a monetary system. Silver <a href="Lithuanian%20long%20currency">Lithuanian long currency</a> (Lithuanian: "Lietuvos ilgieji") circulated, providing an indice of statehood.
The Livonian Order used this period to consolidate their control over Samogitian lands. They built three castles along the border: Memelburg (<a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Klaipėda</a>), Georgenburg (<a href="Jurbarkas">Jurbarkas</a>), and Doben (<a href="Durbe">Durbe</a> in Latvia). The Samogitians responded by electing Algminas as their war leader, and attacked <a href="Courland">Courland</a>, as the Order had limited battlefield successes. In 1259, the Livonian Order lost the <a href="Battle%20of%20Skuodas">Battle of Skuodas</a>, and in 1260, it lost the <a href="Battle%20of%20Durbe">Battle of Durbe</a>. The first loss encouraged a rebellion by the <a href="Semigalia">Semigalia</a>ns, and the later loss spurred the <a href="Old%20Prussians">Prussians</a> into an uprising against the Order. The <a href="Great%20Prussian%20Uprising">Great Prussian Uprising</a> lasted for 14 years. Encouraged by <a href="Treniota">Treniota</a>, his nephew, Mindaugas broke peace with the Order. Some chronicles hint that he also returned to <a href="Lithuanian%20mythology">his former pagan beliefs</a>, but this is disputable. Nevertheless, all the diplomatic achievements made since his coronation were lost.

Mindaugas then formed an alliance with <a href="Alexander%20Nevsky">Alexander Nevsky</a> of <a href="Novgorod%20Republic">Novgorod</a> and marched against the Order. Treniota led an army to <a href="C%C4%93sis">Cēsis</a> and battled <a href="Masovia">Masovia</a>, hoping to encourage all the conquered Baltic tribes to rise up against the Orders and unite under Lithuanian leadership. He waged successful battles, but did not manage to capture the fortified castles or spark a coalition of Baltic forces against the Order. His personal influence grew because Mindaugas was concentrating on the conquest of Russian lands, dispatching a large army to <a href="Bryansk">Bryansk</a>. Treniota and Mindaugas began to pursue different priorities. In the midst of these events, Mindaugas' wife <a href="Morta">Morta</a> died, and Mindaugas expressed the wish to marry <a href="Daumantas%20of%20Pskov">Daumantas</a>' wife. Daumantas and Treniota responded to this insult by assassinating Mindaugas and two of his sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, in 1263. Lithuania lapsed into years of internal instability.

After Mindaugas' death, the state did not disintegrate and Treniota took over the title of Grand Duke. However, his power was fragile; he was challenged by Tautvilas, who had not forgotten his own claims to power. Tautvilas was also assassinated by Treniota. However, just a year later, in 1264, Treniota was killed by Mindaugas' former servants. Mindaugas' son <a href="Vai%C5%A1vilkas">Vaišvilkas</a> and brother-in-law <a href="Shvarn">Shvarn</a> from Volhynia took over the control in Lithuania. Daumantas was forced to flee to <a href="Pskov">Pskov</a>, was baptized Timofei, ruled successfully from 1266 to 1299 and even became a saint. In 1265 Vaišvilkas, as a Christian, reconciled with the Livonian Order and, without support from Lithuania, the rebellions among the Balts that had been fueled by Treniota began to subside. In 1267 he returned to a monastic life and transferred the Grand Duchy to Shvarn.

Little is known about Shvarn and his rule, but historians believe he was unable to take control of all Lithuania, and ruled only over its southern portions. He died in 1269 or 1271 in <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>.

The circumstances surrounding the advance to power in 1269 of the next ruler, <a href="Traidenis">Traidenis</a>, are not clear. From the outset his relationships with Galicia–Volhynia were tense and eventually resulted in the 1274–1276 war. Traidenis was successful in battle, and his control over Black Ruthenia was strengthened. Traidenis, known for his strong anti-German attitude, was also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Karuse">Battle of Karuse</a>, fought on ice near <a href="Saaremaa">Saaremaa</a>. However, in 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building Dünaburg (<a href="Daugavpils">Daugavpils</a>) Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. Several years later, in 1281, Traidenis conquered <a href="Jersika">Jersika</a> Castle in the present-day <a href="Prei%C4%BCi%20District">Preiļi District</a>, and was able to exchange it for the Dünaburg Castle. Dünaburg remained a Lithuanian outpost until 1313. In 1279 the Order attacked Lithuanian lands, reaching as far as <a href="Kernav%C4%97">Kernavė</a>, but on their way back they suffered a major defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aizkraukle">Battle of Aizkraukle</a>. The Order's master, Ernst von Rassburg, died in the battle, and the conquered <a href="Semigallians">Semigallians</a> rebelled. The Semigallians were now willing to acknowledge Lithuania's superiority and asked Traidenis for assistance. However, Traidenis died soon afterwards, and the rebellion was not successful.
Traidenis' reign was the longest and most stable regime during the period of unrest. After his death the Orders finalized their conquests: the conquered Baltic tribes did not rebel again and the Orders could now concentrate on Lithuania. In 1274 the <a href="Great%20Prussian%20Rebellion">Great Prussian Rebellion</a> ended, and the Teutonic Knights proceeded to conquer other Baltic tribes: the <a href="Nadruvians">Nadruvians</a> and <a href="Skalvians">Skalvians</a> in 1274–1277, and the <a href="Yotvingians">Yotvingians</a> in 1283; the Livonian Order completed its conquest of Semigalia, the last Baltic ally of Lithuania, in 1291. The Orders could now turn their full attention to Lithuania. The "buffer zone" composed of other Baltic tribes had disappeared, and Lithuania was left to battle the Orders on its own.

There is considerable uncertainty about the identities of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania between Traidenis' death in 1282 and <a href="Vytenis">Vytenis</a>' assumption of power in 1295. This is in part because the two main sources for Lithuanian history in the 13th century, the <a href="Hypatian%20Codex">Hypatian Codex</a> and the <a href="Livonian%20Rhymed%20Chronicle">Livonian Rhymed Chronicle</a>, end in the early 1290s. In 1285, one chronicle mentions <a href="Daumantas%20of%20Lithuania">Daumantas</a> as Grand Duke. He attacked the Bishop of <a href="Tver">Tver</a> and was severely wounded or even killed in the battle. However, that is the only information about him.

The <a href="Gediminids">Gediminid</a> dynasty began its ascent in Lithuania during this time with the emergence of its first leader, <a href="Butigeidis">Butigeidis</a>. In 1289, leading about 8,000 troops, he attacked <a href="Sambia">Sambia</a>. In 1289 the Teutonic Knights built a castle in present-day <a href="Sovetsk%2C%20Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Sovetsk</a> (Tilsit) and their raids intensified. Butigeidis was the first to build strong castles along the <a href="Neman%20River">Neman River</a>. He died in 1290 or 1292, and his brother <a href="Butvydas">Butvydas</a> (also known as Pukuveras) inherited the crown. Butvydas was the father of <a href="Vytenis">Vytenis</a> and probably of <a href="Gediminas">Gediminas</a>. During his short reign Butvydas tried to defend the duchy against the Teutonic Knights; he also attacked <a href="Masovia">Masovia</a>, an ally of the knights. His son, Vytenis, advanced to power in 1295 and ended the period of relative instability. His reign marks the transition from the state's establishment to the point at which it was poised for expansion.

The state united and ruled by Mindaugas constituted the first Lithuanian state. The state effectively protected Lithuanians and Samogitians from assimilation induced by the Teutonic Knights and the Livonian Order, the destiny of <a href="Old%20Prussians">Prussians</a>, <a href="Skalvians">Skalvians</a>, <a href="Curonians">Curonians</a>, <a href="Selonians">Selonians</a> and other Baltic tribes. Mindaugas ruled about of Lithuanian ethnic territory, an area with an estimated population of 300,000. The <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> lands under his control and influence occupied another . By about 1430, at its peak during the reign of <a href="Vytautas%20the%20Great">Vytautas the Great</a>, the Grand Duchy controlled some and almost 2.5 million people.

The period from 1219 to 1295 also shaped future conflicts: the <a href="Lithuanian%20mythology">pagan Lithuanians</a> were surrounded by the aggressive <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> Orders to its north and southwest, and by adherents of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a> in the east. The Catholic Orders' raids intensified after they overcame the "buffer zone" created by Prussians, Nadruvians, Skalvians, Yotvingians, and Semigalians by 1283. The Lithuanian relationships with the Orthodox Church were more peaceful. The people were allowed to practise their religion; Lithuanian dukes did not hesitate to marry daughters of Orthodox dukes; at least some of the dukes' <a href="scribe">scribe</a>s must have been Orthodox as well. Struggles with the Teutonic Knights and expansion to the east were characteristic of the years from 1295 to 1377. It was inevitable that Lithuania could not endure religious, political, and cultural isolation forever and would have to choose either Roman Catholicism or Eastern Orthodoxy. In 1386, Grand Duke <a href="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> elected baptism in the Catholic rite to marry <a href="Jadwiga%20of%20Poland">Jadwiga of Poland</a> and become <a href="King%20of%20Poland">King of Poland</a>; the last pagan state in Europe was converted to Christianity.

Nauru reed warbler

The Nauru reed warbler (), Acrocephalus rehsei, is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a> in the Pacific Ocean. It is one of only two native breeding land-birds on Nauru and it is the only passerine found on the island. It is related to other <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a>n <a href="Acrocephalus%20%28bird%29">reed warblers</a>, all of which evolved from one of several <a href="adaptive%20radiation">radiations</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> across the Pacific. Related warblers on nearby islands include the <a href="Carolinian%20reed%20warbler">Carolinian reed warbler</a>, with which the Nauru species was initially confused, and the <a href="nightingale%20reed%20warbler">nightingale reed warbler</a>, which was formerly sometimes considered the same species.

A medium-sized <a href="Acrocephalidae">warbler</a>, the Nauru reed warbler has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped <a href="nest">nest</a> into which it lays two or three white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to <a href="Phosphate%20mining%20in%20Nauru">phosphate mining</a>. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means that it could be vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.

<a href="Otto%20Finsch">Otto Finsch</a> was the first naturalist to visit the island of <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a>, stopping for six hours on 24 July 1880 while travelling from the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> to the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. His 1881 report included a warbler he initially identified as the <a href="Carolinian%20reed%20warbler">Carolinian reed warbler</a>. By 1883 he considered it to be a new species, "Calamoherpe rehsei". The generic name "Calamoherpe" is now recognised as a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "<a href="Acrocephalus%20%28bird%29">Acrocephalus</a>", leading to the current <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a>. The generic name "Acrocephalus" derives from the Greek "akros", meaning "topmost", and "kephale", meaning "head". The "akros" part of the name may have been given through confusion with "acutus", and taken to mean "sharp-pointed", referring to the angular head shape typical of this genus. The synonym "Calamoherpe" is from the Greek "kalamos", meaning "reed", and "herpes", meaning "creeping thing". Finsch named the species after Ernst Rehse, a German ornithologist and collector and one of Finsch's travelling companions. Since the original descriptions, little has been written about the species, and details about its ecology and behaviour are poorly known.

Though the Nauru reed warbler is generally accepted as a species, some authorities, such as H. E. Wolters in "Die Vogelarte der Erde" (1980) and Howard and Moore in "A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World" (1991), have considered it a subspecies of "Acrocephalus luscinius", the <a href="nightingale%20reed%20warbler">nightingale reed warbler</a>. Recent <a href="DNA">DNA</a> studies have affirmed its status as a separate species. It is considered <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a>, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the Nauru reed warbler. In the native <a href="Nauruan%20language">Nauruan language</a>, it is known as "Itsirir".
A 2009 <a href="phylogenic">phylogenic</a> study of the family <a href="Acrocephalidae">Acrocephalidae</a> did not include this species, and as recently as 2010 its relation with other members of the genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l DNA showed that the Nauru reed warbler forms a <a href="clade">clade</a> with the <a href="Australian%20reed%20warbler">Australian reed warbler</a>, the <a href="bokikokiko">bokikokiko</a>, the <a href="southern%20Marquesan%20reed%20warbler">southern Marquesan reed warbler</a> and a now-extinct species from <a href="Pagan%20%28island%29">Pagan Island</a> in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Marianas</a>. The closest relative of the Nauru reed warbler appears to be the extinct warbler from Pagan. This is currently named as a subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler, "A. luscinius yamashinae", but that species is <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>, and the Pagan form, which has been proposed as a new species, the <a href="Pagan%20reed%20warbler">Pagan reed warbler</a>, is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands.

The pattern of colonisation of the Pacific islands and eventually Australia by the "Acrocephalus" warblers from Asia was complex, with multiple colonisations of even remote archipelagos. Although the Hawaiian islands were colonised about 2.3 million years ago, the other islands were reached much more recently, in the mid-<a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (between 0.2–1.4 million years ago) or even later. The nearest other warblers geographically to Nauru are the Carolinian reed warbler and the nightingale reed warbler.

The Nauru reed warbler is a medium-sized and warmly coloured reed warbler, with a relatively light build. The entirety of the upperparts are dark brown, with the rump and <a href="Covert%20feather%23Tail%20coverts">uppertail coverts</a> slightly brighter than the tail and <a href="Bird%23Anatomy%20and%20physiology">mantle</a>. When closed, the wing is the same colour as the mantle, short and rounded. The wing does not reach the start of the tail feathers, which enhances the appearance of a long tail. Close inspection of the wing reveals darker centres to both the <a href="Covert%20feather%23Wing%20coverts">greater coverts</a> and <a href="Tertial%20feather%23Tertials">tertial feathers</a>. Its face shows little contrast, as the <a href="Covert%20feather%23Ear%20coverts">ear coverts</a>, crown, nape, chin and throat are all a similar shade of pale brown. The <a href="lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a> are a dark brown, and there is a pale, creamy <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>, or "eyebrow", extending from the beak to the ear coverts, which are a cinnamon-brown, darkening and merging with the nape. The beak is long, thin and straight.

The underparts are much lighter, darkening towards the <a href="Cloaca">vent</a> and <a href="Covert%20feather%23Tail%20coverts">undertail coverts</a>. The chin is a dull cream, merging with the throat, which then browns towards the base. The centre of the breast is a dull brown-yellow, while the sides are a reddish brown. The upper <a href="mandible">mandible</a> of the beak is dark grey with pink edges, while the lower mandible is pink, darkening towards to the tip. The legs and feet are dark grey. The bird measures up to , with a wingspan of .

The species exhibits no <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, and characteristics of the young are unknown. As the only <a href="passerine">passerine</a> on the island, there is no chance that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru reed warbler is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed warbler, which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger, and the <a href="Oriental%20reed%20warbler">Oriental reed warbler</a> has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.

The Nauru reed warbler is <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to the island of Nauru, in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. It is one of only two <a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">indigenous</a> land birds which breed on the island, the other being the <a href="Micronesian%20pigeon">Micronesian pigeon</a>. The warbler can be found throughout the island, thriving in the scrubland in areas previously used for <a href="Phosphate%20mining%20in%20Nauru">phosphate mining</a>, as well as the remaining patches of forest on the island's central plateau. It is most common in the remains of forest found on the island's steep slopes. It is also readily observed in gardens and <a href="ruderal">ruderal</a> areas on the island's coast; in 1881, Finsch described the species as abundant, calling it "as common as the House-Sparrow in England." Biologist Donald Buden again found it widespread on the island in 2008.

The species is sedentary, meaning that the birds do not naturally leave Nauru. <a href="Banaba%20Island">Banaba</a> is the nearest island, and despite being similar to Nauru, it lacks any warblers. However, it is possible that populations of the Nauru reed warbler existed on other islands until comparatively recently. On the Marshall Islands, traditional stories refer to a small bird, known variously as "annañ", "anang" and "annãng". This bird was considered the property of chieftains. Though no physical descriptions exist of the species, it has been described as butterfly-sized, pleasant-smelling and as living among rocks on the shores of north-western islands. <a href="Ethnographers">Ethnographers</a> Krämer and Nevermann reported that the bird became extinct or extirpated around 1880. Based on descriptions of birds seen on <a href="Jaluit">Jaluit</a>, Paul Schnee hypothesised that the "annañ" may have been a Nauru reed warbler. The extinction of the "annañ" may have been due to hunting by cats, which were introduced to the Marshall Islands by the Russian Otto von Kotzebue in 1817 to hunt rats. They then multiplied before being spread by locals as pets, after which they started to become feral.

Nauru reed warbler nests are cup-shaped and woven from grasses and twigs. They sometimes include "<a href="Cassytha%20filiformis">Cassytha filiformis</a>" vine or "<a href="Casuarina%20equisetifolia">Casuarina equisetifolia</a>" needles. The nests are bound to upright stems in a way typical of warblers. Buden reported that the warblers nest in trees and shrubs at a height of . The species may also nest on the ground; the young in ground nests may be more vulnerable to predation by rats. Eggs have variously been reported in December and July, and ornithologist A. Pearson suggested that the species may nest all year round. The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size has been reported as two or three <a href="bird%20egg">eggs</a>. Incubation and <a href="fledge">fledgling</a> periods are unknown. Pearson reported lower nesting than Buden, recording nests in bushes and undergrowth between from the ground, especially in forked branches of <a href="hibiscus">hibiscus</a> and <a href="lime%20tree">lime</a>. Buden reported that the birds were more vocal in December than in March and April. The <a href="bird%20vocalization">song</a> has been described as similar to that of a <a href="song%20thrush">song thrush</a>, <a href="common%20blackbird">common blackbird</a>, or <a href="willie%20wagtail">willie wagtail</a>, and it is delivered both day and night.

Finsch described the warbler as insectivorous, feeding primarily on <a href="dragonflies">dragonflies</a>. Six species of dragonfly have been observed on the island; "<a href="Ischnura%20aurora">Ischnura aurora</a>", "<a href="Anax%20guttatus">Anax guttatus</a>", "<a href="Diplacodes%20bipunctata">Diplacodes bipunctata</a>", "<a href="Pantala%20flavescens">Pantala flavescens</a>", "<a href="Tholymis%20tillarga">Tholymis tillarga</a>" and "<a href="Tramea%20transmarina">Tramea transmarina</a>". Buden did not observe the species feeding on dragonflies, but did see three different feeding habits. Most frequently, the birds were seen moving through trees and shrubs, catching prey on the foliage. Other birds were seen perched close to the floor, darting to the ground, and returning to the perch with prey. In open areas, the birds were observed moving across the ground, "occasionally grasping a presumed prey item". In coastal areas, they have been observed feeding in coconut trees. Potential predators for the birdlife of Nauru in general include feral cats and dogs, as well as the <a href="Polynesian%20rat">Polynesian rat</a> and the <a href="Tanezumi%20rat">Tanezumi rat</a>. Feral cats and wild rats in particular are potential threats to the Nauru reed warbler.

The <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> lists the species as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>", because "its very small range leaves it susceptible to chance events, such as cyclones and the introduction of alien predators." <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> previously estimated that there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Nauru reed warblers, based on 1993 data, but Buden's 2006 estimate was 5,000 birds of all ages led to a revised figure of 3,000 mature individuals. In 2001, it was observed that the removal of the phosphate deposits on the island meant that the vegetation was decreasing, presenting a potential threat to the species. In 2008, however, Buden claimed that "habitat degradation and loss of native forest via mining operations has apparently had no major adverse effects on the population." Nauru reed warblers were observed to be common on the island, and flourishing in the scrubland left by mining.

Unlike other birds on the island, the species is not hunted, and is protected under Schedule 1 of Nauru's Wild Birds Preservation Ordinance 1937. For conservation purposes, the IUCN recommends regular surveys of the population and the establishment of a monitoring programme through training local people. It also proposed raising conservation awareness by increasing the profile of the bird.

Elcor, Minnesota

Elcor is a <a href="ghost%20town">ghost town</a>, or more properly, an extinct town, in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> that was inhabited between 1897 and 1956. It was built on the <a href="Mesabi%20Range">Mesabi Iron Range</a> near the city of <a href="Gilbert%2C%20Minnesota">Gilbert</a> in <a href="St.%20Louis%20County%2C%20Minnesota">St. Louis County</a>. Elcor was its own unincorporated community before it was abandoned and was never a neighborhood proper of the city of Gilbert. Not rating a figure in the national census, the people of Elcor were only generally considered to be citizens of Gilbert. The area where Elcor was located was <a href="Municipal%20annexation%20in%20the%20United%20States">annexed</a> by Gilbert when its existing city boundaries were expanded after 1969.

In November 1890, the <a href="Seven%20Iron%20Brothers">seven Merritt brothers</a> discovered ore near <a href="Mountain%20Iron%2C%20Minnesota">Mountain Iron</a>, triggering an unparalleled iron rush to the Mesabi Range. The Elba mine was opened in 1897, and the town was <a href="plat">plat</a>ted under the direction of Don H. Bacon, president of the Minnesota Iron Company. A second nearby mine, the Corsica, was opened in 1901. The community was first called "Elba" after the name of the first underground mine (the name "Elcor" was formed later by combining the first syllables of each mine's name). The Elba and Corsica mines were both leased by <a href="Pickands%20Mather%20and%20Company">Pickands Mather and Company</a> after the formation of the <a href="United%20States%20Steel%20Corporation">United States Steel Corporation</a>. An influx of people of many ethnicities and many nations followed, and Elcor became a microcosm of U.S. immigration, mirroring the cultural assimilation of the time. At its peak around 1920, Elcor had two churches, a post office, a <a href="general%20store">general store</a>, a primary school, a railroad station, and its own law enforcement, and housed a population of nearly 1,000.

Elcor was a mining location, built by the mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to own their homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the residents to vacate the property so that it could <a href="Mine%20reclamation">reclaim</a> the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies. In 1993, the <a href="Inland%20Steel%20Company">Inland Steel Company</a> began <a href="Stockpile">stockpiling</a> the <a href="overburden">overburden</a> from what is now the Minorca Mine over Elcor's former location.

Elcor came into existence with the opening of the Elba mine in 1897 and ended with the closing of the Corsica mine in 1954. The town was originally known as Elba, between the present-day cities of <a href="McKinley%2C%20St.%20Louis%20County%2C%20Minnesota">McKinley</a> and Gilbert; the name "Elcor" was chosen later, by combining the first syllable of the name of each mine. As an Iron Range mining location, Elcor originally consisted of a grid of houses the mining company rented to its employees. It was one of nearly 50 mining locations between the present-day cities of <a href="Eveleth%2C%20Minnesota">Eveleth</a> and <a href="Aurora%2C%20Minnesota">Aurora</a>. Some of these, like Sparta and Pineville, exist today; others, such as Franklin and Genoa, have been annexed by adjacent communities; most have disappeared entirely.

Development of the Elba mine was carried out by the Minnesota Iron Company, and the first shipment of <a href="ore">ore</a> was made in 1898. The Minnesota Iron Company also had a <a href="controlling%20interest">controlling interest</a> in Petit and Robinson, which owned the Corsica mine, where the first ore was shipped in 1901. Don H. Bacon, who joined the Minnesota Iron Company as general manager in 1887 and eventually became its president, was an ardent traveler who named many mines after Mediterranean islands, including <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="Majorca">Maiorica</a>, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, and <a href="Elba">Elba</a>. He had a penchant for names beginning with the letter M. The Minnesota Steamship Company was organized by, and <a href="vertically%20integrated">vertically integrated</a> with, the Minnesota Iron Company to carry ore in 1889; its steamers and barges all had names that began with M, and the ships were referred to as the M fleet. Elba's street and avenue names also all began with M:
<a href="Mohawk%20people">Mohawk</a> Street
Malta Street
<a href="Manila">Manilla</a> Street (this was also the main street)
<a href="Majo">Manola</a> Street
<a href="Yokuts%20people">Mariposa</a> Avenue
<a href="Mauna%20Loa">Mauna Loa</a> Avenue
<a href="Maritana">Maritana</a> Avenue
<a href="Minorca">Minorca</a> Avenue

The first street in Elba was Manilla Street. Company houses were constructed on both sides of it.

The Elba group of mines was between 1 and 1.5 miles west of McKinley, and was usually classed with the McKinley district mines, which included the Elba and Corsica mines, and the La Belle mine, operated by the Pitt Iron Mining Company. The Minnesota Iron Company operated the Elba mine from 1898 to 1900 under the direction of M. E. McCarthy. Immediately after the formation of the United States Steel Corporation in 1901, Pickands Mather and Company acquired the Elba and Corsica mines, assuming the mineral leases and operating both after that date. Owners James Pickands, <a href="Samuel%20Mather">Samuel Mather</a> and Jay Morse had been interested in the Corsica iron-ore properties for some time, and the mines remained on the firm's shipping roll for many years. William Philip Chinn was appointed superintendent of the Elba and adjacent Corsica mine under the new management of Pickands Mather and Company, succeeding McCarthy. Chinn was then on his way up in mining circles, ultimately becoming general manager of all Pickands Mather mining properties in the Lake Superior region in 1918; he was succeeded as superintendent of the Elba and Corsica mines by L. C. David. The <a href="Oliver%20Iron%20Mining%20Company">Oliver Iron Mining Company</a> also owned what they designated the "Elba No. 1 and No. 2 Reserve" ore bodies, but these were entirely different from the Elba and Corsica mines and remained undeveloped.

The community grew at the beginning of the century. In 1902, the Corsica mine began operating in earnest and houses were quickly built. Company houses were built among the tall timbers. The community thrived on iron mining, its population nearing 1,000 after World War I, resulting in a neat and comfortable location comprising more than 100 houses. The townspeople were <a href="American%20pioneer">pioneers</a> and largely immigrants, including <a href="Croatians">Croatians</a>, <a href="Slovenians">Slovenians</a>, <a href="Finns">Finns</a>, <a href="Italians">Italians</a>, <a href="Germans">Germans</a>, Scandinavians, and English, particularly from <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>.

In the early days, houses were made of wooden boards and surrounded by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a <a href="boardwalk">boardwalk</a>. Most of the streets were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses dragging V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets.
In the center of town was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs, and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. <a href="St.%20Bernard%20%28dog%29">St. Bernard</a> dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed.
Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.

The community's Finns organized a <a href="temperance%20society">temperance society</a> and built the Finnish Temperance Hall. The community also included a band, a volunteer fire department, tennis courts, and a clubhouse for employees.
A small <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> church and <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> church were built. The town also had a night watchman and later a full-time patrolman. Always noted as a quiet, orderly town, Elcor managed to avoid the social vagaries of adjacent communities, like Gilbert's <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>.

One of the frame houses was used as the first school in Elcor. It was not long before a new school was constructed. Elcor was included in the middle part of the Gilbert School system, known then as Independent School District No. 18. There were five schoolhouses in the district. The McKinley-Elba school was built in 1900, halfway between McKinley and Elba, complete with its own well and windmill. It had four teachers and housed classes through the <a href="eighth%20grade">eighth grade</a>, accommodating pupils of both communities. Students walked to school over boardwalks. There were also three primary schools in the district, one of them in Elba on Malta Street.

Elcor's renters were required to take in boarders. The company rented a "cottage" for $7.50 per month, which later included electricity. Homes were charged an additional dollar per month when water was piped in from Gilbert. Although people were later allowed to own their homes (even though the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company), rents were never increased.

All families had their own gardens in which they grew vegetables that lasted through the winter. Some raised cows, pigs, and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the Mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.

In 1920, the Finnish Hall became a general store, the Elcor Mercantile, along with an official U.S. Post Office. When the post office began operation, much confusion resulted, because there was another town named <a href="Elba%2C%20Minnesota">Elba</a> in southeastern Minnesota, just east of <a href="Rochester%2C%20Minnesota">Rochester</a>. The name "Corsica" was attempted with the same result. Finally, the community was named "Elcor", combining the first syllable of each of the two names. "Elcor" was emblazoned in large white letters on the water tower.

Mail was picked up twice daily at the railroad station, erroneously named "Elcore", for the <a href="Duluth%20and%20Iron%20Range%20Railroad">Duluth and Iron Range Railroad</a> (later the <a href="Duluth%2C%20Missabe%20and%20Iron%20Range">Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railroad</a>). Later, the Elcor Mercantile diversified into the up-and-coming petroleum business, selling <a href="Conoco">Conoco</a> gasoline, kerosene, fuel oils, motor oils, grease, and even <a href="outboard%20motors">outboard motors</a>. Concrete <a href="sidewalks">sidewalks</a> were built to line the shady streets, and bright red <a href="fire%20hydrants">fire hydrants</a> were installed. Homes were <a href="Building%20insulation">insulated</a>, and people began to purchase refrigerators. Manilla Street and Maritana Avenue were paved. <a href="Greyhound%20Bus%20Lines">Greyhound Bus Lines</a> established a stop at the Elcor Mercantile. A <a href="baseball">baseball</a> team was entered in the old East Mesaba League, and the Elcor Mercantile sponsored the Elcor-Conocos, an <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> team that became one of the best on the Iron Range. <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> ice hockey goaltender <a href="Sam%20LoPresti">Sam LoPresti</a> was born in Elcor.
The Corsica and Elba mines remained the chief source of employment until 1926, when the underground Elba mine closed. It had been mined out. A few years later, the Corsica mine was converted into an open pit, and the future of the town once again seemed secure. Then the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> hit. In the fall of 1929, Corsica closed and stayed closed for many years, with only a few salaried people retained. The mine remained idle until 1940, ironically receiving an honorable mention in the National Safety Competition from the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Mines">U.S. Bureau of Mines</a> in 1934. Once <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> began, the mining business boomed again.

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that "temporary" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps "eventually" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.

Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.

Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land <a href="speculators">speculators</a>. In the few months after Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at $75 were sold for as much as $500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Highway%20135">Minnesota State Highway 135</a> between Gilbert and <a href="Biwabik%2C%20Minnesota">Biwabik</a>. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway went through what was left of the town site. Mine shafts were boarded up with old timbers. After everyone had left, the company dumped heaps of iron ore on the roads leading into Elcor, and in the process a ghost town was made out of what was once a thriving community. 

For a time, the only landmark that remained at the old mining location was a smokestack near the defunct Corsica mine. The stack, built by <a href="Cornish%20people">Cornish</a> miners in 1901, had a unique design. The <a href="Iron%20Range%20Historical%20Society">Iron Range Historical Society</a> wanted the stack, the last of its kind on the Mesabi Iron Range, to be preserved as an off-premises attraction, since it was structurally sound and historically significant, but its demolition had already been contracted as a part of the Minnesota Mineland Reclamation Act Abandoned Minelands Cleanup Program. Many people feared it might fall and injure someone; others considered it an aerial obstruction. In 1976, the stack was destroyed; it took three blasting attempts and nearly of <a href="dynamite">dynamite</a> to bring the structure down. After the demolition, responsibility for the land on which Elcor stood changed hands on several different occasions. As early as 1978, the property and its management were acquired by the <a href="Jones%20and%20Laughlin%20Steel%20Company">Jones and Laughlin Steel Company</a>. Property rights were then transferred to <a href="LTV%20Steel">LTV Steel</a> after the merger of Jones and Laughlin with <a href="Republic%20Steel">Republic Steel</a> in 1984. Property rights were later acquired by the Inland Steel Company in a transfer from LTV. In 1993, Inland Steel began stripping the overburden near the old town site, and the Laurentian mine was born. The mine is now owned by <a href="ArcelorMittal">ArcelorMittal</a> and has been redesignated the Laurentian pit of the Minorca mine after the acquisition of Inland Steel by <a href="Mittal%20Steel%20Company">Mittal</a> in 1998. 
Elcor sat atop a bed of <a href="taconite">taconite</a> consisting of a uniform mixture of about 30 percent iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore containing 90 to 95 percent iron, a part of the Biwabik iron formation. The formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> era on the bottom of the <a href="Animikie%20Group">Animikie Sea</a>. This sea occupied the western portion of the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> area, depositing iron-bearing sediments extending under Lake Superior from the <a href="Mesabi%20Range">Mesabi</a> and <a href="Vermilion%20Iron%20Range">Vermilion Iron Range</a>s in northern Minnesota, to the <a href="Gogebic%20Range">Gogebic Iron Range</a> in northern <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>'s upper peninsula, to the <a href="Marquette%20Iron%20Range">Marquette Range</a> of the upper peninsula, and west to the <a href="manganese">manganese</a>-rich ore of the <a href="Cuyuna%20Range">Cuyuna Iron Range</a> in central Minnesota. Michigan's <a href="Silicon%20dioxide">silicious</a> steel-blue high-grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was hydrated soft brown <a href="hematite">hematite</a>. Geologists disagree about the geologic time period of the region and the mechanism by which the iron-bearing sediment was laid down differently on opposite sides of the lake. There is iron ore in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.

Geologists divide the iron-bearing rocks of the eastern Mesabi Iron Range into several layers. In the <a href="stratigraphic%20column">stratigraphic column</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Slate">Virginia Slate</a> and <a href="Duluth%20Complex">Duluth gabbro</a> lie above, followed by four main iron-bearing divisions named the Upper Slaty, Upper Cherty, Lower Slaty, and Lower Cherty. Below these are <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> and <a href="granite">granite</a>. Beneath the shallow <a href="topsoil">topsoil</a>, the slate is from to several hundred feet thick, and the four iron-bearing layers are from thick.

Elcor lay at an elevation of in St. Louis County, Minnesota, <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">north-northwest</a> of <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth</a>. The nearest cities to Elcor were Gilbert, approximately to the southwest and McKinley, approximately to the east-northeast. Elcor was along the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135, almost east-southeast of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2053">U.S. Route 53</a> and about northeast of <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Highway%2037">Minnesota State Highway 37</a>.

Elcor was in the <a href="Laurentian%20Mixed%20Forest%20Province">Laurentian Mixed Forest Province</a> in the <a href="Arrowhead%20region">Arrowhead region</a> of northern Minnesota. The <a href="polar%20air%20mass">polar air mass</a> dominates this part of the state year-round.

Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team at the 2012 Summer Paralympics

The 2012 <a href="Australian%20women%27s%20national%20wheelchair%20basketball%20team">Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team</a>, known as the Gliders, was a <a href="wheelchair%20basketball">wheelchair basketball</a> team that played in the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Paralympics">2012 Summer Paralympics</a> in London. The team of twelve included nine Paralympic veterans with fifteen Paralympic Games between them: <a href="Bridie%20Kean">Bridie Kean</a>, <a href="Amanda%20Carter">Amanda Carter</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Stewart%20%28basketball%29">Sarah Stewart</a>, <a href="Tina%20McKenzie">Tina McKenzie</a>, <a href="Kylie%20Gauci">Kylie Gauci</a>, <a href="Katie%20Hill%20%28basketball%29">Katie Hill</a>, <a href="Cobi%20Crispin">Cobi Crispin</a>, <a href="Clare%20Nott">Clare Nott</a> and <a href="Shelley%20Chaplin">Shelley Chaplin</a>. There were three newcomers playing in their first Paralympics: <a href="Amber%20Merritt">Amber Merritt</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Vinci">Sarah Vinci</a> and <a href="Leanne%20Del%20Toso">Leanne Del Toso</a>. Carter returned to the Gliders' line up after being sidelined by a crippling elbow injury at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Paralympics">2000 Summer Paralympics</a> in Sydney. The Gliders had won silver in Sydney and the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Paralympics">2004 Summer Paralympics</a> in Athens, but had never won gold.

The first stage of the Paralympic competition was the group stage, a <a href="round-robin%20tournament">round-robin tournament</a>. The Gliders faced a formidable task just to make the finals, as their pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had beaten the Gliders in 2010, and the Netherlands was rated as one of the competition's best teams. After a narrow victory over Brazil, and an easier one against Great Britain, the Gliders were again defeated by Canada, but won their final match against the Netherlands to finish at the top of their pool. The Gliders went on to win the quarterfinal against Mexico and the semifinal against the United States, but lost to Germany in the final, winning silver.

Prior to the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Paralympics">2012 Summer Paralympics</a> in London, the <a href="Australian%20women%27s%20national%20wheelchair%20basketball%20team">Australian women's national wheelchair basketball team</a>, known as the Gliders, had won silver at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Paralympics">2000 Summer Paralympics</a> in Sydney and the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Paralympics">2004 Summer Paralympics</a> in Athens, and bronze at the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Paralympics">2008 Summer Paralympics</a> in Beijing, but had never won gold. The announcement of the membership of the Paralympic team was made on 5 July 2012. The team of twelve included nine veterans with 15 Paralympic Games between them: <a href="Bridie%20Kean">Bridie Kean</a>, <a href="Amanda%20Carter">Amanda Carter</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Stewart%20%28basketball%29">Sarah Stewart</a>, <a href="Tina%20McKenzie">Tina McKenzie</a>, <a href="Kylie%20Gauci">Kylie Gauci</a>, <a href="Katie%20Hill%20%28basketball%29">Katie Hill</a>, <a href="Cobi%20Crispin">Cobi Crispin</a>, <a href="Clare%20Nott">Clare Nott</a> and <a href="Shelley%20Chaplin">Shelley Chaplin</a>. <a href="Amber%20Merritt">Amber Merritt</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Vinci">Sarah Vinci</a> and <a href="Leanne%20Del%20Toso">Leanne Del Toso</a> were newcomers competing at their first Paralympics. Kean, aged 25, was selected as their captain.

The oldest team member was Amanda Carter, aged 48, who was coming back for a fourth Paralympic games having competed in the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Paralympics">1992 Summer Paralympics</a> in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Paralympics">1996 Summer Paralympics</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, at which she had been sidelined by a crippling elbow injury. She returned to the Gliders' lineup in 2009. The youngest, who had not even been born when Carter had played in Barcelona, was 19-year-old Amber Merritt. British-born Merritt was originally a swimmer, but had been recruited into basketball by the <a href="Paralympic%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Paralympic Hall of Fame</a> coach <a href="Frank%20Ponta">Frank Ponta</a>. Merritt had averaged 20 points and 8.4 <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebound</a>s per game in the Gliders' World Challenge series against Japan, Germany and China in Sydney in July 2012, including a game against Germany in which she scored 21 points and eight rebounds. Another young player from whom much was hoped was Cobi Crispin, who had been named Australian Women's Wheelchair Basketball International Player of the Year in 2011, and had since posted impressive performances in the May 2012 <a href="Paralympic%20World%20Cup">Paralympic World Cup</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and the Gliders World Challenge.

The first part of the competition was the group stage. The Gliders' pool included <a href="Brazil%20women%27s%20national%20wheelchair%20basketball%20team">Brazil</a>, <a href="Great%20Britain%20women%27s%20national%20wheelchair%20basketball%20team">Great Britain</a>, <a href="Canada%20women%27s%20national%20wheelchair%20basketball%20team">Canada</a> and the <a href="Netherlands%20women%27s%20national%20wheelchair%20basketball%20team">Netherlands</a>. Canada had defeated them in the bronze medal game at the <a href="2010%20Wheelchair%20Basketball%20World%20Championship">2010 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> in July 2010. The Gliders' head coach, <a href="John%20Triscari">John Triscari</a>, admitted Canada and the Netherlands would be hard to beat:

The Gliders' first game was on 30 August in front of a crowd of 3,288 at the <a href="Basketball%20Arena%20%28London%29">Basketball Arena</a> in Olympic Park in <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford, London</a>; a venue also known as "The Marshmallow". The Gliders had not played Brazil in four years, and what little they knew about them came from watching video tapes.

The scores were tied fifteen times, and at no point were the Australians more than five points in front. With six minutes to go in the final quarter, the Gliders were up by only two points, with the score 45–43. Crispin was sent to the free-throw line where she extended her team's lead to 47–43. A technical foul saw her straight back to the free-throw line to make it 48–43, the Gliders' biggest lead of the game. Brazil then struck back, scoring five unanswered points to tie the score again at 48–48, but Merritt scored one from <a href="Key%20%28basketball%29">the paint</a> to put the Gliders back in front. She followed by taking a defensive rebound and then another shot to make it 52–48. Brazil scored once more, but time ran out, and the Gliders won, 52–50. Leading scorers for the Gliders were Crispin with 18 points and Merritt with 16.

The Gliders' next match was against Great Britain, and was held at the <a href="North%20Greenwich%20Arena">North Greenwich Arena</a>, which could accommodate a larger crowd than the Marshmallow. A crowd of 5,331 saw a low-scoring affair. The Gliders concentrated on defence, and led by only 11–5 at quarter time. By half time, they had extended their lead to 25–11. The third quarter went badly for Team Great Britain, which only scored three more points to Australia's 14, making the score 39–14 at three-quarter time. The final quarter was Great Britain's best, but the score was still 51–24. Merritt and Crispin were again the Gliders' top scorers, with 10 and 8 points respectively, but they moved the ball around, and every Glider except McKenzie scored at least two points. Gary Peel, the British coach, "preparing to unleash his best impression of Sir <a href="Alex%20Ferguson">Alex Ferguson</a>'s hairdryer on his beleaguered team", was scathing about their performance. "They know that's not the way we play", he said, "and I'm disappointed for the crowd and them because they are tons better than that. It was an absolutely disgraceful effort out there. It really was bad."

The Gliders returned to the Marshmallow the next day for a match against Canada, another team considered a strong chance for a medal, in front of a capacity crowd of 7,200. The Gliders squandered early opportunities, and Canada won the first quarter 20–12. Strong defensive play by Nott and Gauci helped the Gliders reverse this in the second, and left Canada with only a one-point 33–32 lead at half time. The second half saw Canada slowly increase their lead, keeping tied with Australia 4–4 in the first half of third, 6–4 in the last half of the third, 6–4 in the first half of the fourth, and 8–6 in the last half of the fourth. Australia's top players were Crispin, who had 13 points and 15 rebounds; Merritt, who earned 16 points; and Chaplin, with eight points, five rebounds and seven <a href="assist%20%28basketball%29">assist</a>s. The loss raised the prospect that Australia might not make the finals at all, but Crispin remained confident that they could.

Triscari identified the Gliders' poor shooting as their critical problem. "That was a really tough game," he said, "and full credit to Canada, but we can't beat top teams in the world when we only shoot at 34%, that was the key statistic." Merritt, who had a British accent, said that she had "the utmost respect for Canada. They're a great team, but we'll refocus on the game tomorrow and go out and play like we know we can, the Australian way."

The loss to Canada meant that the Gliders needed a win against the Netherlands, who were considered one of the competition's best teams, and who had beaten Canada. Crispin told the media that "We will go out like we have in every other game and stick to our game plan and hopefully we'll come out on top".

The Netherlands scored first, but Kean soon equalised, assisted by Stewart. The Dutch team responded, but Gauci took two points with a <a href="fast%20break">fast break</a>, and then assisted Crispin in putting Australia in the lead, one which the Gliders would not relinquish. Stewart made the next two scores, from outside the paint, and assisted Crispin to bring the score to 6–16. The Dutch team fought back, but there was a 12–18 deficit at quarter time. The Australian defence shut down their opportunities in the second quarter, and the score was 20–30 in Australia's favour at half time, and 29–40 by the end of the third quarter. The Dutch team redoubled their efforts in the final quarter, and won the quarter 20–18, but the Gliders won the game, 49–58.

Once again Merritt led Australia's scoring, with 19 points and considerably improved accuracy of 9 shots from 14 attempts, while Crispin had ten points and seven rebounds. The rest of the team performed equally well. Stewart scored six points and five rebounds. Chaplin's reputation as a play-maker was burnished with four rebounds and seven assists. Gauci had eight points and six assists. Nott had played all 40 minutes of the game against Canada the night before, then over 32 minutes in this game, and was particularly active in the final quarter. Triscari praised both the Gliders and their opponents:

The loss to Canada meant that the Gliders had won three out of four games, the same number as Canada and the Netherlands. Since Australia had lost to Canada by 7 points and defeated the Netherlands by 9, and the Netherlands had defeated Canada by 11 points, a tiebreaker on points differential gave Australia 9 - 7 = +2, Netherlands 11 - 9 = +2, and Canada 7 - 11 = -4. Canada therefore finished third, while Australia, tied with the Netherlands, was placed ahead of them based on defeating them in their match. As a result, the Gliders topped their pool, and received a quarterfinal berth against Mexico, which had managed to qualify despite only winning one game. Triscari was confident, but was not taking the match lightly. He cautioned the media: 

The Gliders planned to dominate Mexico early, playing as aggressively against them as they had played against the Netherlands. Australia's first shots at goal were taken by Kean from the free-throw line, but she missed both. Mexico's Lucia Vazquez Delgadillo then opened the scoring to give Mexico a two-point lead, which turned out to be their biggest of the game. Gauci then put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders. Mexico turned the ball over, and Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Gauci, which was repeated on the next play, with Stewart providing the assist this time. Mexico scored, but the Gliders responded with another shot from Crispin. On the next play, Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Nott then took a defensive rebound, leading to Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled, but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Stewart drew another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14–4.
The Gliders put Mexico under intense defensive pressure. Mexico had six team turnovers to the Gliders' one, and wound up with 19 turnovers in total to Australia's 6. Australia scored 18 points from turnovers, compared to 6 for Mexico. Gauci, a two-point player, took a <a href="three-pointer">three-pointer</a> to take the score to 17–8. Mexico was unable to recover from Australia's high scoring from Merritt, who ultimately scored 14 points with 70 per cent shooting, and Crispin, who scored twelve points with 67 per cent shooting. The teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10. Mexico fell further behind in the second quarter. Amanda Carter immediately stole the ball from Mexico, which let Merritt score two points. A few minutes later, Carter, assisted by Chaplin, scored a basket from the paint, and was fouled in the process. A successful free throw made the score 36–16. Another steal by Merritt led to a fast break, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38–16. At the half-time break, the score was 44–20.

In the third quarter, a team <a href="Turnover%20%28basketball%29">turnover</a> and a series of missed shots by Hill, Kean and Crispin allowed Mexico to outscore Australia by one point, leaving the score at 50–27 at the end of the quarter. The final quarter saw Australia's Del Toso miss a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal miss one at the other. Stewart also missed, before a Mexican turnover led to the first score of the quarter, by Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response. Another shot by Stewart missed, but Carter took an offensive rebound, and scored. Turnovers by Kean and Del Toso allowed Mexico to put four points on the board, but successive fouls sent Kean to the free-throw line to score three points in response.

Merritt brought the score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game drew to a close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to capitalise on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.

In the semifinal, the Gliders had to beat the reigning champions, Team USA, in front of a small crowd of 4,428 at the North Greenwich Arena. Team USA had first possession and earned the first points of the game, but both teams' shooting was poor, and the score was only 10–12 at quarter time. The second quarter started with Merritt scoring twice to give Australia the lead 14–12. Team USA turned the ball over the Gliders several times, but they were unable to capitalise on their strong defence, leaving the score tied at 26–26 at half time. In the third quarter, an early goal by Gauci from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots, most of which they missed, but Team USA gave up a series of turnovers, and their shooting was worse than their rivals', resulting in a 10–0 run by the Gliders. Team USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Hill saw the Gliders leading 38–28. Team USA would ultimately post 28 turnovers to Australia's 17, and the Gliders would score 12 points from turnovers to Team USA's three. Triscari warned his players, "They will come back! We have to stop them!"

In the final quarter, the Australian defence remained strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, who played the entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with four out of five attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's <a href="Desi%20Miller">Desi Miller</a> scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's <a href="Rebecca%20Murray">Rebecca Murray</a>, who took the ball down the court, in the face of the Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to <a href="Rose%20Hollermann">Rose Hollermann</a>, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second to go, but the <a href="shot%20clock">shot clock</a> was not reset. Team USA's <a href="Alana%20Nichols">Alana Nichols</a> rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.

The Gliders would have to defeat Germany in front of a capacity crowd of 12,985 at the North Greenwich Arena to win the gold medal. Australia had narrowly defeated the German team 48–46 in the Gliders World Challenge in Sydney a few months earlier, and at that point had beaten them three of the previous four times they had played.
Once again, Stewart took the opening tip. A defensive rebound by Kean after Germany missed two free throws resulted in the Gliders scoring first, with Gauci assisting Crispin. The Gliders used the same game plan that had defeated the United States, employing a strong defence against a normally high-scoring team. At first, they were successful; with three minutes to go in the quarter, despite several missed shots, Australia was ahead 10–4. In the last minutes, Germany scored ten points that gave them a 10–14 lead at quarter time.

In the second quarter, Germany extended their lead to ten points, but Kean scored a point from a free throw, and then, with seconds left on the clock, stole the ball, enabling Crispin to score, so the Gliders were only seven points behind at half time. The Gliders won the third quarter, but only by 9–8. They still had six points to make up, with strong defences from both teams. Gauci scored the most in this game, with 15 points, including a three-pointer, with five assists and four rebounds. In the end, the Gliders lost by fourteen points, 44–58.

Triscari felt that the Gliders did not put enough pressure on the Germans, and that their shooting was not accurate enough. In particular, they scored a dismal one point from twelve attempts from the free throw line. <a href="Basketball%20Australia">Basketball Australia</a> CEO <a href="Kristina%20Keneally">Kristina Keneally</a> praised the Gliders' efforts. "The Gliders have been nothing short of brilliant at the Paralympic Games," she said, "and this Silver Medal is just reward for their outstanding performance. This is the Gliders' fourth consecutive Paralympic Medal – a remarkable achievement. All of the players, coaches and support staff have done a fantastic job and we can’t wait to greet them on their return home."
In 2013, Keneally announced a four-year development program for the Gliders that included the appointment of a full-time head coach for the first time, based at the National Wheelchair Centre of Excellence at the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Institute%20of%20Sport">New South Wales Institute of Sport</a> in <a href="Homebush%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Homebush, New South Wales</a>. In May 2013, <a href="Tom%20Kyle">Tom Kyle</a> was appointed the Gliders' new head coach.

"We have had the opportunity to play Germany a fair bit in our preparation so our game plan was to have strong defensive pressure and take it from there", Kean told the media. "It started off really good for us, unfortunately they just got a couple more runs than us and that's the way it goes sometimes. They played a great game. We stuck together 12 deep from the second the buzzer started, to that end buzzer and no one gave up. I think that we can hold our heads high because of that. I guess the plan is, next four years, Rio we go one more."

It was not to be. The Gliders did not qualify for the <a href="2016%20Rio%20Paralympics">2016 Rio Paralympics</a> after finishing second to China at the 2015 Asia Oceania Qualifying Tournament.

Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England

The exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England began with the discovery of the king's remains within the site of the former <a href="Greyfriars%2C%20Leicester">Greyfriars Friary Church</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, England, in September 2012. Following extensive anthropological and genetic testing, the remains of <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a>, the last English king killed in battle, were ultimately reinterred at <a href="Leicester%20Cathedral">Leicester Cathedral</a> on 26 March 2015.

Richard III, the final ruler of the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">Plantagenet dynasty</a>, was killed on 22 August 1485 in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth%20Field">Battle of Bosworth Field</a>, the last significant battle of the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. His body was taken to Greyfriars Friary in Leicester, where it was buried in a crude grave in the friary church. Following the friary's <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution in 1538</a> and subsequent demolition, Richard's tomb was lost. An erroneous account arose that Richard's bones had been thrown into the <a href="River%20Soar">River Soar</a> at the nearby Bow Bridge.

A search for Richard's body began in August 2012, initiated by the "Looking for Richard" project with the support of the <a href="Ricardian%20%28Richard%20III%29%23Richard%20III%20Society">Richard III Society</a>. The <a href="Archaeology">archaeological</a> <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavation</a> was led by the <a href="University%20of%20Leicester%23College%20of%20Arts%2C%20Humanities%20%26amp%3B%20Law">University of Leicester Archaeological Services</a>, working in partnership with <a href="Leicester%20City%20Council">Leicester City Council</a>. On the first day a human skeleton belonging to a man in his thirties was uncovered showing signs of severe injuries. The skeleton, which had several unusual physical features, most notably <a href="scoliosis">scoliosis</a>, a severe curvature of the back, was exhumed to allow scientific analysis. Examination showed that the man had probably been killed either by a blow from a large bladed weapon, probably a <a href="halberd">halberd</a>, which cut off the back of his skull and exposed the brain, or by a sword thrust that penetrated all the way through the brain. Other wounds on the skeleton had probably occurred after death as "humiliation injuries", inflicted as a form of posthumous revenge.

The age of the bones at death matched that of Richard when he was killed; they were dated to about the period of his death and were mostly consistent with physical descriptions of the king. Preliminary <a href="Genetic%20testing">DNA analysis</a> showed that <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> extracted from the bones matched that of two <a href="matrilineal">matrilineal</a> descendants, one 17th-generation and the other 19th-generation, of Richard's sister <a href="Anne%20of%20York%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Exeter">Anne of York</a>. Taking these findings into account along with other historical, scientific and archaeological evidence, the University of Leicester announced on 4 February 2013 that it had concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the skeleton was that of Richard III.

As a condition of being allowed to disinter the skeleton, the archaeologists agreed that, if Richard were found, his remains would be reburied in Leicester Cathedral. A controversy arose as to whether an alternative reburial site, <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> or <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, would be more suitable. A legal challenge confirmed there were no public law grounds for the courts to be involved in that decision. Reinterment took place in Leicester on 26 March 2015, during a televised memorial service held in the presence of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> and senior members of other Christian denominations.

Richard was killed fighting the forces of <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry Tudor</a> at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, the last major battle of the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. The Welsh poet <a href="Guto%27r%20Glyn">Guto'r Glyn</a> credited Richard's death to Sir <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Rhys ap Thomas</a>, a Welsh member of Henry's army who was said to have struck the fatal blow. Following his death, Richard's body was stripped naked and taken to Leicester where it was put on public display. The anonymous "<a href="Ballad%20of%20Bosworth%20Field">Ballad of Bosworth Field</a>" says that "in Newarke laid was hee, that many a one might looke on him" —almost certainly a reference to the collegiate <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Annunciation%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Newarke">Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke</a>, a Lancastrian foundation on the outskirts of medieval Leicester. According to the chronicler <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a>, Henry VII "tarried for two days" in Leicester before leaving for London, and on the same date as Henry's departure—25 August 1485—Richard's body was buried "at the convent of Franciscan monks ["sic"] in Leicester" with "no funeral solemnity". The Warwickshire priest and <a href="Antiquary%23Medieval%20and%20early%20modern%20antiquarianism">antiquary</a> <a href="John%20Rous%20%28historian%29">John Rous</a>, writing between 1486 and 1491, recorded that Richard had been buried "in the choir of the Friars Minor at Leicester". Although later writers ascribed Richard's burial to other places, the accounts of Vergil and Rous were seen by modern investigators as the most credible.

In 1495, ten years after the burial, Henry VII paid for a marble and alabaster monument to mark Richard's grave. Its cost is recorded in surviving legal papers relating to a dispute over payment showing that two men received payments of £50 and <a href="%C2%A3sd">£10.1s</a>, respectively, to make and transport the tomb from Nottingham to Leicester. No first-person descriptions of the tomb survive, but <a href="Raphael%20Holinshed">Raphael Holinshed</a> wrote in 1577 (perhaps quoting someone who had seen it in person) that it incorporated "a picture of alabaster representing [Richard's] person". Sir <a href="George%20Buck">George Buck</a> 40 years later wrote that it was "a fair tomb of mingled colour marble adorned with his image". Buck also recorded the epitaph inscribed on the tomb.

Following the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution</a> of Greyfriars in 1538, the friary was demolished and the monument either was destroyed, or slowly decayed as a result of being exposed to the elements. The site of the friary was sold to two Lincolnshire property speculators and was later acquired by Robert Herrick, the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Leicester">Mayor of Leicester</a> (and eventual uncle of the poet <a href="Robert%20Herrick%20%28poet%29">Robert Herrick</a>). The Lord Mayor Herrick built a mansion close to Friary Lane, on a site now buried under the modern Grey Friars Street, and turned the rest of the land into gardens. Although Richard's monument had evidently disappeared by this time, the site of his grave was still known. The antiquary Christopher Wren (father of <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a> the architect) recorded that Herrick erected a monument on the site of the grave in the form of a stone pillar three feet (1 m) high carved with the words, "Here lies the Body of Richard III, Some Time King of England." The pillar was visible in 1612 but had disappeared by 1844.

The <a href="cartographer">cartographer</a> and antiquarian <a href="John%20Speed">John Speed</a> wrote in his "Historie of Great Britaine" (1611) that local tradition held that Richard's body had been "borne out of the City, and contemptuously bestowed under the end of Bow-Bridge, which giveth passage over a branch of Soare upon the west side of the town." His account was widely accepted by later authors. In 1856 a memorial plaque to Richard III was erected next to Bow Bridge by a local builder, stating, "Near this spot lie the remains of Richard III the last of the Plantagenets 1485". The discovery of a skeleton in 1862 in the river sediments near the bridge led to claims that Richard's bones had been found, but closer examination showed they were probably those of a man in his early 20s and not Richard's.

The origin of Speed's claim is unclear; it was not attributed to any source, nor did it have any antecedents in other written accounts. The writer Audrey Strange suggests that the account may be a confused retelling of <a href="desecration">desecration</a> of the remains of <a href="John%20Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a> in nearby <a href="Lutterworth">Lutterworth</a> in 1428, when a mob disinterred him, burned his bones and threw them into the <a href="River%20Swift">River Swift</a>. The independent British historian John Ashdown-Hill proposes that Speed made a mistake over the location of Richard's grave and invented the story to account for its absence. If Speed had been to Herrick's property he would surely have seen the commemorative pillar and gardens, but instead he reported that the site was "overgrown with nettles and weeds" and there was no trace of Richard's grave. The map of Leicester drawn by Speed incorrectly shows Greyfriars where the former Blackfriars was, suggesting that he had looked for the grave in the wrong place.

Another local legend arose about a stone coffin that supposedly held Richard's remains, which Speed wrote was "now made a drinking trough for horses at a common Inn". A coffin certainly seems to have existed; <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a> recorded it on a visit in 1654, and <a href="Celia%20Fiennes">Celia Fiennes</a> wrote in 1700 that she had seen "a piece of his tombstone ["sic"] he lay in, which was cut out in exact form for his body to lie in; it remains to be seen at ye Greyhound [Inn] in Leicester but is partly broken." <a href="William%20Hutton%20%28historian%29">William Hutton</a> found in 1758 that the coffin, which had "not withstood the ravages of time", was kept at the White Horse Inn on Gallowtree Gate. Although the coffin's location is no longer known, its description does not match the style of late 15th-century coffins, and it is unlikely to have had any connection with Richard. It is more likely that it was salvaged from one of the religious establishments demolished following the Dissolution.

Herrick's mansion, Greyfriars House, remained in the possession of his family until his great-grandson Samuel sold it in 1711. The property was subsequently divided and sold in 1740; three years later, New Street was built across the western part of the site. Many burials were discovered when houses were laid out along the street. A townhouse, 17 Friar Lane, was built on the eastern part of the site in 1759 and survives today. During the 19th century, the site became increasingly built on. In 1863 <a href="Alderman%20Newton%27s%20School">Alderman Newton's Boys' School</a> built a schoolhouse on part of the site. Herrick's mansion was demolished in 1871, the present Grey Friars Street was laid through the site in 1873, and more commercial developments, including the Leicester Trustee Savings Bank, were built. In 1915 the rest of the site was acquired by <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Council">Leicestershire County Council</a> which built offices on it in the 1920s and 1930s. The county council relocated in 1965 when its new County Hall opened, and Leicester City Council moved in. The rest of the site, where Herrick's garden had once been, was turned into a staff car park in about 1944, but was not otherwise built on.

In 2007, a single-storey building from the 1950s was demolished on Grey Friars Street giving archaeologists the opportunity to excavate and search for traces of the medieval friary. Very little was unearthed, except for a fragment of a post-medieval stone coffin lid. The results of the dig suggested that the remains of the friary church were farther west than previously thought.

The location of Richard III's body has long been of interest to the members of the <a href="Ricardian%20%28Richard%20III%29%23Richard%20III%20Society">Richard III Society</a>, a group established to bring about a reappraisal of the King's tarnished reputation. In 1975 an article by Audrey Strange was published in the society's journal, "The Ricardian", suggesting that his remains were buried under Leicester City Council's car park. The claim was repeated in 1986, when historian <a href="David%20Baldwin%20%28historian%29">David Baldwin</a> suggested that the remains were still in the Greyfriars area. He speculated, "It is possible (though now perhaps unlikely) that at some time in the twenty-first century an excavator may yet reveal the slight remains of this famous monarch."

Although the Richard III Society remained interested in discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.

In 2004 and 2005, <a href="Philippa%20Langley">Philippa Langley</a>, secretary of the Scottish Branch of the Richard III Society, carried out research in Leicester in connection with a biographical Richard III screenplay and became convinced that the car park was the key location for investigation. In 2005, <a href="John%20Ashdown-Hill">John Ashdown-Hill</a> announced that he had discovered the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequence of Richard III after identifying two <a href="Matrilineality">matrilineal</a> descendants of Richard III's sister <a href="Anne%20of%20York%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Exeter">Anne of York</a>. He also concluded, from his knowledge of the layout of Franciscan priories, that the ruins of the priory church at Greyfriars were likely to lie under the car park and had not been built over. After hearing of his research, Langley urged Ashdown-Hill to contact the producers of <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>'s "<a href="Time%20Team">Time Team</a>" archaeology series to propose an excavation of the car park, but they declined as the dig would take longer than the standard three-day window for "Time Team" projects.

Three years later, writer Annette Carson, in her book "Richard III: The Maligned King" (2008), independently came to the conclusion that his body probably lay under the car park. She joined forces with Langley and Ashdown-Hill to carry out further research, in the course of which she found what she called a "smoking gun"—a medieval map of Leicester showing the Greyfriars Church at the north end of what was now the car park.

In February 2009, Langley, Carson and Ashdown-Hill teamed up with Richard III Society members Dr David Johnson and his wife Wendy to launch a project with the working title "Looking for Richard: In Search of a King", which Langley envisaged as a "landmark TV special". Its premise was a search for Richard's grave "while at the same time telling his real story", with an objective "to search for, recover and rebury his mortal remains with the honour, dignity and respect so conspicuously denied following his death at the battle of Bosworth."

The project gained the backing of several key partners—Leicester City Council, Leicester Promotions (responsible for tourist marketing), the University of Leicester, Leicester Cathedral, Darlow Smithson Productions (responsible for the planned TV show) and the Richard III Society. Funding for the initial phase of pre-excavation research came from the Richard III Society's bursary fund and members of the "Looking for Richard" project, with Leicester Promotions agreeing to pick up the £35,000 cost of the dig. The University of Leicester Archaeological Services—an independent body with offices at the university—was appointed as the project's archaeological contractor.

In March 2011 an assessment of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery had stood, and which land might be available for excavation. A desk-based assessment was conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using <a href="ground-penetrating%20radar">ground-penetrating radar</a> (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as pipes and cables.

Three possible excavation sites were identified: the staff car park of Leicester City Council <a href="Social%20Services">Social Services</a>, the disused playground of the former Alderman Newton's School and a public car park on New Street. It was decided to open two trenches in the Social Services car park, with an option for a third in the playground. Because most of the Greyfriars site had been built on, only seventeen per cent of its former area was available to excavate; the area to be investigated amounted to just one per cent of the site, owing to the limitations of the project's funding.

The proposed excavation was announced in the June 2012 issue of the Richard III Society's magazine, the "Ricardian Bulletin", but a month later one of the main sponsors pulled out leaving a £10,000 funding shortfall; an appeal resulted in members of the several Ricardian groups donating £13,000 in two weeks. A press conference held in Leicester on 24 August announced the start of the work. Archaeologist Richard Buckley admitted the project was a long shot: "We don't know precisely where the church is, let alone where the burial site is." He had earlier told Langley that he thought the odds were "fifty-fifty at best for [finding] the church, and nine-to-one against finding the grave."

Digging began the next day with a trench wide by long, running roughly north-south. A layer of modern building debris was removed before the level of the former monastery was reached. Two parallel human leg bones were discovered about from the north end of the trench at a depth of about , indicating an undisturbed burial. The bones were covered temporarily to protect them while excavations continued further along the trench. A second, parallel trench was dug next day to the south-west. Over the following days, evidence of medieval walls and rooms was uncovered, allowing the archaeologists to pinpoint the area of the friary. It became clear that the bones found on the first day lay inside the east part of the church, possibly the choir, where Richard was said to have been buried. On 31 August, the University of Leicester applied for a licence from the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Justice</a> to permit the exhumation of up to six sets of human remains. To narrow the search, it was planned that only the remains of men in their thirties, buried within the church, would be exhumed.

The bones found on 25 August were uncovered on 4 September and the grave soil dug back further over the next two days. The feet were missing, and the skull was found in an unusual propped-up position, consistent with the body being put into a grave that was slightly too small. The spine was curved in an S-shape. No sign of a coffin was found; the skeleton's posture suggested the body had not been put in a <a href="shroud">shroud</a>, but had been hurriedly dumped into the grave and buried. As the bones were lifted from the ground, a piece of rusted iron was found underneath the vertebrae. The skeleton's hands were in an unusual position, crossed over the right hip, suggesting they were tied together at the time of burial, although this could not be established definitively. After the exhumation, work continued in the trenches over the following week, before the site was covered with soil to protect it from damage and re-surfaced to restore the car park and playground to their former condition.

On 12 September, the University of Leicester team announced that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators were that the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it had severe <a href="scoliosis">scoliosis</a> of the spine possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. An object that appeared to be an arrowhead was found under the spine and the skull had severe injuries.

After the exhumation the emphasis shifted from the excavation to laboratory analysis of the bones that had been recovered. Ashdown-Hill had used <a href="genealogy">genealogical research</a> to track down matrilineal descendants of Anne of York, Richard's older sister, whose matrilineal line of descent is extant through her daughter <a href="Anne%20St%20Leger%2C%20Baroness%20de%20Ros">Anne St Leger</a>. Academic <a href="Kevin%20Sch%C3%BCrer">Kevin Schürer</a> subsequently traced a second individual in the same line.

Ashdown-Hill's research came about as a result of a challenge in 2003 to provide a DNA sequence for Richard's sister <a href="Margaret%20of%20York">Margaret</a>, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in <a href="Mechelen">Mechelen</a>, Belgium. He tried to extract a <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA%23Female%20inheritance">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequence from a preserved hair from <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward IV</a> held by the <a href="Ashmolean%20Museum">Ashmolean Museum</a> in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> but the attempt proved unsuccessful, owing to degradation of the DNA. Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of <a href="Cecily%20Neville%2C%20Duchess%20of%20York">Cecily Neville</a>, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born woman who had emigrated to Canada after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Joy Ibsen (née Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's mitochondrial DNA was tested and found to belong to <a href="Haplogroup%20J%20%28mtDNA%29">mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup J</a>, which by deduction should be Richard's mitochondrial DNA haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.

Joy Ibsen, a retired journalist, died in 2008, leaving three children: Michael, Jeff and Leslie. On 24 August 2012, her son Michael (born in Canada in 1957, a cabinet maker based in London) gave a mouth-swab sample to the research team to compare with samples from the human remains found at the excavation. Analysts found a mitochondrial DNA match between the exhumed skeleton, Michael Ibsen, and an unnamed second direct maternal line descendant, who shares a relatively rare mitochondrial DNA sequence, mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J1c2c.

The other living female-line relative of Richard III is Wendy Duldig, an Australian resident in England and a 19th-generation descendant of Anne of York. Duldig, who has no surviving children, is connected to the Ibsen family through Anne's granddaughter <a href="Robert%20Constable%20%28died%201558%29">Catherine Constable</a>, née Manners. Descendants of Constable, including one of Duldig's ancestors reportedly emigrated to New Zealand. Duldig's mitochondrial DNA is reportedly a close match, i.e. it features one mutation.

Despite the matching mitochondrial DNA, geneticist <a href="Turi%20King">Turi King</a> continued to pursue a link between the paternally-inherited <a href="Human%20Y-chromosome%20DNA%20haplogroup">Y-DNA</a> and that of descendants of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>. Four living male-line descendants of Gaunt have been located, and their results are a match to each other. The Y-DNA from the skeleton is somewhat degraded, but proved not to match any of the living male-line relatives, showing that a <a href="false-paternity%20event">false-paternity event</a> had happened somewhere in the 19 generations between Richard III and <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort</a>; work by Turi King and others has shown that historical rates of <a href="Non-paternity%20event">false paternity</a> are around 1–2% per generation.

Professor <a href="Michael%20Hicks%20%28historian%29">Michael Hicks</a>, a Richard III specialist, has been particularly critical of the use of the mitochondrial DNA to argue that the body is Richard III's, stating that "any male sharing a maternal ancestress in the direct female line could qualify". He also criticises the rejection by the Leicester team of the Y chromosome evidence, suggesting that it was not acceptable to the Leicester team to conclude that the skeleton was anyone other than Richard III. He argues that on the basis of the present scientific evidence "identification with Richard III is more unlikely than likely". However, Hicks himself draws attention to the contemporary view held by some that Richard III's grandfather, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, was the product of an illegitimate union between Cambridge's mother <a href="Isabella%20of%20Castile%2C%20Duchess%20of%20York">Isabella of Castile</a> (a bastard daughter of <a href="Peter%20of%20Castile">Pedro the Cruel of Castile</a>) and John Holland (brother in law of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV of England</a>), rather than <a href="Edmund%20of%20Langley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20York">Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York</a> (<a href="Edward%20III">Edward III</a>'s fourth son). If that was the case then the Y chromosome discrepancy with the Beaufort line would be explained but obviously still fail to prove the identity of the body. Hicks suggests alternative candidates descended from Richard III's maternal ancestress for the body (e.g. <a href="Thomas%20Percy%2C%201st%20Baron%20Egremont">Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont</a>, and <a href="John%20de%20la%20Pole%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lincoln">John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln</a>) but does not provide evidence to support his suggestions. <a href="Philippa%20Langley">Philippa Langley</a> refutes Hicks's argument on the grounds that he does not take into account all the evidence.

An <a href="osteology">osteological</a> examination of the bones by Jo Appleby showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, which may have been destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base of the back of the skull had been completely cut away by a bladed weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another bladed weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. Bladed weapons had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have either removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="Richard%20III%20%28play%29">Richard III</a>".

Taken together, the injuries appear to be a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with the legs and arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.

The head wounds are consistent with the narrative of a 1485 poem by <a href="Guto%27r%20Glyn">Guto'r Glyn</a> in which a Welsh knight, Sir <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Thomas">Rhys ap Thomas</a>, killed Richard and "shaved the boar's head". It had been thought that this was a figurative description of Richard being decapitated, but the skeleton's head had clearly not been severed. Guto's description may instead be a literal account of the injuries that Richard suffered, as the blows sustained to the head would have sliced away much of his scalp and hair and slivers of bone. Other contemporary sources refer explicitly to head injuries and the weapons used to kill Richard; the French chronicler <a href="Jean%20Molinet">Jean Molinet</a> wrote that "one of the Welshmen then came after him, and struck him dead with a <a href="halberd">halberd</a>", and the "Ballad of Lady Bessie" recorded that "they struck his <a href="bascinet">bascinet</a> to his head until his brains came out with blood." Such accounts would certainly fit the damage inflicted on the skull.

Sideways curvature of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has been attributed to adolescent-onset <a href="scoliosis">scoliosis</a>. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a <a href="hunchback">hunchback</a>. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.

Two <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a>s to find the age of the bones suggested dates of 1430–60 and 1412–49—both too early for Richard's death in 1485. <a href="Mass%20spectrometry">Mass spectrometry</a> carried out on the bones found evidence of much <a href="seafood">seafood</a> consumption, which is known to make radiocarbon dating samples appear older than they are. A <a href="Bayesian%20inference">Bayesian</a> analysis suggested there was a 68.2% probability that the true date of the bones was between 1475 and 1530, rising to 95.4% for between 1450 and 1540. Although by itself not enough to prove that the skeleton was Richard's, it was consistent with the date of his death. The mass spectrometry result indicating the rich seafood diet was confirmed by a chemical <a href="isotope%20analysis">isotope analysis</a> of two teeth, a femur and a rib. From the isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the teeth and bones the researchers discovered the diet included much freshwater fish and exotic birds such as <a href="swan">swan</a>, <a href="Crane%20%28bird%29">crane</a> and <a href="heron">heron</a>, and a vast quantity of wine — all items at the high end of the luxury market. Close analysis of the soil immediately below the skeleton revealed that the man had been infested with <a href="roundworm">roundworm</a> parasites when he died.

The excavators found an iron object under the skeleton's vertebrae and speculated it might be an arrowhead that had been embedded in its back. An <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> analysis showed it was a nail, probably of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romano-British</a> date, that by chance had been in the ground immediately under the grave or was in soil disturbed when it was dug and had nothing to do with the body.

On 4 February 2013, the University of Leicester confirmed that the skeleton was that of Richard III. The identification was based on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> evidence, soil analysis, and dental tests, and physical characteristics of the skeleton consistent with contemporary accounts of Richard's appearance. Osteoarchaeologist Jo Appleby commented: "The skeleton has a number of unusual features: its slender build, the scoliosis, and the battle-related trauma. All of these are highly consistent with the information that we have about Richard III in life and about the circumstances of his death."

<a href="Caroline%20Wilkinson">Caroline Wilkinson</a>, Professor of <a href="Craniofacial">Craniofacial</a> Identification at the <a href="University%20of%20Dundee">University of Dundee</a>, led the project to reconstruct the face, commissioned by the Richard III Society. On 11 February 2014, the University of Leicester announced a project headed by <a href="Turi%20King">Turi King</a> to sequence the entire genome of Richard III and Michael Ibsen—a direct female-line descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York—whose mitochondrial DNA confirmed the identification of the excavated remains. Richard III is thus the first ancient person with known historical identity whose genome has been sequenced. A study published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" in December 2014 confirmed a perfect whole-mitochondrial genome match between Richard's skeleton and Michael Ibsen and a near-perfect match between Richard and his other confirmed living relative. However, <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a> DNA inherited via the male line found no link with five other claimed living relatives, indicating that at least one "<a href="false-paternity">false-paternity</a> event" occurred in the generations between Richard and these men. One of these five was found to be unrelated to the other four, showing that another false-paternity event had occurred in the four generations separating them.

The story of the excavation and subsequent scientific investigation was told in a Channel 4 documentary, "Richard III: The King in the Car Park", broadcast on 4 February 2013. It proved a ratings hit for the channel, watched by up to 4.9 million viewers, and won a <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> award. Channel 4 subsequently screened a follow-up documentary on 27 February 2014, "Richard III: The Untold Story", which detailed the scientific and archaeological analyses that led to the identification of the skeleton as Richard III.
The site was re-excavated in July 2013 to learn more about the friary church, before building work on the adjacent disused school building. In a project co-funded by Leicester City Council and the University of Leicester, a single trench about twice the area of the 2012 trenches was excavated. It succeeded in exposing the entirety of the sites of the Greyfriars presbytery and choir sites, confirming archaeologists' earlier hypotheses about the layout of the church's east end. Three burials identified but not excavated in the 2012 project were tackled afresh. One burial was found to have been interred in a wooden coffin in a well-dug grave, while a second wooden-coffined burial was found under and astride the choir and presbytery; its position suggests that it pre-dates the church.

A stone coffin found during the 2012 excavation was opened for the first time, revealing a <a href="lead">lead</a> coffin inside. An investigation with an <a href="endoscope">endoscope</a> revealed the presence of a skeleton along with some head hair and fragments of a shroud and cord. The skeleton was at first assumed to be male, perhaps that of a knight called Sir William de Moton who was known to have been buried there, but later examination showed it to be of a woman—perhaps a high-ranking benefactress. She may not necessarily have been local, as lead coffins were used to transport corpses over long distances.

The University of Leicester's plan to inter Richard's body in <a href="Leicester%20Cathedral">Leicester Cathedral</a> was in keeping with British legal norms which hold that Christian burials excavated by archaeologists should be reburied in the nearest consecrated ground to the original grave and was a condition of the licence granted by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Justice</a> to exhume any human remains found during the excavation. The <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a> made no claim on the remains—Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> was reportedly consulted but rejected the idea of a royal burial—so the Ministry of Justice initially confirmed that the University of Leicester would make the final decision on where the bones should be re-buried. David Monteith, <a href="Chancellor%20%28ecclesiastical%29">Canon Chancellor</a> of Leicester Cathedral, said Richard's skeleton would be reinterred at the cathedral in early 2014 in a "Christian-led but ecumenical service", not a formal reburial but rather a service of remembrance, as a funeral service would have been held at the time of burial.

The choice of burial site proved controversial and proposals were made for Richard to be buried in places which some felt were more fitting for a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="House%20of%20York">Yorkist</a> monarch. Online petitions were launched calling for Richard to be buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, where 17 other English and British kings are interred; <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>, which some claimed was Richard's own preferred burial site; the Roman Catholic <a href="Arundel%20Cathedral">Arundel Cathedral</a>; or in the Leicester car park in which his body was found. Only two options received significant public support, with Leicester receiving 3,100 more signatures than York. The issue was discussed in the <a href="Houses%20of%20Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a>; the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MP and historian <a href="Chris%20Skidmore">Chris Skidmore</a> proposed that a <a href="state%20funerals%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">state funeral</a> should be held, while <a href="John%20Mann%20%28British%20politician%29">John Mann</a>, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> MP for <a href="Bassetlaw%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bassetlaw</a>, suggested that the body should be buried in <a href="Worksop">Worksop</a> in his constituency—halfway between York and Leicester. All options were rejected in Leicester, whose mayor <a href="Peter%20Soulsby">Peter Soulsby</a> retorted: "Those bones leave Leicester over my dead body."

After legal action brought by the "<a href="Plantagenet%20Alliance">Plantagenet Alliance</a>", a group representing claimed <a href="lineal%20descent">collateral descendants</a> of Richard, his final resting place remained uncertain for nearly a year. The group, which described itself as "his Majesty's representatives and voice", called for Richard to be buried in York Minster, which they claimed was his "wish". The <a href="Dean%20of%20Leicester">Dean of Leicester</a> called their challenge "disrespectful", and said that the cathedral would not invest any more money until the matter was decided. Historians said there was no evidence that Richard III wanted to be buried in York. Mark Ormrod of the <a href="University%20of%20York">University of York</a> expressed scepticism over the idea that Richard had devised any clear plans for his own burial. The standing of the Plantagenet Alliance was challenged. Mathematician <a href="Rob%20Eastaway">Rob Eastaway</a> calculated that Richard III may have millions of living collateral descendants, saying that "we should all have the chance to vote on Leicester versus York".

In August 2013 <a href="Charles%20Haddon-Cave">Justice Haddon-Cave</a> granted permission for a judicial review since the original burial plans ignored the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> duty "to consult widely as to how and where Richard III's remains should appropriately be reinterred". The judicial review opened on 13 March 2014 and was expected to last two days but the decision was deferred for four to six weeks. <a href="Heather%20Hallett">Lady Justice Hallett</a>, sitting with <a href="Duncan%20Ouseley">Justice Ouseley</a> and Justice Haddon-Cave, said the court would take time to consider its judgment. On 23 May the High Court ruled there was "no duty to consult" and "no public law grounds for the court to interfere", so reburial in Leicester could proceed. The litigation cost the defendants £245,000—far more than the cost of the original investigation.

In February 2013, Leicester Cathedral announced a procedure and timetable for the reinterment of Richard's remains. The cathedral authorities planned to bury him in a "place of honour" within the cathedral. Initial plans for a flat <a href="ledger%20stone">ledger stone</a>, perhaps modifying , proved unpopular. A <a href="table%20tomb">table tomb</a> was the most popular option among members of the Richard III Society and in polls of Leicester people. In June 2014 the design was announced, in the form of a table tomb of <a href="Swaledale">Swaledale</a> fossil stone. That month, that had stood in Leicester's Castle Gardens was moved to the redesigned Cathedral Gardens, which were reopened on 5 July 2014.

The reburial took place during a week of events between 22 and 27 March 2015. The sequence of events included:

After the discovery, Leicester City Council set up a temporary exhibition about Richard III in the city's medieval <a href="Leicester%20Guildhall">guildhall</a>. The council announced it would create a permanent attraction and subsequently spent £850,000 to buy the freehold of St Martin's Place, formerly part of <a href="Leicester%20Grammar%20School">Leicester Grammar School</a>, in Peacock Lane, across the road from the cathedral. The site adjoins the car park where the body was found, and overlies the chancel of Greyfriars Friary Church. It was converted into the £4.5 million <a href="King%20Richard%20III%20Visitor%20Centre">King Richard III Visitor Centre</a>, telling the story of Richard's life, death, burial and rediscovery, with <a href="artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artefacts</a> from the dig including Philippa Langley's <a href="Wellington%20boots">Wellington boots</a> and the hard hat and high-visibility jacket worn by archaeologist Mathew Morris on the day he found Richard's skeleton. Visitors can see the grave site under a glass floor. The council anticipated that the visitor centre, which opened in July 2014, would attract 100,000 visitors a year.

In Norway, archaeologist Øystein Ekroll hoped that the interest in the discovery of the English king would spill over to Norway. In contrast to England where, with the possible exception of <a href="Edward%20V%20of%20England">Edward V</a>, all the kings since the 11th century have now been discovered, in Norway about 25 medieval kings are buried in <a href="unmarked%20grave">unmarked grave</a>s around the country. Ekroll proposed to start with <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a>, who was probably buried anonymously in <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, beneath what is today a public road. A previous attempt to exhume Harald in 2006 was blocked by the <a href="Norwegian%20Directorate%20for%20Cultural%20Heritage">Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage</a> ("").

Richard Buckley of the University of Leicester Archaeological Services, who said he would "eat his hat" if Richard was discovered, fulfilled his promise by eating a hat-shaped cake baked by a colleague. Buckley later said:Cutting-edge research has been used in the project and the work has really only just begun. The discoveries, such as the very precise carbon dating and medical evidence, will serve as a benchmark for other studies. And it is, of course, an incredible story. He's a controversial figure; people love the idea he was found under a car park; the whole thing unfolded in the most amazing way. You couldn't make it up.

Some commentators suggested the discovery and subsequent positive exposure and good morale around the city contributed to <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City F.C.</a>'s shock <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> victory in 2016. A few days after the burial, Leicester City began a winning streak to take them from bottom of the league to comfortably avoiding relegation, and they went on to win the league the following year. Mayor <a href="Peter%20Soulsby">Peter Soulsby</a> said:For too long, people in Leicester have been modest about their achievements and the city they live in. Now – thanks first to the discovery of King Richard III and the Foxes' phenomenal season – it's our time to step into the international limelight. ... It has been said that we are somehow being repaid for burying Richard with honour in our cathedral.
The two events inspired <a href="Michael%20Morpurgo">Michael Morpurgo</a>'s 2016 children's book, "The Fox and the Ghost King", in which the ghost of Richard III promises to help the football team in return for being released from his car-park grave.

Norman Selfe

Norman Selfe (9 December 1839 – 15 October 1911) was an Australian engineer, <a href="naval%20architect">naval architect</a>, inventor, <a href="urban%20planning">urban planner</a> and outspoken advocate of technical education. After emigrating to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> with his family from England as a boy he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and transport systems. For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a> was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel <a href="cantilever%20bridge">cantilever bridge</a> across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.

Selfe was honoured during his life by the name of the Sydney suburb of <a href="Normanhurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Normanhurst</a>, where his grand house "<a href="Gilligaloola">Gilligaloola</a>" is a local landmark. He was energetically involved in organisations such as the <a href="Sydney%20Mechanics%27%20School%20of%20Arts">Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts</a> and the <a href="Australian%20Historical%20Society">Australian Historical Society</a>. As president of the <a href="Board%20of%20Technical%20Education">Board of Technical Education</a>, he fought consistently for the establishment of an independent system of technical education to serve the needs of a rapidly industrialising society. He was acknowledged upon his death as one of the best-known people in, and greatest individual influences upon, the city of Sydney.

Selfe came from a long line of inventors and engineers. Both sides of his family came from <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston upon Thames</a> in London, where one grandfather had owned a plumbing and engineering works. His father Henry was a plumber and inventor, whose high-pressure <a href="Fire%20hose">fire-fighting hose</a> was displayed at <a href="The%20Great%20Exhibition">The Great Exhibition</a> in London's <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a> in 1851. Selfe's cousin Edward Muggeridge grew up in the same town but moved to the United States in 1855, restyled himself <a href="Eadweard%20Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</a>, and achieved global fame as a pioneer in the new field of <a href="photography">photography</a>.
The Selfe family landed at Sydney's <a href="Semi-circular%20Quay">Semi-circular Quay</a> in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One of the reasons they emigrated to the colony of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> was to enable him and his brother Harry to undertake engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby <a href="The%20Rocks%2C%20Sydney">Rocks district</a> in a small house that had previously been the first Sydney home of <a href="Mary%20Reibey">Mary Reibey</a>, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and <a href="draughtsmanship">draughtsmanship</a> was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a <a href="velocipede">velocipede</a> in the country.

Selfe very quickly began his career as an engineer, taking <a href="Articled%20clerk">articles of apprenticeship</a> to the ironmaster <a href="Peter%20Nicol%20Russell">Peter Nicol Russell</a>, at whose firm he worked in several departments and eventually became its chief draughtsman. He would remain there until 1864. In 1859, when <a href="PN%20Russell%20%26amp%3B%20Co">PN Russell & Co</a> expanded to a site in Barker Street near the head of <a href="Darling%20Harbour">Darling Harbour</a>, Selfe drew up plans for the new works and the wharf, and oversaw their construction. In an address to the Engineering Section of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Royal Society of New South Wales</a> in 1900, Selfe recalled his work for Russell's:

While there [I] prepared plans for numbers of flour mills, and for the first ice-making machines, designing machinery for the multifarious requirements of colonial industries, many of which (such as sheep-washing and <a href="boiling%20down">boiling down</a>) no longer exist on the old lines.

While at Russell's, Selfe made several innovations in the design and construction of <a href="Dredging">dredges</a> for "deeping our harbours and rivers" – something of crucial importance to industry in early Sydney. He later recalled the success of "Pluto", one of his dredges purchased by the government:

[I]n this there were several novelties introduced, and among them, the ladder was lifted by hydraulic power instead of by a chain from a winch ... The day of the official trial ... was a proud one for [me], because during the course of the little festivities which followed their formal approval and official acceptance, [head engineer] Mr Dunlop pointedly remarked that "as she was all right, the credit must be given to his boy in the drawing office".

Selfe achieved international recognition in 1861 when leading British journal "<a href="The%20Engineer%20%28UK%20magazine%29">The Engineer</a>" published illustrations of his designs for one of the <a href="Refrigeration%23First%20refrigeration%20systems">first refrigerating machines</a>. One such machine was installed behind the Royal Hotel in <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Sydney">George Street</a> in Sydney's ice-works – one of the world's earliest commercial refrigeration plants. The decades following Selfe's arrival in Australia were watershed years in the development of refrigeration technology, and he was closely involved with its evolution. The introduction of refrigeration to the colony revolutionised farming, allowing the expansion of settlement, and made possible the export of meat and dairy products. In Sydney itself, refrigeration changed commercial practices and led to the eventual demise of city dairies. Selfe became an international authority on refrigeration engineering; he wrote articles and eventually a definitive textbook on the subject, published in the US in 1900.
After leaving Russell's, Selfe went into partnership with his former employer <a href="James%20Dunlop">James Dunlop</a>. They designed and built major installations for the <a href="Australasian%20Mineral%20Oil%20Company">Australasian Mineral Oil Company</a>, the <a href="Western%20Kerosene%20Oil%20Company">Western Kerosene Oil Company</a> and the <a href="Australian%20Gas%20Light%20Company">Australian Gas Light Company</a>. In 1869 Selfe was appointed to the senior post of "chief draftsman and scientific engineer" at <a href="Mort%27s%20Dock%20and%20Engineering%20Company">Mort's Dock and Engineering Company</a> in Balmain. In this role he oversaw the design and construction of the mail ship "<a href="SS%20Governor%20Blackall">SS Governor Blackall</a>", personally commissioned for the Queensland government by the Premier <a href="Charles%20Lilley">Charles Lilley</a> in 1869. The Sydney-built but Queensland-owned ship was an attempt to break what was later described as the "capricious monopoly" of the <a href="Australasian%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">Australasian Steam Navigation Company</a> on coastal trade and mail delivery from England. However, it ultimately caused the political downfall of Lilley as he had undertaken the contract without consulting his colleagues.
Selfe left Mort's in 1877 to practise as a consulting engineer at 141 <a href="Pitt%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Pitt Street</a>, gaining a reputation for versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884–85, where he visited engineering works and technical education facilities in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe set up a new office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street. He would later move to No. 279 where he operated the consultancy until his death in 1911. In the late 1890s he employed <a href="William%20Dixson">William Dixson</a> as an engineer, who would later make a major donation of <a href="Australiana">Australiana</a> to the <a href="State%20Library%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">State Library of New South Wales</a>. The collection of Selfe's own papers and drawings have since been donated to the same library that his former employee greatly augmented.

Selfe designed the hulls or the machinery for some 50 <a href="Steamship">steam vessels</a>, including two <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s for the New South Wales government, which he claimed were the fastest boats on the harbour for 20 years, and the "SS Wallaby", Sydney Harbour's first <a href="Propeller%20%28marine%29">double-ended screw</a> ferry. Double-ended hulls remain the design of Sydney's current "<a href="Freshwater%20class">Freshwater class</a>" ferries. He designed the first concrete quay wall in Sydney Harbour, and wharves for deep-sea vessels. He also designed the first ice-making machines in New South Wales, introduced the first <a href="elevator">lifts</a>, patented an improved system of <a href="Wool%20bale">baling wool</a> which increased capacity fourfold, and oversaw hydraulic and electric light installations in the city and the carriages on its <a href="Railways%20in%20Sydney">railway network</a>. He planned <a href="Mill%20%28grinding%29">mills</a>, <a href="waterworks">waterworks</a> and <a href="pumping%20station">pumping station</a>s, including the high-level pumps at the reservoir on <a href="Crown%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Crown Street</a>. He made major electric light installations at the <a href="Anthony%20Hordern%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Anthony Hordern & Sons</a> department store and the <a href="Hotel%20Australia">Hotel Australia</a>, and provided a hot-water system for the hotel. He designed machinery for factories, dairies and railways, including, in 1878, the <a href="Funicular">incline</a> of what is now the <a href="Katoomba%20Scenic%20Railway">Scenic Railway</a> attraction at <a href="Katoomba%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Katoomba</a> in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a> – which claims to be the world's steepest. Its original purpose was the transportation of coal from the <a href="Jamison%20Valley">Jamison Valley</a> to the cliff-top.

During his lifetime Selfe received both local and international recognition for his engineering skill. He had been president of both the Australian mechanical engineers' and naval architects' institutes as well as a member of both the British equivalent organisations. He was also elected a full member of the English <a href="Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a> and, by virtue of his writings also being published in Chicago, also an honorary member of an American engineering association.

Selfe's capacity for invention was not limited to the realm of machinery – he was also an energetic civic and urban reformer. He had high hopes for Sydney:
"Every well wisher of Sydney, who sees and understands what magnificent latent possibilities there are before her must hope that she will for all time be the Queen City of the Southern Hemisphere; and that the new century will open finding old ways departed from, and a glorious new era of progress, prosperity, morality and cleanliness installed in our midst. When that day arrives, we shall look back with curiosity and wonder at the continued blindness and negligence from which our city – so highly gifted by nature – had suffered so long."

From the time of Selfe's return in 1886 from two years' travel in the United States and Europe, he campaigned for improvements to the city of Sydney. These included proposals for a <a href="City%20Circle">city railway loop</a>, the redevelopment of the Rocks, and a bridge to the <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Sydney%29">North Shore</a>. His obituary in <a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> noted, "Mr. Selfe for over twenty years was a strenuous advocate of a circular city railway that should connect up the eastern, western, and northern suburbs of the city with the marine suburbs of the harbour, and stations adjacent to the ferries". He published plans and proposals elaborating on his ideas, and produced major articles with titles like "Sydney: past, present and possible" and "Sydney and its institutions, as they are, and might be from an engineer's point of view".

In 1887 Selfe published proposals for a city underground railway, with stations at <a href="Wynyard%2C%20Sydney">Wynyard</a>, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to <a href="Woolloomooloo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Woolloomooloo</a> and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20City%20and%20Suburban%20Railways">Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways</a> in 1890; but nothing was to come of it, largely because the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.

In 1908–09 he served as one of 11 expert commissioners to the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20for%20the%20Improvement%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Sydney%20and%20its%20Suburbs">Royal Commission for the Improvement of the City of Sydney and its Suburbs</a>. Selfe's proposals included an overhead <a href="Circular%20Quay%20railway%20station">railway station at Circular Quay</a> and major landscaping works at <a href="Belmore%20Park">Belmore Park</a> opposite Central Railway Station. Both of these visions were later realised, but not in his lifetime.

By the late 1890s a harbour crossing and a city railway extension were again on the agenda. The <a href="Lyne%20ministry">Lyne government</a> committed to building the new Central Railway Station, and organised a worldwide competition for the design and construction of a <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Harbour Bridge</a>. Selfe submitted a design for a <a href="suspension%20bridge">suspension bridge</a> estimated to cost £1,128,000 and won the second prize of £500. The first prize went to C. E. W. Crutwell, of <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> with a design estimated to cost more than twice as much. After the outcome of the competition had become mired in controversy, in 1902 Selfe won a second competition outright, with a design for a steel <a href="cantilever%20bridge">cantilever bridge</a> stretching from <a href="Dawes%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dawes Point</a> to <a href="McMahons%20Point%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">McMahons Point</a>. The selection board were unanimous, commenting that "The structural lines are correct and in true proportion, and ... the outline is graceful".

Construction of Selfe's version of the Sydney harbour bridge never started due to an economic slowdown and a change of government at the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election%2C%201904">1904 state election</a>. Much to Selfe's outrage, the <a href="NSW%20Public%20Works">Department of Public Works</a> kept his calculations and drawings, and also copied and printed them. Eventually in 1907, the department contacted Selfe and asked him to collect his drawings, but refused to return the calculations. Selfe was never given the £1,100 prize, nor was he paid for his subsequent work which he estimated to be worth more than £20,000.
Among the Selfe family papers in <a href="State%20Library%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Mitchell Library</a> there is a large collection of postcards featuring bridges from across the world. Some were sent to Selfe by friends and relatives from Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Others, <a href="postmark">un-postmarked</a>, were collected on his travels in 1884-85. These would have formed a research catalogue of contemporary international bridge-building practices for Selfe's own designs.

In 1908, Selfe presented new proposals based upon the old design to the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Communication%20between%20Sydney%20and%20North%20Sydney">Royal Commission on Communication between Sydney and North Sydney</a>. However, this time the commissioners preferred a tunnel scheme; again, no work proceeded. Agitation for a bridge was renewed with the election of a Labor government at the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election%2C%201910">1910 state election</a>. But with Selfe's death in 1911, it was time for a new generation of bridge builders. In 1912 the government appointed <a href="J.J.%20Bradfield">J.J. Bradfield</a> as "engineer-in-chief of Sydney Harbour Bridge and City Transit"; the <a href="call%20for%20tenders">call for tenders</a> for constructing the bridge was not made until a decade later. Over the following decades, versions of what Selfe had much earlier articulated for a city circle railway link and a bridge to the north shore were realised. Selfe's contribution received little public or formal recognition.

Selfe was founding vice-president of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Historical%20Society">Australian Historical Society</a> in 1901, serving with president <a href="Andrew%20Houison">Andrew Houison</a> and patron <a href="David%20Scott%20Mitchell">David Scott Mitchell</a> (after whom the Mitchell wing of the State Library of New South Wales is named). He remained actively involved in the society for 10 years, despite what he called "the evident lack of interest ... taken in the proceedings of the Society" by the general public in the early years. The society got off to a shaky start, with low attendance of lectures and meetings. Early papers delivered by Selfe included "A century of Sydney Cove" and "Some notes on the Sydney windmills". Slowly, interest increased, and by 1905 membership had reached 100. Known as the Royal Australian Historical Society (RAHS) since 1918, and housed in a grand <a href="Victorian%20architecture%23Australia">Victorian</a> style <a href="townhouse">townhouse</a> on <a href="Macquarie%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Macquarie Street</a>, the organisation is Australia's oldest historical society; Selfe is celebrated as one of its pioneers.

Selfe was a key figure in the history of technical education in New South Wales. He advocated a more utilitarian and less literary education system, to produce a skilled workforce that could realise Australia's potential as an efficient industrial state. He was utopian in his vision:

There is no doubt that it is on the work of tools directed by brains that the future of Australia depends more than anything else. With tools our Australian deserts may be turned into gardens ... They will pluck the hidden treasure from the bowels of the earth, enable us to soar in the air, or explore the depths of the water. They will weave a network of communication over our island continent, dot it with the homes of a happy people, and minister to our wants in providing not only the necessities and comforts of life, but the most refined luxuries that are needed to satisfy the novel and exacting wants which arise every day, as the standard of intellectual and technical cultivation is raised and extended among us ...

Selfe believed an overhaul of education was needed, from kindergarten to tertiary study. His concept of technical education encompassed <a href="Friedrich%20Fr%C3%B6bel">Friedrich Fröbel</a>'s kindergarten activities based around play and occupations; the teaching of drawing, manual work and science in schools; and specialised practical training of workmen and professionals in technical colleges. He argued for the establishment of a new kind of university – an "industrial university", less theory-oriented and more concerned with the practical and the useful. He saw technical education as a distinct sphere of education to be administered and delivered by people with practical industry experience, not government officials or traditional teachers.

As early as 1865 Selfe gave regular classes in mechanical drawing to tradesmen at the <a href="Sydney%20Mechanics%27%20School%20of%20Arts">Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts</a> in Pitt Street. Selfe's class in <a href="mechanical%20drawing">mechanical drawing</a> was the first technical, vocational offering at the School of Arts, and its popularity led to the introduction of other practical subjects.

Due to the colony's rapidly expanding population and demand for skilled labour, there were increasing calls in the 1870s for a formal system of technical education. In 1870, Selfe helped found the Engineering Association of New South Wales which amalgamated into <a href="Engineers%20Australia">Engineers Australia</a> in 1919. He was its president from 1877 to 1879 and Engineers Australia annually awards the "Norman Selfe Medal" to a student at the <a href="Australian%20Maritime%20College">Australian Maritime College</a>. In 1878, the association joined forces with the <a href="Labor%20Council%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales Trades and Labour Council</a> and the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts to form the Technical and Working Men's College. The College initially operated as an agency of the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts. The college occupied premises in Pitt, Sussex and Castlereagh Streets, and rooms in the Royal Arcade, before it moved to Ultimo in 1889. The college later became the <a href="Sydney%20Technical%20College">Sydney Technical College</a> out of which grew the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Technology%2C%20Sydney">University of Technology, Sydney</a>, and the <a href="National%20Art%20School">National Art School</a>. The Ultimo buildings still serve their original purpose, now as the main campus of the <a href="Sydney%20Institute%20of%20TAFE">Sydney Institute of TAFE</a>.

In 1880, Selfe became vice president of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead for the establishment of a proper institute of technical education, where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of technical education facilities into the suburban and regional districts.

On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales government made a proclamation which transferred control of the Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.

Many of the board's initiatives were based on observations made abroad by Selfe and board president Edward Combes, or recommendations made by the <a href="British%20Royal%20Commission%20into%20Technical%20Education">British Royal Commission into Technical Education</a> of 1881–84. However, most of the board's schemes were frustrated by an unresponsive colonial government. Norm Neill, historian of the early years of the Sydney Technical College, argues that the Board caused many of its own problems:

There was a marked lack of unity ... Members either resigned or became inactive [and the Board failed] to accept that its autonomy was more nominal than real. Any expansion of technical education was dependent on government funding and governments were unlikely to allocate resources to an organisation unwilling or unable to cooperate.

Selfe was president of the Board from January 1887 until it was disbanded in 1889. During this time the relationship between the board and the government deteriorated with Selfe being overtly critical of two powerful institutions: the newly formed <a href="Department%20of%20Public%20Instruction%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Department of Public Instruction</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. Selfe strongly opposed the government's taking control of technical education, which had been underway since the government first declared its interest in doing so at a special meeting of the Sydney Mechanics School of Arts in September 1883. He also did not support an alternative proposal that the University of Sydney should take over. In an address at the annual presentation of prizes at Sydney Technical College in 1887, Selfe alienated the <a href="Minister%20for%20Public%20Instruction%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Public Instruction</a> and others by being openly contemptuous of the traditional pursuits of schools and universities:

[T]he whole experience of the past goes to show that the learning of the schools has had little, if anything, to do with the material advancement of the world, and that while it may have produced intellectual giants, subjective teaching has not brought forth those men who have been inventors and manufacturers that have entirely changed the character of our civilisation.

Selfe criticised the classical <a href="liberal%20arts%20education">liberal arts education</a> offered at the University of Sydney as elitist. In his 1888 address to Sydney Technical College students on prize night, he again caused affront to the establishment when he called for greater diversity of educational opportunities in the colony:

[I]t is not ... easy ... to see why the general public should pay so many thousands a year to make our future professional men in medicine and law in the colony, to form part of the so-called upper classes, when our "principles" will not allow us to pay just a little more in order to have, say, our locomotives made here, and when we are doing so very little, proportionately, to train and educate the artisans who make these locomotives, and who belong to a much less wealthy and influential level in society.

In 1889 the colonial government, already in financial control, assumed direct operational control by abolishing the Board and placing the College within the Technical Education Branch of the Department of Public Instruction (now the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Department%20of%20Education">New South Wales Department of Education</a>).

In the early years of the 20th century, education remained a major political issue in New South Wales. While Selfe would not be drawn again into the centre of the fray, he supported the efforts of his sister <a href="Maybanke%20Anderson">Maybanke</a> and her second husband <a href="Francis%20Anderson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Anderson</a> towards education reform. Following the Knibbs-Turner <a href="Royal%20Commission%20into%20New%20South%20Wales%20Education">Royal Commission into New South Wales Education</a> in 1902, and the appointment of Peter Board as Director of Education in 1905, many of Selfe's ideas for technical education were implemented. Ultimately, in 1949, a separate Department of Technical Education was created, and the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20University%20of%20Technology">New South Wales University of Technology</a> (later the University of New South Wales) was established at <a href="Kensington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kensington</a>.

Les Mandelson, historian of Australia's education systems, categorises Selfe as "a nineteenth century protagonist for the New Education", who helped pave the way for the extensive reforms of the twentieth century. "Without him", he adds, "education in the late nineteenth century would have been decidedly more mundane". However, Mandelson sounds a critical note:

Selfe's contempt for the liberal arts tradition and the priority he accorded practical skill have certain implications which cannot be commended. These reflected and augmented ... one of the less attractive features of the Australian ethos – indifference to higher learning and advanced attainments, an indifference shading into contempt and suspicion ... Selfe may have lost a battle but before long, the liberal arts tradition faced still greater defeats. To these, Selfe certainly contributed, and what must be recognised is that in the vehemence of the struggle, and in the lauding of efficiency over culture, much that was valuable in the liberal arts tradition was lost.

Biographer <a href="Stephen%20Murray-Smith">Stephen Murray-Smith</a> is more generous in his assessment of Selfe's contribution to education debates around the turn of the twentieth century: "Selfe went beyond the concept of helping the working man to achieve a share of the good things hitherto reserved for others, towards the concept of leading him to create good things for himself."

Selfe was a noted activist for the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation of Australia</a> being a member of the Central Federation League. Edward Dowling, his colleague on the inaugural board of the Australian Historical Society, was also the Secretary of the Central League of the Australasian Federation League and his former <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> engineer <a href="John%20Jacob%20Cohen">John Jacob Cohen</a> would later be elected at the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20colonial%20election%2C%201898">1898 New South Wales election</a> in the seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Petersham">Petersham</a> representing the <a href="Protectionist%20Party">National Federal Party</a>.

When Selfe obtained a steady job after his apprenticeship, he brought his family with him from The Rocks to live at <a href="Balmain%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Balmain</a>. Selfe bought waterfront land and built twin <a href="terraced%20house">terraced house</a>s called "Normanton" and "Maybank", which are still at 21 and 23 Wharf Road, <a href="Birchgrove%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Birchgrove</a>. It is likely that Selfe shared Normanton with his widowed mother. Next door lived his brother Harry, his sister Maybanke and his brother-in-law Edmund Wolstenholme.

Selfe was a supportive brother, both emotionally and materially. His sister Maybanke bore seven children to her first husband Edmund, four of whom died as infants from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. He also provided financial support after Maybanke's marriage came to an end. Maybanke earned fame in her own right as a prominent suffragist and pioneer of education for women and girls. In the 1890s brother and sister campaigned together for education reform.
On 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe married Emily Ann Booth, the daughter of <a href="John%20Booth%20%281822-1898%29">John Booth</a>, a well-known shipbuilder and Balmain's first mayor (and formerly the member for <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20East%20Macquarie">East Macquarie</a> in the colonial parliament). They lived for many years at "Rockleigh" in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been demolished. In 1884 their first daughter Rhoda Jane was born, followed by a <a href="Stillbirth">stillborn</a> daughter in 1886, and then Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe bought land in <a href="Ashfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Ashfield</a> and designed a grand house called "Amesbury". Described at the time as having “more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in the colony” including terracotta <a href="lyrebird">lyrebird</a> reliefs by artist <a href="Lucien%20Henry">Lucien Henry</a> on the front wall, and a tower purpose-built for Selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy. Built around 1888 to honour the centenary of the colony, "Amesbury" still stands at 78 Alt Street and was used by <a href="Brahma%20Kumaris">Brahma Kumaris</a> from 1986 as its Australian headquarters until 2014 when it was auctioned for over $3.5 million. As children, Rhoda and Norma attended their Aunt Maybanke's school in <a href="Dulwich%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dulwich Hill</a>. As adults, they trained in Italy with educator <a href="Maria%20Montessori">Maria Montessori</a> and returned to Sydney to open a <a href="Montessori%20school">Montessori school</a> of their own in the building known as "Warwick" on Bland Street, Ashfield.

Around 1894, the family moved, this time to <a href="Hornsby%20Shire">Hornsby Shire</a>, where a new Selfe-designed house, "Gilligaloola", was built on purchased by Selfe ten years earlier. Situated at what is now 82 <a href="Pennant%20Hills%20Road">Pennant Hills Road</a>, the house is still a local landmark, notable for its distinctive tower and twin chimneys. Selfe was a committed citizen and a natural spokesman for the local community, to the extent that when the railways needed a name for the locality, the community chose "<a href="Normanhurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Normanhurst</a>" (though Selfe himself felt that "St Normans" would have been "much more elegant and suggestive").

On 12 May 1906, four years after the death of his first wife, Selfe married Marion Bolton at <a href="St%20Philip%27s%20Church%2C%20Sydney">St Philip's Church, Sydney</a>.

Selfe died suddenly on 15 October 1911. His death certificate states the cause of death as "heart failure brought on by exertion". His daughter Norma offered some context to a journalist in 1957. She said:
"On the day of his death he climbed trees in the church grounds to lop branches, as the gardener was too nervous to climb so high. That night he died in his sleep."

Norma reported that her father had been sanguine to the end, playful with his nephews and learning to play the oboe. However, other reports suggest that Selfe was concealing a bitter sense of disappointment at the end of his life, most particularly over the Harbour Bridge affair. His obituary in the journal "<a href="Building%20%28magazine%29">Building</a>" concluded:

... [T]here is none today who can replace the noble personality, that keen energetic brain ever ready to give of its wonderful store of knowledge, and that happy spirit ever bright, ever optimistic, even though crushed beneath the cruel and unjust blow of the non-acceptance of his prize design for the North Shore bridge. "It will crown my life" he said. We will always remember the bright gleam in his eyes as they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called "God's noblest waterway".

Selfe's funeral was held at St Paul's Church, <a href="Wahroonga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wahroonga</a>, where he had been a <a href="churchwarden">churchwarden</a>. He was buried in <a href="Gore%20Hill%20cemetery">Gore Hill cemetery</a> in the presence of a large gathering of businessmen and representatives of the organisations he had been involved with. He was survived by his two daughters from his first marriage, Rhoda and Norma, and his second wife, Marion. His estate was valued for <a href="probate">probate</a> at nearly £5000. Twenty-one years later, on 11 March 1932 Marion's charred body was found in her new house, also in Normanhurst where she lived alone, having reportedly set fire to her clothes when lighting a candle. Marion was buried alongside Norman in plot CE I:7. Rhoda's ashes were also placed nearby when she died aged 69 in 1954, still living in "Gilligaloola".

The Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar was a <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a>. Bearing portraits of former U.S. Presidents <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> and <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, the coin was issued in commemoration of the centennial of the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> and was produced at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> in 1923. Sculptor <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a> is credited with the design, although the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> closely resembles an earlier work by <a href="Raphael%20Beck%20%28artist%29">Raphael Beck</a>.

In 1922, the motion picture industry was faced with a number of scandals, including manslaughter charges against star <a href="Roscoe%20Arbuckle">Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle</a>. Although Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, motion picture executives sought ways of getting good publicity for Hollywood. One means was an exposition, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923. To induce Congress to issue a commemorative coin as a fundraiser for the fair, organizers associated the exposition with the 100th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, and legislation for a commemorative half dollar for the centennial was passed.

The exposition was a financial failure. The coins did not sell well, and the bulk of the mintage of over 270,000 was released into circulation. Beach faced accusations of plagiarism because of the similarity of the reverse design to a work by Beck, though he and fellow sculptor <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> denied any impropriety. Many of the pieces that had been sold at a premium and saved were spent during <a href="Great%20Depression">the Depression</a>; most surviving coins show evidence of wear.

In the early 1820s, the United States deemed two matters untoward interference by European powers in its zone of influence. The first was the Russian <a href="Ukase%20of%201821">Ukase of 1821</a>, asserting exclusive territorial and trading rights along much of what is today Canada's Pacific coast. The United States considered this area to be part of the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a> and hoped to eventually gain control of it. The second was possible European threats against the <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n nations, newly independent from Spain. United States officials feared that a <a href="Quadruple%20Alliance%20%281815%29">Quadruple Alliance</a> of Prussia, Austria, Russia, and France would restore Spain to power in the Americas.
<a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">British foreign minister</a> <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> was concerned that in the event of a Spanish restoration in Latin America, his nation would lose the trade which it had gained there since the Spanish had been ousted. In 1823, he proposed to the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">American minister to Great Britain</a>, <a href="Richard%20Rush">Richard Rush</a>, that their two nations issue a joint statement against the retaking of the former Spanish colonies by force. Rush asked for instructions from President <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>. The President consulted with his predecessors, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, who favored the joint statement, as an alliance with Britain would protect the United States. Nevertheless, Monroe's <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>, future president <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, felt that if the United States was going to set forth its principles, it should speak for itself and not seem to be following the lead of powerful Britain. Accordingly, Rush was instructed to decline the opportunity to enter into a joint statement, although he was to inform the British that the two nations agreed on most issues.

The policy which would, some 30 years later, come to be called the "Monroe Doctrine" was contained in the President's <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message to Congress</a> on December 2, 1823. It warned European nations against new colonial ventures in the Americas, and against interference with Western Hemisphere governments. The doctrine had little practical effect at the time, as the United States lacked the ability to enforce it militarily and most European powers ignored it, considering it beneath their dignity even to respond. When Britain and other powers seized additional land in <a href="the%20Guianas">the Guianas</a> in the 1830s, the United States did not issue a formal protest. The <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> of 1846–1848 increased Latin American suspicions over the doctrine, as many south of the border felt that the American purpose in warning European powers to keep out was to reserve the land for itself. Nevertheless, the Monroe Doctrine became an important part of United States foreign policy in the second half of the 19th and into the 20th century.

By 1922, the Hollywood film industry was in serious trouble. Established in the Los Angeles area during the 1910s after moving from such eastern venues as <a href="Fort%20Lee%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fort Lee, New Jersey</a>, the industry had been rocked by a number of scandals. These included the mysterious shooting death of film director <a href="William%20Desmond%20Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</a>, and the subsequent evasive testimony concerning it by actress <a href="Mabel%20Normand">Mabel Normand</a>, which helped destroy her career. Another notorious scandal of the early 1920s was the death of actress <a href="Virginia%20Rappe">Virginia Rappe</a> following an orgy at a San Francisco hotel. Actor <a href="Fatty%20Arbuckle">Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle</a> was, after three trials, acquitted of manslaughter, but the negative publicity ended his career as well. These scandals, together with the death of romantic lead <a href="Wallace%20Reid">Wallace Reid</a> from a drug overdose and a number of instances of onscreen sexual explicitness, led to nationwide calls for a boycott of Hollywood films.

Film moguls sought means of damage control. They hired former <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> <a href="Will%20H.%20Hays">Will H. Hays</a> as censor to the industry; the <a href="Hays%20Code">Hays Code</a> would govern how explicit a motion picture could be for decades to come. Another idea was an exposition and film festival to give good publicity to the industry, with the profits to be used for the making of educational films. Planning for this fair, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923, began in 1922. As other fairs, such as the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a> and the <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20Exposition">Panama–Pacific Exposition</a>, had procured the issuance of commemorative coins as a fundraiser, organizers sought a piece for the film fair. The city of Los Angeles wanted to use the fair to show it had come of age, as had Chicago for the Columbian Exposition and San Francisco with the Panama-Pacific event.

Realizing that Congress might not pass legislation for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event with a major anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. The obvious candidate was the <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a> of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles". On December 18, 1922, California Congressman <a href="Walter%20Franklin%20Lineberger">Walter Franklin Lineberger</a> introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, out of the hands of European powers. The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman <a href="Louis%20Cramton">Louis Cramton</a>, and in the Senate by Vermont's <a href="Frank%20L.%20Greene">Frank Greene</a>, who stated, "it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The question is whether the United States government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January 24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000 pieces was authorized.

The fair organizers did not await congressional approval to begin planning the coin. According to Swiatek and Breen, the fair's director general Frank B. Davison came up with the concept for the designs. On December 7, 1922, <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> chairman <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles Moore</a> wrote to <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a> designer and sculptor member of the commission <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, "The Los Angeles people are planning to celebrate the Monroe Doctrine Centennial. They are going to have a 50-cent piece and have decided that on the obverse shall be the heads of President Monroe and John Quincy Adams ... On the reverse will be the western continents from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn with some dots for the West Indies and some indication of the Panama Canal ... It strikes me that the designs having been settled upon, the [plaster] models could be worked out quite readily and that a pretty swell thing could be made."

Fraser contacted fellow New York sculptor <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>, who agreed to do the work. On December 27, Moore wrote to Davison, informing him of Beach's hiring, and that Fraser and Beach had decided to change the reverse. Moore quoted Beach's description of the revised design:

Moore informed Davison that the commission had concurred with the revision, and that Beach had been instructed to complete work as quickly as possible so as to have the coins available at an early date. On February 24, 1923, commission secretary Hans Caemmerer showed the completed models to Assistant Director of the Mint <a href="Mary%20Margaret%20O%27Reilly">Mary Margaret O'Reilly</a>, who was pleased with them. O'Reilly suggested that if Beach was certain there would be no further changes, that he send photographs of the models to the commission's offices, to be forwarded with its endorsement to the Bureau of the Mint in Washington. This was done, and the designs were approved by both Mint Director <a href="Frank%20Edgar%20Scobey">Frank Edgar Scobey</a> and Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Andrew%20Mellon">Andrew Mellon</a> on March 8. Moore was enthusiastic about the designs, writing to Davison on March 21 that "I feel great exultation over the way the model ... has turned out ... I do not know of a memorial [commemorative] coin which for sheer beauty equals this ..."

William E. Pike, in his 2003 article in "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" about the coin, deems the design "uninspired" and complains that the low relief of the coin leaves it without sufficient detail. Coin dealer and numismatic historian <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> states that because of the shallow relief, "newly minted coins had an insipid appearance. Few if any observers called them attractive." Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> also complained about the relief, stating that it made the allegorical figures on the reverse "seem like mounted cut-outs ... the way the females are contoured to achieve their appearance of continents is a clever tour de force of calligraphic relief but an aesthetic monstrosity, a bad pun in art." He had no more praise for the obverse, "Adams, with his staring eye, is scarcely a portrait, and Monroe would not be recognized even by an expert."
The faint lines in the field around the continents represent various ocean currents, with the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> to the upper right of the reverse. Swiatek and Breen speculate that the reason ocean currents were shown was to symbolize the trade routes between the continents. They also consider the design to have an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> look, though noting that the lettering has more of an older, <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> appearance. Beach's <a href="monogram">monogram</a>, CB made into a circle, is found at lower right of the reverse.

On July 23, 1923, <a href="Raphael%20Beck%20%28artist%29">Raphael Beck</a>, who had designed the seal for the 1901 <a href="Pan-American%20Exposition">Pan-American Exposition</a>, wrote to Mint Director Scobey to complain that the reverse design resembled his seal, which he had copyrighted in 1899, and that Beach should be given no further credit for it. The letter was forwarded to the Commission of Fine Arts for comment. In October, Fraser wrote to Beck, stating that he had suggested to Beach that he use figures to represent the continents instead of maps, and that he had never seen the Pan-American seal until Scobey forwarded the letter. According to Bowers, "A comparison of the 1901 and 1923 designs, however, shows that this was highly unlikely."

In May and June 1923, 274,077 of the new half dollars were struck at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>. Most of these were sent to the Los Angeles Clearing House, though 77 pieces were set aside for transmission to Philadelphia and examination by the 1924 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>.
The American Historical Revue and Motion Picture Industry Exposition was open from July 2 to August 4, 1923. The fair was located off of Figueroa Street in <a href="Exposition%20Park%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Exposition Park</a>, just to the east of the brand-new <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Coliseum</a>, where every evening a complimentary show for exposition visitors, "Montezuma and the Fall of the Aztecs", was given. Admission to the fair was fifty cents, though fairgoers could purchase a coin for a dollar at the box office and enter without further charge. After the first week, organizers realized the public was not interested in the historical theme, but was there to see favorite movie stars. Exhibitors accordingly greatly expanded the space devoted to movie attractions, but the exposition was a financial failure. Those in charge of the fair had hoped to attract a million visitors; the actual attendance was about 300,000, many of whom were teenagers given complimentary admission in the final two weeks of the fair. With the fair flirting with insolvency throughout its run, officials hoped the planned visit of President <a href="Warren%20Harding">Warren Harding</a> on August 6 would increase gate receipts, but Harding fell ill in San Francisco and died on August 2. According to Pike in his article, "its effect on the industry [was] hard to measure. However, if Hollywood owes its current status in any way to the event, then it was quite a success indeed."

Approximately 27,000 half dollars were sold at the price of $1, by mail, at banks, and at the fair. Sales continued after it closed, but by October 1923, they had dropped off to almost nothing, and the banks holding them released the remaining nine-tenths of the mintage into circulation, which accounts for the wear on most surviving specimens. Of those set aside, thousands more were spent during <a href="Great%20Depression">the Depression</a>. The 2015 edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists it at $75 in <a href="uncirculated%20MS-60">uncirculated MS-60</a>. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, notes that many specimens have been treated to make them appear brighter or less worn; these, like other circulated pieces, are worth less. An exceptional specimen, certified in MS-67 condition, sold at auction for $29,900 in 2009.

Throffer

In <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a>, a throffer is a proposal (also called an intervention) that mixes an offer with a threat which will be carried out if the offer is not accepted. The term was first used in print by political philosopher <a href="Hillel%20Steiner">Hillel Steiner</a>; while other writers followed, it has not been universally adopted and it is sometimes considered synonymous with "<a href="carrot%20and%20stick">carrot and stick</a>". Though the threatening aspect of a throffer need not be obvious, or even articulated at all, an overt example is

Kill this man and receive £100; fail to kill him and I'll kill you.

Steiner differentiated offers, threats and throffers based on the preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject when compared to the normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable than it would have been were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of <a href="coercion">coercion</a>, and form part of the question of the possibility of <a href="coercive%20offer">coercive offer</a>s. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.

The theoretical concerns surrounding throffers have been practically applied concerning <a href="workfare">workfare</a> programmes. In such systems, individuals receiving <a href="social%20welfare">social welfare</a> have their aid decreased if they refuse the offer of work or education. <a href="Robert%20Goodin">Robert Goodin</a> criticised workfare programmes which presented throffers to individuals receiving welfare, and was responded to by Daniel Shapiro, who found his objections unconvincing. Several writers have also observed that throffers presented to people convicted of crimes, particularly sex offenders, can result in more lenient sentences if they accept medical treatment. Other examples are offered by psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez, who presents concerns about throffers in <a href="community%20psychiatry">community psychiatry</a>, and management expert John J. Clancey, who talks about throffers in employment.

The term "throffer" is a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "threat" and "offer". It was first used by Canadian philosopher <a href="Hillel%20Steiner">Hillel Steiner</a> in a 1974–75 "<a href="Proceedings%20of%20the%20Aristotelian%20Society">Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society</a>" article. Steiner had considered a quote from the 1972 film "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>": "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". While the line seemed to be amusingly ironic (because a threat is being made, not an offer), Steiner was unsatisfied that the difference between an offer and a threat was merely that one promises to confer a benefit and the other a penalty. He thus coined "throffer" to describe the "offer" in "The Godfather". One prominent thinker who adopted the term was political scientist <a href="Michael%20Taylor%20%28political%20scientist%29">Michael Taylor</a>, and his work on throffers has been frequently cited.

"Throffer" has not, however, been universally adopted; Michael R. Rhodes notes that there has been some controversy in the literature on whether to use "throffer", citing a number of writers, including Lawrence A. Alexander, David Zimmerman and Daniel Lyons, who do not use the term. Some, including political scientists Deiniol Jones and Andrew Rigby, consider "throffer" to be synonymous with "<a href="carrot%20and%20stick">carrot and stick</a>", an idiom which refers to the way a donkey is offered a carrot to encourage compliance, while noncompliance is punished with a stick. Other writers, while electing to use the word, consider it a poor one. For instance, literary scholar Daniel Shore calls it "a somewhat unfortunate term", while using it in his analysis of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Regained">Paradise Regained</a>".

In addition to Steiner's original account of throffers, other authors have suggested definitions and ideas on how to differentiate throffers from threats and offers.

In the article that introduces the term "throffer", Steiner considers the difference between interventions in the form of a threat and those in the form of an offer. He concludes that the distinction is based on how the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ for the subject of the intervention when compared with "the norm". Steiner observes that a concept of "normalcy" is presupposed in literature on coercion, as changes in well-being for the subject of an intervention are not merely relative, but absolute; any possibility of an absolute change requires a standard, and this standard is "the description of the normal and preducable course of events, that is, the course of events which would confront the recipient of the intervention were the intervention not to occur".

For an offer, such as "you may use my car whenever you like", the consequence of compliance "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer of the use of the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with "<a href="Highwayman">your money or your life</a>", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.

For Steiner, all of offers, threats and throffers affect the <a href="Practical%20reason">practical deliberations</a> of their recipient in the same way. What is significant for the subject of the intervention is not the extent to which the consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention depends upon the difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.

Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens provides examples of what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives an example of an intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone who makes the demand "either you accept my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.

In its place, Stevens suggests that determining whether an intervention is a throffer depends not on the desirability of compliance and noncompliance when compared to the norm, but on the desirability of the actions entailed in compliance or noncompliance when compared with what their desirability would have been were no intervention made. He proposes that a throffer is made if P attempts to encourage Q to do A by increasing "the desirability to Q of Q doing A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal and decrease the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A relative to what it would have been if P made no proposal". An offer, by contrast, increases the desirability to Q of Q doing A compared to how it would have been without P's intervention, leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A as it would have been. A threat decreases the desirability to Q of Q doing not-A compared to what it would have been without P's intervention, while leaving the desirability to Q of Q doing A as it would have been.

Political philosopher <a href="Kristj%C3%A1n%20Kristj%C3%A1nsson">Kristján Kristjánsson</a> differentiates threats and offers by explaining that the former is a proposal that creates an obstacle, while the latter is one kind of proposal (another example being a request) that does not. He also draws a distinction between "tentative proposals" and "final proposals", which he feels earlier authors ignored. A tentative proposal does not logically create any kind of obstacle for its subject, and, as such, is an offer. For instance, "if you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy" is a tentative proposal, as it does not logically entail that a failure to fetch the paper will result in no candy; it is possible that candy can be acquired by another route. In other words, <a href="Material%20conditional">if</a> the subject fetches the paper, then they get candy. By contrast, if the proposal was a final proposal, it would take the form of "<a href="if%20and%20only%20if">if and only if</a> you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy". This entails that candy can only be acquired if the subject fetches the paper, and no other way. For Kristjánsson, this kind of final proposal constitutes a throffer. There is an offer to fetch the paper ("if"), and a threat that candy can only be acquired through this route ("only if"). As such, an obstacle has been placed on the route of acquiring candy.

Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites <a href="Joel%20Feinberg">Joel Feinberg</a>, <a href="Alan%20Wertheimer">Alan Wertheimer</a> and <a href="Robert%20Nozick">Robert Nozick</a>) provided moral and statistical analyses of various <a href="thought%20experiments">thought experiments</a> to determine whether the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of <a href="moral%20responsibility">moral responsibility</a> would be required.

Political philosopher and legal theorist Michael R. Rhodes offers an account of threats, offers and throffers based upon the perception of the subject of the proposal (and, in the case of proposals from agents as opposed to nature, the perception of the agent making the proposal.) Rhodes presents seven different <a href="motivation">motivation</a>al-want-structures, that is, seven reasons why "P" may want to do what leads to "B":


Proposals that motivate "P" to act because of "W", "W" or "W" represent offers. Those that do so because of "W" represent threats. Rhodes notes that offers and threats are asymmetrical: while an offer requires only a slight approbation, a high degree of disapprobation is required before a proposal can be called a threat. The disapprobation must be high enough to provoke the "perception of a threat and correlative sense of fear". Rhodes labels as "throffers" those proposals that motivate "P" to act because of "W", "W" or "W", but notes that the name is not universally used.

For Rhodes, throffers can not merely be biconditional proposals. If "Q" proposes that "P" pay $10,000 so that "Q" withholds information that would lead to "P"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrest, then despite the fact that the proposal is biconditional (that is, "P" may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for "P" independent of "Q"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s proposal. "P"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s paying of "Q" does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain "neutral proposals", and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a threat and an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a threat and neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.

Consideration of throffers forms part of the wider question of <a href="coercion">coercion</a> and, specifically, the possibility of a <a href="coercive%20offer">coercive offer</a>. Determining whether throffers are coercive, and, if so, to what extent, is difficult. The traditional assumption is that offers cannot be coercive, only threats can, but throffers can challenge this. The threatening aspect of a throffer need not be explicit, as it was in Steiner's examples. Instead, a throffer may take the form of an offer, but carry an implied threat. Philosopher <a href="John%20Kleinig">John Kleinig</a> sees a throffer as an example of an occasion when an offer alone may be considered coercive. Another example of a coercive offer may be when the situation in which the offer is made is already unacceptable; for instance, if a factory owner takes advantage of a poor economic environment to offer workers an unfair wage. For Jonathan Riley, a liberal society has a duty to protect its citizens from coercion, whether that coercion comes from a threat, offer, throffer or some other source. "If other persons ... attempt to frustrate the right-holder's wants, then a liberal society must take steps to prevent this, by law if necessary. All exercises of power by others to frustrate the relevant individual or group preferences constitute unwarranted 'interference' with liberty in purely private matters."

Ian Hunt concurs that offers may be considered coercive, and claims that, whatever form the interventions take, they may be considered coercive "when they are socially corrigible influences over action that diminish an agent's freedom overall". He accepts that a possible objection to his claim is that at least some coercive offers do seemingly increase the freedom of their recipients. For instance, in the thought experiment of the <a href="lecherous%20millionaire">lecherous millionaire</a>, a millionaire offers a mother money for treatment for her son's life-threatening illness in exchange for her becoming the millionaire's mistress. <a href="Joel%20Feinberg">Joel Feinberg</a> considers the offer coercive, but in offering a possibility of treatment, the millionaire has increased the options available to the mother, and thus her freedom. For Hunt, Feinberg "overlooks the fact that the millionaire's offer opens the option of [the mother] saving her child on condition that the option of not being [the millionaire's] mistress is closed". Hunt does not see the mother as more free; "while it is clear that she has a greater capacity to pursue her interests as a parent once the offer has been made, and to that extent can be regarded as freer, it is clear also that her capacity to pursue her sexual interests may have been diminished." Every coercive proposal, whether threat, offer or throffer, according to Hunt, contains a simultaneous loss and gain of freedom. Kristjánsson, by contrast, argues that Feinberg's account of "coercive offers" is flawed because these are not offers at all, but throffers.

<a href="Peter%20Westen">Peter Westen</a> and <a href="H.%20L.%20A.%20Hart">H. L. A. Hart</a> argue that throffers are not always coercive, and, when they are, it is specifically the threat that makes them so. For a throffer to be coercive, they claim, the threat must meet three further conditions; firstly, the person making the throffer "must be intentionally bringing the threat to bear on X in order that X do something, Z", secondly, the person making the throffer must know that "X would not otherwise do or wish to be constrained to do" Z, and, thirdly, the threat part of the throffer must render "X's option of doing Z more eligible in X's eyes than it would otherwise be". As such, for the authors, there is the possibility of non-coercive throffers. The pair present three possible examples. Firstly, when the threat aspect of the throffer is a joke; secondly, when the offer aspect is already so desirable to the subject that the threat does not affect their decision-making; or, thirdly, when the subject mistakenly believes the threat immaterial because of the attractiveness of the offer. Rhodes similarly concludes that if a throffer is coercive, it is because of the threatening aspect. For him, the question is "whether one regards the threat component of a throffer as both a necessary and sufficient condition of the performance of a behaviour". He argues that if the offer without the threat would have been enough for the agent subject to the proposal to act, then the proposal is not coercive. However, if both offer and threat aspects of the throffer are motivating factors, then it is tricky to determine whether the agent subject to the proposal was coerced. He suggests that differentiating between "pure coercion" and "partial coercion" may help solve this problem, and that the question of coercion in these cases is one of degree.

The conceptual issues around throffers are practically applied in studies in a number of areas, but the term is also used outside of academia. For instance, it has seen use in British policing and in British courts.

Conceptual thinking about throffers is practically applied in considerations of conditional aid, such as is used in <a href="workfare">workfare</a> systems. For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky, the denial of <a href="welfare">welfare</a> when subjects refuse work is the epitome of a throffer. Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher <a href="Robert%20Goodin">Robert Goodin</a>. In the words of Daniel Shapiro, also a political philosopher, the offer aspect of workfare is seen in the "benefits one receives if one learns new skills, gets a job, alters destructive behaviors and the like", while the threat aspect is executed with "the elimination or reduction of aid, if the person does not, after a certain period of time, accept the offer". For Goodin, the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect. In this way, workfare can represent a "genuine" throffer, but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive, and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer. When, however, an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments, there is no genuine choice; the individual is, for Goodin, unable to refuse the throffer. This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer. This is presented as an argument against workfare, and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond <a href="paternalism">paternalistically</a> by claiming that, regardless of issues of freedom, the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered.

Shapiro responds to Goodin's argument by challenging his factual assumption that individuals would starve if they refused the workfare throffer. In state-sponsored (see <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a>) workfare systems, he claims, only monetary assistance is eliminated by a refusal to accept the throffer, while in private systems (that is, non-state charities or organisations offering conditional aid), other groups than the one operating a workfare system exist. In either system, recipients of welfare may also turn to family and friends for help. For these reasons, he does not consider the throffer to be unrefusable in the cases in which Goodin believes it is. A second (and, Shapiro claims, more important) objection is also presented. State welfare without sanctions fails to mirror the way that working individuals who do not rely on welfare payments take responsibility for their lives. If a person who works stops working, Shapiro observes, then they will typically find their economic situation worsened. Unconditional state welfare does not reflect this, and instead reflects the unusual position of the person who would be no worse off if they refused to work. As unconditional welfare does not mirror the situation of ordinary workers, it is unable to determine whether or not people are willing to take responsibility for their lives.

For Ivar Lødemel and Heather Trickey, editors of "<nowiki>'</nowiki>An Offer You Can't Refuse': Workfare in International Perspective", workfare programmes' reliance on compulsion makes them throffers. Citing the Danish model as a particular example, the pair argue that workfare involves the use of compulsory offers; while the work or education is presented as an offer, because recipients of welfare are dependent upon the help they would lose if they refuse the offer, they effectively have no choice. The compulsive aspect reveals that at least some recipients of welfare, in the eyes of policy makers, require coercion before they will accept offers of work. Neither the chance of paid work nor participation in labour schemes are, alone, enough to encourage some to freely accept the offers they receive. Such compulsion serves to reintegrate people into the labour market, and serves as a kind of "new paternalism". The authors are concerned about this compulsion, and present several arguments against it which are possible or have been utilised in the literature: Firstly, it impacts the rights of those against whom it is used. This may make it objectionable in and of itself, or it may result in undesirable outcomes. Secondly, it can be argued that benefits must be unconditional in order to act as a genuine <a href="Social%20safety%20net">safety net</a>. Thirdly, compulsion undermines consumer feedback, and so no differentiation can be made between good and poor programmes presented to those receiving welfare. Fourthly, such coercion may contribute to a culture of resistance among those receiving welfare.

Forensic psychologist Eric Cullen and prison governor Tim Newell claim that prisoners face a throffer once they are told that they must acknowledge their guilt before they are offered <a href="parole">parole</a> or moved to an <a href="open%20prison">open prison</a>. Cullen and Newell cite the example of a prisoner who falsely admitted guilt to move to an open prison; once there, however, he felt he could no longer lie about his guilt, and confessed to the prison's governor. He was subsequently transferred back to a maximum security prison. In the case of <a href="sex%20offenders">sex offenders</a>, a throffer is presented when they are offered release if they take up treatment, but are threatened with extended sentences if they do not. Cullen and Newell are concerned about the predicament that these throffers present to prisoners, including those found innocent on appeal. Concerns surrounding throffers proposed to convicted sex offenders have also been discussed in print by Alex Alexandrowicz, himself wrongly imprisoned, and criminologist <a href="David%20Wilson%20%28criminologist%29">David Wilson</a>. The latter observed the difficulties for those innocent people wrongly imprisoned who are faced with the throffer of having their sentence shortened if they "acknowledge their guilt", but noted that, as perspectives of prisoners were rarely considered, the problem is usually not visible.

Likewise, therapeutic treatment of non-criminals with <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> problems can be considered in terms of throffers. In <a href="community%20psychiatry">community psychiatry</a>, patients with mental health problems will sometimes be presented with the provision of social services, such as financial or housing aid, in exchange for changing their lifestyle and reporting for the administration of medicines. Psychiatrist Julio Arboleda-Flórez considers these throffers a form of <a href="Social%20engineering%20%28political%20science%29">social engineering</a>, and worries that they
have multiple implications in regard to coercive mechanisms from implicit curtailments of freedom to ascription of vulnerability. The former would include threats to personal autonomy, instilling fear in regard to a potential loss of freedom, an increase of dependency with mistrust of one's own capabilities to manage the business of living and, hence, an increase of feelings and attitudes of helplessness. The ascription of vulnerability overrides the principle of equality between the partners, constitutes and invasion of privacy and impacts on the positive rights of individuals.
According to <a href="management">management</a> researcher John J. Clancey, <a href="scientific%20management">scientific management</a> can involve the use of throffers. While <a href="piecework">piecework</a> had been utilised since the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Winslow%20Taylor">Frederick Winslow Taylor</a> blended <a href="Rationalization%20%28economics%29">rationalised</a> management with piecework, to create a new system. Productivity processes were standardised, after which point managers were able to present a throffer to workers: higher pay was offered if they were able to exceed the standard, while lower pay was threatened for any who did not meet expectations.

Jane Cobden

Emma Jane Catherine Cobden (28 April 1851 – 7 July 1947), known as Jane Cobden, was a British <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> politician who was active in many radical causes. A daughter of the Victorian reformer and statesman <a href="Richard%20Cobden">Richard Cobden</a>, she was an early proponent of women's rights, and in 1889 was one of two women elected to the inaugural <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>. Her election was controversial; legal challenges to her eligibility hampered and eventually prevented her from serving as a councillor.

From her youth Jane Cobden, together with her sisters, sought to protect and develop the legacy of her father. She remained committed throughout her life to the "Cobdenite" issues of land reform, peace, and social justice, and was a consistent advocate for <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish independence</a> from Britain. The battle for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> on equal terms with men, to which she made her first commitment in 1875, was her most enduring cause. Although she was sympathetic and supportive of those, including her sister <a href="Anne%20Cobden-Sanderson">Anne Cobden-Sanderson</a>, who chose to campaign using militant, illegal methods, she kept her own activities within the law. She stayed in the Liberal Party, despite her profound disagreement with its stance on the suffrage issue.

After her marriage to the publisher <a href="Thomas%20Fisher%20Unwin">Thomas Fisher Unwin</a> in 1892, Jane Cobden extended her range of interests into the international field, in particular advancing the rights of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">the indigenous populations</a> within colonial territories. As a convinced anti-imperialist she opposed the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> of 1899–1902, and after the establishment of the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> in 1910 she attacked its introduction of segregationist policies. In the years prior to the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> she opposed <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>'s tariff reform crusade on the grounds of her father's <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> principles, and was prominent in the Liberal Party's revival of the land reform issue. In the 1920s she largely retired from public life, and in 1928 presented the old Cobden family residence, Dunford House, to the Cobden Memorial Association as a conference and education centre dedicated to the issues and causes that had defined Cobdenism.

Jane Cobden was born on 28 April 1851 in Westbourne Terrace, London. She was the third daughter and fourth child of <a href="Richard%20Cobden">Richard Cobden</a>, who at the time of her birth was a <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radical</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> for the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">West Riding</a>. With <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a> he had co-founded the <a href="Anti-Corn%20Law%20League">Anti-Corn Law League</a> which in the 1840s had spearheaded the successful campaign for the abolition of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>. Jane's mother was Catherine Anne, née Williams, the daughter of a timber merchant from <a href="Machynlleth">Machynlleth</a> in Wales; the older Cobden children were Richard ("Dick"), born 1841; Kate, born 1844; and Ellen, born 1848. Two further daughters followed Jane: Anne, born 1853, and Lucy, born 1861.

In the 1830s Richard had handed control of his prosperous <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a>-printing business to his brothers, so that he could concentrate on public service. By 1849 the business was failing and Richard was close to financial ruin. He was saved from bankruptcy by a public subscription which not only settled his debts but also enabled him to acquire the farmhouse in which he had been born in 1804, at Dunford, near <a href="Heyshott">Heyshott</a> in Sussex. He rebuilt the property as a large villa, Dunford House, which became Jane Cobden's childhood home from the beginning of 1854. In April 1856 Dick, who was at school at <a href="Weinheim">Weinheim</a> in Germany, died there after a short illness. The news was a devastating shock to the family, and caused Richard's temporary withdrawal from public life. This hiatus was prolonged when, in 1857, he lost his parliamentary seat. He returned to the House of Commons in May 1859, as <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> MP for <a href="Rochdale%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Rochdale</a>.

Because of his many absences from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: "Do not keep the money ... as you have now made up your minds to give it to poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".

Richard Cobden died after a severe <a href="Chronic%20bronchitis">bronchial</a> attack on 2 April 1865, a few weeks before Jane's 14th birthday. There followed a time of domestic uncertainty and financial worry, eventually resolved by a pension from the government of £1,500 a year, and the establishment of a "Cobden Tribute Fund" by his friends and followers. After their father's death Jane and Anne attended Warrington Lodge school in <a href="Maida%20Vale">Maida Hill</a> but, following a disagreement the nature of which is unclear, both were removed from the school—"thrown on my hands", their mother complained. In this difficult time, Catherine did not withdraw into seclusion; in 1866 she supervised the re-publication of her husband's "Political Writings", and in the same year became one of the 1,499 signatories to the "Ladies Petition", an event that the historian Sophia Van Wingerden marks as the beginning of the organised women's suffrage movement.

In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and her four younger daughters moved to a house in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>—the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now displaying considerable independence of spirit, and differences of opinion arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, <a href="Julie%20Salis%20Schwabe">Julie Salis Schwabe</a>. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of <a href="John%20Morley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Morley%20of%20Blackburn">John Morley</a>, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.

During these years Jane often travelled abroad. In London, she and her sisters extended their range of acquaintances into literary and artistic circles; among their new friends were the writer <a href="George%20MacDonald">George MacDonald</a> and the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelites</a> <a href="William%20Morris">William</a> and <a href="Jane%20Morris">Jane Morris</a> and <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a>. Ellen later married the painter <a href="Walter%20Sickert">Walter Sickert</a>. Jane developed an interest in the question of women's suffrage after attending a conference in London, in 1871. In 1875 she made a specific commitment to this cause, although she did not became active in the movement for several years. In the meantime, in 1879, she helped to found the Cobden Club in Heyshott, close to her father's birthplace.

From the late 1870s the Cobden sisters began to follow different pathways. Anne married <a href="T.%20J.%20Cobden-Sanderson">Thomas Sanderson</a> in 1882; inspired by her friendships within the Morris circle, her interests turned towards arts and crafts and eventually to socialism. After her marriage to Sickert failed, Ellen became a novelist. Jane became an active Liberal, on the radical wing of the party. In about 1879 she became a member of the <a href="National%20Society%20for%20Women%27s%20Suffrage">National Society for Women's Suffrage</a>, which had been founded in 1867 in the wake of the 1866 "Ladies Petition". Jane joined the National Society's finance committee, and by 1880 was serving as its treasurer. That year she was a speaker at a "Grand Demonstration" at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Hall">St James's Hall</a>, London, and in the following year addressed a similar meeting in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>. In 1883 she attended a conference in <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, jointly organised by the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Federation">National Liberal Federation</a> and the <a href="National%20Reform%20Union">National Reform Union</a>, where she supported a motion proposed by <a href="Henry%20William%20Crosskey">Henry William Crosskey</a> and seconded by <a href="Walter%20McLaren">Walter McLaren</a> (John Bright's nephew), to extend the vote in parliamentary elections to certain women—those who, "possessing the qualifications that entitle men to vote, have now the right of voting in all matters of local government".

The National Society's general stance was cautious; it avoided close identification with political parties, and for this reason would not accept affiliation from branches of the <a href="Women%27s%20Liberal%20Federation">Women's Liberal Federation</a>. This, and its policy of excluding married women from any extension of the franchise, led to a split in 1888, with the formation of a breakaway "Central National Society" (CNS). Jane joined the executive committee of the new body, which encouraged the affiliation of Women's Liberal Associations and hoped that a future Liberal government would grant women's enfranchisement. However, the more radical members of the CNS felt that its commitment to votes for married women was too half-hearted. In 1889 this group, which included Jane Cobden and <a href="Emmeline%20Pankhurst">Emmeline Pankhurst</a>, formed the <a href="Women%27s%20Franchise%20League">Women's Franchise League</a> (WFL) with a specific policy of seeking votes for women on the same basis as for men, and the eligibility of women for all offices.

In 1848 Richard Cobden had written: "Almost every crime and outrage in Ireland is connected with the occupation or ownership of land ... if I had the power, I would always make the proprietors of the soil resident, by breaking up the large properties. In other words, I would give Ireland to the Irish". Nevertheless, his views were held in the context of <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland%23History">Unionism</a>; he had condemned the 1848 <a href="Young%20Irelander%20Rebellion%20of%201848">"Young Ireland"</a> rebellion as an act of insanity. Jane adopted her father's standpoint on Irish land reform, yet embraced the cause of <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20movement">Irish home rule</a>—on which she lectured regularly—and was a strong supporter of the <a href="Irish%20National%20Land%20League">Land League</a>. After visiting Ireland with the Women's Mission to Ireland in 1887, she subsequently used the pages of the English press to expose the mistreatment of evicted tenants. In a letter to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", Jane and her associates cited one particular case—that of the Ryan family of Cloughbready in <a href="County%20Tipperary">County Tipperary</a>—to illustrate the British government's harshness towards even the most vulnerable of individuals. Jane sent money and food to alleviate the Ryan family's distress.

Jane was in contact with Irish Land League leaders, including <a href="John%20Dillon">John Dillon</a> and <a href="William%20O%27Brien">William O'Brien</a>, and lobbied for the release of the latter after his imprisonment under the <a href="Protection%20of%20Person%20and%20Property%20Act%201881">Coercion Act of 1881</a>. She and her sisters supported the Irish <a href="Plan%20of%20Campaign">Plan of Campaign</a>, a scheme whereby tenants acted collectively to secure fair rents from their landlords. This plan was eventually denounced by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> as contrary to natural justice and Christian charity, although some priests supported it. The attachment of Jane and her sisters to the rebellious factions in Ireland strained relations between the sisters and many of their father's former Liberal Unionist colleagues, but won approval from <a href="Thomas%20Bayley%20Potter">Thomas Bayley Potter</a>, who had succeeded Richard Cobden as MP for Rochdale. In October 1887 he wrote to Jane: "You are true to the living and just instincts of your father ... You know your father's heart better than John Bright does".

Under the <a href="Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201882">Municipal Corporations Act of 1882</a> some women were qualified to vote in municipal elections, but were excluded from serving as councillors. However, the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201888">Local Government Act of 1888</a>, which created <a href="county%20council">county council</a>s, was interpreted by some as allowing women's election to these new bodies. On 17 November 1888 a group of Liberal women decided to test the legal position. They formed the <a href="Society%20for%20Promoting%20the%20Return%20of%20Women%20as%20County%20Councillors">Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors</a> (SPRWCC), established an election fund of £400 and selected two women—Jane Cobden and Margaret Sandhurst— as Liberal candidates for the newly created <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>. Cobden was adopted by the party's <a href="Bow%20and%20Bromley">Bow and Bromley</a> division, and Sandhurst by <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a>. Despite objections from the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a>, the women's nominations were accepted by the local returning officers. Cobden's campaign in Bow and Bromley was organised with considerable enthusiasm and efficiency by the 29-year-old <a href="George%20Lansbury">George Lansbury</a>, then a Radical Liberal, later a socialist and eventually leader of the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. Both Cobden and Sandhurst were victorious in the elections on 19 January 1889; they were joined by <a href="Emma%20Cons">Emma Cons</a>, whom the Progressive majority on the council selected to serve as an <a href="alderman">alderman</a>.

The women took their places on the inaugural council, and each accepted a range of committee assignments. Almost immediately, however, Sandhurst's defeated Conservative opponent, Beresford Hope, lodged a legal challenge against her election. When this was heard on 18 March, the judges ruled Sandhurst disqualified under the provisions of the 1882 Act. Her appeal was dismissed, and Beresford Hope was installed in her place. Cobden faced no such challenge, since her runner-up was a fellow-Liberal who had promised to support her. Even so, her position on the council remained precarious, particularly after an attempt in parliament to legalise women's rights to serve as county councillors gained little support. A provision of the prevailing election law provided that anyone elected, even improperly, could not be challenged after twelve months, so on legal advice Cobden refrained from attending council or committee meetings until February 1890. When the statutory twelve months elapsed without challenge, she resumed her full range of duties.

Although Cobden was now protected from challenge, the Conservative member for <a href="City%20of%20Westminster">Westminster</a>, Sir Walter De Souza, instituted fresh court proceedings against both Cobden and Cons. He argued that since they had been elected or selected unlawfully, their votes in the council had likewise been unlawful, making them liable to heavy financial penalties. In court the judge ruled against both women, though on appeal in April 1891 the penalties were reduced from an original £250 to a nominal £5. Cobden was urged by Lansbury and others not to pay even this token, but to go to prison; she declined this course of action. After a further parliamentary attempt to resolve the situation failed, she sat out the remaining months of her term as a councillor in silence, neither speaking nor voting, and did not seek re-election in the 1892 county elections. Women did not receive the right to sit on county councils until 1907, with the passage of the Qualification of Women Act.

In his account of the 1888–89 election, the historian Jonathan Schneer marks the campaign as a step in what he terms "working-class disenchantment with official Liberalism", citing in particular Lansbury's departure from the Liberal Party in 1892. Schneer also remarks that this "pioneering political venture of British feminism ... provides at once an anticipation of, and a direct contrast to, the militant suffragism of the Edwardian era".

In 1892, at the age of 41, Cobden married <a href="Thomas%20Fisher%20Unwin">Thomas Fisher Unwin</a>, an avant-garde publisher whose list included works by <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>, <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, <a href="H.G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a> and the young <a href="Somerset%20Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a>. Unwin's involvement in a range of world and humanitarian causes led Cobden—who adopted the surname "Cobden Unwin"—to extend her interests to international peace and justice, reform in the <a href="Congo%20Free%20State">Congo</a>, and more generally the rights of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">aboriginal peoples</a>. She and Unwin opposed the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> (1899–1902); both were founder-members of the pro-Boer <a href="South%20African%20Conciliation%20Committee">South African Conciliation Committee</a>, Cobden acting as the committee's secretary. The couple settled in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, from where Cobden continued to pursue her own causes. In 1893, with <a href="Laura%20Ormiston%20Chant">Laura Ormiston Chant</a>, she represented the WFL in Chicago at the World Congress of Representative Women. At home, she assisted women candidates in the 1894 <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Kensington">Kensington "vestry"</a> elections. In 1900 she accepted the presidency of the Brighton Women's Liberal Association, and in the same year wrote an extended tract, "The Recent Development of Violence in our Midst", published by the Stop-the-War Committee.

Although Cobden's views were more progressive than those of the Liberal Party's mainstream, she stayed a member of the party, believing that it remained the best political vehicle whereby her causes could be advanced. Other suffragists, including Anne Cobden Sanderson, took a different view, and aligned themselves with socialist movements. When the <a href="Women%27s%20Social%20and%20Political%20Union">Women's Social and Political Union</a> (WSPU) began its militant campaign in 1905, Cobden refrained from participation in illegal actions, although she spoke out for her sister when Anne became one of the first suffragists to be sent to prison, after a demonstration outside Parliament in October 1906. On Anne's release a month later, Cobden and her husband attended a celebration banquet at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a>, together with other WSPU prisoners. Cobden moved closer to the militant wing in 1907 when she endorsed the WSPU's new magazine, "Votes for Women". That year she hosted an "At Home" meeting at which the WSPU leader <a href="Christabel%20Pankhurst">Christabel Pankhurst</a> was the principal speaker. The WSPU was split when members who objected to the Pankhurst family's authoritarian leadership formed themselves into the <a href="Women%27s%20Freedom%20League">Women's Freedom League</a>; Cobden did not join Anne in the breakaway movement, although she supported its associated body, the <a href="Women%27s%20Tax%20Resistance%20League">Women's Tax Resistance League</a>.

In 1911 Cobden was responsible for the Indian women's delegation in the <a href="Women%27s%20Coronation%20Procession">Women's Coronation Procession</a>, a London demonstration organised by suffrage associations from Britain and the <a href="British%20Empire">Empire</a>. The procession marched on 17 June 1911, a few days before <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a>'s coronation. During 1910–12 several <a href="Conciliation%20Bills">Conciliation Bills</a> extending the parliamentary vote to a limited number of propertied women, were debated in the House of Commons. When the third of these was under discussion, Cobden sought the help of the <a href="Irish%20Parliamentary%20Party">Irish Parliamentary Party</a> by reminding them of the support women had given to Ireland during the Land League agitation: "In the name of those 40,000 Englishwomen we urge you to support at every division this Bill by your presence and your vote". The bill was finally abandoned when the Liberal prime minister, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a>, replaced it with a bill extending the male suffrage. In protest against the Liberal government's suffrage policies and its harsh treatment of militants, Cobden resigned her honorary presidency of the Women's Liberal Association in Rochdale, her father's last constituency.

Although the cause of women's suffrage remained her principal concern, at least until the First World War, Cobden was active in other campaigns. In 1903 she defended the principles of free trade, as expressed by her father, against <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>'s <a href="tariff%20reform">tariff reform</a> crusade. Chamberlain had called for a policy of <a href="Imperial%20Preference">Imperial Preference</a>, and the imposition of tariffs against countries opposed to Britain's imperial interests. To a meeting in Manchester, Cobden expressed confidence that "Manchester ... will tell Mr Chamberlain that it is still loyal to our old flag: free trade, peace and goodwill among nations". In 1904, Richard Cobden's centenary year, she published "The Hungry Forties", described by <a href="Anthony%20Howe%20%28historian%29">Anthony Howe</a> in a biographical article as "an evocative and brilliantly successful tract". It was one of several free trade books and pamphlets issued by the Fisher Unwin press which, together with celebratory centenary events, helped to define free trade as a major progressive cause of the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian era</a>.

The Cobdenite cause of land reform was revived in the 1900s as a major Liberal policy, helped in 1913 by the publication of Jane Cobden's book "The Land Hunger: Life under Monopoly". The dedication read: "To the memory of Richard Cobden who loved his native land, these pages are dedicated by his daughter, in the hope that his desire—'Free Trade in Land'—may be fulfilled". Cobden did not confine her interests to domestic affairs. From 1906, along with <a href="Helen%20Bright%20Clark">Helen Bright Clark</a>, she was an active member of the <a href="Aborigines%27%20Protection%20Society">Aborigines' Protection Society</a>, an organisation concerned with the rights of indigenous peoples under colonial rule; the society merged with the <a href="Anti-Slavery%20Society">Anti-Slavery Society</a> in 1909. In 1907 she lobbied the prime minister, <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>, on behalf of the <a href="Friends%20of%20Russian%20Freedom">Friends of Russian Freedom</a>, seeking his support for amendments to the <a href="Hague%20Conventions%20of%201899%20and%201907">Hague Convention</a>, then in session in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> Her efforts for the poorest in society encompassed appeals on behalf of the families of striking workers in London and Dublin during the labour unrest of 1913–14, and of starving women and children in <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a>. She also found time to act as secretary to the memorial fund for Emma Cons, after the latter's death in 1912.

During the war years 1914–18, with the issue of women's suffrage quiescent, Cobden became increasingly involved in <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">South African</a> affairs. She supported <a href="Sol%20Plaatje">Solomon Plaatje</a>'s campaign against the segregationist Natives' Land Act of 1913, a stance that led, in 1917, to her removal from the committee of the Anti-Slavery Society. The Society's line was to support the <a href="Louis%20Botha">Botha</a> government's land reform policy; Cobden denounced <a href="John%20Hobbis%20Harris">Sir John Harris</a>, the Society's parliamentary representative, for being a false friend to the native people by secretly working against them. Cobden maintained her commitment to the cause of Irish freedom, and offered personal help to victims of the <a href="Black%20and%20Tans">Black and Tans</a> during the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>, 1919–21.

In 1920 Cobden gave Dunford House to the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> (LSE), of which she had become a governor. According to <a href="Beatrice%20Webb">Beatrice Webb</a>, co-founder of the School, she soon regretted the gift; Webb wrote in her diary on 2 May 1923: "The poor lady ... makes fretful complaints if a single bush is cut down or a stone shifted, whilst she vehemently resents the high spirits of the students ... not to mention the opinions of some of the lecturers". Later in 1923 LSE returned the house to Cobden; in 1928 she donated it to the Cobden Memorial Association. With the help of the writer and journalist <a href="Francis%20Wrigley%20Hirst">Francis Wrigley Hirst</a> and others, the house became a conference and education centre for pursuing the traditional Cobdenite causes of free trade, peace and goodwill.

After 1928, Jane Cobden's chief occupation was the organisation of her father's papers, some of which she placed in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. Others were eventually collected, with other Cobden family documents, by the <a href="West%20Sussex%20County%20Council">West Sussex County Council</a> Record Office at <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>. In old age she lived quietly at Oatscroft, her home near Dunford House, and following her husband's death in 1935 made few interventions in public life. During the 1930s, under Hirst's direction, Dunford House continued to preach what Howe describes as "the pure milk of the Cobdenian faith": the conviction that in Britain and in continental Europe, peace and prosperity would develop from individual ownership of the soil. Jane Cobden died, aged 96, on 7 July 1947, at Whitehanger Nursing Home in <a href="Fernhurst">Fernhurst, Surrey</a>. In the years following her death her papers were collected and deposited as part of the family archive in Chichester. In 1952 Dunford House was transferred to the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a>, although its general educational functions and mission remained unchanged. The house contains numerous memorabilia of the Cobden family.

Howe depicts Jane Cobden as a formidable personality, known by her husband's publishing colleagues as "The Jane", who took a keen and even intrusive interest in the work of the publishing house. She was, Howe says, "a woman of sentiment and enthusiasm who took up (and sometimes speedily dropped) causes with a fire which brooked no opposition". In an essay on the Cobden sisterhood, the feminist historian Sarah Richardson remarks on the different paths chosen by the sisters by which to take their father's legacy forward: "Jane's activities showed that it was still possible to follow a radical agenda within the aegis of Liberalism". Richardson indicates that the main collective achievement of Jane and her sisters was to ensure that the Cobden name, with its radical and progressive associations, survived well into the 20th century. "In doing so", Richardson concludes, "they proved themselves worthy successors to their father, guaranteeing that his contribution was not only sustained, but remodelled for a new age".

Gagak Item (; <a href="Malay%20trade%20and%20creole%20languages">Vernacular Malay</a> for "Black Raven", also known by the Dutch title De Zwarte Raaf) is a 1939 bandit film from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now Indonesia) directed by <a href="Wong%20brothers">Joshua and Othniel Wong</a> for <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a>. Starring <a href="Rd%20Mochtar">Rd Mochtar</a>, <a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a>, and Eddy T. Effendi, it follows a masked man known only as "Gagak Item" ("Black Raven"). The <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> film, which featured the cast and crew from the 1937 hit "<a href="Terang%20Boelan">Terang Boelan</a>" ("Full Moon"), was a commercial success and received positive reviews upon release. It is likely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

"Gagak Item" was directed by brothers <a href="Wong%20brothers">Joshua and Othniel Wong</a>; filming the work in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a>, they also handled <a href="Sound%20editor%20%28filmmaking%29">sound editing</a>. It was produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a> and starred <a href="Rd%20Mochtar">Rd Mochtar</a>, <a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a>, Eddy T. Effendi, and <a href="Kartolo">Kartolo</a>. The Wongs and cast had first worked together on <a href="Albert%20Balink">Albert Balink</a>'s 1937 blockbuster "<a href="Terang%20Boelan">Terang Boelan</a>" ("Full Moon"), before joining Tan's Film in 1938 for the highly successful "<a href="Fatima%20%281938%20film%29">Fatima</a>"; "Gagak Item" was their second production with the company, which hoped to mirror "Terang Boelan" success. Through these prior films Mochtar and Roekiah had become an established <a href="celebrity%20couple">screen couple</a>.

<a href="Saeroen">Saeroen</a>, a journalist-turned-screenwriter for "Terang Boelan" and "Fatima", returned to write the script to "Gagak Item". The film, a love story, followed a girl and a masked man known as "Gagak Item" ("Black Raven") and was set in rural Buitenzorg (now <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>). The titular bandit was similar to <a href="Zorro">Zorro</a>, a character popular in the Indies at the time; such figures had been a staple of travelling theatre troupes beginning in the early 1930s. When writing the script Saeroen continued the formula he had used in "Terang Boelan", including action, music, beautiful vistas and <a href="physical%20comedy">physical comedy</a>. The film had six songs performed by Hugo Dumas' musical troupe <a href="Lief%20Java">Lief Java</a>; the troupe was known for its "<a href="keroncong">keroncong</a>" performances, mixing traditional music with <a href="Portuguese%20colonialism%20in%20Indonesia">Portuguese</a> influences. "Gagak Item" featured vocals by "kroncong" singer <a href="Annie%20Landouw">Annie Landouw</a>.

"Gagak Item" was released in late 1939 and was screened in Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), the capital of the Indies; <a href="Medan">Medan</a>, <a href="North%20Sumatra">North Sumatra</a>; and <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, <a href="East%20Java">eastern Java</a>. Some screenings of the film, also advertised under the Dutch title "De Zwarte Raaf", had Dutch-language subtitles. A novelisation of the film, published by the <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>-based Kolff-Buning, soon followed. "Gagak Item" was one of four <a href="List%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestic productions</a> released in 1939; the film industry had undergone a significant downturn following the onset of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, during which time cinemas mainly showed <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> productions, and had only begun recovering following the release of "Terang Boelan".

"Gagak Item" was a commercial and critical success, although not as much as Tan's earlier production. An anonymous review in "<a href="Bataviaasch%20Nieuwsblad">Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad</a>" praised the film, especially its music. The reviewer opined that the film would be a great success and that the film industry in the Indies was showing promising developments. Another review in the same paper found that, although "one may shake one's head over the cultural value of indigenous films", the film was a step forward for the industry. The review praised Roekiah's "demure" acting.

Following the success of "Gagak Item" the Wongs, Saeroen, Roekiah, and Mochtar continued to work with Tan's Film. Their next production, "<a href="Siti%20Akbari">Siti Akbari</a>" (1940), was similarly successful, although again not as profitable as "Terang Boelan" or "Fatima". Saeroen, Joshua Wong, and Mochtar left the company in 1940: Wong and Mochtar after payment disputes, and Saeroen to return to journalism. Through 1941 Tan's Film produced fewer movies than its competitors, and was ultimately shut down following the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a> in early 1942.

"Gagak Item" was screened as late as January 1951. The film is likely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a>, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. The American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>'s archives, and film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the <a href="Netherlands%20Government%20Information%20Service">Netherlands Government Information Service</a>.

The Bat (play)

The Bat is a three-act play by <a href="Mary%20Roberts%20Rinehart">Mary Roberts Rinehart</a> and <a href="Avery%20Hopwood">Avery Hopwood</a> that was first produced by Lincoln Wagenhals and Collin Kemper in 1920. The story combines elements of <a href="Mystery%20fiction">mystery</a> and <a href="comedy">comedy</a> as Cornelia Van Gorder and guests spend a stormy night at her rented summer home, searching for stolen money they believe is hidden in the house, while they are stalked by a masked criminal known as "the Bat". The Bat's identity is revealed at the end of the final act.

The play originated as an adaptation of Rinehart's 1908 mystery novel "<a href="The%20Circular%20Staircase">The Circular Staircase</a>". Rinehart and Hopwood altered the story to prepare it for Broadway, including adding the titular <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a>. The connection to the novel led to a legal dispute over film rights with the <a href="Selig%20Polyscope%20Company">Selig Polyscope Company</a>, producers of a 1915 film adaptation of the novel, also titled "<a href="The%20Circular%20Staircase%20%28film%29">The Circular Staircase</a>". After <a href="Preview%20%28theatre%29">previewing</a> under the title "A Thief in the Night", the play opened as "The Bat" at the <a href="Morosco%20Theatre">Morosco Theatre</a> on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> on August 23, 1920.

"The Bat" was a critical and commercial success. It ran for 867 performances in New York and 327 performances in London; several road companies took the show to other areas. The play was revived twice on Broadway, in 1937 and 1953. It had several adaptations, including a 1926 <a href="novelization">novelization</a> credited to Rinehart and Hopwood but ghostwritten by <a href="Stephen%20Vincent%20Ben%C3%A9t">Stephen Vincent Benét</a>. Three film adaptations were produced: "<a href="The%20Bat%20%281926%20film%29">The Bat</a>" (1926), "<a href="The%20Bat%20Whispers">The Bat Whispers</a>" (1930), and "<a href="The%20Bat%20%281959%20film%29">The Bat</a>" (1959). The play and its adaptations inspired other comedy-mysteries with similar settings, and influenced the creation of the comic-book superhero <a href="Batman">Batman</a>.

Elderly, single Cornelia Van Gorder is renting an old, isolated <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> mansion owned by the estate of Courtleigh Fleming, a bank president who had reportedly died several months before. On a stormy evening, the electricity flickers on and off. Most of the servants, convinced that the house is haunted, have made excuses and fled. According to a news report, a mysterious criminal known as "the Bat" has eluded police in the area. Cornelia is in the house with her maid, Lizzie, and Billy, a Japanese butler who is part of Fleming's household staff. They are joined by Brooks, a gardener recently hired by Cornelia's niece, Dale Ogden. Dale and Dr. Wells, the local <a href="coroner">coroner</a> and an old friend of Fleming's, arrive for a visit. They tell Cornelia that Jack Bailey, a cashier at Fleming's bank, has disappeared and is suspected of stealing over a million dollars. Cornelia tells Lizzie and Dale that she has invited a police detective to visit because someone has been trying to break into the house at night. Wells leaves, and Detective Anderson arrives. Cornelia tells Anderson that she suspects Fleming <a href="embezzled">embezzled</a> from the bank and hid the money in the house. While Cornelia shows Anderson to his room, Dale warns Brooks (who is actually Jack Bailey, and Dale's fiancé) that Anderson is a detective. Brooks also believes that Fleming hid the money, and wants to clear himself by finding it. Dale summons Fleming's nephew, Richard (who rented the house to Cornelia), to learn about possible hiding places. Richard shows her a <a href="blueprint">blueprint</a> of the house, with a hidden room where the money might be. While they fight over the blueprint, a figure appears in the darkness and shoots Richard, ending the first act.

Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to the house to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the blueprint she took from Richard because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the <a href="Terrace%20%28building%29">terrace</a> door. When the guests try to identify the unknown man, they discover that they have been locked in the house. At the end of the second act, Cornelia finds the Bat's <a href="Calling%20card%20%28crime%29">calling card</a>, a black paper bat, tacked to a door.

The third act begins on the upper floor of the house, where a masked man is seen in the previously-hidden room taking a <a href="money%20bag">money bag</a> from a safe. When Dale finds the room, the man flees, leaving her and the money locked inside. The others find her there, unconscious. Anderson reappears and accuses Wells of stealing the money and killing Richard. Cornelia begins to present an alternative theory, but is interrupted when the unknown man comes upstairs and Anderson asks him about his <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a>. Cornelia says that she sees a man on the roof, and most of the group leaves to look for him. Cornelia uses the distraction to tell Dale, Jack and the unknown man that she thinks the money is still in the room. When they search for the money, Jack finds the body of Courtleigh Fleming, who was killed only recently. As Cornelia, Dale and Jack argue about what has happened, the unknown man locks the door and orders them to be quiet. When the masked man sneaks in through a window, the unknown man apprehends him and reveals that he, the unknown man, is the real Detective Anderson; the Bat (the masked man) had pretended to be Anderson.

<a href="Mary%20Roberts%20Rinehart">Mary Roberts Rinehart</a> was one of the most successful American mystery writers of the early 20th century. After starting her writing career with short stories, she achieved popular success with the publication of her 1908 novel "<a href="The%20Circular%20Staircase">The Circular Staircase</a>". In 1909 Broadway producers Lincoln Wagenhals and Collin Kemper asked Rinehart to adapt her novella "Seven Days" for the stage. She agreed to work with <a href="Avery%20Hopwood">Avery Hopwood</a>, a young playwright with just one produced play, to create the script. The play "<a href="Seven%20Days%20%28play%29">Seven Days</a>" debuted on Broadway in November 1909 and became a hit. Rinehart and Hopwood each continued to write plays, but did not collaborate again until "The Bat".

In 1916, Rinehart asked theatrical producer <a href="Edgar%20Selwyn">Edgar Selwyn</a> whether he thought a mystery play would be successful if it kept the mystery unresolved until the end; Selwyn replied that such a play could make a million dollars. Rinehart decided to base this play on "The Circular Staircase", which had been adapted for film in 1915. Although she began work on the play in spring 1917, she was distracted by work for the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">United States Department of War</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and by fall 1918 had only written the first two acts. Rinehart approached Hopwood for help completing the play while she was in Europe for the War Department. Hopwood was interested, but did not work on the play when she was overseas.

After Rinehart returned in 1919, Hopwood joined her in <a href="Sewickley%2C%20Pennsylvania">Sewickley, Pennsylvania</a>, where she lived; they worked on the play there and in New York City until they completed it. While they worked on "The Bat", Wagenhals and Kemper asked them to work on a script for "<a href="Spanish%20Love">Spanish Love</a>" (an adaptation of "María del Carmen", an 1896 Spanish play). Writing both plays required Rinehart and Hopwood to work long hours. By early April 1920, they were working on a final, more-humorous round of revisions for "The Bat".
Rinehart and Hopwood finished "The Bat" during the afternoon of April 11, 1920. She was called away moments later when her daughter-in-law went into labor, and her granddaughter was born early the next day. Rinehart decided to focus on family obligations and missed the reading of the play to Wagenhals and Kemper, who expressed interest in staging it after Hopwood shared a draft with them. She missed "The Bat" rehearsals and its Broadway debut, although she attended <a href="Preview%20%28theatre%29">preview</a> performances.

Before its Broadway opening, the play previewed in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where it opened at the Belasco Theater on June 14, 1920, as "A Thief in the Night". The following week, it previewed in <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>. With Rinehart's preferred title restored, "The Bat" opened on Broadway at the <a href="Morosco%20Theatre">Morosco Theatre</a> on August 23, 1920. The play was produced by Wagenhals and Kemper; the latter also directed. The Broadway production closed in September 1922 after 867 performances. Before it closed, Wagenhals and Kemper sent six road companies to tour the United States. On January 23, 1922, "The Bat" opened a 327-performance run in London at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Theatre">St James's Theatre</a> in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>.

The play was revived twice on Broadway. The first revival, produced by Ben Lundy and directed by Benjamin F. Kamsler, opened on May 31, 1937, at the <a href="Majestic%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Majestic Theatre</a> as part of a <a href="summer-stock">summer-stock</a> program. Scheduled to run for a week, it was extended and closed after two weeks and 11 performances. The second revival opened on January 20, 1953, at the <a href="Nederlander%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> and closed on February 7 after 23 performances.

The play's lead role is Cornelia Van Gorder, played in the first production by <a href="Effie%20Ellsler">Effie Ellsler</a>. Despite "The Bat" unusually long run, Ellsler appeared in almost every performance (including the evening after she heard about her husband's death); she left the part only briefly, after collapsing onstage during the production's final week. "The Bat" was her last Broadway role.

Wagenhals and Kemper cast <a href="Harrison%20Hunter">Harrison Hunter</a> in the play's title role. They did not show Hunter or the other cast members the final scene (in which the Bat's identity is revealed) until shortly before the <a href="dress%20rehearsal">dress rehearsal</a>. Hunter, who had thought he was playing a detective, was upset to learn that his role was that of a criminal, although he remained in the role for the entire Broadway run before joining a touring company for the play. At the end of 1922, while still playing the Bat, Hunter became ill and died a week later.

The play's primary <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a> is provided by Lizzie, played in the initial Broadway production by <a href="May%20Vokes">May Vokes</a>. Vokes returned to the role for the 1937 revival, where she was joined by Richard Barrows (also from the original cast, but in a different role). <a href="Minnette%20Barrett">Minnette Barrett</a>, an understudy in the original production, played Cornelia in the revival.

Productions of "The Bat" included the initial Broadway run, a production in London's West End and two later Broadway revivals, with the following opening-night casts:
To adapt "The Circular Staircase" for the stage, Rinehart and Hopwood made changes to the characters and plot; the most significant was the addition of the flamboyant criminal whose pseudonym became the play's title. The primary villains in the novel were an embezzling banker and a doctor who helped the banker fake his death. The character names were all changed (Rachel Innes in the novel became Cornelia Van Gorder in the play, her niece Gertrude became Dale, etc.), and some significant characters from the novel were omitted from the play. Despite the changes, the play retained many elements from the novel, including the elderly <a href="spinster">spinster</a> heroine and her niece staying at a summer house, the hidden room in the house, the conspiracy between the banker and his doctor, and the bank clerk who disguises himself as a gardener.

Like "The Circular Staircase", "The Bat" combines <a href="Mystery%20fiction">mystery</a> and <a href="comedy">comedy</a>. Most of its comedy is provided by Lizzie, Cornelia's maid. The mystery ends with a <a href="Plot%20twist">twist</a>, in which a character who is supposedly a detective investigating the case is actually the villain. Although similar endings had been used in earlier stage mysteries, it was unexpected enough to fool much of the play's Broadway audience. To maintain plausibility, Rinehart and Hopwood checked the timing of the plot (including events taking place offstage) and rewrote as needed to ensure the timeline was realistic. Hopwood told the "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>" that they tried to make the play "absolutely logical and hole-proof".

With a multi-year Broadway run, over nine months on the West End and several road companies touring concurrently, "The Bat" was a financial success. In his 1946 profile of Rinehart, "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine writer <a href="Geoffrey%20T.%20Hellman">Geoffrey T. Hellman</a> estimated that the play had earned over nine million dollars. It was the most successful play for both its writers and its producers, and was the second-longest-running Broadway production in history at the end of its initial stint.

The original Broadway production of "The Bat" received positive reviews praising its writing and performances. In his "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" review, <a href="Alexander%20Woollcott">Alexander Woollcott</a> described the play as entertaining and well-acted. For the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", <a href="Heywood%20Broun">Heywood Broun</a> called "The Bat" better than "Spanish Love" (which had opened the week before). Broun wrote that "The Bat" "provided an excellent succession of thrills", although the "interludes of low comedy" with Vokes could have been omitted. A "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Telegram">New York Evening Telegram</a>" reviewer liked "The Bat" comedy and called it "the best mystery play New York has ever seen". According to a "<a href="Brooklyn%20Daily%20Eagle">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</a>" review, "The Bat" was "three acts full of mystery and fun" and better than "Seven Days".

The play's 1922 London production also received positive reviews. In "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", <a href="W.%20J.%20Turner">W. J. Turner</a> wrote that the play was thrilling and praised Moore's acting as Cornelia, but disliked Wills's "buffoonery" as Lizzie. The "<a href="Bystander%20%28magazine%29">Bystander</a>" called "The Bat" "most exciting from first to last".

When it was revived on Broadway in 1937, reviewers said that the play had not aged well due to many imitations by subsequent plays. For the "New York Times", <a href="Brooks%20Atkinson">Brooks Atkinson</a> wrote that it was "not quite the shriek show it was originally" but still entertaining. According to the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle" Arthur Pollock, "The Bat" showed its age and was more amusing than frightening. Although Atkinson was more favorable about the 1953 revival and the older story's "innocence", other reviewers considered it dated.

"The Bat" is considered a classic example of comedy-mystery; drama critic <a href="Joseph%20Twadell%20Shipley">Joseph Twadell Shipley</a> called it "the most popular and most shiverful of our murder mystery dramas". Many of its elements are now <a href="clich%C3%A9s">clichés</a>. "The Bat" success encouraged imitators to set mysteries mixed with comedy in old, dark houses which some of the characters think are haunted. "<a href="The%20Cat%20and%20the%20Canary%20%28play%29">The Cat and the Canary</a>" by <a href="John%20Willard%20%28playwright%29">John Willard</a> opened on Broadway in February 1922 and ran for 349 performances. Another successful imitation was <a href="Crane%20Wilbur">Crane Wilbur</a>'s "<a href="The%20Monster%20%28play%29">The Monster</a>", which opened on Broadway in August of that year. <a href="Ralph%20Spence%20%28screenwriter%29">Ralph Spence</a>'s 1925 play, "<a href="The%20Gorilla%20%28play%29">The Gorilla</a>", parodied the genre; according to its advertisements, it "outbats "The Bat"".

Film versions soon followed, including <a href="The%20Monster%20%281925%20film%29">a 1925 adaptation</a> of "The Monster" and multiple adaptations of "The Cat and the Canary" and "The Gorilla". By the late 1920s, the mysteries' popularity was declining in live theater, although the genre continued in films such as <a href="James%20Whale">James Whale</a>'s "<a href="The%20Old%20Dark%20House">The Old Dark House</a>" (1932) and several adaptations of "The Bat".

Rinehart sold the film rights to "The Circular Staircase" to film producer <a href="William%20Selig">William Selig</a>'s <a href="Selig%20Polyscope%20Company">Selig Polyscope Company</a> in 1915, and he released a film version of the novel that year. Rinehart purchased the rights back from Selig in 1920 to avoid conflicts over potential film adaptations of "The Bat". But in 1921, Selig re-released his film as "The Bat" to capitalize on the play's success. Wagenhals and Kemper filed suit to block Selig's use of the title.

Three films were based on the original Broadway play. The first, a <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> also called "<a href="The%20Bat%20%281926%20film%29">The Bat</a>", was produced and directed by <a href="Roland%20West">Roland West</a>, who co-wrote the screenplay with <a href="Julien%20Josephson">Julien Josephson</a> and <a href="George%20Marion%20Jr.">George Marion Jr.</a> Cornelia was played by <a href="Emily%20Fitzroy">Emily Fitzroy</a>, and <a href="Eddie%20Gribbon">Eddie Gribbon</a> was the Bat. West's wife, <a href="Jewel%20Carmen">Jewel Carmen</a>, played Dale Ogden as her last film role. West made the actors work at night to get them in the mood for the thriller. The film was released by <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> on March 14, 1926. The year before, West had directed an adaptation of one of "The Bat" imitators, "The Monster". Critics considered "The Bat" to be an improvement over that previous film; it received positive reviews and did well at the box office. The film was considered <a href="lost%20film">lost</a> for decades, but a print was discovered in the 1980s.

Following the commercialization of <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>s, West remade the story four years later as "<a href="The%20Bat%20Whispers">The Bat Whispers</a>". The remake, released by United Artists on November 29, 1930, starred <a href="Chester%20Morris">Chester Morris</a> as the Bat and <a href="Una%20Merkel">Una Merkel</a> as Dale; British actress <a href="Grayce%20Hampton">Grayce Hampton</a> played Cornelia. West experimented with early <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> technology by having two <a href="cinematographers">cinematographers</a> film different versions of the movie, one with a standard <a href="35%20mm">35 mm</a> camera, the other with a new <a href="65%20mm">65 mm</a> "Magnifilm" camera. Like the earlier silent film adaptation, "The Bat Whispers" was considered lost until the <a href="UCLA%20Film%20and%20Television%20Archive">UCLA Film and Television Archive</a> restored both the standard and widescreen versions from rediscovered negatives in 1988. The film received mixed reviews and the experiment with widescreen was a financial failure. <a href="Comic-book">Comic-book</a> creator <a href="Bob%20Kane">Bob Kane</a> said in his 1989 <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a>, "<a href="Batman%20and%20Me">Batman and Me</a>", that the villain in "The Bat Whispers" inspired his character <a href="Batman">Batman</a>.
Crane Wilbur wrote and directed a <a href="The%20Bat%20%281959%20film%29">third adaptation of "The Bat"</a>, which was released by <a href="Allied%20Artists%20Pictures%20Corporation">Allied Artists</a> on August 9, 1959. This version emphasized horror, with the Bat (played by <a href="Gavin%20Gordon%20%28actor%29">Gavin Gordon</a>) ripping out the throats of his victims. Dr. Wells (played by horror star <a href="Vincent%20Price">Vincent Price</a>) had a more prominent role, and <a href="Agnes%20Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a> co-starred as Cornelia. This adaptation received mixed reviews when released. It is widely available because its copyright expired, placing it in the <a href="Public%20domain%20in%20the%20United%20States">public domain</a>.

To reinforce the distinction between "The Bat" and "The Circular Staircase", a <a href="novelization">novelization</a> of the play was published by <a href="George%20H.%20Doran%20Company">George H. Doran Company</a> in 1926. Although the adaptation was credited to Rinehart and Hopwood, it was <a href="ghostwriter">ghostwritten</a> by <a href="Stephen%20Vincent%20Ben%C3%A9t">Stephen Vincent Benét</a>.

"The Bat" was adapted for television several times. The <a href="WOR-TV">WOR-TV</a> <a href="anthology%20series">anthology series</a> "<a href="Broadway%20Television%20Theatre">Broadway Television Theatre</a>" aired its version on November 23, 1953, with a cast that included <a href="Estelle%20Winwood">Estelle Winwood</a>, <a href="Alice%20Pearce">Alice Pearce</a> and <a href="Jay%20Jostyn">Jay Jostyn</a>. On March 31, 1960, <a href="NBC">NBC</a>-TV made "The Bat" the first of its "<a href="Dow%20Hour%20of%20Great%20Mysteries">Dow Hour of Great Mysteries</a>" specials. <a href="Helen%20Hayes">Helen Hayes</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Hamilton%20%28actress%29">Margaret Hamilton</a> and <a href="Jason%20Robards">Jason Robards</a> starred in that version.

Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (novel)

Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (; translated to English as The Rose of Cikembang) is a 1927 <a href="Malay%20trade%20and%20creole%20languages">vernacular Malay-language</a> novel written by <a href="Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">Kwee Tek Hoay</a>. The seventeen-chapter book follows a plantation manager, Aij Tjeng, who must leave his beloved "<a href="njai">njai</a>" (<a href="concubine">concubine</a>) Marsiti so that he can be married. Eighteen years later, after Aij Tjeng's daughter Lily dies, her fiancé Bian Koen discovers that Marsiti had a daughter with Aij Tjeng, Roosminah, who greatly resembles Lily. In the end Bian Koen and Roosminah are married.

Inspired by the lyrics to the song "If Those Lips Could Only Speak" and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>", "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" was initially written as an outline for the stage drama troupe Union Dalia. Kwee intermixed several languages other than Malay, particularly Dutch, <a href="Sundanese%20language">Sundanese</a>, and English; he included two quotes from English poems and another from an English song. The novel has been interpreted variously as promotion of <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">theosophy</a>, a treatise on the <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> concept of <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, a call for education, an ode to "njais", and a condemnation of how such women are treated.

The novel was initially published as a <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> in Kwee's magazine "<a href="Panorama%20%28Indies%20magazine%29">Panorama</a>"; it proved to be <a href="List%20of%20works%20by%20Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">his most popular work</a>. By 1930 there had been a number of stage adaptations, not all of which were authorised, leading Kwee to ask readers to help him enforce his <a href="copyright">copyright</a>. The work was filmed <a href="Boenga%20Roos%20dari%20Tjikembang%20%281931%20film%29">in 1931</a> by <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a> and then in 1975 by <a href="Fred%20Young%20%28director%29">Fred Young</a> and <a href="Rempo%20Urip">Rempo Urip</a>. Though not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, the book ranks amongst the most reprinted works of <a href="Chinese%20Malay%20literature">Chinese Malay literature</a>. It has been translated into Dutch and English.

Oh Aij Tjeng is a young <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> man who runs a plantation in <a href="West%20Java">West Java</a>. He lives there with his "<a href="njai">njai</a>" (<a href="concubine">concubine</a>), a <a href="Sundanese%20people">Sundanese</a> woman named Marsiti. The two are deeply in love and promise to be faithful forever. However, not long afterwards Aij Tjeng's father Oh Pin Loh comes to tell Aij Tjeng that he has been <a href="betrothed">betrothed</a> to Gwat Nio, the daughter of the plantation's owner Liok Keng Djim. Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, Tirta disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, but even more polished owing to her better education. He falls in love with her and begins to forget Marsiti, and the couple have a daughter, Lily.

One day Keng Djim calls Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio to his deathbed, where he confesses that he has recently learned that Marsiti was his daughter from a <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> "njai" he had taken as a youth, and that Marsiti had died. He greatly regrets that he and Pin Loh had her chased away from the plantation. Keng Djim hints that there is another secret to be shared, but dies before he can reveal it. Aij Tjeng calls for his father, to discover the secret, but finds that he too has died.

Eighteen years pass, and Lily is betrothed to a rich Chinese youth named Sim Bian Koen. Lily, although beautiful and talented, is obsessed with death and sadness; she believes that she is destined to die young. She eventually tells Bian Koen to find another fiancée as she will soon leave him. She falls ill shortly thereafter, and doctors are unable to save her. In the aftermath, Bian Koen considers suicide and Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio become sick from their despair.

By the following year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends to <a href="Chinese%20Civil%20War">go to war</a> in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.

When he wakes up at his home, Bian Koen tells his parents that he saw Lily in Cikembang. After investigating, the Sims discover that "Lily" is in fact Aij Tjeng's daughter with Marsiti, Roosminah, who was raised in secret by Tirta. Because of her beauty, equal to that of Lily in every way, she is known as "The Rose of Cikembang". The Sims are able to contact Aij Tjeng, and after discovering Roosminah's background they have Roosminah take over Lily's identity. Her extravagant wedding with Bian Koen is attended by thousands, including Marsiti's spirit.

Five years later, Bian Koen and Roosminah live with their two children at the plantation Aij Tjeng used to manage. While Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio are visiting, their granddaughter Elsy (guided by Marsiti's spirit) brings them flowers from a tree Marsiti had planted. The family take it as a sign of her love.

"Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" was written by journalist <a href="Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">Kwee Tek Hoay</a>. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his wife, Kwee had been raised in <a href="Chinese%20culture">Chinese culture</a> and educated at schools that focused on preparing students for life in a modern world, as opposed to promoting tradition for its own sake. By the time he wrote the novel, Kwee was an active proponent of Buddhist teachings. He also wrote extensively on themes relating to native Indonesians and was a keen social observer. Kwee read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay; he drew on these influences after becoming a writer. His <a href="List%20of%20works%20by%20Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">first novel</a>, "Djadi Korbannja "Perempoean Hina"" ("The Victim of a "Contemptible Woman""), was published in 1924.

According to his original introduction, Kwee was inspired to write the novel after hearing his daughter singing Charles Ridgewell and Will Godwin's "If Those Lips Could Only Speak" (identified by Kwee as "Mimi d'Amour"). He was struck by the melancholic lyrics and decided to write a "sad story or stage play" based on it. However, he did not begin the writing process until February 1927, when the Union Dalia Opera requested permission to perform his earlier work "<a href="Allah%20jang%20Palsoe">Allah jang Palsoe</a>" ("A False God"; 1919). As he considered the work too difficult for the native troupe, he began writing an original outline for their performance, based on his musings. Union Dalia performed "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" on 5 March 1927, using an outline Kwee had written; the novel was not completed until 20 April. During a conversation with fellow writer Khouw Sin Eng, Kwee said that part of the story had been based on <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>", particularly the appearance of a dead person coming back to life.

"Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" is divided into seventeen chapters and, in its first printing, was 157 pages in length. As such, it is considerably shorter than some of Kwee's other works. Translator George A. Fowler writes that, unlike works published by <a href="Balai%20Pustaka">Balai Pustaka</a>, the book did not receive a professional <a href="copy%20editing">copyedit</a> before publication; this was common for works of <a href="Chinese%20Malay%20literature">Chinese Malay literature</a>, which "never had, nor indeed wanted, the corrective, prescriptive 'good literary taste' filter of European editors".

"Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" was written in <a href="Malay%20trade%20and%20creole%20languages">vernacular Malay</a>, as common for works by contemporary Chinese writers in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo writes that Kwee's use of the language, one common within contemporary society, was more "modern" than most of the more formal Balai Pustaka publications (perhaps excepting <a href="Abdul%20Muis">Abdoel Moeis</a>' "<a href="Salah%20Asuhan">Salah Asuhan</a>" ["Never the Twain"], published the following year): it remained focused on key events, those required to advance the story as a whole. The book uses non-Malay words commonly: Sumardjo counts 87 Dutch words, 60 from <a href="Sundanese%20language">Sundanese</a>, and 14 English ones.

During dialogue, diction is dependent on the character's social background: Sumardjo writes that Marsiti speaks as a poor villager with little education would, and that Aij Tjeng's father and father-in-law use constructions and give advice only plausible if coming from older people. He finds only one character, the <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>-educated Bian Koen, to be unrealistic: Sumardjo criticises Bian Koen's emotionality, considering it unfitting of an individual with the character's education and life experiences. In other instances Kwee builds suspense by extended use of <a href="ellipsis">ellipses</a>, a form which Sumardjo suggests was inspired by contemporary "<a href="silat">silat</a>" (traditional martial arts) stories.

As was conventional in contemporary novels such as <a href="Marah%20Roesli">Marah Roesli</a>'s "<a href="Sitti%20Nurbaya">Sitti Nurbaya</a>" (1922), "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" integrates poetic verse into its narrative. One example, an original work in Sundanese, is sung by Marsiti after confiding her dream to Aij Tjeng. Two others are quoted from English poems. The first is an untitled work by Irish poet <a href="Thomas%20Moore">Thomas Moore</a>, beginning with the lines "Go, let me weep". The second is the <a href="Epigraph%20%28literature%29">epigraph</a> from the novel "<a href="Hyperion%20%28Longfellow%20novel%29">Hyperion</a>" (1839) by American writer <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>. A final piece of verse consists of the lyrics that inspired Kwee to write the novel. Malay-language translations are provided for all English and Sundanese quotations. An example is one of three quatrains sung by Marsiti:

In his foreword, Kwee wrote that "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" was intended to lead readers to consider how fate is often at odds with the wants of those involved. Critical readings have, however, been diverse. The <a href="sinologist">sinologist</a> <a href="Myra%20Sidharta">Myra Sidharta</a> notes that the book is replete with mysticism common at the time, as does another sinologist, John Kwee. The latter cites four examples: a dream of Marsiti's, later shown to be prophetic, in which she is forcibly separated from Aij Tjeng despite his previous promise that they would never part; a discussion of reuniting with loved ones after death; Marsiti's spirit attending her daughter's wedding; and a scene towards the end of the novel in which Marsiti's spirit guides Roosminah's daughter to pick flowers for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. <a href="Nio%20Joe%20Lan">Nio Joe Lan</a>, in his history of Chinese Malay literature, notes that Kwee was the only Chinese writer of romances to also write on <a href="Eastern%20philosophy">Eastern</a> (particularly <a href="Chinese%20philosophy">Chinese</a>) philosophy. He finds mysticism to be a common theme in Kwee's works, noting it as particularly well-developed in the later novel "Soemangetnja Boenga Tjempaka" ("The Joy of the Cempaka Flowers").

Eric Oey of the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, writes that the novel's mysticism builds into a promotion of <a href="Theosophy%20%28Blavatskian%29">theosophy</a> and Buddhist ideals: Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio read about both, then leave their materialistic lives to become more spiritual. Ultimately, he writes, the concept of <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> is put forth when Roosminah is discovered soon after Lily's death. Faruk of <a href="Gadjah%20Mada%20University">Gadjah Mada University</a> also notes the novel's concept of reincarnation, drawing on its repeated emphasis on the parallels (both physical and psychological) between the half-sisters Marsiti and Gwat Nio, as well as Lily and Roosminah.
Sidharta, considering the same interrelations between Marsiti/Gwat Nio, does not suggest reincarnation, instead writing that the novel showed that there is no difference in the love of a "njai" and a lawfully wedded wife. Translator Maya Sutedja-Liem, in a similar vein, notes a "modern" message against mistreatment of "njais". However, she concludes that the emphasis on the mystical powers which Marsiti seems to possess causes an abandonment of <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a>, thus rendering the book "anti-modern".

Much commentary has focused on the novel's depiction of "njais", a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes the novel as an <a href="ode">ode</a> to "njais", citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept "njais", showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this was manifested in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed "njai" (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the "njai" within the story, considering the novel to be an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines.

Sidharta suggests that the novel was written as an argument that the <a href="illegitimate%20children">illegitimate children</a> of "njais" would be able to develop as any other person, given the proper education. Sutedja-Liem likewise finds that the need for education (including an understanding of music) is a subtext found in the novel. However, unlike Sidharta she considers this message directed not only at the children of "njais", but women in general. Only through receiving an education and following Chinese and European <a href="etiquette">etiquette</a>, she writes, could a woman be considered truly "modern".

"Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" was originally published in 1927, as a <a href="serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> in Kwee's magazine "<a href="Panorama%20%28Indies%20magazine%29">Panorama</a>", running from March to September. The story was compiled as a book later that year and published by Hoa Siang In Kiok. This print run of 1,000 copies, with the slogan "Roh manoesia djadi mateng dalem tangis / The soul ripens in tears" on its cover, sold out. However, in the foreword to the second edition Kwee suggested that "writing Malay novels ... was not enough to live on".

The book has since proved to be one of Kwee's most popular novels, and is one of the most commonly reprinted works of Chinese Malay literature. Its second printing was in 1930, by Kwee's publishing house Panorama, with a third printing by Swastika in 1963; at the time it was the only work of Chinese Malay literature to have been republished after the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a> (1945–49). Sidharta records a fourth printing in 1972, although she does not note a publisher. A new printing, adapting the <a href="EYD">1972 spelling reform</a>, was included in the second volume of "Kesastraan Melayu Tionghoa dan Kebangsaan Indonesia", an anthology of Chinese Malay literature.

Several translations have been made. In 2007 "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" was translated to Dutch as "De roos uit Tjikembang" by Sutedja-Liem; this edition was published by <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Institute%20of%20Southeast%20Asian%20and%20Caribbean%20Studies">KITLV Press</a> as part of the anthology "De Njai: Moeder van Alle Volken: 'De Roos uit Tjikembang' en Andere Verhalen" ("The Njai: Mother of All Peoples: 'De Roos uit Tjikembang' and Other Stories"). In 2013 the <a href="Lontar%20Foundation">Lontar Foundation</a> published an English-language translation by Fowler under the title "The Rose of Cikembang". This included an introduction to the subject and social conditions, penned by Fowler.

Stage performances and adaptations of "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang" began before the novel was completed, beginning with the Union Dalia performance in 1927. By 1930 numerous native and ethnic-Chinese troupes had performed the story; some received direct help from Kwee. Though these stage performances were sometimes credited for the novel's success, Kwee discounted the idea, writing that the two mediums were different and, in adaptations, changes were necessary. He noted the tendency of native troupes to emphasise Marsiti's role as one such change and considered most such adaptations – excepting those performed by <a href="Dardanella%20%28theatre%20company%29">Dardanella</a> – to be of poor quality. He also found wrote that Native troupes generally did not pay him for the right to use the story, and in the 1930 edition Kwee asked readers to help him enforce his copyright by informing "Panorama" of any illegal performances. Stage performances have continued into the 2000s.

The novel has twice been adapted for film. The first adaptation, <a href="Boenga%20Roos%20dari%20Tjikembang%20%281931%20film%29">released in 1931</a>, was directed by <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>. The sinologist <a href="Leo%20Suryadinata">Leo Suryadinata</a> lists it as the first <a href="list%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestically produced</a> sound film in the Dutch East Indies, although the film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> suggests that there was already a <a href="Karnadi%20Anemer%20Bangkong">domestic talkie</a> released in 1930. In 1975 <a href="Bunga%20Roos%20dari%20Cikembang%20%281975%20film%29">an adaptation</a> was made by <a href="Fred%20Young%20%28director%29">Fred Young</a> and <a href="Rempo%20Urip">Rempo Urip</a> under the title "Bunga Roos dari Cikembang". Although the main points of the story remained the same, several of the Chinese names were Indonesianised. Oh Aij Cheng, for example, was renamed Wiranta, while Gwat Nio's name was changed to Salmah.

Modern reviews of the novel have been positive. Nio describes the book as a "beautiful tragic romance" that "enchants the heart." The Indonesian scholar of Indonesian literature Jakob Sumardjo writes that, though in most of his works Kwee appeared to be strongly impressing his point of view on the reader to the point of "tearing the novels' structural balance", this flaw was not present in "Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang"; instead, Sumardjo finds it "truly good in its form and technique, though the ideals contained within may not be that significant".

Fowler writes that the love between Aij Tjeng and Marsiti is handled with "unusual delicacy and tenderness" despite the social ostracism faced by "njais". In a review of the English edition for "<a href="The%20Jakarta%20Post">The Jakarta Post</a>", Linawati Sidarto describes it as "the ultimate weekend read", "tugging at emotions with the intrigues of love, lies and sacrifice" while at the same time providing an interesting insight into the now-forgotten society in which it takes place. She describes Fowler's introduction as "worth reading by itself".

As with all works written in vernacular Malay, the novel has not been considered part of the Indonesian literary canon. In his doctoral thesis, J. Francisco B. Benitez posits a socio-political cause for this. The Dutch colonial government used <a href="Malay%20language">Court Malay</a> as a "language of administration", a language for everyday dealings, while the Indonesian nationalists appropriated the language to help build a national culture. Chinese Malay literature, written in "low" Malay, was steadily marginalised. Sumardjo, however, sees a question of classification: though vernacular Malay was the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of the time, it was not Indonesian, and as such, he asks whether works in vernacular Malay should be classified as local literature, Indonesian literature, or simply Chinese Malay literature.

Fantastic Novels

Fantastic Novels was an American <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="Fantasy%20literature">fantasy</a> <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by the <a href="Frank%20A.%20Munsey%20Company">Munsey Company</a> of New York from 1940 to 1941, and again by <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, also of New York, from 1948 to 1951. It was a companion to "<a href="Famous%20Fantastic%20Mysteries">Famous Fantastic Mysteries</a>." Like that magazine, it mostly reprinted science fiction and fantasy classics from earlier decades, such as novels by <a href="A.%20Merritt">A. Merritt</a>, <a href="George%20Allan%20England">George Allan England</a>, and <a href="Victor%20Rousseau%20Emanuel">Victor Rousseau</a>, though it occasionally published reprints of more recent work, such as "<a href="Earth%27s%20Last%20Citadel">Earth's Last Citadel</a>", by <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a> and <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C. L. Moore</a>. 

The magazine lasted for 5 issues in its first incarnation, and for another 20 in the revived version from Popular Publications. <a href="Mary%20Gnaedinger">Mary Gnaedinger</a> edited both series; her interest in reprinting Merritt's work helped make him one of the better-known fantasy writers of the era. A Canadian edition from 1948 to 1951 reprinted 17 issues of the second series; two others were reprinted in Great Britain in 1950 and 1951.

In the early 20th century, science fiction stories were frequently published in popular magazines, with the <a href="Frank%20A.%20Munsey%20Company">Munsey Company</a>, a major <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> publisher, printing a great deal of science fiction. In 1926 "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>" became the first specialist pulp magazine publisher of science fiction. Munsey continued to print sf in "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>" during the 1930s, and in 1939 took advantage of the new genre's growing popularity by launching "<a href="Famous%20Fantastic%20Mysteries">Famous Fantastic Mysteries</a>", a vehicle to reprint the most popular fantasy and sf stories from the Munsey magazines.

The new title immediately became successful, and demand for reprints of old favorites was such that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, "Fantastic Novels", in July 1940, edited, like "Famous Fantastic Mysteries", by Mary Gnaedinger. The two magazines were placed on bimonthly schedules, arranged to alternate with each other, though the schedule slipped slightly with the fifth issue of "Fantastic Novels", dated April 1941 but following the January 1941 issue. "Fantastic Novels" was suspended after that issue and merged with "Famous Fantastic Mysteries". The stated reason was that "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" "is apparently the favorite title", but it seems likely that production difficulties caused by World War II played a part. The June 1941 and August 1941 issues of "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" both carried the slogan "Combined with Fantastic Novels Magazine" on the cover.

"Fantastic Novels" reappeared in 1948 through <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, which had acquired "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" from Munsey at the end of 1942. Gnaedinger remained editor of "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" when Popular took over, and was editor of the second incarnation of "Fantastic Novels". The March 1948 issue, the first of the new series, was catalogued volume 1, number 6, as if there had been no break in publication. This version lasted for a further 20 issues, ending without notice with the June 1951 issue. It was apparently a sudden decision; the final issue had announced plans to reprint <a href="Otis%20Adelbert%20Kline">Otis Adelbert Kline</a>'s "Maza of the Moon".

"Fantastic Novels" came into existence because of the demand from readers of "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" for book-length reprints. Gnaedinger observed that "Everyone seems to have realized that although [the] set-up of five to seven stories with two serials running, was highly satisfactory, that the long list of novels would have to be speeded up somehow". When the new magazine was launched, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" was partway through serialization of <a href="Austin%20Hall%20%28writer%29">Austin Hall</a> and <a href="Homer%20Eon%20Flint">Homer Eon Flint</a>'s "The Blind Spot", with the third episode appearing in the May/June 1940 issue. Rather than complete the serialization, Gnaedinger printed the novel in its entirety in the first issue of "Fantastic Novels", ensuring that readers of "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" would also acquire the new magazine. Over the next four issues she printed <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>' "People of the Golden Atom", <a href="Ralph%20Milne%20Farley">Ralph Milne Farley</a>'s "The Radio Beasts", and two novels by <a href="A.%20Merritt">A. Merritt</a>: "The Snake Mother" and "The Dwellers in the Mirage". Gnaedinger's interest in reprinting Merritt's work helped make him one of the better-known fantasy writers of the era.

In the second series, from 1948 to 1951, Gnaedinger continued to reprint work by Merritt, along with other reader favorites from the Munsey years. Works by <a href="George%20Allan%20England">George Allan England</a>, <a href="Victor%20Rousseau%20Emanuel">Victor Rousseau</a>, Ray Cummings, and Francis Stevens (the pen name of <a href="Gertrude%20Barrows%20Bennett">Gertrude Barrows Bennett</a>) appeared, as well as (occasionally) reprints of more recent work, such as "<a href="Earth%27s%20Last%20Citadel">Earth's Last Citadel</a>", by <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a> and <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C. L. Moore</a>, which had been serialized in "Argosy" in 1943. In the early 1950s, when first "Fantastic Novels" and two years later "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" ceased publication, it is likely that the audience for science fiction was growing too sophisticated for these early works.

Each issue, except the last one, featured a lead novel with additional short fiction. The cover artwork was mostly by <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Stevens%20%28artist%29">Lawrence Stevens</a>, <a href="Peter%20Stevens%20%28artist%29">Peter Stevens</a>, and <a href="Norman%20Saunders">Norman Saunders</a>, with one early cover contributed by <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a>.

Mary Gnaedinger edited "Fantastic Novels" for both the Munsey and Popular Publication series. Five issues appeared between July 1940 and April 1941, and an additional twenty from March 1948 to June 1951. The schedule was bimonthly, with only two irregularities: the issues that would have been dated March 1941 and March 1951 were each delayed by a month. The volume numbering was regular throughout, with four volumes of six numbers, and a final fifth volume of one number. The magazine was printed in pulp format throughout both series, and was priced at 20 cents for the first two issues; then 10 cents for the remainder of the first series and 25 cents for issues in the second series. "Fantastic Novels" was 144 pages for the first two issues, 128 pages for two issues, and 112 pages for the last issue of the first series; it was 132 pages from the start of the second series until the November 1950 issue, and then 128 pages for January 1951, and 112 pages for the last two issues.

A Canadian reprint edition ran from September 1948 to June 1951; these were published by the Toronto-based New Publications. They were half an inch taller than the U.S. editions and used different back-cover advertisements, but were otherwise identical to the U.S. issues of the same date. Two issues were released in Britain: a single issue was released in March 1950; it was a copy of the November 1949 U.S. issue but was neither numbered nor dated. The other British issue was a copy of the May 1949 issue, cut to only 64 pages; it was released in June 1951 and was undated but numbered 1. Both these issues were published by Pemberton's and distributed by Thorpe & Porter.

Cosmic Stories and Stirring Science Stories

Cosmic Stories (also known as Cosmic Science-Fiction) and Stirring Science Stories were two American <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>s that published a total of seven issues in 1941 and 1942. Both "Cosmic" and "Stirring" were edited by <a href="Donald%20A.%20Wollheim">Donald A. Wollheim</a> and launched by the same publisher, appearing in alternate months. Wollheim had no budget at all for fiction, so he solicited stories from his friends among the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of young <a href="Science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fans</a> including <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> and <a href="C.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BM.%20Kornbluth">C. M. Kornbluth</a>. <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> contributed a story, but later insisted on payment after hearing that <a href="F.%20Orlin%20Tremaine">F. Orlin Tremaine</a>, the editor of the competing science fiction magazine "<a href="Comet%20%28magazine%29">Comet</a>", was irate at the idea of a magazine that might "siphon readership from magazines that paid", and thought that authors who contributed should be blacklisted. Kornbluth was the most prolific contributor, under several pseudonyms; one of his stories, "Thirteen O'Clock", published under the pseudonym "Cecil Corwin", was very successful, and helped to make his reputation in the field. The magazines ceased publication in late 1941, but Wollheim was able to find a publisher for one further issue of "Stirring Science Stories" in March 1942 before war restrictions forced it to close again.

Other well-known writers who appeared in the two magazines included <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a> and <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>. Knight's first published story, "Resilience", appeared in the February 1941 issue of "Stirring Stories", but the story was ruined by a misprint in a crucial word in the first sentence. Keller was an established writer in the field, but Wollheim was aware that Keller occasionally donated material to fanzines, and was able to obtain a story from him. The quality of the artwork was variable; it included <a href="Elliot%20Dold">Elliot Dold</a>'s last artwork in the <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> field, for the cover of the July 1941 issue of "Cosmic Stories", and several covers and interior drawings by <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>, who later became a well-known artist in the field.

Although <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> had been published in the United States before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s the field was booming, and between 1939 and 1941 a flood of new sf magazines appeared. In late 1940, <a href="Donald%20A.%20Wollheim">Donald A. Wollheim</a>, an active science fiction fan and aspiring editor and writer, noticed a new magazine titled "Stirring Detective and Western Stories" on the newsstands. He wrote to the publishers, Albing Publications, to see if they were interested in adding a science fiction title to their list, and he was invited to their office. Wollheim later recalled the meeting:

Wollheim sent a letter out to his contacts in science fiction fandom, announcing the new magazines. Originally the plan had been to publish a single monthly title, but this was changed by the publisher to two alternating bimonthly magazines, to be called "Cosmic Stories" and "Stirring Science Stories". The first to appear was the February 1941 issue of "Stirring Science Stories". Wollheim had announced a planned newsstand date of 15 December 1940, but according to Damon Knight's later recollection the magazine appeared in January 1941. The two titles alternated months until the July 1941 issue of "Cosmic Stories" (by that time retitled "Cosmic Science-Fiction" on the cover), after which the magazines were cancelled. Some months later Wollheim was able to find another publisher, Manhattan Fiction Publications, and a fourth issue of "Stirring" appeared, dated March 1942. Wartime constraints prevented the new publisher from continuing, and there were no more issues of either title.

An announcement in the January 1941 "<a href="Writer%27s%20Digest">Writer's Digest</a>" listed the payment rate as half a cent per word. This was a low rate, but it would have been on a par with many other magazines of the era, had Wollheim been able to achieve it. In the event he was able to start paying small amounts to his authors after the first couple of issues; C.M. Kornbluth was paid for several of his later stories for the two magazines, though the rates were well below half a cent per word.

"Stirring Science Stories" was presented by Wollheim as if it were two separate magazines bound together; the first half of the magazine was titled "Stirring Science-Fiction", and the second half "Stirring Fantasy-Fiction". An editorial and letters section, titled "The Vortex", separated the two. Wollheim described his approach in the first issue, saying ""Stirring Science Stories" isn't really one magazine but two. A sort of Siamese twin embracing within its covers for the first time in publishing history a science fiction magazine and a weird-fantasy magazine".

Wollheim was a member of the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of New York science fiction fans, many of whom were also starting to be published writers. Some, including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, <a href="C.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BM.%20Kornbluth">C. M. Kornbluth</a>, and <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, were later to become very successful in the field. <a href="Robert%20A.%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert A. W. Lowndes</a>, another Futurian, took on the task of finding free material for Wollheim to fill the first two issues. Two of the Futurians (Lowndes and Pohl) were already working as editors of recently launched sf magazines, and there were many other paying markets for science fiction at that time, but the Futurians were so prolific that Wollheim was able to obtain much of his material from them. Wollheim also published some of his own stories in the two magazines. Kornbluth provided Wollheim with more stories than anyone else, using several aliases, including "Cecil Corwin", "S.D. Gottesman", and "Kenneth Falconer". Other Futurians who contributed material included Blish, Lowndes, <a href="Walter%20Kubilius">Walter Kubilius</a>, <a href="David%20Kyle">David Kyle</a>, and <a href="John%20B.%20Michel">John B. Michel</a>; the stories, often collaborations between two or more of the Futurians, were published under a variety of pseudonyms. Damon Knight's first story, "Resilience", appeared in the February 1941 issue of "Stirring" with an unfortunate printer's error in the first sentence of the story that rendered the plot incomprehensible. Knight would later become a member of the Futurians, but he was still living in Oregon at the time the story appeared in print.

"Thirteen O'Clock", by Kornbluth, is generally regarded as the best story in the first issue of "Stirring"; Knight describes it as "a delightful screwball fantasy", and adds that it made Kornbluth's reputation. Other stories from later issues that have been well-received include "The Long Wall", by Lowndes; "The City in the Sofa", "What Sorghum Says", "The Golden Road", and "The Words of Guru", all by Kornbluth; "The Real Thrill" by Blish; and "The Goblins Will Get You", by Michel. Isaac Asimov contributed a story, "<a href="The%20Secret%20Sense">The Secret Sense</a>", which appeared in the March 1941 issue of "Cosmic". After Wollheim acquired the story, Asimov met with <a href="F.%20Orlin%20Tremaine">F. Orlin Tremaine</a>, the editor of "<a href="Comet%20%28magazine%29">Comet</a>"—a competing science fiction magazine—and discovered that Tremaine was irate at the idea of a magazine that might "siphon readership from magazines that paid" by taking stories without paying the authors. Tremaine felt that any author who contributed a story to these magazines should be blacklisted. Asimov acknowledged that a story of his would be appearing in "Cosmic", but told Tremaine that he had been paid for it. In Asimov's autobiographical anthology "<a href="The%20Early%20Asimov">The Early Asimov</a>" he recalls that after hearing Tremaine's comments he requested a token payment of $5 from Wollheim; in Asimov's autobiography "<a href="In%20Memory%20Yet%20Green">In Memory Yet Green</a>" the sequence of events is given slightly differently, with Asimov asking Wollheim for payment, or else for the story to be published under a pseudonym, before the story was published. This was requested on the grounds that "even though the story might be worth nothing, my name was worth something". Wollheim reluctantly agreed to a payment of $5, commenting that it was an effective word rate of $2.50 per word, since he was paying only for the use of Asimov's name. Wollheim later commented that because of the payment he could sue Asimov for royalties whenever the latter's name appeared in print.

In contrast to Tremaine's attitude, <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>, the editor of the leading science fiction magazine, "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>", was not concerned by Albing's policy. Campbell felt that any story that an author was willing to give away would be so poor that the new magazines would not be competitive. Although Campbell was correct that the magazine was unable to compete with paying magazines, Wollheim managed to produce, in Damon Knight's words, "a rather surprising level of quality".

As well as stories from the Futurians, Wollheim was able to obtain some material from established names in the field, including <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a> and <a href="Clark%20Ashton%20Smith">Clark Ashton Smith</a>. Keller occasionally gave material to fan magazines, and Wollheim would have been aware of this when he began looking for free stories.

Wollheim was fortunate in obtaining a good deal of artwork from <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>, later to become a popular artist in the field. Bok was enthusiastic enough about Kornbluth's "Thirteen O'Clock" to produce more interior drawings than Wollheim had room for in that issue; they were eventually used to advertise the magazine in later issues. For the February 1941 issue of "Stirring Science Stories", the $15 art budget went to <a href="Leo%20Morey">Leo Morey</a>, an established artist. Morey's cover was undistinguished; Damon Knight commented later that the door to the airlock in the picture evidently did not fit, and that at $15 Morey was overpaid. Wollheim also obtained free art from Roy Hunt, an artist based in Denver. The cover for the July 1941 issue of "Cosmic Stories "was by <a href="Elliott%20Dold">Elliott Dold</a>; Dold was at one time regarded as one of the most important sf artists, but this was the last work he did in the science fiction field. The cover has been described by sf historian Mark Rich as "excellent ... [it] accurately illustrates a scene" from "Interference", a story by Kornbluth published under the pseudonym "Walter C. Davies".

Donald A. Wollheim was the editor for all issues of both "Cosmic Stories" and "Stirring Science Stories". "Cosmic" had a single volume of three numbers; "Stirring" also was numbered in volumes of three issues, but reached volume 2 number 1 with its last issue. Initially the two magazines appeared on an alternating bimonthly schedule, with "Stirring"'s first issue appearing in February 1941 and "Cosmic"'s first issue the following month; after three issues each there was a long delay before a final issue of "Stirring" appeared in March 1942. "Cosmic" was titled "Cosmic Science-Fiction" on the cover for the second and third issues, though it remained "Cosmic Stories" on the masthead. The publisher for all issues of "Cosmic" and the first three issues of "Stirring" was Albing Publications of New York; the final issue of "Stirring" was published by Manhattan Fiction Publications of New York. Both magazines were priced at 15 cents throughout. "Stirring" was pulp format and 128 pages long for the first three issues, and switched to large pulp format with 68 pages for the last issue. "Cosmic" was 130 pages for the first two issues, and 116 pages for the last issue; all were in pulp format.

Marvel Science Stories

Marvel Science Stories was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> that ran for a total of fifteen issues in two separate runs, both edited by Robert O. Erisman. The publisher for the first run was Postal Publications, and the second run was published by Western Publishing; both companies were owned by Abraham and <a href="Martin%20Goodman%20%28publisher%29">Martin Goodman</a>. The first issue was dated August 1938, and carried stories with more sexual content than was usual for the genre, including several stories by <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a>, under his own name and also under <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>s. Reaction was generally negative, with one reader referring to Kuttner's story "The Time Trap" as "trash". This was the first of several titles featuring the word "Marvel", and <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> came from the same stable in the following year.

The magazine was canceled after the April 1941 issue, but when a boom in <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>s began in 1950, the publishers revived it. The first issue of the new series was dated November 1950; a further six issues appeared, the last dated May 1952. In addition to Kuttner, contributors to the first run included <a href="Arthur%20J.%20Burks">Arthur J. Burks</a> and <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>; the second run published stories by <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>, among others. In the opinion of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> historian Joseph Marchesani, the quality of the second incarnation of the magazine was superior to the first, but it was unable to compete with the new higher-quality magazines that had appeared in the interim.

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. After 1931, when "<a href="Miracle%20Science%20and%20Fantasy%20Stories">Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories</a>" was launched, no new sf magazines appeared for several years. In 1936 Abraham and <a href="Martin%20Goodman%20%28publisher%29">Martin Goodman</a>, two brothers who owned a publishing company with multiple <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprints</a>, launched "<a href="Ka-Zar%20%28magazine%29">Ka-Zar</a>", an imitation <a href="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> magazine with some borderline sf content. It lasted for three issues, with the last issue dated January 1937. In addition to this marginal sf magazine, in 1937 the Goodmans began publishing several "weird-menace" pulps. These were a genre of pulp magazine known for incorporating "sex and <a href="sadism%20and%20masochism%20in%20fiction">sadism</a>", with storylines that placed women in danger, usually because of a threat that appeared to be supernatural but was ultimately revealed to be the work of a human villain. The Goodmans' titles were "Detective Short Stories", launched in August 1937, and "Mystery Tales", which published its first issue in March 1938. These were followed up by "Marvel Science Stories", edited by Robert O. Erisman, which was not intended to be a weird-menace pulp, but rather an sf magazine. The influence of the "sex and sadism" side of the Goodman's portfolio of magazines was apparent, however: authors were sometimes asked to add more sex to their stories than was usual in sf at the time. This was the first time that the word "Marvel" was used in the title of a Goodman publication. It went on to be used in other titles, notably <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> in the following year. The word may have been chosen to appeal to advertisers Marvel Home Utilities and <a href="Marvel%20Mystery%20Oil">Marvel Mystery Oil</a>, or it may have been that Martin Goodman liked the name because it was similar to his own.

The first issue, dated August 1938, appeared on newsstands in May of that year. It contained "Survival" by <a href="Arthur%20J.%20Burks">Arthur J. Burks</a> as the lead novel; this was well received by the readers, and did not contain any sexual content. The first couple of issues contained several stories that did little to offend readers, but they also contained two stories by <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a>, who was selling regularly to the Goodmans' other publications. Erisman and the Goodmans had asked Kuttner to spice up his submissions to "Marvel Science Stories". He obliged with "Avengers of Space" in the first issue, which included "scenes of aliens lusting after unclothed Earth women", in the words of sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, and "The Time Trap" in the second issue. Reader reaction was strongly negative: a typical letter, from <a href="William%20Hamling%20%28publisher%29">William Hamling</a>, later to become a publisher and editor of science fiction magazines in his own right, commented, "I was just about to write you a letter of complete congratulations when my eyes fell upon Kuttner's "The Time Trap". All I can say is: PLEASE, in the future, dislodge such trash from your magazine". In addition to these two stories published under Kuttner's name, there were two more stories in the same two issues by him under pseudonyms which were equally offensive to readers such as Hamling.

After five issues, the title was changed to "Marvel Tales"; at the same time, the number of stories advertised as "passionate" or containing "sin-lost" or "lust-crazed" characters sharply increased. Though some stories contained little to match the titillating blurbs, others did, with "women entrapped, burned and otherwise maltreated, and whips cracking into use with uninventive frequency", according to sf historian Joseph Marchesani. While women with large breasts often appeared on pulp magazine covers, "Marvel"s content was unusually explicit. <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> wrote in 1969 of how in "1938-39 ... for some half a dozen issues or so, a magazine I won't name" published "spicy" stories about "the hot passion of alien monsters for Earthwomen. Clothes were always getting ripped off and breasts were described in a variety of elliptical phrases" for its "few readers" before "the magazine died a deserved death". 

The magazine ceased publication with the April 1941 issue, but in 1950 the Goodmans saw an opportunity to revive it when a new boom in science fiction magazines got under way. Erisman was still working for the Goodmans, and was listed as editorial director of the new version of the magazine, but much of the editorial work was done by <a href="Daniel%20Keyes">Daniel Keyes</a>, who was credited as "Editorial Associate" on the 1951 issues. The first issue of the new incarnation of "Marvel Science Stories" was dated November 1950. After two issues Erisman switched the magazine to a <a href="digest%20size">digest</a> format, but the final issue, dated May 1952, was once again a pulp. The post-war issues contained stories by well-known writers, including <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, Asimov, <a href="Richard%20Matheson">Richard Matheson</a>, <a href="William%20Tenn">William Tenn</a>, <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, and <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a>, but the stories were of only average quality. In Marchesani's opinion, Erisman and Keyes were able to improve on the material published in the pre-war "Marvel Tales", but the field had grown more sophisticated since those days, and the writers who sold to "Marvel Tales" were now publishing their best work elsewhere. William Knoles's 1960 "<a href="Playboy%20%28magazine%29">Playboy</a>" article on the pulp era, "Girls of the Slime God", was, Asimov said, mostly based on "Marvel".

There were nine issues in the first sequence, in one volume of six numbers and a second volume of three numbers. All issues in the first run were in pulp format and were priced at 15 cents. The first four issues were 128 pages; the next five were 112 pages. The title was "Marvel Science Stories" for five issues, then "Marvel Tales" for two issues, and then "Marvel Stories" for the last two issues of the first run. The publisher for the first series was listed as Postal Publications of Chicago for the first four issues, and as Western Publishing of New York and Chicago; in both cases the owner was Martin and Abraham Goodman. The intended schedule was bimonthly but this was never achieved. The editor was Robert O. Erisman. The second incarnation of the magazine lasted for six issues on a more regular quarterly schedule, starting in November 1950. The price was 25 cents and the page count was 128 pages for all six issues; the first two issues and last issue of this sequence were in pulp format, and the three from May 1951 to November 1951 were in digest format. The title returned to "Marvel Science Stories" for the first three issues of this series, and changed to "Marvel Science Fiction" for the last three issues. The publisher was listed as Stadium Publishing of New York; as with the first series, Martin and Abraham Goodman were the owners.

There was a British reprint of the February 1951 issue, published by <a href="Thorpe%20%26amp%3B%20Porter">Thorpe & Porter</a> and dated May 1951. Science fiction bibliographer Brad Day lists five other British reprints of the second series of "Marvel Science Stories," but no copies are recorded by more recent bibliographers. In 1977 the Goodmans launched a digest science fiction magazine titled "<a href="Skyworlds">Skyworlds</a>", which has been described by Mike Ashley as "without any shadow of a doubt, the worst" of the 1970s crop of science fiction magazines; the fiction it contained was almost entirely reprinted from the second series of "Marvel Science Stories".
