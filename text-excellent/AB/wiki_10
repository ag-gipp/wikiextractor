Clinton Engineer Works

The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> that during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> produced the <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a> used in the 1945 <a href="bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">bombing of Hiroshima</a>, as well as the first examples of <a href="nuclear%20reactor">reactor-produced</a> <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a <a href="power%20plant">power plant</a>, and the town of <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge</a>. It was in <a href="East%20Tennessee">East Tennessee</a>, about west of <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville</a>, and was named after the town of <a href="Clinton%2C%20Tennessee">Clinton</a>, to the north. The production facilities were mainly in <a href="Roane%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Roane County</a>, and the northern part of the site was in <a href="Anderson%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Anderson County</a>. The Manhattan District Engineer, <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a>, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>.

Construction workers were housed in a community known as <a href="Happy%20Valley%2C%20Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Happy Valley</a>. Built by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000. The town was developed by the federal government as a <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregated community</a>; black residents lived only in an area known as Gamble Valley, in government-built "hutments" (one-room shacks) on the south side of what is now Tuskegee Drive.

In 1942, the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> was attempting to construct the first <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s. This would require production facilities, and by June 1942 the project had reached the stage where their construction could be contemplated. On 25 June, the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) <a href="S-1%20Executive%20Committee">S-1 Executive Committee</a> deliberated on where they should be located. <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20D.%20Styer">Wilhelm D. Styer</a> recommended that the different manufacturing facilities be built at the same site in order to simplify security and construction. Such a site would require a substantial tract of land to accommodate both the facilities and housing for the thousands of workers. The <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> processing plant needed to be from the site boundary and any other installation, in case radioactive <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a> escaped. While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation. A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable. Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The <a href="stratum">substratum</a> needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work. It was estimated that the proposed plants would need access to 150,000 <a href="Watt%23Kilowatt">kW</a> of electrical power and of water per minute. A <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> policy held that, as a rule, munitions facilities should not be located west of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra</a> or <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>s, east of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>, or within of the Canadian or Mexican borders.

Several sites were considered in the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a>, two in the Chicago area, one near the <a href="Shasta%20Dam">Shasta Dam</a> in California, and some in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state</a>, where the <a href="Hanford%20site">Hanford site</a> was eventually established. An OSRD team had selected the <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville</a> area in April 1942, and in May <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, the director of the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a>, had met with Gordon R. Clapp, the General Manager of the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> (TVA). The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District (MED), <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="James%20C.%20Marshall">James C. Marshall</a>, asked Colonel <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves Jr.</a> to undertake a study within the Army's Office of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Engineers">Chief of Engineers</a>. After receiving assurances that the TVA could supply the required quantity of electric power if given priority for procuring some needed equipment, Groves also concluded that the Knoxville area was suitable. The only voice of dissent at the 25 June meeting was <a href="Ernest%20O.%20Lawrence">Ernest O. Lawrence</a>, who wanted the <a href="electromagnetic%20separation">electromagnetic separation</a> plant located much nearer to his <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> in California. The Shasta Dam area remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection.

On 1 July, Marshall and his deputy, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a>, surveyed sites in the Knoxville area with representatives of the TVA and <a href="Stone%20%26amp%3B%20Webster">Stone & Webster</a>, the designated construction contractor. No perfectly suitable site was found, and Marshall even ordered another survey of the <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a> area. At the time, the proposed <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, <a href="gas%20centrifuge">gas centrifuge</a> and <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> technologies were still in the research stage, and the design of the plant was a long way off. The schedules, which called for construction work on the nuclear reactor to commence by 1 October 1942, the electromagnetic plant by 1 November, the centrifugal plant by 1 January 1943 and the gaseous diffusion plant by 1 March, were unrealistic. While work could not commence on the plants, a start could be made on the housing and administrative buildings. Stone & Webster therefore drew up a detailed report on the most promising site, about west of Knoxville. <a href="Stephane%20Groueff">Stephane Groueff</a> later wrote:
The site was located in <a href="Roane%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Roane County</a> and <a href="Anderson%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Anderson County</a>, and lay roughly halfway between the two <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a>s of <a href="Kingston%2C%20Tennessee">Kingston</a> and <a href="Clinton%2C%20Tennessee">Clinton</a>. Its greatest drawback was that a major road, <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Route%2061">Tennessee State Route 61</a>, ran through it. Stone & Webster considered the possibility of re-routing the road. The <a href="Great%20Lakes%20and%20Ohio%20River%20Division">Ohio River Division</a> (ORD) of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a> estimated that it would cost $4.25 million to purchase the entire site.

Groves became the director of the Manhattan Project on 23 September, with the rank of brigadier general. That afternoon, he took a train to Knoxville, where he met with Marshall. After touring the site, Groves concluded that the site "was an even better choice than I had anticipated". He called Colonel John J. O'Brien of the Corps of Engineers' Real Estate Branch, and told him to proceed with acquiring the land. The site was initially known as the Kingston Demolition Range; it officially became the Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) in January 1943, and was given the codename Site X. After the township was established in mid-1943, the name Oak Ridge was chosen from employee suggestions. It met with the Manhattan District's approval because "its rural connotation held outside curiosity to a minimum". Oak Ridge then became the site's postal address, but the site itself was not officially renamed Oak Ridge until 1947.

Although War Department policy maintained that land should be acquired by direct purchase, as time was short it was decided to proceed immediately with <a href="eminent%20domain">condemnation</a>. This allowed access to the site for construction crews, provided faster compensation to the owners, and expedited the handling of property with defective titles. On 28 September 1942, the ORD Real Estate Branch opened a project office in <a href="Harriman%2C%20Tennessee">Harriman</a> with a staff of 54 surveyors, appraisers, lawyers and office workers. The ORD Real Estate Branch was quite busy at this time, as it was also acquiring land for the <a href="Dale%20Hollow%20Reservoir">Dale Hollow Reservoir</a>, so some staff were borrowed from the <a href="Federal%20Land%20Bank">Federal Land Bank</a> and the TVA. The next day, <a href="United%20States%20Under%20Secretary%20of%20War">Under Secretary of War</a> <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a> authorized the acquisition of at an estimated cost of $3.5 million. At the request of the ORD Real Estate Branch attorneys, the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Tennessee">District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee</a> issued an order of possession on 6 October, effective the next day. Recognizing the hardship that it would cause to the landowners, it restricted immediate exclusive possession to properties "essential to full and complete development of the project".
Over 1,000 families lived on the site on farms or in the hamlets of <a href="Elza%2C%20Tennessee">Elza</a>, <a href="Robertsville%2C%20Tennessee">Robertsville</a>, and Scarboro. The first that most heard about the acquisition was when a representative from the ORD visited to inform them that their land was being acquired. Some returned home from work one day to find an eviction notice nailed to their door or to a tree in the yard. Most were given six weeks to leave, but some were given just two. The government took possession of 13 tracts for immediate construction work on 20 November 1942. By May 1943, 742 declarations had been filed covering . Most residents were told to prepare to leave between 1 December and 15 January. In cases where this would cause undue hardship, the MED allowed residents to stay beyond this date. For some it was the third time that they had been evicted by the government, having previously been evicted for the <a href="Great%20Smoky%20Mountains%20National%20Park">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a> in the 1920s and the TVA's <a href="Norris%20Dam">Norris Dam</a> in the 1930s. Many expected that, like the TVA, the Army would provide assistance to help them relocate; but unlike the TVA, the Army had no mission to improve the area or the lot of the local people, and no funds for the purpose. Tires were in short supply in wartime America, and moving vehicles were hard to find. Some residents had to leave behind possessions that they were unable to take with them.

A delegation of landowners presented the ORD Real Estate Branch with a petition protesting the acquisition of their property on 23 November 1942, and that night over 200 landowners held a meeting at which they agreed to hire lawyers and appraisers to challenge the Federal government. Local newspapers and politicians were sympathetic to their cause. By the end of May 1943, agreements were reached covering 416 tracts totaling , but some landowners rejected the government's offers. The ORD Real Estate Branch invoked a procedure under Tennessee law that allowed for a jury of five citizens appointed by the Federal District Court to review the compensation offered. They handled five cases in which they proposed higher values than those of the ORD appraisers, but the landowners rejected them as well, so the Army discontinued the use of this method. In response to rising public criticism, O'Brien commissioned a review by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a>. It found that the appraisals had been fair and just, and that farmers had overestimated the size and productivity of their land.

The landowners turned to their local , <a href="John%20Jennings%20%28American%20politician%29">John Jennings, Jr.</a>, On 1 February 1943, Jennings introduced a <a href="Resolution%20%28law%29">resolution</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> calling for a committee to investigate the values offered to the landowners. He also complained to Patterson about how buildings and facilities were being demolished by the MED. On 9 July, <a href="Andrew%20J.%20May">Andrew J. May</a>, the chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Military%20Affairs">House Committee on Military Affairs</a>, appointed an investigating subcommittee chaired by Tennessee Representative <a href="Clifford%20Davis%20%28politician%29">Clifford Davis</a>, who selected <a href="Dewey%20Jackson%20Short">Dewey Short</a> of Missouri and <a href="John%20Sparkman">John Sparkman</a> of Alabama as its other members. Public hearings were held in Clinton on 11 August, and in Kingston the following day. The Committee report, presented in December 1943, made a number of specific recommendations concerning the Corps of Engineers' land acquisition process, but neither Congress nor the War Department moved to provide any additional compensation for the landowners.
In July 1943, Groves prepared to issue Public Proclamation No. 2, declaring the site a military exclusion area. He asked Marshall to present it to the <a href="Governor%20of%20Tennessee">Governor of Tennessee</a>, <a href="Prentice%20Cooper">Prentice Cooper</a>. Marshall, in turn, delegated the task to the area engineer, <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> Thomas T. Crenshaw, who sent a junior officer, <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">Captain</a> George B. Leonard. Cooper was unimpressed; he told Leonard that he had not been informed about the purpose of the CEW, and that the Army had kicked the farmers off their land and had not compensated the counties for the roads and bridges, which would now be closed. In his opinion it was "an experiment in socialism", a <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> project being undertaken in the name of the war effort. Instead of reading the proclamation, he tore it up and threw it in a waste paper basket. Marshall went to <a href="Nashville">Nashville</a> to apologize to Cooper, who refused to talk to him. Nichols, who succeeded Marshall as chief engineer of the Manhattan District, met Cooper on 31 July, and offered compensation in the form of Federal financing for road improvements. Cooper accepted an offer from Nichols to visit the CEW, which he did on 3 November.

Nichols and Cooper came to an agreement about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in <a href="Knox%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Knox County</a>, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction. It was still paying off the bonds, but now the bridge was usable only by CEW workers. Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $25,000 annually for the bridge, of which $6,000 was to be used to maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on road works in Knox County.

Additional parcels of land were acquired during 1943 and 1944 for access roads, a railway spur, and for security purposes, bringing the total to about . The Harriman office closed on 10 June 1944, but reopened on 1 September to deal with the additional parcels. The last acquisition was not complete until 1 March 1945. The final cost of the land acquired was around $2.6 million, about $47 an acre.

On 2 February 1943, <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> began construction of the plutonium <a href="wikt%3Asemi-works">semiworks</a>, on an isolated site in the Bethel Valley about southwest of Oak Ridge. Intended as a <a href="pilot%20plant">pilot plant</a> for the larger production facilities at the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a>, it included the air-cooled <a href="graphite">graphite</a>-<a href="neutron%20moderation">moderated</a> <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a>. There was also a chemical separation plant, research laboratories, waste storage area, training facility for Hanford staff, and administrative and support facilities that included a laundry, cafeteria, first aid center and fire station. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot. The facility was known as the Clinton Laboratories, and was operated by the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> as part of the Metallurgical Laboratory project.

The X-10 Graphite Reactor was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor after <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>'s <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>, and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation. It consisted of a block, long on each side, of <a href="nuclear%20graphite">nuclear graphite</a> cubes, weighing around , surrounded by of high-density concrete as a <a href="radiation%20protection">radiation shield</a>. There were 36 horizontal rows of 35 holes. Behind each was a metal channel into which uranium fuel slugs could be inserted. The cooling system was driven by three large electric fans.

Construction work on the reactor had to wait until DuPont had completed the design. Excavation commenced on 27 April 1943, but a large pocket of soft clay was soon discovered, necessitating additional foundations. Further delays occurred due to wartime difficulties in procuring building materials. There was also an acute shortage of common and skilled labor: the contractor had only three-quarters of the required workforce, and less after high turnover and absenteeism, mainly the result of poor accommodations and difficulties in commuting. The township of Oak Ridge was still under construction, and barracks were built to house workers. Special arrangements with individual workers increased their morale and reduced turnover. Finally, there was unusually heavy rainfall, with falling in July 1943, more than twice the average of .

Construction commenced on the pilot separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. In May 1943, DuPont managers decided to use the <a href="bismuth-phosphate%20process">bismuth-phosphate process</a>. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated remotely from the control room. Construction work was completed on 26 November, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. The first batch was received on 20 December, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. By February, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed.

In September 1942, Compton asked Whitaker to form a skeleton operating staff for X-10. Whitaker became director of the Clinton Laboratories, and the first permanent operating staff arrived at X-10 from the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1944, by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site. They were augmented by one hundred technicians in uniform from the Army's Special Engineer Detachment. By March 1944, there were 1,500 people working at X-10.

A radioisotope building, a steam plant, and other structures were added in April 1946 to support the laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. All work was completed by December, adding another $1,009,000 to the cost of construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000. Operational costs added another $22,250,000.

Electromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as <a href="calutron">calutron</a>s, a hybrid of the standard laboratory <a href="mass%20spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a> and cyclotron. The name was derived from the words "California", "university" and "cyclotron". In the electromagnetic separation process, a magnetic field deflected <a href="charged%20particle">charged</a> uranium particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. The process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. It could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.
Responsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called <a href="Y-12%20National%20Security%20Complex">Y-12</a>, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September, Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.

When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in November, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December, Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A <a href="Pickling%20%28metal%29">pickling</a> plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings. The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.

<a href="Tennessee%20Eastman">Tennessee Eastman</a> was hired to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack. The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate. They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education. Nichols compared unit production data, and pointed out to Lawrence that the young "hillbilly" girl operators were outperforming his PhDs. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were "trained like soldiers not to reason why", while "the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials".

Y-12 initially enriched the <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> content to between 13 and 15 percent, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to the Manhattan Project's weapons design laboratory, the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a>, in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product; much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10 percent of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4 percent) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant, and the next month it received enhanced (5 percent) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.

The Alpha tracks began to suspend operations on 4 September 1945, and ceased operation completely on 22 September. The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December, processing feed from K-25 and the new K-27. By May 1946, studies suggested that the gaseous plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass. After a trial showed this was the case, Groves ordered all but one Beta track at Y-12 shut down in December 1946. Y-12 remained in use for nuclear weapons processing and materials storage. A production facility for the hydrogen bomb used in <a href="Operation%20Castle">Operation Castle</a> in 1954 was hastily installed in 1952.

The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. <a href="Graham%27s%20law">Graham's law</a> states that the rate of <a href="effusion">effusion</a> of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a>, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> by a group that included <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a>, <a href="Karl%20P.%20Cohen">Karl P. Cohen</a> and <a href="John%20R.%20Dunning">John R. Dunning</a>.

In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, <a href="M.%20W.%20Kellogg">M. W. Kellogg</a> accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5 million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a>. The best choice for this seemed to be <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Laboratories">Bell Telephone Laboratories</a> and the <a href="Bakelite">Bakelite</a> Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.
Kellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story U-shaped structure long containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, <a href="Union%20Carbide">Union Carbide and Carbon</a>, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480 million.

The production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April, K-25 had attained a 1.1 percent enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7 percent enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants. Uranium was enriched by the K-25 gaseous diffusion process until 1985; the plants were then decommissioned and <a href="decontamination">decontaminated</a>. A 235 MW coal-fired power station was included for reliability and to provide variable frequency, although most electric power came from the TVA.

The thermal diffusion process was based on <a href="Sydney%20Chapman%20%28mathematician%29">Sydney Chapman</a> and <a href="David%20Enskog">David Enskog</a>'s <a href="Chapman%E2%80%93Enskog%20theory">theory</a>, which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.

The <a href="Naval%20Research%20Laboratory">Naval Research Laboratory</a> continued the research under <a href="Philip%20Abelson">Philip Abelson</a>'s direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when Captain <a href="William%20S.%20Parsons">William S. Parsons</a>, the naval officer who was in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>, the director there, news of encouraging progress in the Navy's experiments on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y-12. Groves set up a committee consisting of <a href="Warren%20K.%20Lewis">Warren K. Lewis</a>, <a href="Eger%20Murphree">Eger Murphree</a> and <a href="Richard%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a> to investigate the idea, and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $3.5 million could enrich of uranium per week to nearly 0.9 percent uranium-235. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944.

Groves contracted with the <a href="H.%20K.%20Ferguson%20Company">H. K. Ferguson Company</a> of <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50. Groves' advisers, Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from <a href="Esso">Standard Oil</a>, estimated that it would take six months to build; Groves gave Ferguson just four. Plans called for the installation of 2,142 diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of and temperature of , flowed downward through the innermost nickel pipe, while water at flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. Isotope separation occurred in the uranium hexafluoride gas between the nickel and copper pipes.

Work commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve. The plant produced just of 0.852 percent uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced . By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71 percent to 0.89 percent. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23 percent. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12.

In early September Nichols appointed a production control committee, headed by Major <a href="Arthur%20V.%20Peterson">A.V. (Pete) Peterson</a>. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, and decided that the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">Japan surrendered</a> in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, and the plant had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.

Despite protests from TVA that it was unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a coal-fired power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam generated from the K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris Dam and <a href="Watts%20Bar%20Dam">Watts Bar Dam</a>, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own <a href="electrical%20substation">electrical substation</a>s at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September. The 235,000 KVA steam plant was required for reliability; in 1953-55 a rat shorting out a transformer at CEW resulted in a complete loss of load and of several weeks of production. The plant could supply up to five different frequencies, although it was found that variable frequency was not necessary. J. A. Jones built the plant and the gaseous diffusion plant. The site was cleared in June 1943, steam was available from one boiler in March 1944 and in April 15,000 KVA was available from the first turbine generator. The plant was the largest single block of steam power built at one time, and with completion in January 1945 in record time.

Planning for a "Government village" to house the workers at the Clinton Engineer Works began in June 1942. Because the site was remote, it was believed more convenient and secure for the workers to live on the site. The gentle slopes of Black Oak Ridge, from which the new town of <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge</a> got its name, were selected as a suitable location. Brigadier General <a href="Lucius%20D.%20Clay">Lucius D. Clay</a>, the deputy chief of staff of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Services%20of%20Supply">Army Services of Supply</a>, reminded Marshall of a wartime limit of $7,500 per capita for individual quarters. Groves argued for "economy" with small and simple houses; but Marshall, who had argued for an exemption from the limit, saw no prospect that the kind of workers they needed would be willing to live with their family in substandard accommodation (and du Pont at HEW agreed). The houses at CEW and HEW were basic but of a higher standard (as specified by Marshall and Nichols) than the houses at Los Alamos (as specified by Groves; and the quality of housing there suffered).

The first plan, submitted by Stone & Webster on 26 October 1942, was for a residential community of 13,000 people. As Stone & Webster began work on the production facilities, it became clear that building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm <a href="Skidmore%2C%20Owings%20%26amp%3B%20Merrill">Skidmore, Owings & Merrill</a> to design and build the township. The <a href="John%20B.%20Pierce">John B. Pierce</a> Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20High%20School%20%28Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee%29">high school</a> for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, <a href="fiberboard">fiberboard</a> and <a href="Drywall">gypsum board</a> were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.

In addition to the East Town, a self-contained community known as the East Village, with 50 family units, its own church, dormitories and a cafeteria, was built near the Elza gate. This was intended as a <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">segregated community</a> for Black people, but by the time it was completed, it was required by white people. Black people were instead housed in "hutments" (one-room shacks) in segregated areas, some in "family hutments" created by joining two regular hutments together.
The Army presence at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall as head of the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although the name of the district did not change. In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to <a href="Turner%20Construction%20Company">Turner Construction Company</a> through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company. The company was paid a fee of $25,000 per month on a <a href="cost-plus%20contract">cost-plus contract</a>, about 1 percent of the $2.8 million monthly cost of running the town facilities. Roane-Anderson did not take over everything at once, and a phased takeover started with Laundry No. 1 on 17 October 1943; transportation and garbage collection soon followed. It assumed responsibility for water and sewage in November, and electricity in January 1944. The number of Roane-Anderson workers peaked at around 10,500 in February 1945, including concessionaires and subcontractors. Thereafter, numbers declined to 2,905 direct employees and 3,663 concessionaires and subcontractors when the Manhattan Project ended on 31 December 1946.

By mid-1943, it had become clear that the initial estimates of the size of the town had been too low, and a second phase of construction was required. Plans now called for a town of 42,000 people. Work began in the fall of 1943, and continued into the late summer of 1944. Hospitals were expanded, as were the police and fire services, and the telephone system. Only 4,793 of a planned total of 6,000 family houses were built, mostly on the East Town area and the undeveloped stretch along State Route 61. They were supplemented by 55 new dormitories, 2,089 trailers, 391 hutments, a <a href="cantonment">cantonment</a> area of 84 hutments and 42 barracks. Some 2,823 of the family units were prefabricated off-site. The high school was expanded to cater for 1,000 students. Two additional primary schools were built, and existing ones were expanded so that they could accommodate 7,000 students.
Although expected to accommodate the needs of the entire workforce, by late 1944 expansion of both the electromagnetic and gaseous diffusion plants led to forecasts of a population of 62,000. This prompted another round of construction that saw an additional 1,300 family units and 20 dormitories built. More shopping and recreational facilities were added, the schools were expanded to accommodate 9,000 students, and a 50-bed annex was added to the hospital. The number of school children reached 8,223 in 1945. Few issues resonated more with the scientists and highly skilled workers than the quality of the education system. Although school staff were nominally employees of the Anderson County Education Board, the school system was run autonomously, with federal funding under the supervision of administrators appointed by the Army. Teachers enjoyed salaries that were considerably higher than those of Anderson County. The population of Oak Ridge peaked at 75,000 in May 1945, by which time 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 10,000 by Roane-Anderson.

In addition to the township, there were a number of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction workers should live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.

The main shopping area was Jackson Square, with about 20 shops. The Army attempted to keep prices down by encouraging competition, but this met with limited success due to the captive nature of the population, and the requirements of security, which meant that firms and goods could not freely move in and out. The Army could give prospective concessionaires only vague information about how many people were in or would be in the town, and concessions were only for the duration of the war. Concessions were therefore charged a percentage of their profits in rental rather than a fixed fee. The Army avoided imposing draconian price controls, but limited prices to those of similar goods in Knoxville. By 1945, community amenities included 6 recreation halls, 36 bowling alleys, 23 tennis courts, 18 ball parks, 12 playgrounds, a swimming pool, a 9,400-volume library, and a newspaper.

From 1 April 1943, access to the Clinton Engineer Works was strictly controlled, with wire fences, guarded gates, and guards patrolling the perimeter. All employees had to sign a security declaration, the purpose of which was to make them aware of possible penalties under the <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a>. Noting the distillation facilities and their high energy consumption, "I thought they were making <a href="sour%20mash">sour mash</a> to drop on the Germans, get them all drunk," engineer Benjamin Bederson recalled, before realizing that the facilities were enriching nuclear isotopes. Mail was censored, and <a href="polygraph">lie detector</a>s were employed in security checks. Everyone was issued with a color-coded badge that restricted where they could go. Despite the security, the Clinton Engineer Works was penetrated by <a href="atomic%20spies">atomic spies</a> <a href="George%20Koval">George Koval</a> and <a href="David%20Greenglass">David Greenglass</a>, who passed secrets to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

Occupational health and safety presented a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a> and handling <a href="fissile%20material">fissile material</a>s. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the <a href="National%20Safety%20Council">National Safety Council</a> presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National Traffic Safety Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.
The citizens of Oak Ridge were not allowed to have any form of local government, but the state of Tennessee, concerned over the potential loss of tax revenue, did not cede sovereignty over the land. The residents of Oak Ridge therefore did not live on a federal reservation, and were entitled to vote in state and county elections. Notice of the Clinton City elections was withheld by local authorities until a week after the deadline to pay the <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a>. On the day of a 1945 <a href="referendum">referendum</a> on whether Anderson should remain a <a href="dry%20county">dry county</a>, the Edgemoor Bridge was suddenly closed for repairs, and the "dry" vote carried. A subsequent vote in 1947 reversed this result, with 4,653 "dry" votes compared to 5,888 "wet"; 5,369 of the "wet" votes came from Oak Ridge.

This was but one point of difference between Oak Ridge residents and the rest of Anderson County. While most Oak Ridge residents had high school diplomas, and many had college degrees, the average education level of adults in Anderson County was only 6.8 years. Oak Ridge residents demanded, and Groves insisted on, schools with fine teachers and first-rate facilities. To achieve this, the Manhattan District paid teachers nearly twice as much as Anderson County. The consequent drain of qualified teachers from surrounding areas aroused considerable resentment.

The Manhattan District accepted that wages and salaries had to be high enough to allow contractors to hire and retain good workers. It generally allowed wages and salaries to be paid by contractors as they saw fit, subject to limits imposed by wartime national wage and price controls intended to limit <a href="inflation">inflation</a>. Salaries above $9,000 had to be approved by Patterson and Groves.

The <a href="War%20Production%20Board">War Production Board</a> was asked to keep stores in Oak Ridge well-stocked in order to reduce absenteeism among the workers. When shortages occurred, the relatively well-paid Oak Ridge residents bought up scarce goods in surrounding areas. In both cases, they attracted the ire of their residents. Personnel employed by the Manhattan District were not exempted from being drafted under the <a href="Selective%20Service%20System">Selective Service System</a>. Efforts were made to employ draft-exempt personnel, and deferments were requested only for critical personnel, mainly young scientists and technicians.

On 10 May 1945, Women's Army Corps typists at Manhattan District headquarters began preparing press kits on the Manhattan Project for use after an atomic bomb had been dropped. Fourteen press releases were prepared, and thousands of copies made by <a href="mimeograph">mimeograph</a>. The final wartime shipment of uranium-235 left the Clinton Engineer Works on 25 July. Shipments reached <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a> on <a href="C-54">C-54</a> aircraft on 28 and 29 July. They were incorporated into the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> bomb <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">dropped on Hiroshima</a> on 6 August. The news was greeted with wild celebration in Oak Ridge. Patterson issued a letter to the men and women of the Clinton Engineer Works:

By 1945, Roane-Anderson was divesting itself of many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and <a href="Southern%20Bell">Southern Bell</a> the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime <a href="olive%20drab">olive drab</a>. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.

The hospital remained an Army hospital until 1 March 1949, when it was transferred to Roane-Anderson. <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> took over the operation of the Clinton Laboratories on 1 July 1945. Control of the entire site passed to the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) on 1 January 1947. The Clinton Laboratories became the Clinton National Laboratory in late 1947, and the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in January 1948. Union Carbide took over its management in December 1947, bringing all of Oak Ridge's operations under its control.

While the war was in progress, the Manhattan District resisted allowing <a href="labor%20union">labor union</a>s access to its facilities. In 1946, they were permitted to operate at the Clinton Engineer Works. Elections were held at K-25, Y-12 and X-10 in August and September 1946, and the <a href="Oil%2C%20Chemical%20and%20Atomic%20Workers%20International%20Union">United Chemical Workers</a> became their representative. A contract was negotiated with Union Carbide on 10 December. The <a href="Atomic%20Trades%20and%20Labor%20Council">Atomic Trades and Labor Council</a> became the representative of the Clinton Laboratories, signing a contract with Monsanto on 18 December.
At its peak in May 1945, 82,000 people were employed at the Clinton Engineer Works, and 75,000 people lived in the township. By January 1946, these figures had fallen to 43,000 and 48,000 respectively. By the time the Manhattan Project concluded at the end of 1946, the corresponding figures were 34,000 and 43,000. The departure of large numbers of construction workers meant that 47 percent of those remaining were family members of workers. Eight dormitories were closed in October 1945. Most of those who remained in dorms now had their own rooms. The white hutments began to be removed. Trailers were returned to the Federal Public Housing Authority.

The end of the war brought national attention to Oak Ridge, and there was bad publicity about the conditions that the Black residents were living in. Roane-Anderson dusted off plans for a village for them. The new village, called Scarboro, was built where the Gamble Valley Trailer Camp had once stood. Construction commenced in 1948, and the first residents moved in two years later. It housed the entire Black community of Oak Ridge until the early 1960s.

In 1947, Oak Ridge was still part of "an island of socialism in the midst of a free enterprise economy". The AEC pressed forward with plans to withdraw from running the community, but it could never be too fast for some members of Congress. AEC officials repeatedly explained how Roane-Anderson provided far more than regular municipal services. For the residents, the benefits of a free enterprise economy were slight. They enjoyed low rents and no property taxes, but high standards of services and an excellent school system. Oak Ridge City Historian William J. Wilcox, Jr. noted that the townspeople "thoroughly enjoyed their much protected existence and the benevolence the Army had provided". A <a href="straw%20poll">straw poll</a> of the residents on opening the gates showed them opposed, 10 to 1.

Nonetheless, on 19 March 1949 the residential and commercial portion of Oak Ridge was ceremoniously opened to public access. <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Alben%20W.%20Barkley">Alben W. Barkley</a>, Governor <a href="Gordon%20Browning">Gordon Browning</a>, Atomic Energy Commission Chairman <a href="David%20E.%20Lilienthal">David E. Lilienthal</a>, and movie star <a href="Marie%20McDonald">Marie McDonald</a> were on hand to watch the guards take down the barriers. Access to the nuclear facilities was controlled by three <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20gatehouses">Oak Ridge gatehouses</a>. On 6 June 1951, the <a href="Senate%20Appropriations%20Committee">Senate Appropriations Committee</a> called on the Atomic Energy Commission to discontinue "the present undemocratic method" of operating the community, and it initiated steps to coerce Oak Ridge residents to establish democratic institutions and adopt a free enterprise system.

William Robinson Brown

William Robinson "W. R. " Brown (January 17, 1875 – August 4, 1955) was an American corporate officer of the <a href="Brown%20Company">Brown Company</a> of <a href="Berlin%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Berlin, New Hampshire</a>. He was also an influential Arabian <a href="horse%20breeder">horse breeder</a>, the founder and owner of the Maynesboro Stud, and an authority on <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s.

After graduating from <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a>, Brown joined the family corporation, then known as the Berlin Mills Company, and became manager of the Woods Products Division, overseeing the company's woodlands and logging operations. He became an early advocate for <a href="sustainable%20forest%20management">sustainable forest management</a> practices, was a member of the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Forestry%20Commission">New Hampshire Forestry Commission</a> from 1909 until 1952, and served on the boards of several forestry organizations. As chair of the Forestry Commission, Brown helped send sawmills to Europe during World War I to assist the war effort. He was influenced by the <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Progressive movement</a>, instituting employee benefits such as company-sponsored care for injured workers that predated modern <a href="workers%27%20compensation">workers' compensation</a> laws. As a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, he served as a <a href="presidential%20elector">presidential elector</a> for New Hampshire in 1924.

Brown founded the Maynesboro Stud in 1912 with <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation bloodstock</a> from some of the most notable American breeders of Arabian horses. He looked abroad for additional horses, particularly from the <a href="Crabbet%20Arabian%20Stud">Crabbet Arabian Stud</a>, and imported Arabian horses from England, France and Egypt. At its peak, Maynesboro was the largest Arabian horse breeding operation in the United States. In 1929, he wrote "The Horse of the Desert," still considered an authoritative work on the Arabian breed. He served as President of the <a href="Arabian%20Horse%20Club%20of%20America">Arabian Horse Club of America</a> from 1918 until 1939. Brown was a <a href="remount%20agent">remount agent</a> and had a special interest in promoting the use of Arabian horses by the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Remount%20Service">U.S. Army Remount Service</a>. To prove the abilities of Arabians, he organized and participated in a number of <a href="endurance%20riding">endurance races</a> of up to , which his horses won three times, retiring the U.S. Mounted Service Cup. This accomplishment occurred even though <a href="The%20Jockey%20Club">The Jockey Club</a> donated $50,000 to the U.S. Army to buy <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s that tried but failed to beat the Arabians. Brown's legacy as a horse breeder was significant. Today, the term "CMK", meaning "Crabbet/Maynesboro/Kellogg" is a label for specific lines of "Domestic" or "American-bred" Arabian horses, many of which descend from Brown's breeding program. In 2012, the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society held a 100th anniversary celebration of the stud's founding.

Although Brown family members sold personal assets to keep the Brown Company afloat during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, including Brown's dispersal of his herd of Arabian horses in 1933, the business went into receivership in 1934. Brown remained in charge of the Woods Division through the company's second bankruptcy filing in 1941. He retired from the company in 1943 and died of cancer in 1955. His final book, "Our Forest Heritage," was published posthumously, and his innovations in forest management became industry standards.

W. R. Brown was born in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>, in 1875 to Emily Jenkins Brown and William Wentworth "W. W." Brown. He was the youngest of the couple's three sons, all of whom were avid <a href="equestrianism">horsemen</a>. He also had two younger half-brothers. He attended <a href="Phillips%20Andover%20Academy">Phillips Andover Academy</a> and <a href="Williams%20College">Williams College</a>, graduating from the latter in 1897. He was a <a href="Kappa%20Alpha%20Society">Kappa Alpha fraternity</a> member who also managed the football and baseball teams at Williams. In 1915, he married Hildreth Burton Smith, the granddaughter of former governor of Georgia, <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> general <a href="John%20B.%20Gordon">John B. Gordon</a>. The couple had five children: Fielding, Newell, Brenton, Nancy, and Frances. Brown lived in New Hampshire for the remainder of his life, in Berlin until 1946 and then <a href="Dublin%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Dublin</a>. After a long illness, he died of cancer on August 4, 1955, and was buried at the Dublin cemetery. He was survived by his wife, his five grown children, and 15 grandchildren.

Brown's family was strongly affiliated with Williams College; W. R. and his two older brothers Herbert ("H. J.") and Orton ("O. B.") all attended Williams, as did sons Fielding and Brenton. Fielding also earned a Ph.D. at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and returned to Williams as the Charles L. MacMillan Professor of Physics before retiring to become an artist and sculptor. Daughter Frances married Nobel Prize–winning physicist <a href="Charles%20Hard%20Townes">Charles H. Townes</a> and wrote a book, "Misadventures of a Scientist's Wife," about her life. Newell attended Princeton and served as the Federal Wages and Hours Administrator for the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">United States Department of Labor</a> during the <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower administration</a>. Politically aligned with the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican party</a>, W. R. Brown was a <a href="presidential%20elector">presidential elector</a> for New Hampshire in the 1924 election, voting for <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>.

H. Winslow & Company, later called the Berlin Mills Company, was founded about 1853, and W. W. Brown purchased an interest in 1868. In 1881, the company expanded from lumber into pulp and paper manufacturing. W. W. Brown obtained a controlling interest in the company by 1888, becoming, along with his older two sons, the sole owners by 1907. The corporation's name was changed to the <a href="Brown%20Company">Brown Company</a> in 1917, removing the word "Berlin" because of the conflict with Germany in World War I.

W. R. Brown went to work for the company in 1897 after finishing college. His father, declaring he "wanted no kittens that couldn't catch mice," made W. R. find a job without family help. As a result, Brown started out selling the company's lumber in Portland, Maine, earning nine dollars a week. He was promoted, returned to Berlin, and after a second promotion became the sawmill's night superintendent. In that position, he developed a method of using exhaust steam to heat a pond that thawed and cleaned logs, speeding up mill production during the winter. Promoted to day superintendent, he organized a successful event on September 8, 1900 to break the world's record for lumber cut by the crew of a "one head rig" in an 11-hour shift, producing 221,319 <a href="board%20feet">board feet</a>, a record that still stood 85 years later. After this event, he declared that he "qualified with Father as one of the 'kittens'." His father, who had been out of town on the day of the record attempt, reviewed the results, inquired as to the amount of cut lumber that was actually shipped to customers, and then commented, "Hum, that was good." His father promoted Brown to full general manager of the Woods Division in 1902. He was an officer of the corporation, and managed the company's timberlands as director of woods operations until 1943. When Brown began his career, the company owned of land. At its peak, the company owned, and Brown supervised, , as many as 40 logging camps, plus an inland fleet of more than 30 boats. The loggers used at least 2500 horses to haul logs, and the company-owned railroad had more than 800 freight cars.

The Brown family was later described as "progressive and ... ahead of their times", and had innovative ideas about wood products manufacturing and scientific forest management. During Brown's tenure, the company was one of the first to initiate modern forest management practices and to attempt to conserve the forest for future industry use. He was particularly critical of the damage done by portable sawmills. Brown understood that the pulp mills of his time were dependent on locally accessible timber, and concluded that sustainable practices were important to the industry. He built upon the sustainable forestry practices advocated by company forester Austin Cary, who had been recruited from the U.S. Forest Service. In 1919, Brown set up a tree nursery on the north shore of <a href="Mooselookmeguntic%20Lake">Cupsuptic Lake</a> that researched sustained yield practices and at its peak was the largest tree nursery in the United States. His innovations in forest management became industry standards; researchers at <a href="Plymouth%20State%20College">Plymouth State College</a> concluded that he "led the Brown company to international prominence as a source for scientific research and development."

Brown was influenced by the <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Progressive movement</a> as applied to business. He paid his workers above the prevailing wage, instituted safety programs, hired a doctor to care for loggers in the camps, and, prior to modern <a href="workers%27%20compensation">workers' compensation</a> laws, had the company pay for hospitalization of injured workers. He also attempted to improve camp conditions for the workers by banning card games and requiring the loggers to take showers, but those particular reform efforts "were not well received." The Brown family took considerable interest in the city of Berlin. Various family members started a public kindergarten, built a community club with a gym, swimming pool, and bowling alley, provided soup to the sick, and gave Christmas presents to local children. Brown himself helped found a number of civic and business self-help organizations including the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, established in 1901; the New Hampshire Timberlands Owners Association, a fire-protection group established in 1910; and similar fire-protection groups in Maine and Vermont. He set up a series of effective forest-fire <a href="fire%20tower">lookout towers</a>, possibly the first in the nation, and by 1917 had helped establish a forest-fire insurance company. In 1909, after helping draft the legislation creating New Hampshire's State Forestry Department, he became a member of the New Hampshire Forestry Commission; and its chair from 1910 until 1952, playing a significant role in shaping the forestry practices and laws of the state. Brown also served on the boards of several industry groups, including the <a href="American%20Forestry%20Association">American Forestry Association</a>, <a href="Society%20of%20American%20Foresters">Society of American Foresters</a>, <a href="Canadian%20Pulp%20and%20Paper%20Association">Canadian Pulp and Paper Association</a>, and the <a href="Forest%20Research%20Council">Forest Research Council</a>. He represented the U.S. at the first World Forestry Congress held in Rome in 1926.

During World War I, in his capacity as chair of the New England Forestry Commission, Brown worked with the <a href="War%20Industries%20Board">War Industries Board</a> to send 10 sawmills abroad. The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain's need for lumber. When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million board feet of lumber per month, Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there, but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of his poor vision, as he was partially blind in one eye.

The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> had a significant impact on the Brown Company. Berlin at that time had a population of about 20,000 people, most of whom either worked for the company or provided services to the families of company employees. The Brown family had borrowed heavily during the 1920s to fund expansion, and, as stated by a company employee, had become "complacent and overly optimistic." The family's <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> may also have become a disadvantage. Reduced demand for the company's products forced it to take out short-term loans to provide operating capital, and by 1931 the international financial situation led to major losses in the value of the company's bonds. As a result, in the winter of 1931–32 the Brown Company could not obtain the necessary financing for its logging operations, when it normally needed to employ 4,000 to 5,000 loggers to cut timber each winter. Family members sold off personal holdings to try to keep the company solvent, and W. R. Brown dispersed his entire herd of Arabian horses. In 1933, he negotiated a cooperative financing plan with the City of Berlin and the State of New Hampshire, ratified by the state legislature, to fund the woods operations, keeping Berlin's local residents employed. The company was nevertheless forced to file for bankruptcy in 1935, after having gone into receivership the previous year. A court-appointed president took over, but Brown continued as head of the Woods Division. Brown's agreement with the City of Berlin lasted until 1941, when the company again filed for bankruptcy. Ultimately the Brown family ceased to have a significant role on the board of directors and the company was sold to outside investors. Brown officially retired from the company in 1943, but his brother O. B. remained on the board of directors until 1960.

Brown bought his first <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s in 1910 and founded the Maynesboro Stud near Berlin in 1912. The farm was named after the original settlement in the area, <a href="Berlin%2C%20New%20Hampshire%23History">Maynesborough</a>, located in the <a href="White%20Mountains%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">White Mountains</a> in an area also known as the <a href="Great%20North%20Woods%20Region%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">Great North Woods Region</a>. The main stallion barn, although moved from its original location, has been preserved and restored by the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society, which is also restoring the <a href="draft%20horse">work horse</a> barns of the Brown Company. On September 15, 2012, the society celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Maynesboro Stud.

At its peak, Maynesboro was the largest Arabian stud farm in the United States. In 1919, Brown had 88 horses, some at his main farm in New Hampshire, and others at farms he owned in <a href="Decorah%2C%20Iowa">Decorah, Iowa</a>, and <a href="Cody%2C%20Wyoming">Cody, Wyoming</a>. He is credited as the breeder of 194 horses, and became known as one of the most knowledgeable breeders and authorities on Arabians. He served as President of the Arabian Horse Club of America, now part of the <a href="Arabian%20Horse%20Association">Arabian Horse Association</a>, from 1918 until 1939.

As he built Maynesboro, Brown studied the pedigrees of almost every purebred Arabian in the US at the time. He believed the Arabian was actually a <a href="History%20of%20horse%20domestication%20theories%23Multiple%20primitive%20types">separate subspecies</a> of horse, a once-popular but now discredited theory. He found that, even though developed in the desert, Arabians adapted well to the severe winter weather of his New England farm.

When he started Maynesboro, Brown obtained his original <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation bloodstock</a> from his oldest brother, Herbert, who had purchased *Abu Zeyd, a stallion bred by the <a href="Crabbet%20Arabian%20Stud">Crabbet Arabian Stud</a> in England. *Abu Zeyd was considered the best son of his famous sire, <a href="Mesaoud">Mesaoud</a>. Herbert Brown obtained the <a href="stallion">stallion</a> from the estate of <a href="Homer%20Davenport">Homer Davenport</a> following Davenport's death in 1912. The Maynesboro stud also acquired 10 <a href="mare">mare</a>s from the Davenport estate. Brown considered *Abu Zeyd an ideal representative of the Arabian breed, and when the stallion died, Brown donated the skeleton to the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>. His other American purchases included most of the horses owned by Spencer Borden's Interlachen Farms in Massachusetts, following Borden's decision to disperse his herd. These horses included animals descended from the breeding program of Randolph Huntington, one of the first people in the United States to breed purebred Arabians. Brown also obtained Borden's extensive collection of literary works on horsemanship, Arab culture, and the Arabian horse, which included 8th-century <a href="Furusiyya">Furusiyya</a> manuscripts. Following this start, he looked abroad for additional bloodstock, eventually importing 33 horses into the United States.

Many American breeders had purchased horses from the Crabbet Stud, which at the time Brown founded Maynesboro was owned by <a href="Lady%20Anne%20Blunt">Lady Anne Blunt</a> and <a href="Wilfrid%20Scawen%20Blunt">Wilfrid Scawen Blunt</a>. American breeders obtained some of Crabbet's best Arabians during the early 1900s owing to the turmoil within the Blunt family. The couple separated in 1906, and following Lady Anne's death in 1917, Blunt's daughter Judith, <a href="Lady%20Wentworth">Lady Wentworth</a>, became involved in a rancorous and expensive estate battle with Wilfrid over the Crabbet lands and horses. Wilfrid, needing to appease creditors, sold many of the stud's best horses to international buyers for low prices. Through an agent, Brown purchased 20 Crabbet horses in 1918, although for reasons unknown, only 17 actually made it to Maynesboro; he paid only £2727 for the entire lot. The most significant animal purchased was the well-known stallion *Berk, who died in America after siring only four <a href="foal">foal</a>s, much to the dismay of Lady Wentworth, who was trying to buy back the best breeding stock lost to Crabbet because of her father's actions. Brown bought two additional Crabbet-bred horses from England in 1923, although not directly from Lady Wentworth.

One of the most notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown eventually kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, who had come to America in 1909. This horse had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two purebred foals in New England, was sold to the remount, shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire. *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but that group of foals included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.

Brown traveled to Europe with the U.S. Army Remount Service in 1921, visiting a number of major European studs in Austria, France, and Hungary. He met Lady Wentworth at Crabbet on the way home, but did not purchase any of her horses. He imported several Arabian mares from France in 1921 and 1922, in part owing to France's reputation for producing excellent cavalry horses.

In 1929, Brown traveled to Egypt and Syria with Arabian expert <a href="Carl%20Raswan">Carl Raswan</a> in search of desertbred horses. According to Brown's wife, the two apparently did not get along well, and the five horses purchased during their journey somehow never made it to America. Following that trip, Brown wrote "The Horse of the Desert," still considered to be one of the best works written about the Arabian horse.

In 1932, Brown sent his stud manager Jack Humphrey to Egypt, where acting for Brown he bought two stallions and four mares from <a href="Mohammed%20Ali%20Tewfik">Prince Mohammed Ali</a>. The Prince was known as a horseman and scholar, publishing a two-volume treatise on the breeding of Arabian horses. Two of the mares purchased were daughters of Mahroussa, whom Brown described as "the most beautiful mare he ever saw". The stallions were *Nasr, a successful race horse, and *Zarife.

Brown was a remount agent, who served on the U.S. Remount Board, and his interest in improving the quality of horses used by the <a href="U.S.%20Cavalry">U.S. Cavalry</a> may have been his motivation to breed Arabians. Spencer Borden shared Brown's interest in Arabians as remount bloodstock. Seeking to prove the superior endurance and durability of Arabian horses to the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Remount%20Service">U.S. Army Remount Service</a>, Brown actively encouraged the participation of Arabians in <a href="endurance%20riding">endurance races</a>. He had most of his horses trained to ride and drive. Many were used in endurance races, others shown, and at least one was a <a href="polo%20pony">polo pony</a>.

In 1918, Brown set up a test ride in which he had two of his horses travel from Berlin to <a href="Bethel%2C%20Maine">Bethel, Maine</a>, a distance of . They completed the ride in just over 31 hours including breaks; each horse carried a rider and equipment weighing in poor weather and on muddy roads. The horses were Kheyra, a purebred seven-year-old mare who weighed , and Rustem Bey, a <a href="part-Arabian">half-Arab</a> by <a href="Khaled%205%20%28horse%29">Khaled</a> out of a <a href="Standardbred">Standardbred</a> mare of the <a href="Clay%20Trotting%20Horses">Clay Trotting Horses</a> line. Rustem Bey was taller and heavier than Kheyra. Both horses were examined by a veterinarian, assessed as being sound and fit to continue at the end of the ride, and showed no evidence of soreness 24 hours later. A third Arabian, Herbert Brown's *Crabbet, was ridden by a military officer supervising the test, and that pair covered in seventeen hours. The results of the test were reported in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>".

Following the 1918 test, Brown helped organize the first U.S. Official Cavalry Endurance Ride in 1919, which was won by his mare Ramla, who carried . The race covered in five days. The U.S. Remount Service requested the weight horses carried in 1920 be raised to , and required horses to travel for about a day for five days. Arabians won the highest average points of any breed, and although an Arabian horse did not win first place that year, Rustem Bey was second. In 1921, with a weight requirement of , again covering in five days, Brown's <a href="gelding">gelding</a> *Crabbet won the race and Rustem Bey placed third, despite a donation of $50,000 from <a href="The%20Jockey%20Club">The Jockey Club</a> to the Army to buy the best <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s possible in a failed attempt to beat the Arabians. Brown won again in 1923 with an <a href="Anglo-Arabian">Anglo-Arabian</a> named Gouya, thus retiring the U.S. Mounted Service Cup.

Brown used Arabian stallions owned by the remount service as breeding animals, and over time he also provided 32 of his own stallions to sire remounts. He advocated <a href="crossbreeding">crossbreeding</a> Arabians to improve other breeds. He concluded, however, that attempting to breed purebred Arabians for increased size resulted in a sacrifice in quality and Arabian type.

Brown sold all his horses in 1933 in an attempt to raise funds to keep the Brown Company solvent. They were bought by the <a href="W.%20K.%20Kellogg%20Arabian%20Horse%20Center">Kellogg Ranch</a>, Roger Selby, <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s San Simeon Stud, and "General" J. M. Dickinson of Traveler's Rest Stud, who acquired most of the horses from Brown's 1932 importation from Egypt. Dickinson in turn sold *Zarife to <a href="Wayne%20Van%20Vleet">Wayne Van Vleet</a> of Colorado in 1939, and Azkar, the last foal bred by Brown, to a ranch in Texas. There Azkar was left to fend for himself on the <a href="open%20range">open range</a> as a herd stallion, but, a testament to the hardiness of Brown's Arabians, he survived and was returned to the Arabian breeding world by <a href="Henry%20Babson">Henry Babson</a>. Dickinson sold the mare *Aziza to Alice Payne, who later owned *<a href="Raffles%20%28horse%29">Raffles</a>.

Brown believed it was important to preserve the scenic value of New Hampshire's forests. Between 1903 and 1911, he helped with efforts to establish <a href="White%20Mountain%20National%20Forest">White Mountain National Forest</a>. Among his many civic activities, Brown promoted early legislative efforts to protect public riding trails. He also helped New Hampshire acquire <a href="Franconia%20Notch">Franconia Notch</a> and <a href="Crawford%20Notch">Crawford Notch</a> as public lands, and established a river conservation group in Quebec.

A scholar of the Arabian horse, he collected a significant library of works on the breed, one of the largest collections in the United States. His papers are now kept by the Arabian Horse Owners Foundation (AHOF). Today, the term "CMK", meaning "Crabbet/Maynesboro/Kellogg", is a label for specific lines of "Domestic" or "American-bred" Arabian horses. It describes the descendants of horses imported to America from the desert or from Crabbet Park Stud in the late 1800s and early 1900s and then bred on in the US by the Hamidie Society, Huntington, Borden, Davenport, Brown, <a href="Will%20Keith%20Kellogg">W. K. Kellogg</a>, Hearst, or Dickinson.

Satellite Science Fiction

Satellite Science Fiction was an American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, published from October 1956 to April 1959 by <a href="Leo%20Margulies">Leo Margulies</a>' Renown Publications. Initially "Satellite" was <a href="Digest%20size">digest-sized</a>, and ran a full-length novel in each issue, with a handful of short stories accompanying it: the policy was intended to help it compete against paperbacks, which were taking a growing share of the market. <a href="Sam%20Merwin%20Jr.">Sam Merwin</a> edited the first two issues; Margulies took over when Merwin left, and then hired <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a> for the February 1959 issue. That issue saw the format change to <a href="Letter%20%28paper%20size%29">letter-size</a>, in the hope that the magazine would be more prominent on newsstands. The experiment was a failure, and Margulies closed the magazine when the sales figures came in.

The novels included the original version of <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s first novel, "<a href="The%20Cosmic%20Puppets">The Cosmic Puppets</a>", and well-received work by <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a> and <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, though the quality was not always high. <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> were among the short story contributors. <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a> wrote a series of articles on the early history of science fiction for "Satellite"; these were later to be revised as part of his book "Explorers of the Infinite". In 1958 Margulies tracked down the first magazine publication of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>' "<a href="The%20Time%20Machine">The Time Machine</a>" from 1894–1895, and reprinted a short excerpt from it that had been omitted by every subsequent printing.

In 1952, <a href="Leo%20Margulies">Leo Margulies</a> and H. Lawrence Herbert founded King-Size Publications, which published "<a href="The%20Saint%20%28Simon%20Templar%29%23In%20magazines">Saint Detective Magazine</a>" and "<a href="Fantastic%20Universe">Fantastic Universe</a>". By 1956 the company was in debt, and Margulies sold his share of the company to Herbert. With the money from the sale he founded Renown Publications, launching "<a href="Michael%20Shayne%20Mystery%20Magazine">Michael Shayne Mystery Magazine</a>" in September 1956, and the first issue of "Satellite Science Fiction" in October. "Satellite"'s <a href="Distribution%20%28marketing%29">distributor</a>, PDC, was run by old friends of Margulies. The magazine began as a bimonthly, though Margulies hoped to make it monthly eventually. The first editor was <a href="Sam%20Merwin%20Jr.">Sam Merwin</a>, whom Margulies had worked with since the 1930s. Margulies also hoped to launch a book imprint, Renown Books, with the goal of issuing four books a month. One title each month would be science fiction, and would be featured in "Satellite" before it appeared in book form.

Merwin left after two issues and Margulies took over as editor with the February 1957 issue. In an attempt to make "Satellite" more visible on the newsstands, Margulies changed the format from digest-size to letter-size with the February 1959 issue, handing over the editorship to <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a> at the same time, and switching to a monthly schedule. This proved to be a mistake. The production costs for the new format were higher, and the sales figures for the first issue in the new format were weak; when Margulies saw the numbers he immediately closed down the magazine. The June 1959 issue was assembled, but never printed, though a few galley proofs made their way into the hands of collectors. The end of the magazine also meant the end of Margulies' plans for Renown Books.

Paperbacks were a growing share of the science fiction (sf) market in the mid-1950s; they were successful partly because they offered novels, which most readers preferred to short stories. Margulies decided to combat the threat from paperbacks by including a novel in every issue of the magazine. This was a strategy that had been used by pulp sf magazines like "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>", for which Margulies had been editorial director. It was not common in digest magazines, where a story as short as 15,000 words might be listed as a novel on the contents page, but Margulies acquired true novel-length works, with an average length of about 40,000 words, for "Satellite". Margulies used the slogan "The Magazine That Is a Book!" in advertisements for the magazine, and the tagline "A Complete Science Fiction Novel in Every Issue!" appeared on many of the covers.

The first two issues featured <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a>'s novel "The Man From Earth", and <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick%20bibliography">Philip K. Dick</a>'s debut novel, under the title "A Glass of Darkness". Both were revised and appeared as paperbacks in the next couple of years, titled "<a href="Man%20of%20Earth">Man of Earth</a>" and "<a href="The%20Cosmic%20Puppets">The Cosmic Puppets</a>", respectively. The high standard of these two issues could not be maintained, and in the opinion of sf historians <a href="Malcolm%20Edwards">Malcolm Edwards</a> and <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> the magazine's quality declined thereafter. <a href="Hal%20Clement">Hal Clement</a>'s "Planet for Plunder", which appeared in the third issue, was told from the point of view of an alien on a mission to Earth. It was too short to fit Margulies' policy of publishing a lead novel, so Merwin wrote additional chapters from the human perspective, and alternated the two points of view in the published version. Ashley speaks highly of Clement's original novella, which was eventually published without the additions in 1972, and comments that Merwin's additions serve as "an object lesson in how to ruin a good story". Edwards and Ashley single out two other novels as worthy of mention: <a href="J.%20T.%20McIntosh">J.T. McIntosh</a>'s "One Million Cities" (in the August 1958 issue), and <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>’s "<a href="The%20Languages%20of%20Pao">The Languages of Pao</a>" (December 1957), described by sf critics <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> and <a href="David%20Langford">David Langford</a> as "one of the most intelligent uses in genre sf" of the <a href="Whorf%20hypothesis">Whorf hypothesis</a> – the theory that the language one speaks determines one's perception of reality. Frank Belknap Long's novel "Mission to a Distant Star" (February1958) was at one point considered for publication as the first novel in the planned Renown Books line.

The novels in the first five issues were all original, but in August 1957 the lead novel was a reprint: John Christopher's "The Year of the Comet", which had been published in the UK in 1955, but had not yet appeared in the US. More reprints followed, including <a href="Charles%20Eric%20Maine">Charles Eric Maine</a>'s "Wall of Fire", <a href="E.C.%20Tubb">E.C. Tubb</a>'s "The Resurrected Man", and <a href="Noel%20Loomis">Noel Loomis</a>'s "The Man With Absolute Motion". Each had been published in the previous few years in the UK, but not in the US.

Since the word count for the whole magazine was only about 53,000 words, there was little space for other stories or for non-fiction features, and as a result the accompanying stories were usually very short expositions of an idea or joke; in Michael Shaara's "Four-Billion Dollar Door", the first manned trip to the moon lands successfully but discovers that the door has frozen shut and cannot be opened. <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="Dal%20Stivens">Dal Stevens</a> were frequent contributors of short fiction, and there were appearances by other well-known writers such as <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>. Margulies was aware that a couple of pages of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>' 1895 novel "<a href="The%20Time%20Machine">The Time Machine</a>" had been omitted from every printing of the novel since its original serialization in 1894–1895 in "<a href="The%20New%20Review">The New Review</a>", so he paid for a library search and was rewarded by the discovery of the magazine containing the missing pages in the New York Public Library, across the street from his office. The omitted material, which dealt with a far future where humans have degenerated to small, rabbit-like creatures, was reprinted in the August 1958 issue.

<a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a> began a book review column in February 1957 that quickly turned into a series of articles about early science fiction, beginning with "The Real Earth Satellite Story" in the June 1957 issue, about the idea of satellites in early sf. Moskowitz also suggested stories that could be reprinted to supplement the articles, such as <a href="Fitz%20James%20O%27Brien">Fitz-James O'Brien</a>'s 1864 short story "How I Overcame My Gravity", which accompanied the essay on O'Brien in the June 1958 issue. Most of these articles were later revised for his book, "Explorers of the Infinite", though the illustrations, which reproduced early artwork or book covers, were omitted for the book version. Margulies wrote an editorial for every issue except the last one. In the April 1959 issue his essay argued that a letter column was a way to "[strengthen] the bond between writers and readers"; he accordingly introduced a letter column in the May 1959 issue, which proved to be the last. "Satellite"'s artwork was unremarkable, in the opinion of Mike Ashley; he singles out <a href="Alex%20Schomburg">Alex Schomburg</a>'s half-dozen covers for praise, but describes the interior art, much of it by Leo Morey, as "mediocre".

When the format changed, at the start of 1959, Margulies dropped the policy of having a full-length novel in every issue. He added a "Department of Lost Stories", which reprinted old stories, selected by reader's requests; the first to be reprinted was <a href="Ralph%20Milne%20Farley">Ralph Milne Farley</a>'s 1932 short story "Abductor Minimi Digit", requested by <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>. The June 1959 issue, which was never distributed, would have contained Sturgeon's "The Strange Birth", which eventually appeared in the May 1960 issue of "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", under the title "Open to Me, My Sister". A mockup of the cover for the July 1959 has survived, showing some of the planned contents; the two unpublished issues would have contained stories and articles by Arthur C. Clarke, <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>, among others. Most of the stories and articles were eventually published elsewhere.

"Satellite" was digest-sized for the first fourteen issues, and converted to letter-size for the last four. It maintained a regular bimonthly schedule until the switch to letter size, at which point it became monthly. There were three volumes of six numbers each. The digest issues were each 128 pages, and the letter-sized issues were 64 pages. The price was 35 cents throughout. Sam Merwin edited the first two issues; he was succeeded by Leo Margulies for the rest of the digest run. Frank Belknap Long took over as editor for the four letter-sized issues. Margulies' wife, Cylvia, was managing editor for all issues, under her maiden name, Cylvia Kleinman. The publisher for all issues was Renown Publications, which was wholly owned by Leo Margulies.

Future Science Fiction and Science Fiction Stories

Future Science Fiction and Science Fiction Stories were two American <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction</a> magazines that were published under various names between 1939 and 1943 and again from 1950 to 1960. Both publications were edited by <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a> for the first few issues; <a href="Robert%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert W. Lowndes</a> took over in late 1941 and remained editor until the end. The initial launch of the magazines came as part of a boom in science fiction <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> publishing at the end of the 1930s. In 1941 the two magazines were combined into one, titled "Future Fiction combined with Science Fiction", but in 1943 wartime paper shortages ended the magazine's run, as <a href="Louis%20Silberkleit">Louis Silberkleit</a>, the publisher, decided to focus his resources on his mystery and western magazine titles. In 1950, with the market improving again, Silberkleit relaunched "Future Fiction", still in the pulp format. In the mid-1950s he also relaunched "Science Fiction", this time under the title "Science Fiction Stories". Silberkleit kept both magazines on very slim budgets throughout the 1950s. In 1960 both titles ceased publication when their distributor suddenly dropped all of Silberkleit's titles.

The fiction was generally unremarkable, with few memorable stories being published, particularly in the earlier versions of the magazines. Lowndes spent much effort to set a friendly and engaging tone in both magazines, with letter columns and reader departments that interested fans. He was more successful than Hornig in obtaining good stories, partly because he had good relationships with several well-known and emerging writers. Among the better-known stories he published were "<a href="The%20Liberation%20of%20Earth">The Liberation of Earth</a>" by <a href="William%20Tenn">William Tenn</a>, and "<a href="If%20I%20Forget%20Thee%2C%20Oh%20Earth">If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth</a>" by <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>.

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s the field was booming. One of Gernsback's employees, <a href="Louis%20Silberkleit">Louis Silberkleit</a>, became a publisher in his own right in 1934 when he founded the Winford Publishing Company. Towards the end of the 1930s Silberkleit decided to launch an sf pulp magazine under his <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Magazines">Blue Ribbon Magazines</a> imprint; the title he chose was "Science Fiction." Gernsback recommended <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a> to Silberkleit for the post of editor; Hornig had previously edited "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>" for Gernsback from 1933 to 1936. Silberkleit took the recommendation and Hornig was hired in October 1938. Hornig had no office; he worked from home, coming into the office as needed to drop off manuscripts and dummy materials, and pick up typeset materials to proof. He was given broad freedom to select what he wanted to publish; he reported to Silberkleit's chief editor, Abner J. Sundell, but Sundell knew little about sf and did not get involved with running the magazine. The first issue was dated March 1939. The schedule was intended to be bimonthly, but it began to slip immediately, with the second issue dated June 1939.
In order to spread his costs over more magazines, Silberkleit soon decided to launch two additional titles. When he had worked for Gernsback, Silberkleit had suggested ""Future Fiction"" as a possible title for the magazine Gernsback was planning to launch. Gernsback eventually chose ""Amazing Stories"" instead, and Silberkleit now decided to use his original suggestion for one of the new magazines. In November 1939 the first issue of "Future Fiction" appeared; it was followed in July 1940 by "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Quarterly">Science Fiction Quarterly</a>". Hornig was editor for all three magazines. In October 1940, Hornig received his military <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">draft notice</a>; he was a <a href="pacifist">pacifist</a>, and decided to move to California and register as a conscientious objector. He continued to edit the magazines from the west coast, but Silberkleit was unhappy with the arrangement. Silberkleit allowed Hornig to retain his post as editor of "Science Fiction", and offered the editorship of the other two titles to <a href="Sam%20Moskowitz">Sam Moskowitz</a>. Moskowitz declined, saying afterwards "I would never strike at a man's job", but <a href="Donald%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a> heard of the offer and prompted <a href="Robert%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert W. Lowndes</a> to write to Silberkleit. Lowndes later recalled Wollheim's idea: "In the letter, I'd suggest that it might be a good idea to add a science fiction title to the list, offering my services as editor at a slightly lower price than Hornig was being paid, and also find fault with all the other sf titles presently out, but particularly with Hornig's". Lowndes relates that Silberkleit took the bait and hired him in November 1940; Hornig recalls the separation as being by mutual consent because of his move to California. Lowndes subsequently agreed that this was likely to be the real reason Silberkleit replaced Hornig. The first issues Lowndes was responsible for were the Spring 1941 issue of "Science Fiction Quarterly" and the April 1941 issue of "Future Fiction". He completed the preparations for the last issue of "Science Fiction", dated September 1941, but he used material that Hornig had already selected for the article, with minor exceptions. The changes included the replacement of "Fantasy Times", a fan department by James Taurasi, with "Futurian Times", a similar department from a rival group of fans, the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, to which Lowndes belonged. Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had on Hornig's, vetoing five of the seven stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 "Future", but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit "was satisfied that I knew what I was doing, and ... didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".

"Science Fiction" was not selling well, and later that year Silberkleit merged it with "Future Fiction", under the title "Future Combined with Science Fiction." The last independent issue of "Science Fiction" was dated September 1941, and the first merged issue was dated October 1941. The final two issues of the combined magazine, dated April and June 1943, were, confusingly, titled "Science Fiction Stories;" this was an attempt to improve sales by reminding readers of "Science Fiction", but before sales figures could be tallied to determine the impact of the title change, Silberkleit made the decision to cease publication. The June 1943 issue was the last for some years: Silberkleit was forced to cut some of his titles because of wartime paper shortages, and he decided to retain his western and detective magazines instead.

In 1950, Silberkleit brought back "Future", under the title "Future Combined with Science Fiction Stories"; this allowed Silberkleit to keep the rights to both the titles. The first issue was dated May/June 1950. In January 1952 the title changed to just "Future Science Fiction Stories". Payment rates at that time were one to three cents per word. In the summer of 1953, with "Future" still in pulp format, Silberkleit issued a single <a href="Digest%20size">digest-sized</a> magazine with no number and no date, under the title "Science Fiction Stories". Another issue with the same format and title followed in the spring of 1954, also unnumbered. Silberkleit decided that the digest format was partly responsible for the good sales of these experimental issues, so he changed the format of "Future" from pulp to digest. The first issue in the new format was dated January 1955, and in response to reader feedback the title was changed to "Science Fiction Stories". The volume numbering was continued from the existing "Future" volume numbering, despite the fact that the title was taken from "Science Fiction", the earlier magazine. Complicating matters, Silberkleit decided later in 1955 that the market could support both titles, so he revived "Future" again. Since "Science Fiction Stories" was using the volume numbering from the previous pulp-format incarnation of "Future", Silberkleit switched to an issue number format, with no volume. The first issue was numbered 28, counting forward from the May/June 1950 issue as 1.

Both "Science Fiction Stories" and "Future Fiction" were able to maintain a fairly regular schedule through the rest of the 1950s. "Science Fiction Stories" was bimonthly throughout, except for a brief period from mid-1958 to early 1959 when it patchily adhered to a monthly schedule. "Future Fiction" began with three undated issues, then switched to a quarterly schedule in 1956, and finally to a regular bimonthly schedule from the start of 1958.
With the September 1955 issue, the title graphic of "Science Fiction Stories" was modified so that the cover read "The Original Science Fiction Stories". This was intended to make it clear that the magazine was a continuation of the 1939 version of "Science Fiction", but it led to additional confusion, with some readers believing that this was an entirely new magazine. Lowndes addressed the confusion in the letter column of "Science Fiction Stories", saying

In 1960 Silberkleit's distributor stopped carrying his magazines, and both titles ceased publication, with no notice given in their final issues that this was the end. The last issues were the April 1960 "Future Science Fiction" and the May 1960 "Science Fiction Stories". James Taurasi acquired rights to the "Science Fiction Stories" title from Silberkleit and produced three semi-professional issues in 1961, 1962, and 1963, but the venture was not successful enough for Taurasi to continue.

The first issue of "Science Fiction" showed the continuing influence of Hugo Gernsback in the sf magazine field: in addition to an editor who had worked for him, the magazine featured a guest editorial by Gernsback, and the cover was painted by <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a>, a stalwart of the Gernsback days—in fact, all 12 of "Science Fiction"<nowiki>'s covers for the first series were painted by Paul.</nowiki> Both "Future Fiction" and "Science Fiction" began life with very limited budgets. Hornig worked with <a href="Julius%20Schwartz">Julius Schwartz</a>, a literary agent who was a friend of his; this gave him access to stories by the writers Schwartz represented, but Schwartz would not allow his authors' real names to be used unless they were paid at least one cent per word. Hornig could not afford to pay the one cent rate for everything he bought, so he paid half a cent a word for much of what he acquired through Schwartz, and ran those stories under pseudonyms. Unsurprisingly, given the low rates, the stories sent to Hornig had usually already been rejected by the better-paying markets. The result was mediocre fiction, even from the better-known writers that Hornig was able to attract. The magazines paid on publication, rather than acceptance, and this slower payment also discouraged some authors from submitting material.

A letter from <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, who was a friend of Hornig's, was published in the second issue of "Science Fiction", encouraging Hornig to publish sophisticated stories; in response, Hornig wrote "I'm trying to give the magazine an appeal to mature minds", but sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> comments that "this never became evident". Hornig's comment was probably intended as a criticism of <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>'s editorial approach at "Amazing Stories" and "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>", but Ashley points out that the authors Hornig relied on, concealed behind pseudonyms, were generally the same authors that were selling to Palmer. The first issue of "Future" included stories by <a href="M.M.%20Kaplan">M.M. Kaplan</a>, <a href="J.%20Harvey%20Haggard">J. Harvey Haggard</a>, and <a href="Miles%20J.%20Breuer">Miles J. Breuer</a>, all of whom had been more active some years earlier, and Ashley suggests that Hornig may have obtained some of the many stories that Palmer threw out when he became editor of "Amazing Stories" in 1938.

When "Future" was relaunched in early 1950, the sf magazine field was not particularly crowded, and Lowndes was able to attract moderately good stories from writers who were either well-known or on their way up in the field. The first issue included stories by <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a>, <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a> and <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>; other authors featured in the early issues included <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, <a href="Judith%20Merril">Judith Merril</a>, <a href="H.%20Beam%20Piper">H. Beam Piper</a>, and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>. Some of the better-known stories Lowndes published in the early 1950s were "And There Was Light" by del Rey, "If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth" by <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, and "Liberation of Earth" by <a href="William%20Tenn">William Tenn</a>, which <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a> described as "the funniest story [Tenn has] ever written". He also bought work by some of the women writers active in the 1950s, including several early stories by <a href="Carol%20Emshwiller">Carol Emshwiller</a>. Lowndes knew many successful writers in the field, and was able to call on them for stories, but the expanding sf magazine market of the mid-1950s meant that the best material was spread thinly. To attract readers, Lowndes established a friendly and personal style for the magazine, with letter columns and departments aimed at science fiction fans. Blish, writing as William Atheling, Jr., commented in 1953 that Lowndes was doing a "surprisingly good job" with "Future", despite the low rates and the slow payment to authors.

The trial issues of "Science Fiction Stories" in 1953 and 1954 were competent but unremarkable, with stories by some popular writers, such as <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>, <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a>, and <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>. Once "Science Fiction Stories" became established in 1955, "Future" was relegated to the junior role, and "Science Fiction Stories" tended to publish the better stories of the two. During the period when "Science Fiction Stories" was monthly, it carried serialized novels, including de Camp's "The Tower of Zanid" and <a href="Ward%20Moore">Ward Moore</a> and Robert Bradford's "Caduceus Wild". It also published "Genius Loci", described by Ashley as one of <a href="Thomas%20N.%20Scortia">Thomas N. Scortia</a>'s best short stories. Some well-received stories did appear in "Future" towards the end of the decade, including "Vulcan's Hammer", an early novella version of Philip K. Dick's <a href="Vulcan%27s%20Hammer">novel of the same name</a>; <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a>'s "Worlds Without End"; and Judith Merril's "Homecalling", reprinted in the 1960s in "<a href="Science%20Fantasy%20%28magazine%29">SF Impulse</a>", whose editor, <a href="Kyril%20Bonfiglioli">Kyril Bonfiglioli</a>, commented "I don't believe I have ever read a more successful attempt to imagine an utterly alien way of thought." Lowndes did what he could to provide interesting non-fiction departments: a book review column was started in the early 1950s, and the end of the decade saw a series of science articles written by <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, and critical articles on science fiction history, written by Lowndes himself. <a href="R.A.%20Lafferty">R.A. Lafferty</a>'s first story appeared in "Science Fiction Stories" in the January 1960 issue, shortly before the magazine was closed down. The budget for both magazines, never very great, shrank even further towards the end, so that Lowndes had to fill space with reprints and re-use old illustrations to avoid paying for new stories and artwork.

Charles Hornig was the editor of all 12 issues of the first incarnation of "Science Fiction", and of the first five issues of "Future Fiction". <a href="Robert%20A.%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert W. Lowndes</a> was the editor of all subsequent issues of both titles. Both "Future" and "Science Fiction " began as pulp magazines; the 1953 experimental issue of "Science Fiction Stories" saw a change to digest format for that title, and "Future" followed suit in late 1955 with issue 28. Both titles were initially priced at 15 cents. "Future" raised its price to 20 cents for the July 1943 issue, the last of its first run, but dropped to 15 cents again when it was relaunched in 1950. With the November 1950 issue the price went back to 20 cents, and it rose to 25 cents with the January 1953 issue and 35 cents in June 1954. When "Science Fiction Stories" reappeared in 1953, it was priced at 35 cents, and stayed at that price throughout the remainder of its run.

"Science Fiction" began in March 1939 at 132 pages. "Future Fiction" was 112 pages when it was launched in November of that year, and shortly afterwards, March 1940, "Science Fiction" dropped to 116 pages. The combined magazine, "Future Combined with Science Fiction", retained "Future"s page count of 112; when "Future" was relaunched, still as a pulp, in 1950, the page count had dropped again, to 96. Both "Future" and "Science Fiction Stories" were 128 pages long when they changed to digest format; "Future" remained at that length, but "Science Fiction Stories" switched to 144 pages for nine issues, from January 1956 to May 1957.

The sequence of title changes for the two magazines is summarized below. For "Science Fiction":

Note that although the cover read ""The Original Science Fiction Stories"" for much of the second run, the title was always ""Science Fiction Stories"", though some reference books index the magazine under "O". For "Future":

Louis Silberkleit was the publisher of both magazines throughout their existence, but he changed the imprint he used for them twice. Both were initially published by Blue Ribbon Magazines, <a href="Holyoke%2C%20Massachusetts">Holyoke, Massachusetts</a>. Starting with the March 1940 issue of "Future", and the March 1940 issue of "Science Fiction", the magazines were published by <a href="Double%20Action%20Magazines">Double Action Magazines</a>, with offices in Chicago. This changed to <a href="Columbia%20Publications">Columbia Publications</a>, with offices in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Springfield</a> and Holyoke, Massachusetts, with the March 1941 issue of "Science Fiction" and the April 1941 issue of "Future".

A Canadian edition of "Science Fiction" ran for 6 pulp-sized issues of 64 pages from October 1941 to June 1942, priced at 25 cents; it was intended to be monthly but there were no issues in December 1941, or in April or May 1942. The publisher was Superior Magazines of Toronto for the first two issues, and Duchess Printing of Toronto for the remaining four. A different editor, William Brown-Forbes, was listed, but the fiction was all reprinted from Silberkleit's U.S. magazines. The artwork was new, however, with covers by John Hilkert and Edwin Shaw, among others.

Two issues of "Science Fiction" were reprinted in the UK by Atlas Publications; these were abridged versions of the October and December 1939 issues. They were 96 pages, in pulp format. There were no British reprints of the first series of "Future", but Thorpe & Porter reprinted 14 numbered and undated issues from November 1951 to June 1954, corresponding roughly to the U.S. issues from March 1951 to March 1954. They were 96 pages in pulp format, and were priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">1/6</a> (7.5p). In 1957 Strato Publications reprinted another 11 issues, again undated, from November 1957 to February 1960, corresponding to the U.S. issues from Summer 1957 to August 1959, skipping the February 1958 issue. These were in digest format, and were 128 pages; they were priced at <a href="%C2%A3sd">2/-</a> (10p). Strato Publications also produced a reprint series of "Science Fiction"; this ran from October 1957 to May 1960, for 12 undated issues, in digest format, 128 pages, priced at 2/-. The first 11 of these reprints were cut versions of the U.S. originals, corresponding to 11 of the U.S. issues between September 1957 and May 1959—the omitted issues were January, March, and September 1958. The final issue was the U.S. issue for May 1960, overprinted with the British price.

There are no anthologies of stories drawn solely from either "Science Fiction" or "Future", but in the 1960s <a href="Ivan%20Howard%20%28writer%29">Ivan Howard</a> edited several anthologies for Silberkleit's publishing imprint, <a href="Belmont%20Books">Belmont Books</a>, with contents drawn solely from Silberkleit's magazines. These included:

In addition, <a href="Douglas%20Lindsay">Douglas Lindsay</a> edited an anthology titled "Blue Moon" in 1970, published by Mayflower Books, which contains six stories from the August 1942 issue of "Future", plus one story from the Winter 1942 issue of "Science Fiction Quarterly".

Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Moscow)

The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary is a <a href="neo-Gothic">neo-Gothic</a> <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> at <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>'s center, that serves as the cathedral of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Moscow">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow</a>. Located in the <a href="Central%20Administrative%20Okrug">Central Administrative Okrug</a>, it is one of three <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> churches in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and the largest in Russia.

The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Russia%29">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> under <a href="Russian%20Empire">Tsarist Russia</a>. <a href="Groundbreaking">Groundbreaking</a> was in 1899; construction work began in 1901 and was completed ten years later. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect <a href="Foma%20Osipovitch%20Bogdanovitch-Dvorzhetskij">Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki</a>. The style was influenced by <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> and <a href="Milan%20Cathedral">Milan Cathedral</a>. With the help of funds from Catholic <a href="parish">parish</a>es in Russia and its neighbouring states, the church was consecrated as a <a href="chapel">chapel</a> for Moscow's Polish parish in 1911. In the aftermath of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> in 1917, the <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a> was overthrown by the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> and Russia became part of the newly formed <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Because the promotion of <a href="state%20atheism">state atheism</a> was a part of <a href="Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%20atheism">Marxist–Leninist ideology</a>, the government <a href="Soviet%20anti-religious%20legislation">ordered many churches closed</a>; the cathedral was closed in 1938. During World War II, it was threatened with demolition, and was used after the war for civil purposes, as a warehouse and then a hostel. Following the <a href="fall%20of%20communism">fall of communism</a> in 1991, it returned to being a church in 1996. In 2002 it was elevated to the status of cathedral. Following an extensive and costly programme of reconstruction and refurbishment, the cathedral was reconsecrated in 2005.

In the 21st century, after 58 years of non-religious use, the cathedral is once again the setting for regular liturgical celebrations in multiple languages—Russian, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>, English, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>—as well as <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a>s featuring organ and church music. Its <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a>, the third since the cathedral's construction, was donated by the <a href="Basel%20M%C3%BCnster">Basel Münster</a>. The cathedral is listed as a heritage building in the Russian Federation, and is a protected monument.

At the end of the 19th century, only two Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the <a href="Catholic%20church%20of%20Saint-Louis%20des%20Fran%C3%A7ais%2C%20Moscow">Saint Louis des Français church</a> for the French population and the <a href="Catholic%20church%20of%20Sts.%20Peter%20and%20Paul%2C%20Moscow">St. Peter and Paul</a> church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings were too small. Following the submission of a petition to the <a href="Governor-General">Governor-General</a> of Moscow, the local council voted for a new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> sacred sites.

Bearing in mind the council's requirements, on 16 May 1895 the parish purchased a 10 <a href="hectare">hectare</a> (22 <a href="acre">acre</a>) site on Malaya Gruzinskaya Street, then located on the city outskirts and surrounded by fields and vegetable gardens. Today, the site is in the <a href="Central%20Administrative%20Okrug">Central Administrative Okrug</a>, outside of the <a href="Garden%20Ring">Garden Ring</a> road defining the old walled city, just beyond the <a href="Moscow%20Metro">Moscow Metro</a>'s <a href="Koltsevaya%20Line">Koltsevaya Line</a>, and is surrounded by 20th century urban development. The purchase of the land was funded by donations, and cost 10,000 <a href="Russian%20ruble">rubles</a> in gold (roughly <a href="US%24">US$</a> ). The purchase agreement and a full list of donations are today kept in the city archives of Moscow and <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>.

A further condition imposed by the city read as follows: "In the light of the two existing Roman Catholic churches, the future church shall be larger, with a cross on the <a href="gable">gable</a>, but without <a href="spire">spire</a>s and exterior sculpture". The plans for the building were produced by a Russian architect of Polish descent, <a href="Foma%20Osipovitch%20Bogdanovitch-Dvorzhetskij">Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki</a>. Although his plan did not follow the council's latter condition, it was accepted. The plan provided seating for up to 5,000 worshippers. <a href="Groundbreaking">Groundbreaking</a> was in 1899, and construction took place from 1901 to 1911. The construction cost was 290,000 roubles in gold (roughly US$ ), much of which was donated by members of the Polish parish of Moscow. More funding came from Catholic parishes throughout Russia, Poland and Byelorussia.

The church was consecrated on 21 December 1911 as the "Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary". It soon obtained the status of a chapel in the Peter and Paul parish. The consecration received extensive coverage in the Russian and Polish press. The Moscow newspaper, "Russkoye Slovo", wrote: In the filthy, wretched Malaya Gruzinskaya (Little Georgian) Street, forsaken by God and the city, there rose the wonderful, highly artistic solidity of the new Roman Catholic church, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception of Holy Virgin Mary. Tremendous in magnitude and height, ... with a plenty of conning turrets and towers with crosses. The new cathedral makes a deep impression ... [Every detail] looks impressive and eminent: Not the slightest stylistic flaw could be seen or detected.

From 1911 to 1917, money was collected for interior furnishings, which were relatively sparse apart from the impressive <a href="Altar">main altar</a>. (These original furnishings remained until the 1930s.) Parts of the draft plan were abandoned: the floor was not constructed from marble as intended, but poured from plain concrete; outside there were no pinnacles on the <a href="fa%C3%A7ade">façade</a>. Writings vary on when the pinnacles were built: some claim they were built in 1923, but others argue that they were not completed until the renovation of the cathedral in 1999. Observers that argue for an earlier construction date state that they were damaged during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and left dismantled for some time.

In the aftermath of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> in 1917, the <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a> was overthrown by the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a>, and <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> became part of the new <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. As the promotion of <a href="state%20atheism">state atheism</a> was a part of <a href="Marxist%E2%80%93Leninist%20atheism">Marxist–Leninist ideology</a>, the Soviet government <a href="USSR%20anti-religious%20campaign%20%281928%E2%80%931941%29">ordered many churches closed</a>. The Peter and Paul parish was formally dissolved by the communist government in 1929, and celebrating <a href="mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> was forbidden. The church lost much of its surrounding gardens in 1935—a school was built there the following year—and the church was finally closed on 30 July 1938 (the <a href="St.%20Peter%20and%20Paul%20church">St. Peter and Paul church</a> had met the same fate nine days earlier). The church was plundered after its closure, and many items, including the main altar and the organ, were irretrievably lost. The church was used for several months as a vegetable store, and was then reconstructed as a hostel and its interior divided into four floors.

The main tower's spire was removed during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a> to prevent the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> from using it as a landmark. Shortly after the war ended in 1945, sections of the gardens were annexed for the building of an apartment block. A fire in 1956 caused the collapse of the lantern over the principal tower's dome. Existing tenants were slowly rehoused, and members of the Mosspetspromproyekt (Russian: "Мосспецпромпроект") research institute took possession of the former church. The research institute dealt primarily with project drawings for industrial facilities, but also designed the Olympic cauldron used at <a href="Luzhniki%20Stadium">Lenin Stadium</a> for the <a href="1980%20Summer%20Olympics">1980 Summer Games</a>.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's exterior became increasingly dilapidated; among those concerned about the church's deterioration was Russian <a href="bard%20music">bard</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Vysotsky">Vladimir Vysotsky</a>, who lived in a house across the street. In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. These projects were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.

The "<a href="glasnost">glasnost</a>" (openness) policy, introduced during the rule of <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, played a major role in developing <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">religious freedom</a> in the Soviet Union. Consequently, in 1989, a group of Moscow Catholics and the cultural association "The Polish House" (Russian: "Дом Польский"), suggested that the building should again be used for religious purposes. Following the city's assent, the first Mass at the site in 60 years was celebrated on the church stairs during the feast of the <a href="Immaculate%20Conception">Immaculate Conception</a> on 8 December 1990. The Mass was celebrated by the Polish priest <a href="Tadeusz%20Pikus">Tadeusz Pikus</a>, who later became an <a href="List%20of%20auxiliary%20bishops%20in%20Warsaw">auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Warsaw</a>.

In January 1990, a group of Catholics in Moscow formally founded the parish of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary. On 13 April 1991 <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> promulgated the <a href="encyclical">encyclical</a> "<a href="Providi%20quae">Providi quae</a>", establishing the "<a href="Apostolic%20administration">Apostolic administration</a> for European Russia". Its apostolic administrator, <a href="Tadeusz%20Kondrusiewicz%20%28archbishop%29">Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz</a>, issued a decree for the reconstruction of the church on 21 April 1991. With the city's permission, on the <a href="Constitution%20of%20May%203%2C%201791">Polish National Day</a> (3 May) a second Mass was held, again on the stairs. The constitution of the parish was officially acknowledged on 31 May by the department of justice of the city council. Meanwhile, parts of the church were subleased by Mosspetspromproyekt to various companies.

From 7 June 1991, Masses were celebrated each Sunday in the churchyard—the institute still occupied the building. On 15 July 1991, Father Josef Sanewski, a member of the <a href="Salesians%20of%20Don%20Bosco">Salesians of Don Bosco</a>, was appointed the new parish priest. Religious education had been given regularly under the direction of the Salesian Sisters since 29 November 1991. At the same time, the first charities were founded for nursing and aid to the poor. The vice-mayor of Moscow, <a href="Yury%20Luzhkov">Yury Luzhkov</a>, signed a decree in favour of the Church on 1 February 1992 ordering the institute to vacate the property by 1994. Parish members entered the building on 2 July 1992, and occupied the institute's workshop. Moscow City Council agreed to allow the church to occupy the space, which was subsequently walled off from the remainder of the building. There, in the former workshop, Mass was celebrated regularly.
The dividing wall was removed by parish members on 7 March 1995, while others started clearing the truss. The institute called the police, <a href="OMON">OMON</a>, for help. The following day, more conflict with the police occurred and several parish members, among them a <a href="nun">nun</a>, were injured. Others were arrested, including a priest and a <a href="seminarian">seminarian</a>, but were released the next day. After these events, the Apostolic Administrator, Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, wrote an open letter to the Russian President, <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Boris Yeltsin</a>, on 9 March 1995, requesting his intervention: "It seems that persecution of the church was history. Is that the case? I can't remember seeing a priest arrested, and I can't remember seeing a nun beaten up."

As a result, Senior Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a Yeltsin appointee, signed a decision for the removal of the institute. The decision, dated 7 March 1995, ordered the institute's departure by 1996. Simultaneously, the institute wrote to Luzhkov describing the earlier events from their perspective, and requested compensation for loss of the building. In a meeting with the Polish Ambassador, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Ciosek">Stanisław Ciosek</a>, on 15 March 1995, the acting mayor of Moscow, Alexander Musykantski, assured him that the return of the church would be complete by the end of the year.

On 19 March 1995, a Mass was celebrated in the reclaimed part of the church under the direction of <a href="Papal%20Nuncio">Papal Nuncio</a> <a href="John%20Bukowski">John Bukowski</a>, who delivered Pope John Paul II's blessing to the parish. In a new decision dated 2 November 1995, Luzhkov ordered Mosspetspromproyekt to leave the building by the end of the year at the latest. When the order was still not implemented, parish members entered the institute on 2 January 1996 and began the removal. Institute director Evgeny Afanasyev called the police once again, but on this occasion, they declined to intervene. Subsequently, the institute director asked the parish priest for a final extension of the removal date by two weeks—Mosspetspromproyekt vacated the building on 13 January 1996. On 2 February 1996, the Archdiocese of Mother of God at Moscow obtained official permission to use the church indefinitely.

In the early 1990s, plans were made by the Office for Monument Protection to restore the church by 1997, the 850th anniversary of Moscow's foundation. This proposal was not implemented because of the dispute over occupancy. However, in 1995, the city determined that the parish would be responsible for restoration costs. A commission was founded for the planned restoration, chaired by parish priest Josef Sanevski, Russian historian <a href="Stanislav%20Durnin">Stanislav Durnin</a>, and Polish building contractor and politician <a href="Grzegorz%20Tuderek">Grzegorz Tuderek</a>.

From 1996 to 1999, the church was restored with the help of sponsors <a href="EnergoPol">EnergoPol</a>, a Polish company, and <a href="Renovabis">Renovabis</a>, a German association for Roman Catholic churches. The Russian government provided funds towards the conclusion of the project. Reconstruction took place initially under the direction of Polish companies PKZ and Budimex, who completely restored the façade and roof. From September 1998, Father Andrzey Stetskevich and <a href="Jan%20Tajchman">Jan Tajchman</a>, architect and <a href="restorer">restorer</a> from <a href="Toru%C5%84">Toruń</a>, Poland, jointly oversaw the work; they had previously headed the restoration of the Catholic Assumption Cathedral in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>. (Stetskevich later rose to become <a href="vicar%20general">vicar general</a> of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow.) The interior fittings and the new altar were built by Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian experts. Companies in Moscow carried out all the internal and external <a href="marble">marble</a> work. The church furnishings were produced, under the direction of Vladimir Mukhin, by students from the St. Petersburg renovating school. <a href="Stained%20glass">Stained glass</a> for the façade's <a href="rose%20window">rose window</a> were made in Toruń, other windows were produced by Tolotschko, a Belarusian company from <a href="Hrodna">Hrodna</a>. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was ceremonially reopened on 12 December 1999 and was reconsecrated by the <a href="Cardinal%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>, <a href="Angelo%20Sodano">Angelo Cardinal Sodano</a>. The cathedral incorporates a library, the editorial office of the Russian Catholic magazine "The Catholic Messenger—The Light of the Gospel" (Russian: Католический вестник — Свет Евангелия) as well as the local office for the <a href="Caritas%20%28charity%29">Caritas</a> charity.

The cathedral, built in a <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">neo-Gothic</a> style, is a <a href="Nave">three-aisled</a> cross-shaped pseudo-<a href="basilica">basilica</a>, which has three <a href="nave">nave</a>s and an <a href="apse">apse</a>. It was constructed entirely from red brick, and was not <a href="Cement%20render">rendered</a> externally. The five-<a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bay</a> main aisle extends for , each with lateral arms long. The octagonal <a href="lantern">lantern</a> tower above the <a href="crossing%20%28architecture%29">crossing</a> is high. The façade is based on the design of <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, and the tower loosely on that of <a href="Milan%20Cathedral">Milan Cathedral</a>. Typically for old-style church buildings, each side aisle is strengthened by five <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es, the ten together symbolising the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John Paul II and archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz.

The first ten steps to the <a href="Portal%20%28architecture%29">portal</a> symbolise the Commandments, the eleventh symbolises <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. The portal symbolises Heaven's gate, reached by obeying the Commandments and the teachings of Jesus. The portal is surrounded by columns and crowned by a <a href="wimperg">wimperg</a>, the gable spire of which is formed as a <a href="finial">finial</a>. The wimperg is decorated with a <a href="relief">relief</a> ornament, in the centre of which is a golden <a href="monogram">monogram</a> "VMIC" ("Virgo Maria Immaculata Concepta", Latin for "Virgin Mary, conceived unblemished"). The original architectural design provided a <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> instead of the monogram, a reference to the <a href="Judaism">Jewish faith</a> of the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>. Above the wimperg is a tall rose window, built from a light-coloured, translucent stone.

On each side on the entry of the cathedral is a stone <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a> and a <a href="holy%20water%20font">holy water font</a>. High on the left side there is a brick from the <a href="Lateran%20Basilica">Lateran Basilica</a>, and on the right side a jubilee 2000 medal. The <a href="crypt">crypt</a> is accessed through the door in the right wall of the vestibule, then up to the <a href="Matroneum">organ matroneum</a> and finally down through the door on the left wall. In the crypt, there is an <a href="Oratory%20%28worship%29">oratory</a>, as well as <a href="Catechism">Catechism</a> rooms and the office of the Caritas charity.

There are benches in the main aisle and <a href="confessional">confessional</a>s in the side aisles. The confessionals contained benches until the closure of the church in 1938. After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. The floor is constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.

Most of the high stained glass windows have <a href="Abstract%20art">abstract</a> designs. Those in front feature crests of Apostolic Nuncios John Cardinal Burkowski and <a href="Francesco%20Colasuonno">Francesco Cardinal Colasuonno</a>. The windows in the <a href="aisle">transept</a> are slightly larger and have a more complex design. The window in the right lateral arm depicts <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a> and <a href="Saint%20Andrew">Saint Andrew</a>, who symbolise the Western and Eastern branches of the Catholic Church. On the window on the opposite side of the left lateral arm is depicted Pope John Paul II, who is gazing at the <a href="F%C3%A1tima%2C%20Portugal">Marian apparition of Fátima</a>. In the nave, under the windows, are fourteen reliefs depicting the <a href="Stations%20of%20the%20Cross">Stations of the Cross</a>.

The entry to the <a href="vestry">vestry</a> is located at the end of the right side aisle next to the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a>; at the end of the left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The <a href="Church%20tabernacle">tabernacle</a> is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses <a href="relic">relic</a>s of Saints Andrew, <a href="Zenon%20of%20Verona">Zenon of Verona</a>, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nyssa">Gregory of Nyssa</a>, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="Cosmas%20and%20Damian">Cosmas, Damian</a> and <a href="Basilissa%20and%20Anastasia">Anastasia</a>, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Verona">Diocese of Verona</a>. The <a href="Ambon%20%28liturgy%29">ambo</a>—a projection coming out from the <a href="soleas">soleas</a>—is on the right side of the altar, and is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the <a href="apse">apse</a>, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> by architect <a href="Svyatoslav%20Sakhlebin">Svyatoslav Sakhlebin</a> are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s. On the opposite side of the altar and above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50 choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.

The present <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> is one of the largest in Russia and the third since the church's foundation. The first organ was taken by the state in 1938 and the second, an <a href="electronic%20organ">electronic organ</a> with 60 <a href="organ%20stop">stops</a>, was installed as part of the renovations in 1999. It was donated by the American charity "Aid to the Church in Russia", headed by priest Marcel Guarnizo, who received consecration as a deacon during the renovation in 1997. The electronic organ was replaced by a pipe organ during 2002–2005.

The cathedral's pipe organ was built in 1955 by Orgelbau Kuhn AG of <a href="M%C3%A4nnedorf">Männedorf</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, for the Reformed Evangelical <a href="Basel%20M%C3%BCnster">Basel Münster</a> Cathedral in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, Switzerland. The Swiss cathedral donated the organ, dismantled it in 2002, and all pipes but without the largest—"Nr. 65 principal bass 32", 10 m (32 ft) long—were transferred to Moscow. The pipes were transported wrapped in new garments donated by the people of Basel, which were later distributed to Moscow's poor. The installation of the pipe organ in Moscow was performed by the Orgelbau Schmid company from <a href="Kaufbeuren">Kaufbeuren</a>, Germany, headed by Gerhard Schmid, who refused payment for his work. During the work, Schmid was killed in a fall from a scaffold on 9 September 2004; his son Gunnar finished the work.

The original 10-metre, 32' pipe stayed in Switzerland and was built into a new organ in the <a href="M%C3%BCnster%20Cathedral">Münster Cathedral</a>, which belongs to the <a href="Swiss%20Inventory%20of%20Cultural%20Property%20of%20National%20and%20Regional%20Significance">Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance</a>. This pipe, capable of reproducing a tone of 16.35 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a>, the bass note <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">C</a> four octaves below middle C, was recreated in Moscow and added to the cathedral's organ in 2009.
The five church bells are located on the cathedral's roof behind a tripartite screen of <a href="Gothic%20architecture%23Lancet%20arch">lancet</a> arches on the left side of the façade. They were poured by the Felczyński bell foundry in <a href="Przemy%C5%9Bl">Przemyśl</a>, Poland and donated by bishop Wiktor Skworc The bells are electronically activated. The largest weighs and bears the name "<a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20F%C3%A1tima">Our Lady of Fátima</a>". The other bells are named, from the smallest to the largest: "John Paul II"; "<a href="Jude%20the%20Apostle">St. Jude</a>", named after the <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz; "Anniversary-2000"; and "<a href="Victor%20and%20Corona">St. Victor</a>", named after the patron saint of Bishop Wiktor Skworc.

On 11 February 2002, Pope John Paul II created the administration for the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Moscow">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow</a> and named Apostolic Administrator <a href="Tadeusz%20Kondrusiewicz%20%28archbishop%29">Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz</a> as archbishop and <a href="metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitan</a>. However, this decision was criticised by Patriarch <a href="Alexy%20II">Alexy II</a>, who called it "unfriendly", as he believed the Roman Catholic Church saw Russia as a field for missionary activity. At the same time, the Church of the Immaculate Conception acquired the status of <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a> of the archdiocese. In March 2002, members of the cathedral and Catholics from other European cities participated in a <a href="rosary">rosary</a> led by the Pope via video conference. Since the reopening, many services take place daily in the cathedral. The main <a href="liturgical%20language">liturgical language</a> for Masses is Russian, but services are also held in <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, English, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>, <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> (based on an <a href="Armenian%20Rite">Armenian Rite</a>).

The re-installed organ—with 74 stops, 4 <a href="Manual%20%28music%29">manuals</a> and 5,563 pipes—was consecrated by Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow on 16 January 2005. The mass was followed by the opening concert for the First International Festival for Organ Music. The month-long festival saw several organ concerts in the cathedral. The closing concert was performed by chief organist James Edward Goettsche from <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a>. Organ and church music concerts take place regularly in the cathedral; entry is normally free, except for selected concerts, for which admission is by ticket. A service in remembrance of those killed in the <a href="2010%20Polish%20Air%20Force%20Tu-154%20crash">2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash</a> was held on 12 April 2010.

Escalera's bat

Escalera's bat ("Myotis escalerai") is a European <a href="bat">bat</a> in the genus "<a href="Myotis">Myotis</a>", found in Spain (including the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>), Portugal, and far <a href="southern%20France">southern France</a>.

Although the species was first named in 1904, it was included in <a href="Natterer%27s%20bat">Natterer's bat</a> ("Myotis nattereri") until molecular studies, first published in 2006, demonstrated that the two are distinct species. "M. escalerai" is most closely related to an unnamed species from Morocco. Unlike "M. nattereri", which lives in small groups in tree holes, "M. escalerai" forms large colonies in caves. Females start to aggregate in late spring in maternity colonies, and their young are born in summer. The species spends each winter in hibernation colonies, usually in caves or basements.

"M. escalerai" is a medium-sized, mostly gray bat, with lighter underparts. It has a pointed muzzle, a pink face, and long ears. The wings are broad and the species is an agile flyer. Wingspan is and body mass is . Though very similar to "M. nattereri", it differs from that species in some features of the tail membrane. The <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> of "M. escalerai" is assessed as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" or "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" in various parts of its range.

"Myotis escalerai" was named by <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Cabrera%20%28naturalist%29">Ángel Cabrera</a> in 1904, on the basis of four specimens from two localities in eastern Spain. He named the new species after the Spanish entomologist Manuel Martínez de la Escalera, who collected two specimens of the species in <a href="Bellver%20de%20Cerdanya">Bellver</a>, <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. Cabrera did not designate either of the two localities (Bellver and <a href="Foyos">Foyos</a>, <a href="Valencia%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Valencia</a>) as the <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a>, and later authors have listed both. Currently, Foyos, which was listed first by Cabrera, is accepted as the type locality. Cabrera commented that "M. escalerai" was close to <a href="Natterer%27s%20bat">Natterer's bat</a> ("Myotis nattereri"), and in 1912, <a href="Gerrit%20S.%20Miller">Gerrit S. Miller</a> listed "escalerai" as a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of that species. He argued that one of the features Cabrera had listed as distinguishing the two was an artefact of the preservation of the specimens of "M. escalerai" in alcohol. Miller's classification was followed for almost a century, and indeed, Cabrera himself accepted in 1914 that "M. escalerai" was not a valid species.

However, a 2006 study by Carlos Ibáñez and colleagues found that "M. nattereri" in fact included several <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a> with highly distinguished <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s characteristics, even though morphological differences were small or nonexistent. One, which they recorded in the southern <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, was identified as "M. escalerai". Populations in the mountains of northern Spain represent another species (now known to be "<a href="Cryptic%20myotis">Myotis crypticus</a>"), which is now also known from the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>. A 2009 study using data from the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> genes <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> and <a href="ND1">ND1</a> found that "M. escalerai" is most closely related to an <a href="undescribed%20taxon">unnamed species</a> from Morocco previously included in "M. nattereri" (now known to be <a href="Zenati%20myotis">"Myotis" "zenatius"</a>), and more distantly to other members of the <a href="Myotis%20nattereri%20complex">"Myotis nattereri" group</a>. "M. escalerai" and "M. zenatius" are estimated to have diverged about 2 million years ago. Later in 2009, "M. escalerai" was also recorded for the first time from France. One 2011 study found a fifth putative species in the complex (""Myotis" sp. C"), occurring in the Italian peninsula and most closely related to "M. crypticus", but another study published in the same year included these populations in "M. crypticus". The latter study, by I. Salicini and colleagues, used sequences from six <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> genes to confirm the distinctiveness of "M. escalerai" and its close relationship with "M." "zenatius". 

A medium-sized gray bat, "Myotis escalerai" is similar to "Myotis nattereri". The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The <a href="tragus%20%28anatomy%29">tragus</a>, a projection on the inner side of the outer ear, is long and reaches to the middle of the ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from "M. nattereri" in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.

The head body length is , tail length is , forearm length is , ear length is , <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> is , and body mass is .

The range of "Myotis escalerai" remains poorly constrained and may turn out to be larger than currently known. "M. escalerai" is widespread in Spain and Portugal. For example, it occurs widely, though localized, in <a href="Arag%C3%B3n">Aragón</a>, where "Myotis" sp. A (the only other species in the "M. nattereri" complex to occur there) is known from a single locality only. Similarly, in Catalonia, "M. escalerai" is widespread and occurs from sea level up to an altitude of . The species also occurs on the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a> of <a href="Mallorca">Mallorca</a>, <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a>, and <a href="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>. The sole French record is from a cave in <a href="Valmanya">Valmanya</a>, <a href="Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Orientales">Pyrénées-Orientales</a>.

Relatively little is known of the biology of "M. escalerai". Females begin to form reproductive colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single young is born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes "M. escalerai" from "M. nattereri" as well as "M." sp. A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed in a variety of structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a> colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. "M. escalerai" is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. <a href="Rabies">Rabies</a> has been identified in a Spanish specimen of "M. escalerai".

The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> classifies "Myotis escalerai" as "<a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>". "M. nattereri" and "M. escalerai" are also listed separately on the Annex to the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats. Portugal lists "M. escalerai" as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>", though noting that populations may be increasing. Because of its restriction to caves, it is considered vulnerable in Aragón. In Catalonia, the species appears tolerant of different habitats and of human disturbance, but it is listed as "<a href="data%20deficient">data deficient</a>". In France, where the species was only discovered in 2009, it is also listed as "data deficient".

1923 FA Cup Final

The 1923 FA Cup Final was an <a href="association%20football">association football</a> match between <a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> on 28 April 1923 at the original <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in London. The showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (better known as the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>), it was the first football match to be played at Wembley Stadium. <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> was in attendance to present the trophy to the winning team.

Each team had progressed through five rounds to reach the final. Bolton Wanderers won 1–0 in every round from the third onwards, and <a href="David%20Jack">David Jack</a> scored the lone goal each time. West Ham United faced opposition from the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> or lower in each round, the first time this had occurred since the introduction of multiple divisions in the Football League. West Ham took three attempts to defeat <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> in the fourth round but then easily defeated <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> in the semi-final, scoring five goals.

The final was preceded by chaotic scenes as vast crowds surged into the stadium, far exceeding its official capacity of approximately 125,000. A crowd estimated at up to 300,000 gained entrance and the terraces overflowed, with the result that spectators found their way into the area around the pitch and even onto the playing area itself. Mounted policemen, including one on a light-coloured horse which became the defining image of the day, had to be brought in to clear the crowds from the pitch and allow the match to take place. The match began 45 minutes late as crowds stood around the perimeter of the pitch. Although West Ham started strongly, Bolton proved the dominant team for most of the match and won 2–0. David Jack scored a goal two minutes after the start of the match and <a href="Jack%20Smith%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">Jack Smith</a> added a controversial second goal during the second half. The pre-match events prompted discussion in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> and led to the introduction of safety measures for future finals. The match is often referred to as the "White Horse Final" and is commemorated by the <a href="White%20Horse%20Bridge">White Horse Bridge</a> at the new <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>.

<a href="Bolton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> and <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> were playing in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> and <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> respectively, and both entered the competition at the first round stage, under the tournament format in place at the time. Bolton had appeared in the final twice before, in <a href="1894%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1894</a> and <a href="1904%20FA%20Cup%20Final">1904</a>, but West Ham, who had only joined <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> in 1919, had never previously progressed further than the quarter finals. In the first round, Bolton defeated <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> of the <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Third Division South</a>, in the process recording the club's first away win in the competition since a second round victory over <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> in the <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">1904–05 season</a>. After a home win over <a href="Leeds%20United%20F.C.">Leeds United</a> in the second round, Bolton faced one of the First Division's top teams, <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a>, in the third round. The initial match at Huddersfield's <a href="Leeds%20Road%2C%20Huddersfield">Leeds Road</a> ground ended in a draw, necessitating a replay which Bolton won 1–0. In the fourth round Bolton defeated <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> by a single goal, and in the semi-final beat <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> by the same score in a match played at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, home of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. Although ticket prices were considered to be extremely high, a crowd of 72,000 attended the match, a new record for an FA Cup semi-final. In every match from the third round onwards, Bolton's single goal was scored by <a href="David%20Jack">David Jack</a>, which gave him a reputation for having single-handedly steered his team into the final.
In contrast to Bolton's defensive style, West Ham's cup run was characterised by fast-moving, attacking play, which won them many admirers. The London-based club began the competition away to fellow Second Division team <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> and won 3–2. In the second round they were held to a draw by <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a> of the Third Division South, but won the replay 1–0 at home. The "Hammers" defeated another Third Division South team, <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a>, in the third round, but found the fourth round tough going against <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. The first match at West Ham's home, the <a href="Boleyn%20Ground">Boleyn Ground</a>, ended in a 1–1 draw, as did the replay at <a href="The%20Dell%20%28Southampton%29">The Dell</a> in <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>. A second replay was held at <a href="Villa%20Park">Villa Park</a> in Birmingham, home of <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>, and finally produced a winner, as West Ham won 1–0 with a goal from <a href="Billy%20Brown%20%28footballer%20born%201900%29">Billy Brown</a>. The goal came in the 70th minute, with a "clever free kick" past the "startled" <a href="Herbert%20Lock">Herbert Lock</a> in the Saints' goal. In the semi-finals, West Ham took on <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a> at <a href="Stamford%20Bridge%20%28stadium%29">Stamford Bridge</a>, home of <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a>, and won 5–2. Brown scored two more goals and <a href="Billy%20Moore%20%28English%20footballer%29">Billy Moore</a> also scored twice. All five of the teams that West Ham defeated on their way to Wembley played in the Second Division or lower. This made West Ham the first team since the introduction of multiple divisions in The Football League to reach the FA Cup final without facing opposition from the top division.

The match was the first event of any kind to take place at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>, which had not been due to open until 1924 but was completed ahead of schedule. After sub-capacity crowds had attended the first three finals after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> at Stamford Bridge, <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (The FA) was unconvinced that the match could fill the large capacity of the new stadium and undertook a major advertising campaign, for fans to attend. Despite these fears, the new <a href="national%20stadium">national stadium</a>, which had been advertised as the greatest venue of its kind and had an unprecedented capacity of 125,000, proved to be a great lure and drew a large number of casual observers. The fact that a London-based team was competing meant that many football fans from all parts of the city chose to attend. The morning newspapers on the day of the match reported that around 5,000 fans were travelling from <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a> and that they were expected to be joined by "at least 115,000 enthusiasts from London and other parts of the country". The easy accessibility of the stadium by public transport and the fine weather were also factors which contributed to the enormous crowd.

The gates were opened at 11:30 am as advertised, three and a half hours before the match was due to begin, and until 1:00 pm the flow of people into the stadium was orderly. By 1:00 pm, however, a vast number of people were pouring into the stadium, and after an inspection by the stadium authorities, the decision was made to close the gates at 1:45 pm. Spectator William Rose said later that the route to the stadium was ""seething" with people" and that "the nearer I got to the stadium the worse it got, by the time I got there the turnstiles had been closed". Although the information was relayed to various railway stations, thousands of people continued to arrive and mass outside the gates. Organisation within the stadium was poor, and in his report on the match the correspondent for the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" described the stewarding as "useless" and stated that officials in and around the stadium "seemed to know nothing". Fans were not directed to any specific area, and the tiers in the lower half of the stadium filled up much faster than those higher up.

As the crowds outside the stadium continued to grow, local police stations were mobilised, but by the time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15 pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that "To put it mildly, the whole thing was a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way through the crowds. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start, but that when <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing "<a href="God%20Save%20The%20King">God Save The King</a>", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.
Eventually <a href="mounted%20police">mounted police</a>men were brought in to try to clear the crowds from the pitch, including <a href="Constable">PC</a> <a href="George%20Scorey">George Scorey</a>, who was mounted on a horse named "Billie" (some sources spell the name "Billy"). PC Scorey had not actually been on duty that day but answered a call for emergency assistance as the throng of spectators in the stadium grew. Billie the horse was actually grey, but appeared white in the primitive (<a href="Display%20contrast">high-contrast</a>) black and white <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a> footage of the era. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, other horses were also involved, but the "white" horse, as the most visible in the news footage, became the defining image of the day.

Eventually the police, assisted by appeals from the players for the crowd to calm, were able to manoeuvre the spectators to just beyond the touchline, and the game began approximately 45 minutes late, while fans stood around the perimeter of the pitch.

Both teams employed the <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%232%E2%80%933%E2%80%935%20%28Pyramid%29">2-3-5 formation</a> typical of the era: two <a href="Defender%20%28association%20football%29%23Full-back">full-backs</a>, three <a href="Midfielder">half-backs</a>, comprising one centre-half and two wing-halves, and five <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forwards</a>, comprising two outside-forwards, two inside-forwards and a centre-forward. West Ham's game plan initially centred on the two fast-moving outside-forwards <a href="Dick%20Richards%20%28footballer%29">Dick Richards</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Ruffell">Jimmy Ruffell</a>, but Bolton set out from the start to keep the two players contained, rushing at them whenever they got the ball. After just two minutes West Ham half-back <a href="Jack%20Tresadern">Jack Tresadern</a> became entangled in the crowd after taking a throw-in and was unable to return to the pitch immediately. This gave Bolton's <a href="David%20Jack">David Jack</a> the opportunity to shoot for goal. His shot beat West Ham goalkeeper <a href="Ted%20Hufton">Ted Hufton</a> to give Bolton the lead, and hit a spectator who was standing pressed against the goal net, knocking him unconscious. Three minutes later <a href="Vic%20Watson">Vic Watson</a> received the ball a few yards in front of the Bolton goal but his shot flew over the crossbar. Eleven minutes into the game the crowd surged forward once again and a large number of fans encroached onto the pitch, leading to the suspension of play while the mounted police again cleared the playing area. A number of fans required first aid from members of the <a href="British%20Red%20Cross">British Red Cross</a> while the players looked on and awaited the resumption of play. Policemen patrolled the perimeter of the pitch to keep it clear for the <a href="Assistant%20referee%20%28association%20football%29">linesmen</a>, after play was resumed.

Soon after play restarted, West Ham's Dick Richards eluded two Bolton defenders and shot for goal. Bolton goalkeeper <a href="Dick%20Pym">Dick Pym</a> fumbled the ball but managed to kick it clear before it crossed the goal-line. Bolton continued to dominate the match, and were only prevented from scoring again by a strong performance from West Ham full-back <a href="Billy%20Henderson%20%28footballer%29">Billy Henderson</a>. When West Ham attacked, however, Bolton were able to quickly switch to a strongly defensive formation, as players changed positions to form a line of five half-backs. This stifled West Ham's attacking style of play and ensured that the Bolton goal was not seriously threatened, and the score remained 1–0 to Bolton until half-time. Due to the crowds that surrounded the pitch, the players were unable to reach the dressing-rooms and instead remained on the pitch for five minutes before starting the second half.

West Ham began the second half as the stronger team, and Vic Watson received the ball in a good goalscoring position but mis-hit his shot. Eight minutes into the second half, Bolton added a second goal in controversial circumstances. Outside-forward <a href="Ted%20Vizard">Ted Vizard</a> played the ball into a central position and <a href="Jack%20Smith%20%28Scottish%20footballer%29">Jack Smith</a> hit the ball past Hufton. West Ham's players claimed that the ball had not entered the goal but rebounded into play from the goalpost, but referee <a href="D.%20H.%20Asson">D. H. Asson</a> overruled them, stating that in his view the ball had entered the goal but then rebounded off a spectator. West Ham also claimed that Bolton had received an unfair advantage, as a Bolton fan at pitchside had kicked the ball towards Vizard, but Asson disregarded these claims as well and confirmed Bolton's second goal. At this point the crowd began to sense that Bolton would emerge victorious and many began heading towards the exits. Neither team had any more serious chances to score, and the remainder of the match was largely a stalemate with little inspired play. Late in the game, West Ham captain <a href="George%20Kay">George Kay</a> attempted to persuade Asson to abandon the match, but Bolton captain <a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28football%20forward%20born%201889%29">Joe Smith</a> reportedly replied "We're doing fine, ref, we'll play until dark to finish the match if necessary". The score remained 2–0 to Bolton until the final whistle. The King presented the FA Cup trophy to Joe Smith and then left the stadium to cheers from the crowd. West Ham trainer <a href="Charlie%20Paynter">Charlie Paynter</a> attributed his team's defeat to the damage the pitch had suffered before kick-off, saying "It was that white horse thumping its big feet into the pitch that made it hopeless. Our wingers were tumbling all over the place, tripping up in great ruts and holes".

Although around 900 spectators were treated for slight injuries, only 22 were taken to hospital and ten of those were quickly discharged. Two policemen were also injured during the match. The chaotic scenes at the match prompted discussion in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, where <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="William%20Bridgeman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Bridgeman">William Bridgeman</a> paid tribute to the actions of the police and the general behaviour of the crowd. During the debate <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a> was chastised by the <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28UK%29">Speaker of the House</a> for characterising the fans present at the stadium as hooligans. Bridgeman was asked to consider opening a public inquiry, but ultimately concluded that the police had dealt successfully with the incident, and that he was happy for the stadium authorities and the police to decide on a plan to prevent similar events from happening again.
A committee examined the stadium a month after the match, and made several recommendations to the stadium authorities. Their proposals included the replacement of the turnstiles with more up-to-date models, the erection of extra gates and railings, and the division of the terraces into self-contained sections, each with its own entrance. In addition, the pre-purchasing of tickets was made compulsory for all future finals, eliminating the possibility that excessive numbers of fans would arrive in the hope of being able to pay at the turnstile. The gross gate money for the match was £27,776. After the deduction of the stadium authorities' costs, the Football Association and each of the two clubs took £6,365, although the refunds to fans unable to reach their assigned seats were deducted from the FA's share.

After the match the players and officials attended a dinner at which former Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> proposed the toast. The Bolton players returned home by train and were greeted at <a href="Moses%20Gate%20railway%20station">Moses Gate railway station</a> by the chairman of <a href="Municipal%20Borough%20of%20Farnworth">Farnworth District Council</a> before going on to a reception hosted by the Mayor. The club presented each of the victorious players with a gold watch. The players from both teams received gold commemorative medals. In 2005 the medal presented to West Ham's George Kay was sold at auction for £4,560, and tickets and programmes from the match have also been star lots at auctions.

The image of Billie the white horse remains famous within English football lore, and the match is often referred to as "The White Horse Final". Billie's rider, George Scorey, was rewarded by the Football Association with free tickets to subsequent finals, but he had no interest in football and did not attend.

In 2005, a public poll chose that the new footbridge near the rebuilt <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> would be named the <a href="White%20Horse%20Bridge">White Horse Bridge</a>. The executive director of the <a href="London%20Development%20Agency">London Development Agency</a>, which organised the poll, stated that the choice of name was appropriate given that the bridge, like the horse, would improve safety for fans at Wembley. In 2007 a play drawn from the reactions of a group of Bolton residents to the events of the final was staged at the <a href="Octagon%20Theatre%2C%20Bolton">Octagon Theatre, Bolton</a>.

James B. Longacre

James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Mint">Chief Engraver</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the <a href="Shield%20nickel">Shield nickel</a>, <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a> and other coins of the mid-19th century.

Longacre was born in <a href="Delaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Delaware County, Pennsylvania</a>, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His <a href="art">art</a>istic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an <a href="engraving">engraving</a> firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a> in 1844.

In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> was dominated by Mint Director <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a> and Chief Coiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> and <a href="double%20eagle">double eagle</a>, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20M.%20Meredith">William M. Meredith</a> that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict.

In 1856, Longacre designed the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a>. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the <a href="Three-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">silver and nickel three-cent pieces</a>, the <a href="Shield%20nickel">Shield nickel</a>, and the <a href="Two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">two-cent piece</a>. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a>. Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic advancement.

James Barton Longacre was born on a farm in <a href="Delaware%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Delaware County, Pennsylvania</a>, on August 11, 1794. His mother Sarah (Barton) Longacre died early in his life; his father, Peter Longacre, was the descendant of early Swedish settlers of North America. When Peter Longacre remarried, his son found the home life intolerable, and James Longacre left home at the age of 12, seeking work in the nearby city of Philadelphia. He apprenticed himself at a bookstore; the owner, John E. Watson, took the boy into his family. Over the following years, Longacre worked in the bookstore, but Watson realized that the boy's skill was in portraiture. Watson granted Longacre a release from his apprenticeship in 1813 so that he could follow an artistic muse, but the two remained close, and Watson would often sell Longacre's works.

Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, principal in the <a href="engraving">engraving</a> firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. This business derived from the firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, <a href="Robert%20Scot">Robert Scot</a>. Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, and <a href="John%20Hancock">John Hancock</a> which were placed on a facsimile of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of $9,000 (equal to $ today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 was the man who would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.

Longacre's first important commission were plates for S.F. Bradford's "Encyclopedia" in 1820; an engraving of General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> by Longacre based on a portrait by <a href="Thomas%20Sully">Thomas Sully</a> achieved wide sales. Longacre then agreed to engrave illustrations for Joseph and <a href="John%20Sanderson">John Sanderson</a>'s "Biographies of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence", published in nine volumes between 1820 and 1827. Although the venture was marked by criticism of the writing, sales were good enough that the project was completed. <a href="Numismatic">Numismatic</a> writer Richard Snow suggests that the books sold on the strength of the quality of Longacre's illustrations. Longacre also completed a series of studies of actors in their roles in 1826 for "The American Theatre".
With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects. He was on the point of launching this project, having invested $1,000 of his own money (equal to $ today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series. In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on "The American Portrait Gallery" (later called the "National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans"), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life. He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits. Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>. In July 1832, "<a href="Niles%27%20Register">Niles' Register</a>" described a Longacre engraving, "one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art".

Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls. Sales of the "Gallery" lagged due to the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home. Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co. With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at <a href="1%20Wall%20Street">1 Wall Street</a> in New York. According to Snow, Longacre was known as the best engraver in the country.
Gobrecht's death in July 1844 left the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> (the "Mint") without a chief engraver. Among those who hoped for appointment were Philadelphia banknote engraver Charles Welsh, and Allen Leonard, who had modeled the Mint's medal for former president <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>. Through the influence of Senator Calhoun, however, Longacre secured the appointment. According to coin historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, Longacre did not attempt to gain the support of Mint Director <a href="Robert%20Maskell%20Patterson">Robert M. Patterson</a> in seeking the appointment from President <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>, and "if Patterson resented the slight, however, he was more annoyed by Leonard's importunities."

Longacre was commissioned by President Tyler on September 16, 1844; his was a <a href="recess%20appointment">recess appointment</a> as the post of chief engraver required Senate confirmation, and that body was not then sitting. Tyler transmitted Longacre's nomination to the Senate on December 17, 1844, which confirmed Longacre without recorded opposition on January 7, 1845. According to numismatist David Lange, Longacre was glad to get the position because engravers were receiving less work due to the advent of <a href="daguerrotype">daguerrotype</a> photography.

According to coin dealer and author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, upon appointment as chief engraver, Longacre "found that he had entered a hornet's nest of intrigue, politics, and infighting, dominated by <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>, chief coiner since 1839". Peale sent Mint personnel to work on his private residence, and in addition to his official duties—mostly performed by his predecessor, <a href="Adam%20Eckfeldt">Adam Eckfeldt</a>, who continued in his work without pay despite his retirement—he had a thriving side business preparing <a href="coining%20%28mint%29">dies</a> for private medals using government resources. Peale controlled access to dies and materials, and was close to Director Patterson; the two men later proved to have been skimming metal from bullion deposits. The remaining Mint officers were cronies of Patterson, and Longacre found himself a loner among them. <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in his comprehensive volume on U.S. coins, suggests that Patterson resented Longacre because of the engraver's sponsorship by Calhoun, whom the director disliked as a southerner.

In Longacre's first years as chief engraver, no original designs were required for coins. Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842, and his successor had time to learn arts necessary for coin production that he had not needed as a maker of print engravings. These arts included coin design, making of punches for design elements, and die sinking. Longacre's work in the private sector had involved <a href="etching">cutting lines into a copper plate</a> which was then used to print reproductions. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary <a href="Robert%20J.%20Walker">Robert J. Walker</a> that Longacre "is a gentleman of excellent character, highly regarded in this community, and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper; but he is not a Die-Sinker. Indeed I do not know that he has ever made an attempt in this art." By December of that year, the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre, stating that the engraver had "more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors. He has shown too that he is quite competent to make the required model from his drawings." Taxay attributed Patterson's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver.

A number of blunders can be seen among the early coins produced at the Mint under Longacre, though it is uncertain to whom these errors should be attributed. These include the 1844 half dollar struck at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mint">New Orleans Mint</a> (1844-O) with a doubled date, and the 1846 half dollar with the 6 overlying an identical digit, but one which had been placed horizontally. Bowers indicates that Longacre likely delegated such work, although in 1849 he wrote that his daily work was punching dates into working dies. Tom DeLorey, in his 2003 article on Longacre, notes that Peale and his staff often made punches without consulting the Engraver's Department (headed by Longacre), and believes the chief coiner more likely to be responsible.

Despite the charged atmosphere at the Philadelphia Mint, Longacre avoided conflict with Patterson and Peale until March 1849, when Congress authorized a <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> and <a href="double%20eagle">double eagle</a> or twenty-dollar gold piece, both new coins. By then, Patterson had come to desire Longacre's departure as he was deemed a threat to Peale's medal business, and opposed new coins which would require the chief engraver's skills. According to Richard Snow in his book on <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle</a> and <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>s, "having an ethical chief engraver threatened their sideline." The conflict came over the use of the Contamin portrait lathe, necessary in the making of dies both for Longacre in producing the new coins and Peale in his medal business. When Longacre complained that Peale was monopolizing the device, Peale decided to sabotage Longacre's coin work and have him removed from his position.

In early 1849, according to a letter written by Longacre the following year, the chief engraver was approached by a member of the Mint staff, warning him that another officer (plainly Peale) sought to have the engraving work done outside of the Mint, making Longacre redundant. The outside engraver in question was Frenchman Louis Bouvet, whom Patterson had prepare a design for the half eagle, though it was not adopted. Longacre's response to the information was to spend much of March 1849 preparing the dies for the gold dollar, at some cost to his health, as he later related. He demanded that Patterson hire assistance for him, but found the director willing only to have work contracted out. Longacre was unwilling to consent to this, as he could not supervise work done outside the Mint (he did get help within the Mint from assistant engraver <a href="Peter%20Cross%20%28engraver%29">Peter Filatreu Cross</a>, who worked on the reverse of the gold dollar). Longacre proceeded with work on the double eagle through late 1849, and described the obstacles set in his path by Peale:

When Longacre completed the double eagle dies, they were rejected by Peale, who stated that the design was engraved too deeply to fully impress the coin, and the pieces would not stack properly. Taxay, however, noted that the one surviving 1849 double eagle displays no such problems, and by appearance would be level in a stack. Peale complained to Patterson, who wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20M.%20Meredith">William M. Meredith</a> asking for Longacre's removal on December 25, 1849, on the ground he could not make proper dies. Patterson that day promised the position to engraver <a href="Charles%20Cushing%20Wright">Charles Cushing Wright</a>, effective when Longacre was ousted. Meredith questioned whether a competent replacement could be found; Patterson assured him that one could. Longacre objected to Patterson that Peale was delaying acceptance of revised double eagle dies, the director did not reply in writing, but met with Longacre, told him the administration had decided to terminate him, and that he should send in his resignation without delay. Longacre, after thinking the matter over, did not do so, but instead went to Washington on February 12, 1850, to meet with Meredith. He found that the secretary had been lied to about a number of matters. According to Snow, Longacre did not seek retribution, content to be allowed to continue his work in peace. The double eagle went into production in March 1850, though Patterson complained that the coins did not strike well. The double eagle quickly became the favored way to hold gold, and in the years to come more gold would be struck into double eagles than into all other denominations combined.

Patterson wrote again to request Longacre's ouster on April 1, 1850, alleging that President <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> had decided that Longacre be dismissed. Despite these attempts, Longacre remained in his position. Also in 1850, Longacre's wife Elizabeth (generally Eliza) died. The Mint officials clashed again in 1851, after Congress authorized a silver <a href="Three-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">three-cent piece</a>. Longacre prepared a design showing a star on one side and the Roman numeral III on the other, which initially won Patterson's approval. Peale, however, persuaded Patterson to change his mind and authorize the chief coiner to propose a version himself, copying design elements Gobrecht had used in 1836. The issue was submitted to the new Treasury Secretary, <a href="Thomas%20Corwin">Thomas Corwin</a>, who selected Longacre's proposal—Longacre had taken the precaution of sending the secretary a letter explaining his imagery.

In July 1851, Patterson retired and President Fillmore replaced him with <a href="Thomas%20Eckert">Thomas Eckert</a>. Peale's medal business suffered a setback when Adam Eckfeldt, who was still performing the duties of chief coiner, died in 1852. In 1854, Mint Director <a href="James%20Ross%20Snowden">James Ross Snowden</a> fired Peale after the extent to which he had used Mint labor for private gain became public. Nevertheless, the firing caused considerable press attention, a Senate investigation, and a large demand for compensation by Peale. With his enemies gone, life at the Mint improved for Longacre.

Faced with a rise in silver prices, Congress decreased the silver content of the half dime, dime, quarter and half dollar in 1853. Longacre was asked to alter Gobrecht's designs so new coins could be distinguished from old. He proposed placing rays around the <a href="spreadeagle%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic eagle</a> on the reverses of the quarter and half dollar, and arrows by the date for all of the affected denominations. As the act requiring the reduction in weight allowed the Mint to hire outside artists to do the work, Snowden allowed for public designs for the new pieces. No public entry was found suitable, and Longacre's proposal was adopted. The rays tended to shorten die life and were dropped within a year; the arrows were dispensed with after 1855.

In 1853, Congress authorized a <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>. In a note found among his papers, Longacre wrote that his task was to make the coin as easy as possible to distinguish from the <a href="quarter%20eagle">quarter eagle</a>, which at $2.50 was close in value. Longacre produced a design for a Native American princess, which he made different from Gobrecht's Liberty design on the quarter eagle with a thinner and wider planchet. At the time, a female Native American was often used to represent America in art, and a depiction of Liberty as an Indian princess was in accord with contemporary practices. The chief engraver wrote to Mint Director Snowden that the three-dollar piece, which went into production in 1854, was the first time he had been allowed artistic freedom in designing a coin. The gold dollar was altered the same year to make the planchet both thinner and wider; Longacre modified his princess design for the gold dollar. For the reverse of the coins, Longacre created a wreath of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton, blending the agricultural products of the North and the South. This wreath would also be used on the reverse of the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a> in 1856; reused on the dime beginning in 1860, the "cereal wreath" would be Longacre's last surviving design on coinage, remaining with modifications until the 1916 abandonment of the <a href="Barber%20coinage">Barber dime</a>.

In the mid-1850s, Longacre was engaged by the Navy Department to design a medal to be presented to Captain <a href="Duncan%20Ingraham">Duncan Ingraham</a>. Longacre produced the imagery used for the reverse; the obverse was by Assistant Engraver Cross. Although Bowers describes Longacre as having been "strictly ethical in the duties of his office", when the Treasury Department learned that Longacre accepted a $2,200 payment from the Navy for his work, they required that he repay the money under a federal law barring compensation of this kind. Other than his design for the 1867 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a> medal, and his similar, wreathed reverses for the commission medals in 1860, 1861, and 1868, the Ingraham work was Longacre's only medal made for the government.

After a rise in commodity prices, the Mint to sought to replace the <a href="large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">large copper cent</a> with a smaller version. Beginning in 1850, a number of pattern coins were struck in attempts to find a replacement coin. Designs and formats varied; at first, Mint authorities considered an annular, or holed, cent. In 1854 and 1855, much experimentation was done, some with a Liberty Head design as featured on the large cent; others with a flying eagle design adapted by Longacre from the <a href="Gobrecht%20dollar">Gobrecht dollar</a> of 1836. Gobrecht's design said to have been modeled on <a href="Peter%20%28eagle%29">Peter the eagle</a>, a tame bird which frequented the Philadelphia Mint in the 1830s until it was caught up in machinery and killed; Peter, in stuffed form, was subsequently placed on exhibit at the Philadelphia Mint.

The flying eagle design was adopted for a large issue of experimental <a href="pattern%20coins">patterns</a> given to government officials and others in 1856; that coin was then used for the regular issue from 1857. The reverse featured Longacre's cereal wreath, which led to difficulties in coining; the head and tail of the eagle on the obverse opposed the wreath, making those design points particularly hard to strike in the tough copper-nickel alloy which was used. Beginning in 1859, the cent featured a Longacre design of Liberty wearing a Native American headdress. What is called the "laurel wreath", though actually olive, adorned the reverse of the cent in 1859; beginning in 1860, a reverse with an oak wreath and shield was placed on the cent. The replacement of the wreath is for reasons unknown; the shield was added because of Snowden's desire to give the coin a "more national character". This reverse is generally credited to Longacre; Snow speculates that it may have been created by Assistant Engraver Anthony C. Paquet.

By numismatic legend, Longacre's Indian Head cent design was based on the features of his daughter Sarah; the tale runs that she was at the Philadelphia Mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting and her father sketched her. However, Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married, not 12 as in the tale, in 1858 and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of Venus in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican. James Longacre did often sketch his elder daughter, and there are resemblances between the depiction of Sarah Longacre and the various representations of Liberty on Longacre's coins of the 1850s. These tales were apparently extant at the time, as Snowden, in writing to Treasury Secretary <a href="Howell%20Cobb">Howell Cobb</a> in November 1858, denied that the coin was based "on any human features in the Longacre family". Lee F. McKenzie, in his 1991 article on Longacre, notes that any artist can be influenced by many things, but calls the story "essentially false".

The <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> brought economic disturbances which resulted in the removal of some coins, including the base-metal cent, from circulation. Paper currency (valued as low as three cents), postage stamps, and private tokens, filled the gap. Many of the tokens were cent-sized, but thinner and made of bronze. Mint authorities took notice that these metal pieces were successfully circulating, and obtained legislation for a bronze cent. Longacre's Indian head design continued in its place with the new metal; later in 1864 he engraved his initial "L" in the headdress. The act which authorized the bronze cent also issued a <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">two-cent piece</a>; Longacre furnished a design, which Lange calls a "particularly attractive composition" with arrows and a laurel wreath flanking a shield. However, art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> stated that elements of the design "need only flanking cannon to be the consummate expressions of Civil War heraldry." Treasury Secretary <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> favored placing an expression of the nation's faith in God in a time of war on the coinage, and wrote to Mint Director Pollock, "You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition." Several mottos were considered by Pollock, including "God Our Trust" and "God and Our Country". Longacre's two-cent piece was the first coin inscribed with "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>".

Nickel had been removed from the cent over the objection of Pennsylvania industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>, who had large interests in the metal; his congressman, <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, had fought against the act. In 1864, Wharton published a pamphlet arguing for a coinage in which all coins less than ten cents would be made of a copper-nickel alloy with 25% nickel, just over twice the percentage which the cent had contained. In March 1865, Congress passed legislation for a <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent coin of that alloy</a>, intended to retire <a href="fractional%20currency">fractional currency</a> of that denomination. Longacre furnished a head of Liberty for the coin resembling his other depictions of the goddess which he had made in the past 16 years; for the reverse he used the "laurel" wreath from the 1859 cent surrounding the Roman numeral III borrowed from the silver three-cent piece.

Wharton and others seeking to promote the use of nickel remained powerful in Congress, and in 1866 secured authorization for <a href="Nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">a five-cent coin</a> of copper nickel. Longacre prepared a number of designs; Pollock selected Longacre's design of a shield (similar to the two-cent piece) and a starry circle for the reverse, and the <a href="Shield%20nickel">Shield nickel</a> began to be struck that year. Mint Assayer William DuBois wrote to Longacre, "it is truly pleasing to see a man pass the life of three score and ten and yet be able to produce the same artistic works as in earlier days."

In 1865 Congress required the use of "In God We Trust" on all coins large enough to bear the inscription; in 1866, Longacre added the motto to all silver coins larger than the dime and all gold coins larger than the three-dollar piece. He also in 1867 made modifications to the design of the copper-nickel five-cent piece, or nickel as it was coming to be known. In 1865, Longacre engaged British-born engraver <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a> as assistant; William H. Key was also made an assistant in 1864 and remained at the Mint past Longacre's death.

Some of the coinage which had vanished from circulation during the Civil War and had been exported to South America continued to be used in Chilean trade as nationals found their local coinage valued poorly with the American pieces. In 1866, the Chilean government instructed its representative in Washington to approach the U.S. State Department for permission to have their coinage dies made in America. The <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> administration was happy to oblige; Treasury Secretary <a href="Hugh%20McCulloch">Hugh McCulloch</a> gave the Chileans a letter of introduction to Longacre in Philadelphia. Longacre was engaged by the Chileans to redesign five silver and four gold coins, and he agreed, so long as permission from McCulloch was obtained for him to accept an outside fee. McCulloch was initially agreeable, but Mint Director Pollock raised objection on the ground that government property should not be used to enable private gain. Eventually, all parties reached agreement that Longacre could do the work at a total cost of $10,000 provided that he brought in an outside engraver to do some of the work under Longacre's supervision; the chief engraver selected Anthony C. Paquet, one of his former assistants. Resistance at the Mint dissolved with Pollock's resignation over President Johnson's <a href="Reconstruction%20era">Reconstruction policies</a>, and the dies and hubs (from which more dies could be made) were created beginning in November 1866, probably in-house at the Philadelphia Mint. Longacre's designs for Chile were used until new ones were adopted in the 1890s.

In 1867, Longacre proposed the use of aluminum in coins; this was rejected as the supply and price of the metal fluctuated considerably, and it then had a high intrinsic value. In 1868, Wharton's interests proposed making the dime into a copper-nickel piece and to modify the cent, three-cent piece, and nickel. The project was abandoned when it became clear the base-metal dime would be too large to be effectively struck in the tough copper-nickel alloy, but Longacre prepared a number of half dollar-size patterns. He also began work on re-engraving the designs of the gold pieces, and completed the <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">$10 piece</a> by year's end.

James Longacre died suddenly at his home in Philadelphia on January 1, 1869. A memorial meeting was held at the Philadelphia Mint on January 5, attended by the facility's employees. The Director of the Mint, <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a>, delivered a speech in praise of Longacre prior to the formal eulogy, which was given by Longacre's assistant, William Barber, who would be appointed as Longacre's successor. Like each of his predecessors, Longacre died in office.

Longacre was recognized in an exhibit of 100 notable American engravers sponsored by the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a> in 1928. In 1970, art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on U.S. coins, viewed Longacre and his works less favorably, "uniform in their dullness, lack of inspiration, and even quaintness, Longacre's contributions to patterns and regular coinage were a decided step backwards from the art of [Thomas] Sully, [Titian] Peale, [Robert] Hughes, and Gobrecht" and "whatever his previous qualities as an engraver of portraits, he seems not to have brought much imagination to his important post at the Philadelphia Mint." However, Vermeule considered the Flying Eagle cent more of a work of art, far above the mundane.

In his 1991 article, McKenzie notes Vermeule's concerns, but considers Longacre's work important for its use of American symbols, including the representations of Native Americans. He believes Longacre's use of such symbols influenced later coin designers, such as <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, <a href="Victor%20D.%20Brenner">Victor D. Brenner</a>, and <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>. He particularly praises the ornate scroll on the reverse of the double eagle, calling it "unique in American numismatic art and enhances the elegance of a design befitting the highest-denomination U.S. coin", and applauds "the exciting innovation in symbolism and expression of national sentiment that he brought to U.S. numismatic art".

According to Bowers, "Today, Longacre is widely admired by numismatists." Lange notes that Longacre's "artistic vision graced 60 years of American coins". Snow writes,

James T. Aubrey

James Thomas Aubrey Jr. (December 14, 1918 – September 3, 1994) was an American television and film executive. President of the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> <a href="television%20network">television network</a> from 1959 to 1965, he put some of television's most enduring series on the air, including "<a href="Gilligan%27s%20Island">Gilligan's Island</a>" and "<a href="The%20Beverly%20Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a>". Under Aubrey, CBS dominated American television the way <a href="General%20Motors%20Corporation">General Motors</a> and <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> dominated their industries. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>" in 1964 called Aubrey "a master of programming whose divinations led to successes that are breathtaking".

Aubrey replaced <a href="CBS%20Television">CBS Television</a> president <a href="Louis%20Cowan">Louis Cowan</a>, who was slowly dismissed after <a href="1950s%20quiz%20show%20scandals">the quiz show scandals</a>. Despite his successes in television, Aubrey's abrasive personality and oversized ego – "Picture <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Machiavelli">Machiavelli</a> and <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a> at a <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20football">University of Colorado football</a> <a href="Gary%20Barnett%23Colorado">recruiting party</a>" wrote "Variety" in 2004 – led to his firing from CBS amid charges of improprieties. "The circumstances rivaled the best of CBS adventure or mystery shows," declared "The New York Times" in its front-page story on his firing, which came on "the sunniest Sunday in February" 1965. He earned the nickname "Smiling Cobra" for his brutal decision-making ways. Aubrey governed CBS with a firm grip, and it did not go unnoticed. He was suddenly dismissed in February 1965. Aubrey offered no explanation following his dismissal, nor did CBS President Frank Stanton or Board Chairman William Paley. After four years as an independent producer, Aubrey was hired by financier <a href="Kirk%20Kerkorian">Kirk Kerkorian</a> in 1969 to preside over <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>'s near-total shutdown, during which he slashed the budget and alienated producers and directors but brought profits to a company that had suffered huge losses. In 1973, Aubrey resigned from MGM, declaring his job was done, and then vanished into almost total obscurity for the last two decades of his life.

Hollywood executive <a href="Sherry%20Lansing">Sherry Lansing</a>, a close friend of Aubrey's for two decades, told the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" in 1986:
Jim is different. He does his own dirty work. Jim is one of those people who are willing to say, "I didn't like your movie." Directness is disarming to people who are used to sugar-coating. It's tough for people who need approval to see somebody who doesn't. Myths and legends begin to surround that kind of person.

Born in <a href="LaSalle%2C%20Illinois">LaSalle, Illinois</a>, James Thomas Steven Aubrey was the eldest of four sons of James Thomas Aubrey Sr., an advertising executive with the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> firm of Aubrey, Moore, and Wallace; and his wife, the former Mildred Stever. He grew up in the affluent Chicago suburb of <a href="Lake%20Forest%2C%20Illinois">Lake Forest</a> and attended <a href="Lake%20Forest%20Academy">Lake Forest Academy</a>, <a href="Phillips%20Exeter%20Academy">Phillips Exeter Academy</a> in <a href="Exeter%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Exeter, New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. All four boys, James, Stever, David, and George, went to Lake Forest Academy, Exeter and Princeton; his brother Stever became a successful advertising man at <a href="J.%20Walter%20Thompson">J. Walter Thompson</a> before heading the <a href="F.%20William%20Free">F. William Free</a> agency. While at Princeton all four brothers were members of the Tiger Inn eating club. "My father insisted on accomplishment," Aubrey recalled in 1986. In college, Aubrey was a star on the <a href="American%20football">football</a> team, playing left end. He graduated in 1941 with honors in <a href="English%20literature">English</a> and entered the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>. During his service in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Aubrey rose to the rank of major and taught military flying to actor <a href="James%20Stewart">James Stewart</a>, who was a licensed civilian pilot.

While stationed in southern California, he met <a href="Phyllis%20Thaxter">Phyllis Thaxter</a>, an actress signed to MGM, whom he married in November 1944. Thaxter's first role was as Ted Lawson's wife in "<a href="Thirty%20Seconds%20Over%20Tokyo">Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo</a>" (1944), and her final film was as <a href="Martha%20Kent">Martha</a>, in the 1978 "<a href="Superman%20%281978%20film%29">Superman</a>". They had two children, Susan Schuyler "Skye" Aubrey (born c. 1946) and James Watson Aubrey (born c. 1953). The marriage ended in divorce in 1962.

Aubrey was "6-foot 2-inch with an incandescent smile" with "unrevealing polar blue eyes," said "The New York Times Magazine" in 1964. The next year "Life Magazine" described him as "youthful, handsome, brainy, with an incandescent smile, a quiet, somewhat salty wit and, when he cared to turn it on, considerable charm. He was always fastidiously turned out, from his Jerry the Barber haircut to his CBS-eye cuff links." One producer said, "Aubrey is one of the most insatiably curious guys I know."

After Aubrey was discharged from the Air Force, he stayed in southern California; before his marriage, he intended to return to Chicago. In <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, he sold advertising for the <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a> and <a href="Cond%C3%A9%20Nast%20Publications">Condé Nast</a> magazine companies. His first broadcasting job was as a salesman at the CBS radio station in Los Angeles, <a href="KNX%20%28AM%29">KNX</a>, and soon went to the network's new television station, <a href="KNXT%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">KNXT</a>. Within two years Aubrey had risen to be the network's West Coast television programming chief. There he met <a href="Hunt%20Stromberg%20Jr.">Hunt Stromberg Jr.</a>, and they developed the popular western "<a href="Have%20Gun%2C%20Will%20Travel">Have Gun, Will Travel</a>". They sent their idea to the network's chief of programming, Hubbell Robinson, and as Oulahan and Lambert put it, "the rest is TV history." Aubrey was promoted to manager of all television network programs, based in California, until he went to <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> in 1956.

On December 16, 1956, <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> president <a href="Oliver%20E.%20Treyz">Oliver E. Treyz</a> announced Aubrey would immediately become the network's head of programming and talent. ABC, the weakest of the three networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to the early days of the <a href="Fox%20Network">Fox Network</a>. Aubrey later said "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. But I went because [ABC chairman] <a href="Leonard%20Goldenson">Leonard Goldenson</a> in effect said, 'Look, I don't know that much about TV, I'm a lawyer.' And he let me have autonomy."

As vice president in charge of programs (a title he gained before March 1957), he brought to the air what he recalled as "wild, sexy, lively stuff, things that had never been done before," shows such as "<a href="Maverick%20%28television%20program%29">Maverick</a>", a western with <a href="James%20Garner">James Garner</a>, and "<a href="77%20Sunset%20Strip">77 Sunset Strip</a>", a detective show with <a href="Efrem%20Zimbalist%20Jr.">Efrem Zimbalist Jr.</a> (However, by the time "Strip" went on the air in October 1958, Aubrey had already left the network.) Oulahan and Lambert said Aubrey scheduled "one lucrative show after another ... and for the first time the third network became a serious challenge to NBC and CBS." Among the successes he scheduled were "<a href="The%20Donna%20Reed%20Show">The Donna Reed Show</a>", a domestic comedy; "<a href="The%20Rifleman">The Rifleman</a>", a western with <a href="Chuck%20Connors">Chuck Connors</a>; and "<a href="The%20Real%20McCoys">The Real McCoys</a>", a rural comedy with <a href="Walter%20Brennan">Walter Brennan</a> and <a href="Richard%20Crenna">Richard Crenna</a>.

Despite his success at ABC, Aubrey saw a limited future at the network and asked to return to CBS, doing so on April 28, 1958, initially as assistant to <a href="Frank%20Stanton%20%28executive%29">Frank Stanton</a>, president of CBS, Inc., the holding company which owned the network. (<a href="Thomas%20W.%20Moore">Thomas W. Moore</a> would take his ABC job.) Aubrey was made vice president for creative services in April 1959, replacing <a href="Louis%20G.%20Cowan">Louis G. Cowan</a>, whom CBS promoted to network president.

Aubrey was named executive vice president on June 1, 1959, a newly created post that was the number-two official at the network. His responsibilities encompassed general supervision of all departments of the CBS Television Network. On December 8, 1959, Cowan resigned, having been damaged from his connection to the <a href="quiz%20show%20scandals">quiz show scandals</a>. (He created the show "<a href="The%20%2464%2C000%20Question">The $64,000 Question</a>" and owned the company which produced it for the network, though Cowan denied he knew anything about the rigging of the program.) Cowan's letter of resignation to Stanton declared, "you have made it impossible for me to continue." Aubrey was named president the same day and elected to the board of directors on December 9, 1959.

Aubrey was president of the CBS Network for the next five years, and made it tremendously successful, substantially increasing ratings and doubling the company's profits. In the <a href="1963-64%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">1963–64</a> season, all twelve of the top daytime programs and fourteen of the top fifteen prime-time shows were on CBS – the lone evening exception was <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s "<a href="Bonanza">Bonanza</a>", ranked number two. After he was fired, journalists Richard Oulahan and William Lambert wrote in a "Life Magazine" profile:
In the long history of human communications, from <a href="tom-tom%20drum">tom-tom</a> to <a href="Telstar">Telstar</a>, no one man ever had a lock on such enormous audiences as James Thomas Aubrey Jr. during his five-year tenure as head of the Columbia Broadcasting System's television network ... He was the world's No. 1 purveyor of entertainment.

His formula was characterized by a CBS executive as "broads, bosoms, and fun," resulting in such shows as "<a href="The%20Beverly%20Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a>" and "<a href="Gilligan%27s%20Island">Gilligan's Island</a>", despised by the critics – and CBS chairman <a href="William%20S.%20Paley">William S. Paley</a> – but extremely popular with viewers. While Aubrey had a great feel for what would be successful with viewers, he had nothing but contempt for them. "The American public is <a href="flyover%20country">something I fly over</a>," he said. His former boss at ABC, Oliver E. Treyz, said at programming "Jim Aubrey was one of the most effective ever, from the standpoint of delivering what the public wanted and making money. He was the best program judge in the business."

Aubrey said in 1986 of Paley and his programming choices:
I'd gone to CBS, and I'd become convinced "Beverly Hillbillies" was going to work. Bill Paley wasn't convinced. Bill has this great sense of propriety. Putting aside the <a href="David%20Sarnoff">Sarnoffs</a> and all the other great names of broadcasting, Paley stood – stands – head and shoulders above everyone else. He had this blasting genius of instinctively looking at a show and knowing if it should be on the air. He could also be ruthless and distant ... But Bill was intuitive about both the business and creative sides of TV. And he genuinely disliked "Beverly Hillbillies." I put it on the schedule anyway.

"The hucksters' huckster," <a href="David%20Halberstam">David Halberstam</a> labeled him, "whose greatest legacy to television was a program called "The Beverly Hillbillies", a series so demented and tasteless that it boggles the mind" Columnist <a href="Murray%20Kempton">Murray Kempton</a> described "The Beverly Hillbillies" as, "a confrontation of the characters of <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a> with the environment of <a href="Spyros%20Skouras">Spyros Skouras</a>," the extravagant chairman of <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a>. But regardless of what anyone said about "Hillbillies", the public loved it. The <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a>s showed 57 million were watching the show – one in three Americans.

When Skouras was forced out of Fox by the company's board of directors in July 1962, Aubrey was widely mentioned to be his successor, but he openly denied he had any intention of leaving CBS.

Another part of Aubrey's formula was making sure that the commercial interests of CBS's sponsors were kept foremost in their minds. In 1960 he elaborated on this idea more when he told The Office of Network Study:

"There is relatively little that is incompatible between our objectives and the objectives of the advertisers...Before sponsorship of a program series commences there is often a meeting between production personnel and representatives of the advertiser at which time the general areas of the advertiser's interest and general attitudes are discussed. A breakfast food advertiser may, for example, wish to make sure the programs do not contain elements that make breakfast distasteful. A cigarette manufacturer would not wish to have cigarette smoking depicted in an unattractive manner. Normally, as long as these considerations do not limit creativity, they will be adhered to."

CBS's dominance was so great that when the fall schedules were announced, ABC and NBC would wait until CBS announced its plans before making their own announcements, effectively making Aubrey programmer for all three networks. CBS had great success with rural-themed programs such as the "Hillbillies", "<a href="The%20Andy%20Griffith%20Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a>", "<a href="Mister%20Ed">Mister Ed</a>", "<a href="Green%20Acres">Green Acres</a>," and "<a href="Petticoat%20Junction">Petticoat Junction</a>". Yet another CBS hit Paley hated was "<a href="The%20Munsters">The Munsters</a>", part of a trend of fantasy shows at the time that included CBS's "<a href="My%20Favorite%20Martian">My Favorite Martian</a>" and "<a href="Gilligan%27s%20Island">Gilligan's Island</a>". Aubrey's "unwritten code" for programs was described in "Life":
Feed the public little more than rural comedies, fast-moving detective dramas and, later, sexy dolls. No old people; the emphasis was on youth. No domestic servants, the mass audience wouldn't identify with maids. No serious problems to cope with. Every script had to be full of action. No physical infirmities.

"Life" acknowledged there were exceptions, such as "<a href="The%20Defenders%20%281961%20TV%20series%29">The Defenders</a>" with <a href="E.G.%20Marshall">E.G. Marshall</a> and <a href="Robert%20Reed">Robert Reed</a> as socially conscious attorneys, and quoted Aubrey's defense to charges of pandering to the public. "I felt that we had an obligation to reach the vast majority of most of the people," he said. "We made an effort to continue purposeful drama on TV, but we found out that people just don't want an anthology. They would rather tune in on "<a href="The%20Lucy%20Show">Lucy</a>"."

In 1962, a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> committee investigating <a href="juvenile%20delinquency">juvenile delinquency</a> held hearings on sex on television and called executives from the three networks. The chairman, Senator <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Dodd">Thomas J. Dodd</a> (<a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">D</a>-<a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>), blasted "an unmistakable pattern" and informed the executives "you all seem to use the same terminology – to think alike – and to jam this stuff down the people's throat." Dodd accused Aubrey of putting "prurient sex" in the CBS program "<a href="Route%2066%20%28TV%20series%29">Route 66</a>" to boost ratings, and confronted him with the "bosoms, broads, and fun" quotation from a memorandum by CBS executive Howard G. Barnes following a meeting with the program's producers. Aubrey denied saying the phrase. He said that people in the business often shorthanded "wholesome, pretty girls" as "broads", and "attractive" as "bosoms". Another memo summarizing the same meeting, written by Screen Gems executive <a href="William%20Dozier">William Dozier</a>, read as follows: "There is not enough sex in the programs. Neither lead has gotten involved even for a single episode with the normal wants of a young man, namely to get involved with a girl or even to kiss her."

Aubrey was a controlling man and a workaholic, putting in twelve-hour days six days a week. He endlessly read scripts, screened episodes, and ordered reshoots or changes made in the furniture and dressing of a set. <a href="Murray%20Kempton">Murray Kempton</a> wrote that he would see six movies every weekend and read three books on transcontinental flights. Kempton quoted a CBS executive saying:

He read everything. Like he saw every movie. But he had the smallest world there could be. He'd watch a movie and, while everyone else was involved in the story, he'd say out loud "that kid could be the lead in a television program." He read everything sure. All the new fiction. What he didn't like was <a href="Saul%20Bellow">Bellow</a>, <a href="John%20Updike">Updike</a>, <a href="John%20Cheever">Cheever</a>, <a href="J.%20D.%20Salinger">Salinger</a>, <a href="Truman%20Capote">Capote</a>, and <a href="Norman%20Mailer">Mailer</a>. He didn't know how to use them.

Kempton claimed Aubrey:
[He] was the fourth president of CBS-TV as <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> was the fourth of the twelve Caesars. Each carried the logic of his imperial authority as far as it could go. Each was deposed and disappeared suddenly leaving bad press behind him.

Oulahan and Lambert claimed "Aubrey exercised his tremendous power with the canny skill and the ruthlessness of a <a href="Tatar">Tatar</a> <a href="Khan%20%28title%29">khan</a>." Aubrey's treachery led the producer <a href="John%20Houseman">John Houseman</a> in 1959 to dub him "The Smiling Cobra." Houseman in public was less direct. In December 1962, CBS announced it was spending $250,000 an episode on Houseman's hour-long drama on American history for the next season, "The Great Adventure", but on July 25, 1963, CBS announced Houseman had resigned. The producer told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" "The kind of show they want is not what I wanted to produce" but attributed his departure to a simple difference of opinion, the "Times" reporter stating Houseman "expressed no criticism of CBS." (The show ran for one season, 1963–64.)

In "Only You, Dick Daring!", his humorous yet damning account of the five and a half months he spent trying to make a show with CBS for the 1963–64 season based on an idea of Aubrey's about a <a href="county%20agent">county agent</a>, writer <a href="Merle%20Miller">Merle Miller</a> described how Aubrey would simply walk out of meetings without offering any substantive comments on Miller's program and the nineteen rewrites he did of the pilot episode. Miller was assured by other CBS executives that Aubrey's silence meant things were fine – Kempton quoted a CBS producer telling Miller "this has nothing to do with a good script or a bad script. It has to do with pleasing one man, Jim Aubrey. Don't ever forget it" – and Miller later learned of efforts by Aubrey to force him out. (A pilot for the show, known as "Calhoun" and "County Agent", to star <a href="Jackie%20Cooper">Jackie Cooper</a> and <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>, was shot and put on the fall schedule, but the series was canceled before it ever aired.) Miller quoted an independent producer: "Aubrey's the most important man in television, in the history of television, maybe in the history of entertainment. He out-Mayers <a href="Louis%20B.%20Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> ten times over."

Aubrey's success seemed to have gone to his head and he became even more arrogant. He was abusive to the network's affiliates, advertisers, producers, and talent. Friends of Aubrey's such as producers <a href="Dick%20Dorso">Dick Dorso</a> of <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>, <a href="Martin%20Ransohoff">Martin Ransohoff</a> of <a href="Filmways">Filmways</a>, and <a href="David%20Susskind">David Susskind</a>, who had each sold several series to CBS, suddenly found themselves shut out. "He's a friend of mine, but he cut me stone cold last year," Susskind said. "I was hanging there with my pants down, wondering what I'd tell the stockholders." Gossip columnist <a href="Liz%20Smith%20%28journalist%29">Liz Smith</a>, who worked as CBS during Aubrey's time there, called him a "a mean, hateful, truly scary, bad, outré guy."

<a href="Garry%20Moore">Garry Moore</a>, a popular personality in the 1950s, wanted to make a comeback on CBS, but Aubrey casually dismissed him: "Not a chance." (Moore finally got his chance, long after Aubrey left the network, in the fall of 1966, with a short-lived revival of his weekly variety series). <a href="John%20Frankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a>, critically acclaimed as the number one director of live TV dramas during the 1950s, was shown the exit door by Aubrey in 1960. Frankenheimer was forced to find a new career as a movie director (for which he is now arguably best known), although he had wanted to continue in television. In 1996, during a personal appearance at the Museum of Television & Radio, Frankenheimer described Aubrey as "a barbarian."

The star of CBS's "<a href="The%20Lucy%20Show">The Lucy Show</a>" had problems with Aubrey. "<a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a> couldn't say his name without calling him an S.O.B.," Stanton said – though Kempton quoted her after Aubrey's firing as saying "he was the smartest one up there." Aubrey fought with <a href="Red%20Skelton">Red Skelton</a>, <a href="Danny%20Thomas">Danny Thomas</a>, <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Godfrey">Arthur Godfrey</a> as well. The treatment of <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a> was typical.

Aubrey first rescheduled Benny's long-running series without consulting the star. Benny, a good friend of Paley's since he lured the comedian to CBS in 1948, objected to his new lead-in on Tuesdays for the 1963–64 season, "<a href="Petticoat%20Junction">Petticoat Junction</a>", instead of the previous season's "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Show">The Red Skelton Hour</a>". Then in the summer of 1963, Aubrey told Benny his show would not be renewed at the end of the forthcoming season, Aubrey having decided that Benny was out of step with current tastes and no longer relevant. "You're through, old man." Aubrey told the star. Benny took his show to NBC, his home before 1948; Benny ended the show after only one season there, proving Aubrey's point if not his tactics.

There were charges of favoritism in purchasing programs. Aubrey's friend <a href="Keefe%20Brasselle">Keefe Brasselle</a>, who had bit parts in several movies in the 1940s and 1950s and met Aubrey when they both worked at KNXT, had no experience as a producer. "A 1965 edition of <a href="George%20Raft">George Raft</a>," said David Susskind, particularly apt as there were also rumors Brasselle had ties to <a href="the%20Mafia">the Mafia</a>. Nevertheless, Aubrey scheduled three shows from Brasselle's Richelieu Productions for the <a href="1964-65%20United%20States%20network%20television%20schedule">1964–65</a> season, all without pilots, still an almost unheard-of practice. (The shows were "<a href="The%20Baileys%20of%20Balboa">The Baileys of Balboa</a>", a sitcom with <a href="Paul%20Ford">Paul Ford</a>; the newspaper drama "<a href="The%20Reporter%20%28TV%20series%29">The Reporter</a>"; and "<a href="The%20Cara%20Williams%20Show">The Cara Williams Show</a>", a sitcom starring red-head Williams, billed as the next <a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a>.) Brasselle would personally supervise "The Reporter", shot in New York City. Costs skyrocketed on Brasselle's shows – after nine episodes, "The Reporter" was $450,000 over budget – and all three bombed – "The Reporter" running only three months, "Baileys" until April 1965; and "Cara Williams" finishing the season. Aubrey was later asked why he aired three untested programs. "Arrogance, I guess" he responded. In his book "<a href="The%20Other%20Glass%20Teat">The Other Glass Teat</a>", media critic <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> alleges that a Mafia don had put out a contract on Aubrey for beating his daughter during consensual sex at a <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> hotel, and that Brasselle demanded the shows in exchange for his using his own Mafia connections to smooth things over.

But, as his critics acknowledged, Aubrey could be charming and go to great lengths to please talent. To keep <a href="Jackie%20Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> happy when he moved his show from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to <a href="Miami%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Miami Beach</a> in 1963, Aubrey had CBS buy Gleason's futuristic home in <a href="Peekskill%2C%20New%20York">Peekskill, New York</a> – "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called it "a flying-saucer like cabana" – for $350,000. The network was still trying to sell it years later.

Aubrey, who on May 9, 1963, warned the network's affiliates the high cost of rights for professional sports could price them off television, nevertheless in January 1964 agreed to pay $28.2 million to air the games of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> for two years, seventeen games each season. "We know how much these games mean to the viewing audience, our affiliated stations, and the nation's advertisers," Aubrey told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". In April, he agreed to extend the deal for another year for a total of $31.8 million.

In the spring of 1964, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a> Magazine" declared CBS "for the 10th year in a row ... was the undisputed champion of the television networks." The "Times" quoted an analyst who said CBS was "almost comparable to what <a href="General%20Motors%20Corporation">General Motors</a> did in autos or what <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> [did] in electrical equipment."

Aubrey fought constantly with officials of <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a>, especially its chief, <a href="Fred%20W.%20Friendly">Fred W. Friendly</a>, who was just as demanding and controlling as Aubrey. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, "Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control", recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey talked at length of how much money the news was costing the company, a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. However, Paley supported the news and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. Aubrey in 1962 ordered that there would be fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move.

That fall, "<a href="CBS%20Reports">CBS Reports</a>", a news/documentary program at 7:30(et) on Wednesdays, was blamed in the press for the sharp drop off in the ratings of "<a href="The%20Beverly%20Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a>" – the comedy had been number one in its first two seasons, but dropped to eighteenth when "CBS Reports" became the "Hillbillies" lead-in for its third season. ("Hillbillies" had aired at nine o'clock before moving up a half hour in 1964.) CBS responded by moving "CBS Reports" to Mondays.

In the spring of 1964, charges were printed in the April 16 issue of "Close-Up", a celebrity <a href="Tabloid%20journalism">tabloid</a>, which claimed Aubrey was taking kickbacks from producers. The <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> made inquiries, and CBS learned that despite his $264,000 annual salary from the company, Aubrey's apartment on <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>'s <a href="Central%20Park%20South">Central Park South</a> was owned by <a href="Martin%20Ransohoff">Martin Ransohoff</a>, the head of Filmways, the producer of the "Hillbillies"," <a href="Petticoat%20Junction">Petticoat Junction</a>", "<a href="Mister%20Ed">Mister Ed</a>", and other CBS programs. And though he had a chauffeur-driven car paid for by the network, Brasselle's Richelieu Productions was paying for another chauffeured car for Aubrey, done so Paley and Stanton would not know what Aubrey was doing after hours. CBS had not known of either the apartment or the car. The company was also concerned about the money spent to buy Gleason's former home.

In late 1964, Aubrey approached Stanton with a proposal. Claiming he had investors lined-up and ready to buy the company, Aubrey said once in control, they would fire Paley, install Stanton as chairman, and promote Aubrey to Stanton's post, CBS corporate president. This did not come to pass, but Aubrey's contempt for Paley knew no bounds, Aubrey even showing his disregard for Paley in public. The <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> filing a tax lien against Aubrey for $38,047.93 was another irritant for Paley. Aubrey also seemed to have lost his touch, the early ratings for the 1964–65 season showing the new shows that fall were flops. Aubrey panicked, noted "Life", and "by that time Paley had made his decision to fire Aubrey, though he had yet found no plausible excuse."

"Aubrey was torpedoed at last," wrote "The New York Times Magazine", "by a combination of his imperiousness, the ratings drop, and a vivid afterhours life culminating in a raucous <a href="Miami%20Beach">Miami Beach</a> party – details of which no one ever agrees on – the weekend he was fired." (Aubrey had been in Florida for Jackie Gleason's forty-ninth birthday party.)

"I don't pretend to be any saint. If anyone wants to indict me for liking pretty girls, I'm guilty," Aubrey said at the time, one factor in his divorce in 1962, which freed him to, "live the high life around New York, <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami</a>, and in Europe with such companions as <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a>, <a href="Julie%20Newmar">Julie Newmar</a>, <a href="Rhonda%20Fleming">Rhonda Fleming</a> – and with other dolls who were only faces and figures, not names. His late dates and early morning parties were the talk of several towns."

Paley ordered Stanton to fire Aubrey, and he did so on February 27, 1965, though the announcement was delayed until the following afternoon, a Sunday. Stanton's statement declared:
Jim Aubrey's outstanding accomplishment during his tenure as head of the C.B.S. television network need no elaboration. His extraordinary record speaks for itself.

In 1986, Paul Rosenfield of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote:
There are at least 13,000 theories on why he got the ax, some of them lurid, but none as obvious as the fact that CBS was starting to slip in the Nielsens. "And there was a basic dissatisfaction with me," as he put it. If Aubrey understood ratings and revenue, he also was no stranger to a kind of after-hours recklessness that mirrored the Camelot of its day. Nobody questions that Jungle Jim had a good time in the playgrounds of Manhattan and Hollywood.

Rosenfield also claimed "for years gossip columnists had to bite their tongues because the fodder on Aubrey was so tempting, but mostly unprintable. How much was <a href="hearsay">hearsay</a> and how much was fiction is not clear." Aubrey's successor was announced as <a href="John%20A.%20Schneider">John A. Schneider</a>, the general manager of <a href="WCBS-TV">WCBS-TV</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, who had no experience in network television. Aubrey was so despondent at losing his job Stanton feared he would kill himself. <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> took the news badly as well: CBS stock plunged nine points over the following week. The stock tumble "puts my net value to the network at $20 million," Aubrey noted. Aubrey continued to be a CBS employee until April 20.

<a href="Jack%20Gould">Jack Gould</a>, television critic for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", wrote two days after Aubrey's dismissal that Aubrey
symbolized an era in television that has been and is too much rooted in calculated and insensitive preoccupation with making more money this year than last ... Automated situation comedies that wooed the young and did not drive away the old were the mainstay of his philosophy and they paid off.

Aubrey, who left CBS with $2.5 million in network stock, moved to the <a href="Sunset%20Strip">Sunset Strip</a> and set up a production company, The Aubrey Company. His attorney, <a href="Greg%20Bautzer">Gregson E. Bautzer</a>, in 1967 tried to buy the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> for another client, the Las Vegas-based millionaire <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>. Aubrey was to have run ABC after the takeover, but the reclusive Hughes refused to testify in person at hearings before the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a>, which had to approve the purchase, and the deal collapsed.

Aubrey's outsize reputation – beaming smile, dapper dress, endless womanizing – and his dramatic exit from CBS inspired characters in three novels. His former friend <a href="Keefe%20Brasselle">Keefe Brasselle</a> wrote "The CanniBalS: A Novel About Television's Savage Chieftains" (1968), the title of which had very unsubtle capitalization and was, in <a href="Nora%20Ephron">Nora Ephron</a>'s assessment, "unreadable." <a href="Harold%20Robbins">Harold Robbins</a>'s "The Inheritors" (1969) and <a href="Jacqueline%20Susann">Jacqueline Susann</a>'s "<a href="The%20Love%20Machine%20%28novel%29">The Love Machine</a>" (1969) also contained characters based on him. In Susann's book, Aubrey is network executive Robin Stone. Paul Rosenfield said Aubrey had "quietly cooperated" with Susann, "giving her background on TV," although Susann's husband, <a href="Irving%20Mansfield">Irving Mansfield</a>, had been a busy TV producer himself, before switching
to managing his wife's career full-time. Susann said Aubrey, her neighbor, was "one of those people who are born to run the works. A natural for a novel."

In June 1967, Aubrey agreed to a two-year contract to produce films for <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Despite being frequently rumored as a candidate for many posts in the entertainment industry, Aubrey told <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" he had "no desire ever again to become involved in the corporate side of the entertainment business" and had been, in Canby's words, "dabbling in a number of enterprises, including the acquisition of films for TV, real estate, and <a href="cultured%20pearl">cultured pearl</a>s." In 1965, Oulahan and Lambert had noted he had "extensive investments in everything from <a href="copper">copper</a> mines to a chain of waffle shops." His first project for Columbia was to be an adaptation of a <a href="Patricia%20Highsmith">Patricia Highsmith</a> book, "Those Who Walk Away". "The criteria is profitable entertainment," he told Canby. Before the deal collapsed on January 1, 1968, Aubrey had been rumored to be the leading candidate to be hired as ABC television entertainment chief if <a href="International%20Telephone%20and%20Telegraph">International Telephone and Telegraph</a>'s takeover of ABC, which was announced in March 1966, had been completed.

Aubrey resurfaced in 1969 when Las Vegas businessman <a href="Kirk%20Kerkorian">Kirk Kerkorian</a> took control of the <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> studio for the first time, ousting Canadian liquor magnate <a href="Edgar%20Bronfman%20Sr.">Edgar M. Bronfman</a>, who had gained control earlier that year. Aubrey's attorney Gregson E. Bautzer also represented Kerkorian, and Bautzer recommended Aubrey for the MGM post. Aubrey, announced as MGM president on October 21, 1969, was Kerkorian's third choice after <a href="Herb%20Jaffe">Herb Jaffe</a> of <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> and independent producer Mike Frankovich both declined the post, while producer <a href="Ray%20Stark">Ray Stark</a> was also considered. Aubrey replaced the fired <a href="Louis%20F.%20Polk%20Jr.">Louis F. Polk Jr.</a>, who had been MGM president only since January 14, 1969. Aubrey was the studio's third president that year. Polk told "The New York Times", "no one likes to leave a job unfinished," and said he had started much-needed reforms at the studio, which suffered a $35 million loss in the fiscal year ending August 31, 1969.

Aubrey received a salary of $4,000 a week, but had no contract. He said in 1986, "I wanted Kirk to be able to say, 'Get lost, Jim,' without obligation if it didn't work." Like most of the big studios in the 1960s, MGM was struggling and Kerkorian said his new president would bring the company roaring back to its former glory. Instead, Aubrey largely liquidated the company as Kerkorian transformed it into a hospitality company with the <a href="MGM%20Grand%20Las%20Vegas">MGM Grand Hotel</a> he was building. "We've been using old-fashioned methods here," Aubrey said at the time. In 1986, he said the company was "total disarray. Until you were in a position to lift up the rug, there was no way to know how much disarray. The crown jewel of studios had become a shambles."

Within days of his hiring, twelve films were canceled because of financial issues, among them director <a href="Fred%20Zinnemann">Fred Zinnemann</a>'s "Man's Fate", days from starting principal photography.

Aubrey eliminated hundreds of jobs when he relocated corporate headquarters from <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City</a> to be closer to production facilities, a move which was announced on April 29, 1970. Aubrey ordered the sale of MGM's historic collection of costumes and props such as the <a href="Ruby%20Slippers">Ruby Slippers</a> worn by <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a> in "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>", <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>'s dresses from "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" and the suit <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> wore in "<a href="Inherit%20the%20Wind%20%281960%20film%29">Inherit the Wind</a>". (It was bought by one of the defense attorneys defending <a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a>, who regularly wore it to court.) The studio's camera department was auctioned. Most of the studio's Culver City backlot and its 2,000 acre (8 km²) ranch in the Conejo Valley were sold to developers, moves already planned under Polk. Aubrey literally threw the company's valuable archives into the trash and brought production to a standstill. Composer and conductor <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Previn">André Previn</a>, in his memoir, "No Minor Chords. My Days in Hollywood", describes how Aubrey had MGM's collection of film music manuscripts discarded into the trash.[citation needed] Aubrey was criticized for these actions. In 1986, he recalled, "the buck had to stop somewhere, and it was with me. Nostalgia runs strong out here, so we were criticized for selling Judy Garland's red shoes. To us they had no value, and they had no intrinsic value."

These moves were effective in restoring the company's finances. In his first nine months on the job, he cut MGM's debt by $27 million, nearly one-quarter the total, and the company posted profits of $540,000 for those nine months compared to a $18,372,000 loss in the comparable period in the preceding fiscal year.

Losses were so great because Polk wrote off as total losses many films made under his predecessors; the company posted a $35,366,000 loss in the fiscal year ending August 31, 1969. "Basically what we're really concentrating on at the moment is to really streamline this operation. There isn't much else to do when you're losing as much money as we are," Aubrey told "The New York Times" in December 1969. Aubrey said, "we have determined that we're not going to continue to produce on the basis of forty acres and acres and acres of standing sets. Young people who are the major movie audience today, refer to that as the plastic world and that is almost a deterrent in the business today."

Aubrey announced plans for faster and cheaper movies, none of which would have a budget above $1 million, but many of these inexpensive films bombed with critics and audiences. One notable success was the <a href="Richard%20Roundtree">Richard Roundtree</a> film "<a href="Shaft%20%281971%20movie%29">Shaft</a>", which cost $1 million and grossed around $12 million at the box office. Agent <a href="Sue%20Mengers">Sue Mengers</a> said he was a very tough dealmaker. "I'd rather go to bed with him than negotiate with him." Upon assuming his MGM post, Aubrey almost immediately canceled production on two <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a> pictures, "She Loves Me" and "Say It With Music", the late 1960s fad for musicals having ended. He also clashed with <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>, whose production of "<a href="Ryan%27s%20Daughter">Ryan's Daughter</a>" was running overbudget, in early 1970, attempting to cancel or at least scale down the film; but Lean held too much sway for Aubrey's actions to have any effect.

In the first half of fiscal 1970, the company had profits of $6,531,000 despite sizable write-offs. The company had significantly cut its operating losses from $6,547,000 to $1,594,000. Aubrey told the press in April 1970 the company would have made money if not for four films: <a href="Herbert%20Ross">Herbert Ross</a>'s musical version of <a href="James%20Hilton%20%28novelist%29">James Hilton</a>'s novel "<a href="Goodbye%2C%20Mr.%20Chips%20%281969%20film%29">Goodbye, Mr. Chips</a>" starring <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> and <a href="Petula%20Clark">Petula Clark</a>; <a href="Michelangelo%20Antonioni">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>'s "<a href="Zabriskie%20Point%20%28film%29">Zabriskie Point</a>", a film <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> called "a huge, jerry-built crumbling ruin of a movie"; the adventure "<a href="Captain%20Nemo%20and%20the%20Underwater%20City">Captain Nemo and the Underwater City</a>" with <a href="Robert%20Ryan">Robert Ryan</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Connors">Chuck Connors</a>; and <a href="Sidney%20Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>'s "<a href="The%20Appointment">The Appointment</a>" with <a href="Omar%20Sharif">Omar Sharif</a>, <a href="Anouk%20Aim%C3%A9e">Anouk Aimée</a>, and <a href="Lotte%20Lenya">Lotte Lenya</a>. These four pictures cost almost $20 million to produce and had they broken even the company would have been profitable. In "The New York Times", <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> noted that same month "the fickle tastes of the movie-going audience have made a large part of [studios' film] inventory obsolete."

By the end of the fiscal year, the company had made $1,573,000 in profits; a remarkable turnaround for a company which posted a $35 million loss one year before. In January 1971, Aubrey declared, "we are pleased that the company has been turned around. Through the policies of this management, including a complete reorganization, substantial economies, consolidation of operations and through better performance of recent films, we have been able to operate substantially in the black."

That same month, Aubrey announced the company was in merger talks with <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a>, days after Fox fired its top executives, <a href="Richard%20D.%20Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a> and <a href="David%20Brown%20%28producer%29">David Brown</a>. Two weeks later he announced the talks had ended. However, <a href="Darryl%20F.%20Zanuck">Darryl F. Zanuck</a>, chairman and CEO of Fox, publicly denied any negotiations. "There have not been and are not now and are not scheduled for the future any discussions concerning a merger or any other type of combination between our two companies," he told the press.

Aubrey again took a hands-on approach to MGM's products, personally ordering cuts on films. "The New York Times Magazine" wrote, "Aubrey's heavy involvement with every creative detail of MGM's pictures far surpassed his immersal in CBS's scripts." After he made edits to the film "<a href="Going%20Home%20%281971%20film%29">Going Home</a>" starring <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a>, its director, <a href="Herbert%20B.%20Leonard">Herbert B. Leonard</a>, protested publicly. "He unilaterally and arbitrarily raped the picture," he told "Time" in 1971. Director <a href="Blake%20Edwards">Blake Edwards</a> was incensed by changes Aubrey made to his film "<a href="Wild%20Rovers">Wild Rovers</a>" with <a href="William%20Holden">William Holden</a>, telling "The New York Times Magazine", "Cuts? He doesn't know as much as a first-year cinema student. He cut the heart right out of it." Television producer <a href="Bruce%20Geller">Bruce Geller</a>, who created "", had his name removed from the credits of his first film, "<a href="Corky%20%28film%29">Corky</a>", because "It's not my picture any more." The producer of the film "<a href="Chandler%20%28film%29">Chandler</a>", Michael S. Laughlin, and its director, <a href="Paul%20Magwood">Paul Magwood</a>, took out a full page ad, bordered in black, in the trade papers declaring:
Regarding what was our film "Chandler", let's give credit where credit is due. We sadly acknowledge that all editing, post-production as well as additional scenes were executed by James T. Aubrey Jr. We are sorry.

Laughlin told "Time Magazine", "You just can't deal with Aubrey. He realizes that litigation can be a great expense, and that because of legal delays the film will have disappeared long before your case comes to court."

Aubrey engaged in another infamous feud with <a href="Sam%20Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>, who in 1973 began work on the Western "<a href="Pat%20Garrett%20and%20Billy%20the%20Kid">Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</a>". Aubrey clashed with Peckinpah immediately, the two men's notoriously difficult personalities leading to a long-lasting feud. Aubrey slashed Peckinpah's budget early in production, refusing to allow him to reshoot crucial footage, pushing back the release date to Memorial Day, and editing out nearly 20 minutes of the film. Editor <a href="Roger%20Spottiswoode">Roger Spottiswoode</a> said that "Aubrey was ordering scenes cut out for no other reason except he knew Sam didn't want them cut." 

MGM had disagreements with the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a> and its rating system for films, which had been instituted in 1968. MGM resigned from the MPAA in 1971 over the issue of ratings and "exorbitant dues charges," Aubrey said. In October 1971, MGM announced that it was to build the world's largest hotel in Las Vegas, what would become the <a href="MGM%20Grand%20Las%20Vegas">MGM Grand Hotel</a>, and was to enter the cruise-ship business. The next month, the company announced fiscal 1971 profits of $16,358,000, up sharply from the $1.6 million in fiscal 1970 and the highest in a quarter century.

After four years at MGM, Aubrey announced his resignation, declaring, "The job I agreed to undertake has been accomplished." Kerkorian was named as his successor on October 31, 1973. "<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time Magazine</a>" declared, "Under Aubrey, MGM churned out profitable, medium-budget schlock like "<a href="Skyjacked%20%28film%29">Skyjacked</a>" and "<a href="Black%20Belly%20of%20the%20Tarantula">Black Belly of the Tarantula</a>"; directors often charged him with philistine meddling, and he alienated many of them" but "as a financial auteur, Aubrey may have deserved an <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar</a>."

Aubrey and <a href="Sherry%20Lansing">Sherry Lansing</a>, who entered the movie business as a script reader at MGM under Aubrey, were struck by a car while crossing <a href="Wilshire%20Boulevard">Wilshire Boulevard</a> in the mid-1970s. Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches for a year and a half. Aubrey nursed her back to health. "He came every day. He would say, 'You're not going to limp.' My own mother and father couldn't give me more support," she told "Variety" in 2004.

Aubrey became an independent producer after leaving MGM, producing ten films, none memorable. His greatest success was a 1979 television movie about the "<a href="Dallas%20Cowboys%20Cheerleaders">Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders</a>" starring <a href="Jane%20Seymour%20%28actress%29">Jane Seymour</a>. In the mid-1980s, he was chairman of Entermark, a production company which made low-budget films and was backed by several wealthy Texans – including former Governor <a href="John%20Connally">John Connally</a>. "Our theory is that with today's ancillary rights, there is real profit in a movie that costs $3 million. We don't need to gross $40 million, or open on <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a>," he said. To publicize this venture, he granted a rare interview to the "Los Angeles Times" in 1986. Reporter Paul Rosenfield found him unrepentant:

Aubrey doesn't deny that he shoots from the hip, in a style that can unhinge the fragile egos of show business. "If I was in the tire business," reasoned Aubrey, "I wouldn't be hurt if the customer didn't buy my tires. I'd think, 'So what?' But in my business, if I don't buy the script, then the writer kicks the dog and beats his wife. So you learn to pay attention to personal relationships. But that doesn't mean you lie to people. I've been the screwer and the screwee, and I know which is better. It's better to be the screwer, and it's very difficult to do that with honesty, but it's how I prefer to be treated. I don't want power now, or authority, so I suppose my candor can't hurt me.

Gossip columnist <a href="Liz%20Smith%20%28journalist%29">Liz Smith</a> reported this profile of Aubrey had led to rumors he would again return to head CBS after Paley was forced out in 1986 when <a href="Laurence%20Tisch">Laurence Tisch</a> acquired the network. Aubrey worked as a consultant for <a href="Brandon%20Tartikoff">Brandon Tartikoff</a> during the 1980s, while Tartikoff worked to restore the reputation of NBC, but by the time of Aubrey's death he had been largely forgotten.

Chalukya dynasty

The Chalukya dynasty () was a <a href="Classical%20India">Classical India</a>n royal dynasty that ruled large parts of <a href="south%20India">southern</a> and <a href="central%20India">central India</a> between the 6th and the 12th centuries. During this period, they ruled as three related yet individual dynasties. The earliest dynasty, known as the "Badami Chalukyas", ruled from Vatapi (modern <a href="Badami">Badami</a>) from the middle of the 6th century. The Badami Chalukyas began to assert their independence at the decline of the <a href="Kadamba%20Dynasty">Kadamba</a> kingdom of <a href="Banavasi">Banavasi</a> and rapidly rose to prominence during the reign of <a href="Pulakeshin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Pulakeshin II</a>. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a> became an independent kingdom in the eastern <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>. They ruled from <a href="Vengi">Vengi</a> until about the 11th century. In the western Deccan, the rise of the <a href="Rashtrakutas">Rashtrakutas</a> in the middle of the 8th century eclipsed the Chalukyas of Badami before being revived by their descendants, the <a href="Western%20Chalukyas">Western Chalukyas</a>, in the late 10th century. These Western Chalukyas ruled from Kalyani (modern <a href="Basavakalyan">Basavakalyan</a>) until the end of the 12th century.

The rule of the Chalukyas marks an important milestone in the history of <a href="South%20India">South India</a> and a <a href="Golden%20Age">golden age</a> in the history of <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>. The political atmosphere in South India shifted from smaller kingdoms to large empires with the ascendancy of Badami Chalukyas. A Southern India-based kingdom took control and consolidated the entire region between the <a href="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> and the <a href="Narmada%20River">Narmada</a> rivers. The rise of this empire saw the birth of efficient administration, overseas trade and commerce and the development of new style of architecture called "Chalukyan architecture". <a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a>, which had enjoyed royal support in the 9th century Rashtrakuta court found eager patronage from the Western Chalukyas in the <a href="Jain">Jain</a> and <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a> traditions. The 11th century saw the patronage of <a href="Telugu%20literature">Telugu literature</a> under the Eastern Chalukyas.

While opinions vary regarding the early origins of the Chalukyas, the consensus among noted historians such as <a href="John%20Keay">John Keay</a>, <a href="Dineshchandra%20Sircar">D.C. Sircar</a>, Hans Raj, S. Sen, <a href="Suryanath%20U.%20Kamath">Kamath</a>, <a href="K.%20V.%20Ramesh%20%28archaeologist%29">K. V. Ramesh</a> and Karmarkar is the founders of the empire at Badami were native to the modern <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> region.

A theory that they were descendants of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the <a href="Andhra%20Ikshvaku">Andhra Ikshvaku</a> (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath has failed to explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves "Vashisthiputras" of the "Hiranyakagotra". The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as "Harithiputras" of "Manavyasagotra" in their inscriptions, which is the same lineage as their early overlords, the <a href="Kadamba%20dynasty">Kadambas</a> of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.

A later record of Eastern Chalukyas mentions the northern origin theory and claims one ruler of <a href="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> came south, defeated the Pallavas and married a Pallava princess. She had a child called Vijayaditya who is claimed to be the <a href="Pulakeshin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Pulakeshin I</a>'s father. However, according to the historians K. V. Ramesh, Chopra and Sastri, there are Badami Chalukya inscriptions that confirm <a href="Jayasimha%20%28Vatapi%20Chalukya%20dynasty%29">Jayasimha</a> was Pulakeshin I's grandfather and <a href="Ranaraga">Ranaraga</a>, his father. Kamath and Moraes claim it was a popular practice in the 11th century to link South Indian royal family lineage to a Northern kingdom. The Badami Chalukya records themselves are silent with regards to the Ayodhya origin.

While the northern origin theory has been dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination. According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity may have been due to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin of their ancestors may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region. The writing of 12th century <a href="Kashmiri%20people">Kashmiri</a> poet <a href="Bilhana">Bilhana</a> suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the <a href="Shudra">Shudra</a> caste while other sources claim they were <a href="Kshatriya">Kshatriya</a>s.

The historians Jan Houben and Kamath, and the epigraphist D.C. Sircar note the Badami Chalukya <a href="Epigraphy">inscriptions</a> are in <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> and <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. According to the historian N. L. Rao, their inscriptions call them "Karnatas" and their names use indigenous Kannada titles such as "Priyagallam" and "Noduttagelvom". The names of some Chalukya princes end with the pure Kannada term "arasa" (meaning "king" or "chief"). The <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> inscriptions call the Chalukyas of Badami "Karnatabala" ("Power of Karnata"). It has been proposed by the historian S. C. Nandinath that the word "Chalukya" originated from "Salki" or "Chalki" which is a Kannada word for an agricultural implement.

Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main source of information about Badami Chalukya history. Among them, the <a href="Badami">Badami</a> cave inscriptions of <a href="Mangalesha">Mangalesha</a> (578), <a href="Kappe%20Arabhatta">Kappe Arabhatta</a> record of c. 700, Peddavaduguru inscription of <a href="Pulakeshin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Pulakeshin II</a>, the <a href="Kanchi">Kanchi</a> Kailasanatha Temple inscription and <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a> Virupaksha Temple inscription of <a href="Vikramaditya%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Vikramaditya II</a> (all in Kannada language) provide more evidence of the Chalukya language. The Badami cliff inscription of Pulakeshin I (543), the <a href="Mahakuta%20Pillar">Mahakuta Pillar</a> inscription of <a href="Mangalesha">Mangalesha</a> (595) and the <a href="Aihole%20inscriptions">Aihole inscription</a> of Pulakeshin II (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old <a href="Kannada%20script">Kannada script</a>.
The reign of the Chalukyas saw the arrival of Kannada as the predominant language of inscriptions along with Sanskrit, in areas of the Indian peninsula outside what is known as <a href="Ancient%20Tamil%20country">Tamilaham</a> (Tamil country). Several coins of the Badami Chalukyas with Kannada legends have been found. All this indicates that Kannada language flourished during this period.

Travelogues of contemporary foreign travellers have provided useful information about the Chalukyan empire. The Chinese traveller <a href="Xuanzang">Xuanzang</a> had visited the court of <a href="Pulakeshin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Pulakeshin II</a>. At the time of this visit, as mentioned in the <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a> record, Pulakeshin II had divided his empire into three "Maharashtrakas" or great provinces comprising 99,000 villages each. This empire possibly covered present day <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and <a href="Konkan">coastal Konkan</a>. Xuanzang, impressed with the governance of the empire observed that the benefits of the king's efficient administration was felt far and wide. Later, Persian emperor <a href="Khosrau%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Khosrau II</a> exchanged ambassadors with Pulakeshin II.

Court poets of the Western Chalukya dynasty of Kalyani narrate:

Some scholars connect the Chalukyas with the <a href="Chaulukya%20dynasty">Chaulukyas</a> (Solankis) of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. According to a myth mentioned in latter manuscripts of <a href="Prithviraj%20Raso">Prithviraj Raso</a>, Chaulukyas were born out of fire-pit (Agnikund) at <a href="Mount%20Abu">Mount Abu</a>. However it has been reported that the story of <a href="Agnivansha">Agnikula</a> is not mentioned at all in the original version of the <a href="Prithviraj%20Raso">Prithviraj Raso</a> preserved in the Fort Library at <a href="Bikaner">Bikaner</a>.

According to the Nilagunda inscription of King Vikramaditya VI (11th century or later), the Chalukyas originally hailed from <a href="Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> where fifty-nine kings ruled, and later, sixteen more of this family ruled from South India where they had migrated. This is repeated by his court poet Bilhana, who claims that the first member of the family, "Chalukya", was so named as he was born in the "hollow of the hands" of God <a href="Brahma">Brahma</a>. Some genealogical accounts point to an Ayodhya origin and claim that the Chalukyas belonged to the <a href="Solar%20dynasty">Solar dynasty</a>.

According to a theory put forward by Lewis, the Chalukya were descendants of the "<a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleukia</a>" tribe of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and that their conflict with the <a href="Pallava">Pallava</a> of Kanchi was, but a continuation of the conflict between ancient Seleukia and "<a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a>", the proposed ancestors of <a href="Pallavas">Pallavas</a>. However, this theory has been rejected by Kamath as it seeks to build lineages based simply on similar-sounding clan names.

The Chalukyas ruled over the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a> plateau in India for over 600 years. During this period, they ruled as three closely related, but individual dynasties. These are the "Chalukyas of Badami" (also called "Early Chalukyas"), who ruled between the 6th and the 8th century, and the two sibling dynasties, the "Chalukyas of Kalyani" (also called <a href="Western%20Chalukyas">Western Chalukyas</a> or "Later Chalukyas") and the "Chalukyas of Vengi" (also called <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a>).

In the 6th century, with the decline of the <a href="Gupta%20Empire">Gupta dynasty</a> and their immediate successors in northern India, major changes began to happen in the area south of the <a href="Vindhyas">Vindhyas</a> – the Deccan and <a href="Ancient%20Tamil%20country">Tamilaham</a>. The age of small kingdoms had given way to large empires in this region. The Chalukya dynasty was established by <a href="Pulakeshin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Pulakeshin I</a> in 543. Pulakeshin I took Vatapi (modern <a href="Badami">Badami</a> in <a href="Bagalkot">Bagalkot</a> district, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>) under his control and made it his capital. Pulakeshin I and his descendants are referred to as "Chalukyas of Badami". They ruled over an empire that comprised the entire state of Karnataka and most of <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> in the Deccan.

Pulakeshin II, whose pre-coronation name was Ereya, commanded control over the entire Deccan and is perhaps the most well-known emperor of the Badami dynasty. He is considered one of the notable kings in Indian history. His queens were princess from the <a href="Alupas">Alupa Dynasty</a> of <a href="South%20Canara">South Canara</a> and the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Western Ganga Dynasty</a> of <a href="Talakad">Talakad</a>, clans with whom the Chalukyas maintained close family and marital relationships. Pulakeshin II extended the Chalukya Empire up to the northern extents of the <a href="Pallava">Pallava</a> kingdom and halted the southward march of <a href="Harsha">Harsha</a> by defeating him on the banks of the river <a href="Narmada%20River">Narmada</a>. He then defeated the <a href="Vishnukundins">Vishnukundins</a> in the south-eastern Deccan. Pallava <a href="Narasimhavarman">Narasimhavarman</a> however reversed this victory in 642 by attacking and occupying Badami temporarily. It is presumed Pulakeshin II, "the great hero", died fighting.

The Badami Chalukya dynasty went into a brief decline following the death of Pulakeshin II due to internal feuds when Badami was occupied by the Pallavas for a period of thirteen years. It recovered during the reign of <a href="Vikramaditya%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Vikramaditya I</a>, who succeeded in pushing the Pallavas out of Badami and restoring order to the empire. Vikramaditya I took the title "Rajamalla" ("lit" "Sovereign of the "Mallas"" or Pallavas). The thirty-seven year rule of <a href="Vijayaditya">Vijayaditya</a> (696–733) was a prosperous one and is known for prolific temple building activity.

The empire was its peak again during the rule of the illustrious <a href="Vikramaditya%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Vikramaditya II</a> (733–744) who is known not only for his repeated invasions of the territory of Tondaimandalam and his subsequent victories over Pallava <a href="Nandivarman%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Nandivarman II</a>, but also for his benevolence towards the people and the monuments of Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple. During his reign Arab intruders of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> invaded southern Gujarat which was under Chalukya rule but the Arabs were defeated and driven out by Pulakesi, a Chalukya governor of Navsari. He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the <a href="Pandya">Pandya</a>s, the <a href="Chola">Chola</a>s and the <a href="Chera%20Dynasty">Cheras</a> in addition to subduing a <a href="Kalabhra">Kalabhra</a> ruler. The last Chalukya king, <a href="Kirtivarman%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Kirtivarman II</a>, was overthrown by the <a href="Rashtrakuta">Rashtrakuta</a> King <a href="Dantidurga">Dantidurga</a> in 753. At their peak, the Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the <a href="Kaveri">Kaveri</a> in the south to the <a href="Narmada%20River">Narmada</a> in the north.

The Chalukyas revived their fortunes in 973 after over 200 years of dormancy when much of the Deccan was under the rule of the Rashtrakutas. The genealogy of the kings of this empire is still debated. One theory, based on contemporary literary and inscriptional evidence plus the finding that the Western Chalukyas employed titles and names commonly used by the early Chalukyas, suggests that the Western Chalukya kings belonged to the same family line as the illustrious Badami <a href="Chalukya">Chalukya</a> dynasty of the 6th century while other Western Chalukya inscriptional evidence indicates they were a distinct line unrelated to the Early Chalukyas.

<a href="Tailapa%20II">Tailapa II</a>, a Rashtrakuta feudatory ruling from Tardavadi – 1000 (<a href="Bijapur%20district%2C%20Karnataka">Bijapur district</a>) overthrew <a href="Karka%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Karka II</a>, re-established the Chalukya rule in the western Deccan and recovered most of the Chalukya empire. The Western Chalukyas ruled for over 200 years and were in constant conflict with the <a href="Cholas">Cholas</a>, and with their cousins, the <a href="Eastern%20Chalukyas">Eastern Chalukyas</a> of Vengi. <a href="Vikramaditya%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI">Vikramaditya VI</a> is widely considered the most notable ruler of the dynasty. Starting from the very beginning of his reign, which lasted fifty years, he abolished the original "Saka" era and established the "Vikrama Era". Most subsequent Chalukya inscriptions are dated in this new era. Vikramaditya VI was an ambitious and skilled military leader. Under his leadership the Western Chalukyas were able to end the Chola influence over Vengi (coastal Andhra) and become the dominant power in the Deccan. The Western Chalukya period was an important age in the development of <a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a> and <a href="Sanskrit%20literature">Sanskrit literature</a>. They went into their final dissolution towards the end of the 12th century with the rise of the <a href="Hoysala%20Empire">Hoysala Empire</a>, the <a href="Pandyas">Pandyas</a>, the <a href="Kakatiya%20dynasty">Kakatiya</a> and the <a href="Seuna%20Yadavas%20of%20Devagiri">Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri</a>.

Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> in 616, defeating the remnants of the <a href="Vishnukundina">Vishnukundina</a> kingdom. He appointed his brother <a href="Kubja%20Vishnuvardhana">Kubja Vishnuvardhana</a> as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between <a href="Nellore">Nellore</a> and <a href="Visakhapatnam">Visakhapatnam</a>.

After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.

The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the <a href="Chola">Chola</a> kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king <a href="Rajaraja%20Chola%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Rajaraja Chola I</a>. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.

Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and literature, though, after a period of time, local factors took over and they gave importance to <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu language</a>. Telugu literature owes its growth to the Eastern Chalukyas.

The Badami Chalukya era was an important period in the development of South Indian architecture. The kings of this dynasty were called "Umapati Varlabdh" and built many temples for the Hindu god Shiva. Their style of architecture is called "Chalukyan architecture" or "Karnata Dravida architecture". Nearly a hundred monuments built by them, rock cut (cave) and structural, are found in the <a href="Malaprabha">Malaprabha</a> river basin in modern <a href="Bagalkot%20district">Bagalkot district</a> of northern Karnataka. The building material they used was a reddish-golden <a href="Sandstone">Sandstone</a> found locally. These cave temples are basically excavations, cut out of the living rock sites they occupy. They were not built as their structural counterparts were, rather created by a special technique known as "subtraction" and are basically sculptural. Though they ruled a vast empire, the Chalukyan workshops concentrated most of their temple building activity in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland – <a href="Aihole">Aihole</a>, <a href="Badami%20Cave%20Temples">Badami</a>, <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a> and <a href="Mahakuta%20group%20of%20temples">Mahakuta</a> in modern Karnataka state.

Their temple building activity can be categorised into three phases. The early phase began in the last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one <a href="Veda">Vedic</a>, one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared <a href="verandah">verandah</a>, a columned hall ("<a href="mandapa">mantapa</a>") and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship. In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of <a href="Harihara">Harihara</a>, <a href="Durga">Mahishasuramardhini</a>, <a href="Varaha">Varaha</a>, <a href="Narasimha">Narasimha</a>, Trivikrama, <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> seated on <a href="Shesha">Anantha</a> (the snake) and <a href="Nataraja">Nataraja</a> (dancing <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>).

The second phase of temple building was at Aihole (where some seventy structures exist and has been called "one of the cradles of Indian temple architecture") and Badami. Though the exact dating of these temples has been debated, there is consensus that the beginnings of these constructions are from c. 600. These are the <a href="Lad%20Khan%20Temple">Lad Khan Temple</a> (dated by some to c. 450 but more accurately to 620) with its interesting perforated stone windows and sculptures of river goddesses; the Meguti Jain Temple (634) which shows progress in structural design; the Durga Temple with its northern Indian style tower (8th century) and experiments to adapt a Buddhist "Chaitya" design to a brahminical one (its stylistic framework is overall a hybrid of north and south Indian styles.); the Huccimalli Gudi Temple with a new inclusion, a <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a>, connecting the sanctum to the hall. Other "dravida" style temples from this period are the Naganatha Temple at Nagaral; the Banantigudi Temple, the Mahakutesvara Temple and the Mallikarjuna Temple at Mahakuta; and the Lower Sivalaya Temple, the Malegitti Sivalaya Temple (upper) and the Jambulingesvara Temple at Badami. Located outside the Chalukyan architectural heartland, 140 km south-east of Badami, with a structure related to the Early Chalukya style is the unusual Parvati Temple at <a href="Sanduru">Sanduru</a> which dates to the late 7th century. It is medium-sized, 48 ft long and 37 ft wide. It has a "nagara" (north Indian) style "vimana" (tower) and "dravida" (south Indian) style parts, has no <a href="mantapa">mantapa</a> (hall) and consists of an "<a href="antarala">antarala</a>" (<a href="Antechamber">vestibule</a>) crowned with a barrel-vaulted tower ("sukhanasi"). The "staggered" base plan of the temple became popular much later, in the 11th century.

The structural temples at Pattadakal, built in the 8th century and now a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, marks the culmination and mature phase of Badami Chalukyan architecture. The Bhutanatha group of temples at Badami are also from this period. There are ten temples at Pattadakal, six in southern "dravida" style and four in the northern "nagara" style. Well known among these are the Sangamesvara Temple (725), the Virupaksha Temple (740–745) and the Mallikarjuna Temple (740–745) in the southern style. The Papanatha temple (680) and Galaganatha Temple (740) are early attempts in the "nagara" – "dravida" fusion style. Inscriptional evidence suggests that the Virupaksha and the Mallikarjuna Temples were commissioned by the two queens of King Vikramaditya II after his military success over the Pallavas of Kanchipuram. Some well known names of Chalukyan architects are Revadi Ovajja, Narasobba and <a href="Gundan%20Anivaritachari">Anivarita Gunda</a>.

The reign of Western Chalukyas was an important period in the development of Deccan architecture. Their architecture served as a conceptual link between the Badami Chalukya architecture of the 8th century and the <a href="Hoysala%20architecture">Hoysala architecture</a> popularised in the 13th century. The centre of their cultural and temple-building activity lay in the <a href="Tungabhadra">Tungabhadra</a> region of modern Karnataka state, encompassing the present-day <a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a>; it included areas of present-day <a href="Haveri%20district">Haveri</a> and <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag</a> districts. Here, large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing <a href="Dravidian%20architecture">dravida</a> temples, defined the "Karnata dravida" tradition.

The most notable of the many buildings dating from this period are the <a href="Mahadeva%20Temple%20%28Itagi%29">Mahadeva Temple</a> at Itagi in the <a href="Koppal%20district">Koppal district</a>, the Kasivisvesvara Temple at <a href="Lakkundi">Lakkundi</a> in the <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a>, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, and the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali, both in the <a href="Davangere%20district">Davangere district</a>. Other notable constructions are the <a href="Dodda%20Basappa%20Temple">Dodda Basappa Temple</a> at <a href="Dambal">Dambal</a> (Gadag district), the <a href="Siddhesvara%20Temple">Siddhesvara Temple</a> at <a href="Haveri">Haveri</a> (<a href="Haveri%20district">Haveri district</a>), and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri (<a href="Dharwad%20district">Dharwad district</a>). The Eastern Chalukyas built some fine temples at Alampur, in modern eastern Andhra Pradesh.

The Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II (634) written by his court poet Ravikirti in Sanskrit language and Kannada script is considered as a classical piece of poetry. A few verses of a poet named Vijayanaka who describes herself as the "dark <a href="Sarasvati">Sarasvati</a>" have been preserved. It is possible that she may have been a queen of prince <a href="Chandraditya%20%28Chalukya%20dynasty%29">Chandraditya</a> (a son of Pulakeshin II). Famous writers in Sanskrit from the Western Chalukya period are <a href="Vijnaneshwara">Vijnaneshwara</a> who achieved fame by writing <a href="Mitakshara">Mitakshara</a>, a book on Hindu law, and King <a href="Someshvara%20III">Someshvara III</a>, a noted scholar, who compiled an <a href="encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> of all arts and sciences called "Manasollasa".

From the period of the Badami Chalukyas, references are made to the existence of Kannada literature, though not much has survived. Inscriptions however refer to Kannada as the "natural language". The <a href="Kappe%20Arabhatta">Kappe Arabhatta</a> record of c. 700 in "<a href="tripadi">tripadi</a>" (three line) metre is the earliest available work in Kannada poetics. "Karnateshwara Katha", which was quoted later by Jayakirti, is believed to be a eulogy of Pulakeshin II and to have belonged to this period. Other probable Kannada writers, whose works are not extant now but titles of which are known from independent references are Syamakundacharya (650), who is said to have authored the "Prabhrita", and Srivaradhadeva (also called Tumubuluracharya, 650 or earlier), the possible author of the "Chudamani" ("Crest Jewel"), a lengthy commentary on <a href="logic">logic</a>.

The rule of the Western and Eastern Chalukyas, however, is a major event in the history of Kannada and Telugu literatures respectively. By the 9th–10th centuries, Kannada language had already seen some of its most notable writers. The "three gems" of <a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a>, <a href="Adikavi%20Pampa">Adikavi Pampa</a>, <a href="Sri%20Ponna">Sri Ponna</a> and <a href="Ranna%20%28Kannada%20poet%29">Ranna</a> belonged to this period. In the 11th century, <a href="Telugu%20literature">Telugu literature</a> was born under the patronage of the Eastern Chalukyas with Nannaya Bhatta as its first writer.

The army was well organised and this was the reason for Pulakeshin II's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller <a href="Hiuen-Tsiang">Hiuen-Tsiang</a> wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered "Revatidvipa" (<a href="Goa">Goa</a>), and <a href="Puri">Puri</a> on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term "Karnatabala" when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.

The government, at higher levels, was closely modelled after the <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a>n and <a href="Satavahana">Satavahana</a> administrative machinery. The empire was divided into "Maharashtrakas" (provinces), then into smaller "Rashtrakas" ("Mandala"), "Vishaya" (district), "Bhoga" (group of 10 villages) which is similar to the "Dasagrama" unit used by the <a href="Kadambas">Kadambas</a>. At the lower levels of administration, the Kadamba style prevailed fully. The Sanjan plates of Vikramaditya I even mentions a land unit called "Dasagrama". In addition to imperial provinces, there were autonomous regions ruled by feudatories such as the Alupas, the <a href="Western%20Ganga%20Dynasty">Gangas</a>, the <a href="Bana%20Kingdom">Banas</a> and the Sendrakas. Local assemblies and guilds looked after local issues. Groups of "<a href="mahajan">mahajan</a>as" (learned <a href="brahmin">brahmin</a>s) looked after "agraharas" (called "ghatika" or "place of higher learning") such as at Badami which was served by 2000 "mahajans" and Aihole which was served by 500 "mahajanas". Taxes were levied and were called the "herjunka" – tax on loads, the "kirukula" – tax on retail goods in transit, the "bilkode" – sales tax, the "pannaya" – betel tax, "siddaya" – land tax and the "vaddaravula" – tax levied to support royalty.

The Badami Chalukyas minted coins that were of a different standard compared to the coins of the northern kingdoms. The coins had "<a href="Devanagari">Nagari</a>" and Kannada legends. The coins of Mangalesha had the symbol of a temple on the obverse and a 'sceptre between lamps' or a temple on the reverse. Pulakeshin II's coins had a caparisoned lion facing right on the obverse and a temple on the reverse. The coins weighed 4 grams and were called, in old-Kannada, "hun" (or "honnu") and had fractions such as "fana" (or "fanam") and the "quarter fana" (the modern day Kannada equivalent being "hana" – which literally means "money"). A gold coin called "gadyana" is mentioned in a record at the Vijayeshwara Temple at <a href="Pattadakal">Pattadakal</a>, which later came to be known as "<a href="varaha">varaha</a>" (their royal emblem).

Both <a href="Shaivism">Shaivism</a> and <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a> flourished during the Badami Chalukya period, though it seems the former was more popular. Famous temples were built in places such as Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests ("archakas") were invited from northern India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows ("vrata") and the giving of gifts ("dana") was important. The Badami kings were followers of <a href="%C5%9Arauta">Vedic</a> Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a>, <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>, <a href="Kartikeya">Kartikeya</a>, <a href="Ganapathi">Ganapathi</a>, <a href="Shakti">Shakti</a>, <a href="Surya">Surya</a> and "<a href="Matrikas">Sapta Matrikas</a>" ("seven mothers"). The Badami kings also performed the <a href="Ashwamedha">Ashwamedha</a> ("horse sacrifice"). The worship of <a href="Lajja%20Gauri">Lajja Gauri</a>, a <a href="fertility%20goddess">fertility goddess</a> is known. <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a> too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example. Ravikirti, the court poet of Pulakeshin II was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the <a href="Trimurti">Trimurti</a> ("Hindu trinity") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, <a href="Harihara">Harihara</a> (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and "Ardhanarishwara" (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern <a href="Lakshmeshwar">Lakshmeshwar</a> in the <a href="Gadag%20district">Gadag district</a>) were primary places of learning.

The <a href="Hindu%20caste%20system">Hindu caste system</a> was present and devadasis were recognised by the government. Some kings had concubines ("ganikas") who were given much respect, and <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">Sati</a> was perhaps absent since widows like Vinayavathi and Vijayanka are mentioned in records. <a href="Devadasi">Devadasi</a>s were however present in temples. Sage <a href="Bharata%20Muni">Bharata</a>'s "Natyashastra", the precursor to <a href="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a>, the classical dance of South India, was popular and is seen in many sculptures and is mentioned in inscriptions. Some women from the royal family enjoyed political power in administration. Queen Vijayanka was a noted Sanskrit poet, Kumkumadevi, the younger sister of Vijayaditya (and queen of Alupa King Chitravahana) made several grants and had a Jain <a href="basadi">basadi</a> called Anesajjebasadi constructed at Puligere, and the queens of Vikramaditya II, Lokamahadevi and Trailokyamahadevi made grants and possibly consecrated the Lokesvara Temple (now called Virupaksha temple) but also and the Mallikarjuna temple respectively at Pattadakal.

The Chalukya era may be seen as the beginning of the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India, making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions. This is seen clearly in the field of architecture. The Chalukyas spawned the "Vesara" style of architecture which includes elements of the northern "nagara" and southern "dravida" styles. During this period, the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local <a href="Dravidian%20people">Dravidian</a> vernaculars which were already popular. <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian languages</a> maintain these influences even today. This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages. The Hindu legal system owes much to the Sanskrit work "Mitakshara" by Vijnaneshwara in the court of Western Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI. Perhaps the greatest work in legal literature, "Mitakshara" is a commentary on "Yajnavalkya" and is a treatise on law based on earlier writings and has found acceptance in most parts of India.

No. 1 Flying Training School RAAF

No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) was a school of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). It was one of the Air Force's original units, dating back to the service's formation in 1921, when it was established at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria. By the early 1930s, the school comprised training, <a href="Fighter%20Squadron%20RAAF">fighter</a>, and <a href="Seaplane%20Squadron%20RAAF">seaplane</a> components. It was re-formed several times in the ensuing years, initially as No. 1 Service Flying Training School (No. 1 SFTS) in 1940, under the wartime <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. After graduating nearly 3,000 pilots, No. 1 SFTS was disbanded in late 1944, when there was no further requirement to train Australian aircrew for service in Europe.

The school was re-established in 1946 as No. 1 FTS at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Uranquinty">RAAF Station Uranquinty</a>, New South Wales, and transferred to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training to cope with the demands of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, No. 1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No. 1 Applied Flying Training School (No. 1 AFTS); it moved to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Base Pearce</a>, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's <a href="air%20traffic%20controller">air traffic controller</a>s. Its pilot trainees included <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a>, <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Navy</a>, and foreign students as well as RAAF personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of <a href="No.%201%20Basic%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Basic Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No. 1 AFTS was re-formed as <a href="No.%202%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Flying Training School</a> and No. 1 BFTS was re-formed as No. 1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No. 1 FTS in 1993.

No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) was the first unit to be formally established as part of the new <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Australian Air Force</a> on 31 March 1921 (the term "Royal" was added in August that year). No. 1 FTS was formed from the remnants of Australia's original military flying unit, <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria. Squadron Leader <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">William Anderson</a>, who was also in charge of the Point Cook base, was No. 1 FTS's first commanding officer. The school's initial complement of staff was twelve officers and 67 airmen.

In December 1921, the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> prepared to form its first five <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a> and allocate aircraft to each, as well as to the nascent flying school. The plan was for No. 1 FTS to receive twelve <a href="Avro%20504">Avro 504</a>Ks and four <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a>s, and the squadrons a total of eight <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s, eight <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>s, and three <a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>s. Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1 July 1922 and re-form them as <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flights</a> in a composite squadron under No. 1 FTS. The same month, Flight Lieutenant <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara, VC</a>, took command of the school.

The inaugural flying course commenced in January 1923. Basic instruction took place on the Avro 504Ks, and more advanced or specialised training on the school's other aircraft. Fourteen students commenced the year-long course, and twelve graduated. As well as flying, they studied aeronautics, communications, navigation, armament and general military subjects. Squadron Leader Anderson resumed command of No. 1 FTS in 1925; the following year he handed over to Wing Commander <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, who led the unit until 1929. The first Citizen Air Force (active reserve) pilots' course ran from December 1925 to March 1926, 26 of 30 students completing the training. Although 24 accidents occurred, there were no fatalities, leading Cole to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of <a href="Natural%20rubber">India rubber</a> or had learned how to crash "moderately safely". However, the 1926 Permanent Air Force (PAF) cadet course was marred by three fatal accidents. The following year, 29 students graduated—thirteen PAF, nine reserve, and seven destined for exchange with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF). In June 1928, the school's Avro 504Ks were replaced by <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland DH.60 Cirrus Moths</a>; these were augmented by <a href="Gipsy%20Moth">Gipsy Moth</a>s commencing in 1930.
Squadron Leader McNamara resumed command of No. 1 FTS in October 1930. By then, two sub-units had been raised at Point Cook under the school's auspices: "<a href="Fighter%20Squadron%20RAAF">Fighter Squadron</a>", operating <a href="Bristol%20Bulldog">Bristol Bulldog</a>s; and "<a href="Seaplane%20Squadron%20RAAF">Seaplane Squadron</a>", operating <a href="Supermarine%20Southampton">Supermarine Southampton</a>s, among other types. As of February 1934, No. 1 FTS was organised into Training Squadron, operating Moths and <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>s, Fighter Squadron and Seaplane Squadron. Fighter and Seaplane Squadrons were formally established as units that month, but remained under the control of the flying school and were "really little more than flights", according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF. As well as participating in training exercises, Fighter Squadron was often employed for aerobatic displays and flag-waving duties. One of No. 1 FTS's leading instructors during the early 1930s, Flight Lieutenant <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>, was also a flight commander in Fighter Squadron. Seaplane Squadron undertook naval co-operation and survey tasks, as well as seaplane training. Fighter Squadron was dissolved in December 1935 when its Bulldogs were transferred to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Laverton</a>, while Seaplane Squadron continued to function until June 1939, when it was separated to form the nucleus of <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a>.

In 1932, No. 1 FTS started running two courses each year, the first commencing in January and the second in July; it also ceased graduating <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20College">Royal Australian Naval College</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander <a href="Hippolyte%20De%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLa%20Rue">Hippolyte De La Rue</a> became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No. 1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first <a href="Avro%20Cadet">Avro Cadet</a>s, procured as an intermediate trainer to bridge the gap between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. <a href="Link%20Trainer">Link Trainer</a> simulators were introduced in March 1939.

RAAF flying training was heavily reorganised soon after the outbreak of World War II, in response to Australia's participation in the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS). Several elementary flying training schools were formed, to provide basic flight instruction to cadets, while more advanced pilot instruction was to take place at service flying training schools. On 1 May 1940, No. 1 FTS was re-formed at Point Cook as No. 1 Service Flying Training School (No. 1 SFTS). Its inaugural commanding officer was <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> John Summers, who led Fighter Squadron in the early 1930s and had taken over No. 1 FTS in December 1939. The school's Instructors' Training Squadron was detached to become the nucleus of a re-formed Central Flying School, which relocated to <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Camden</a>, New South Wales, in June. Courses at the service flying training schools consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced; the total duration varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for sixteen weeks, the course was cut to ten weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to twelve weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to sixteen weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.

At the time of formation, No. 1 SFTS came under the control of <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a>, headquartered in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s, <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>s, and a <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Tiger%20Moth">de Havilland Tiger Moth</a>. Group Captain <a href="John%20McCauley">John McCauley</a> served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a>, who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October. As of July, No. 1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including Gipsy Moths, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides</a>, <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>, <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s and <a href="Airspeed%20Oxford">Airspeed Oxford</a>s, the last two being the mainstays. In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed <a href="No.%201%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No. 1 Training Group</a>. By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets. It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School. Wing Commander <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a> held command of No. 1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15 September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated. Among these were <a href="Nicky%20Barr">Nicky Barr</a>, who became one of Australia's leading <a href="Flying%20ace">fighter aces</a> in <a href="North%20Africa%20Campaign">North Africa</a>, and <a href="Bill%20Newton">Bill Newton</a>, awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for bombing raids in <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea</a>. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the <a href="invasion%20of%20Normandy">invasion of Normandy</a>, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30 June numbered 3,000 Australians.

On 1 March 1946, <a href="No.%205%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Service Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Uranquinty">RAAF Station Uranquinty</a>, New South Wales, was re-formed as No. 1 FTS, under Southern Area Command. Its complement of aircraft included one Anson, two Tiger Moths, and 55 Wirraways, though the unit was mainly responsible for the maintenance of equipment and little flying was undertaken apart from refresher courses for pilots posting to the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a> in Japan. By 1 September 1947, No. 1 FTS had transferred to Point Cook, initially as "Flying Training School", under Wing Commander Read. The RAAF's first post-war flying training course at the school consisted of 42 students and commenced in February 1948, finishing in August the following year. Flight grading took place after six months of general military training, at which point students were selected to be trainee pilots or navigators; the former remained at No. 1 FTS, while the latter transferred to the School of Air Navigation at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Base East Sale</a>. Unlike some other air forces, which placed students into specialised aircraft roles after basic training, the RAAF's philosophy was to give all pilots essentially the same training from induction to graduation, so they would be able to convert more easily from one aircraft type to another as operational requirements evolved. In September 1949, Read handed over to Squadron Leader <a href="Glen%20Cooper">Glen Cooper</a>, who commanded the school until August 1951.

In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, flying training underwent major changes in 1951–52, the syllabus at No. 1 FTS being split among three separately located units. <a href="No.%201%20Initial%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Initial Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 IFTS) was raised at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Archerfield">RAAF Station Archerfield</a>, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No. 1 IFTS went on to the newly formed <a href="No.%201%20Basic%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Basic Flying Training School</a> (No. 1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No. 1 FTS, which was renamed No. 1 Applied Flying Training School (No. 1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as <a href="Sergeant">sergeant pilot</a>s. <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a>, formed at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers. The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No. 1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the <a href="CAC%20Winjeel">CAC Winjeel</a>, first delivered in 1955.
By the time it was re-formed as No. 1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956. Southern Area Command was re-formed as <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training Command</a> in September 1953. On 28 May 1958, No. 1 AFTS relocated to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">RAAF Base Pearce</a>, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook. The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No. 1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19 December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31 December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No. 1 BFTS (for basic training) and No. 1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.

The demand for trained aircrew, which had lessened in the mid-1950s, rose again the following decade as a result of the RAAF embarking on a major re-equipment program, and Australia's increasing involvement in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The RAAF also had an ongoing commitment to providing flying training to students from the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>. By adding instructors and increasing the ratio of pupils to instructors, the number of Air Force graduates was progressively raised from 38 in 1963, to 100 in 1968. Also in 1968, <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Macchi MB-326H</a> jet trainers began replacing the Vampires of No. 1 AFTS. The introduction of the Macchi led to a brief flirtation with "all-through" jet training in the Air Force, consisting of 210 hours on this one type of aircraft. The experiment was dropped after two courses as being, in the words of the official historian of the post-war RAAF, "an expensive way of finding out that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots"; by 1971 students were receiving 60 hours of basic training on Winjeels at Point Cook, and the Maachi course at Pearce was reduced to 150 hours. On 31 December 1968, No. 1 AFTS was disbanded at Pearce, re-forming on 1 January 1969 as <a href="No.%202%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Flying Training School</a> . At the same time, No. 1 BFTS was disbanded at Point Cook and re-formed as No. 1 FTS.
The Winjeels of No. 1 FTS were replaced by <a href="PAC%20CT/4%20Airtrainer">CT-4A Airtrainers</a> in late 1975. The first CT-4 pilots' course of 34 students included six from the Royal Australian Navy and three from Malaysia. By 1977, the school was organised into Air Training, Ground Training and Maintenance Squadrons. As well as maintaining its own aircraft, it was responsible for technical support of other units at Point Cook. The <a href="Queen%27s%20Colour">Queen's Colour</a> was presented to No. 1 FTS by the Governor-General, <a href="Zelman%20Cowen">Sir Zelman Cowen</a>, in 1981. In November 1989, one of the school's CT-4s re-created the first trans-Australia flight that had taken place 70 years before, when Captain <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a> and Sergeant <a href="Arthur%20William%20Murphy">Arthur "Spud" Murphy</a> flew a <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a> biplane from Point Cook to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, between 16 November and 12 December 1919.

A review of undergraduate flying training, commissioned by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS), Air Marshal <a href="Ray%20Funnell">Ray Funnell</a>, and aimed at reducing failure rates and improving cost-effectiveness, saw the retirement of the CT-4s in December 1992, followed by the closure of No. 1 FTS. The last RAAF flying course completed on 12 June 1992, and the last Army pilots' course in December. The school was disbanded on 31 January 1993, bringing to an end almost 80 years of military flying training at Point Cook, Australia's oldest military air base. The occasion was marked by a parading of the Queen's Colour and a flypast by six CT-4s in front of the new CAS, Air Marshal <a href="Barry%20Gration">Barry Gration</a>. This was followed by a service at the RAAF Chapel of the Holy Trinity overflown by four Winjeels and a Tiger Moth, and later an all-ranks dining-in night. Concurrent with the phase-out of training at No. 1 FTS, <a href="BAE%20Systems">British Aerospace</a> was contracted to conduct flight grading at its base in <a href="Tamworth%20Airport">Tamworth</a>, New South Wales. Subsequent all-through flight training on the <a href="Pilatus%20PC-9">Pilatus PC-9</a> took place at No. 2 FTS, Pearce. In 1998, British Aerospace was granted a contract to supply tri-service basic flying instruction at the newly formed <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Basic%20Flying%20Training%20School">Australian Defence Force Basic Flying Training School</a> (ADFBFTS) in Tamworth, the first course commencing in January 1999 on CT-4B Airtrainers, and No. 2 FTS again became responsible for advanced flying training only. ADFBFTS thus became, according to the school's head of training, "the No. 1 Flying Training School you have when you don't have a No. 1 Flying Training School".

Suillus salmonicolor, commonly known as the Slippery Jill, is a <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Suillaceae">Suillaceae</a> of the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Boletales">Boletales</a>. First described as a member of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Boletus">Boletus</a>" in 1874, the <a href="species">species</a> acquired several <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a>, including "Suillus pinorigidus" and "Suillus subluteus", before it was assigned its current <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> in 1983. It has not been determined with certainty whether "S. salmonicolor" is distinct from the species "<a href="Suillus%20cothurnatus">S. cothurnatus</a>", described by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> in 1945. "S. salmonicolor" is a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungus—meaning it forms a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> association with the <a href="root">root</a>s of plants such that both organisms benefit from the exchange of nutrients. This symbiosis occurs with various species of <a href="pine">pine</a>, and the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> (or <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) of the fungus appear scattered or in groups on the ground near the trees. The fungus is found in North America, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, Asia, the Caribbean, South Africa, <a href="Flora%20of%20Australia">Australia</a> and Central America. It has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to several of those locations via transplanted trees.

The mushroom's dingy yellow to brownish <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is rounded to flattened in shape, slimy when wet, and grows up to wide. The small pores on the underside of the cap are yellow before becoming olive-brown. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is up to long and thick and is covered with reddish-brown glandular dots. Young specimens are covered with a grayish, slimy <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that later ruptures and leaves a sheathlike <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the stem. Although the mushroom is generally considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>—especially if the slimy <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> and partial veil are first peeled off—opinions about its palatability vary. Other similar "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" species include "<a href="Suillus%20acidus">S. acidus</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20subalutaceus">S. subalutaceus</a>", and "<a href="Suillus%20intermedius">S. intermedius</a>".

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> scientifically by American <a href="mycologist">mycologist</a> <a href="Charles%20Christopher%20Frost">Charles Christopher Frost</a> in 1874 as "Boletus salmonicolor", based on specimens he collected in the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> area of the United States. In a 1983 publication, mycologist <a href="Roy%20Halling">Roy Halling</a> declared "Boletus subluteus" (described by <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> in 1887; "Ixocomus subluteus" is a later combination based on this name) and "Suillus pinorigidus" (described by <a href="Wally%20Snell">Wally Snell</a> and Esther A. Dick in 1956) to be <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a>. Halling also reexamined Frost's <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> specimen of "B. salmonicolor", and considered the <a href="taxon">taxon</a> better placed in "Suillus" because of its glutinous cap, dotted stem, and <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>; he formally transferred it to that genus, resulting in the combination "Suillus salmonicolor". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "salmonicolor" is a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> color term meaning "pink with a dash of yellow". The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "slippery Jill".

In a 1986 publication on "Suillus" <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> and <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">nomenclature</a>, and further discussed the synonymy of "S. salmonicolor", "S. subluteus", and "S. pinorigidus". They noted that <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of "S. subluteus" collected in Minnesota did not have the strong salmon colors considered characteristic of "S. salmonicolor", as well as collections that had been named "S. pinorigidus"; this is a <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> difference that could be sufficient to consider "S. subluteus" a distinct species. They explained that although the microscopic characteristics of the three taxa do not differ significantly, this is not unusual for "Suillus" and cannot be used as the sole proof of <a href="conspecificity">conspecificity</a>. Palm and Stewart concluded that a study of specimens from various areas of their geographical ranges would be needed to fully resolve the taxonomy of these related species.

There is some disagreement in the literature about whether "<a href="Suillus%20cothurnatus">Suillus cothurnatus</a>" represents a different species from "S. salmonicolor". The online mycological taxonomy database <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a> lists them as synonyms, contrary to <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a>. In their 2000 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of North American boletes, <a href="Alan%20Bessette">Alan Bessette</a> and colleagues list the two taxa separately, noting that the range of "S. cothurnatus" is difficult to determine because of confusion with "S. salmonicolor". In a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analyses of "Suillus" <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>, based on the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a>, "S. salmonicolor" (as "S. subluteus") and "S. intermedius" clustered together very closely, indicating a high degree of <a href="genetic%20similarity">genetic similarity</a>. These analyses were based on comparing the <a href="nucleic%20acid%20sequence">sequence</a> differences in a single region of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a>; more recent molecular analyses typically combine the analysis of several genes to increase the validity of inferences drawn.

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "S. salmonicolor" is bluntly rounded or convex to nearly flattened, reaching a diameter of . The cap surface is sticky to slimy when moist, but becomes shiny when dry. The cap color is variable, ranging from dingy yellow to yellowish-orange to <a href="ochre">ochraceous</a>-<a href="salmon%20%28color%29">salmon</a>, cinnamon-brown or olive-brown to yellow-brown. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is pale orange-yellow to orange-<a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> or orange, and does not stain when exposed to air. The odor and taste are not distinctive. The pore surface on the underside of the cap is yellow to dingy yellow, or yellowish orange to salmon, darkening to brownish with age; it also does not stain when bruised. The pores are circular to angular, measuring 1–2 per mm and deep. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is long, thick, and either equal in width throughout or slightly enlarged in the lower portion. It is whitish to yellowish or pinkish-ochre, and has reddish-brown to dark brown glandular dots and smears on the surface. Glandular dots are made of clumps of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ed cells, and, unlike <a href="wikt%3Areticulation">reticulation</a> or scabers (small visible tufts of fibers that occur on the stems of other "Suillus" species), can be rubbed off with handling. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is ochraceous to yellowish, often salmon-orange at the base of the stem. The <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that protects the developing gills is initially thick, baggy, and rubbery. It often has a conspicuously thickened cottony roll of tissue at its base, and sometimes flares outward from the stem on the lower portion. It forms a gelatinous <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the upper to middle part of the stem. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is cinnamon-brown to brown. The surface of the cap, when applied with a drop of dilute <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH) or <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonia solution</a> (chemical reagents commonly used for <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">mushroom identification</a>), will first turn a fleeting pink color, then dark red as the flesh collapses.

The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are smooth, roughly <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> in shape, inequilateral when viewed in profile, and measure 7.6–10 by 3–3.4 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. They appear <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) to yellowish in a dilute solution of KOH, and cinnamon to pale <a href="ochre">ochraceous</a> when <a href="staining">stained</a> with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> are somewhat collapsed, hyaline, and 5–6 μm thick. The <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> are scattered, sometimes arranged in clusters (especially on the gill edge), usually with an ochraceous-brown content, but occasionally hyaline. They are club-shaped to somewhat cylindric and measure 34–60 by 10–13 μm. The <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> of the cap is an ixotrichodermium—a cellular arrangement where the outermost hyphae are gelatinous and emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are hyaline and narrowly cylindric, measuring 1.4–3 μm in diameter. The stem surface is made of scattered bundles of caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are brown or sometimes hyaline in KOH, club-shaped to <a href="subcylindrical">subcylindrical</a> bundles interspersed among hyaline cells. These bundles are underlain by a layer of gelatinous, hyaline, vertically oriented and parallel hyphae that are shaped like narrow cylinders. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are absent from the hyphae.

The mushroom is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, but removal of the slimy cap cuticle and partial veil is recommended to avoid possible <a href="Human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal</a> upset; similarly, the 1992 field guide "Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America" recommends the removal of the tube layer before preparation, as it can become slimy during cooking. Opinions about the quality of the mushroom vary. According to the book "Boletes of North America", it is "very good" with a "lemony" flavor. A Canadian field guide is more cautious in its assessment, and suggests that one would have to be brave to consume a mushroom with such a sticky veil. Mycologist <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a>, in his "<a href="Mushrooms%20Demystified">Mushrooms Demystified</a>", opines that it is not worth eating. Whatever its palatibility to humans, the mushroom serves as a habitat for <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="fungivore">mycophagous</a> insects such as the <a href="Muscidae">muscid fly</a> "<a href="Mydaea%20discimana">Mydaea discimana</a>" and the <a href="scuttle%20fly">scuttle fly</a> "<a href="Megaselia%20lutea">Megaselia lutea</a>".

"<a href="Suillus%20intermedius">Suillus intermedius</a>", found in northeastern and northern North America, is similar in appearance to "S. salmonicolor". It may be distinguished by a lighter-colored cap, cream to yellowish or pale ochraceous flesh, and a ring that is neither as thick nor as wide as "S. salmonicolor". It is also larger, with a cap diameter of up to , and its pore surface sometimes slowly stains reddish-brown when bruised. Although it has not been definitively established whether "<a href="Suillus%20cothurnatus">S. cothurnatus</a>" is a distinct species, several characteristics have been reported to differentiate it from "S. salmonicolor": a thinner, less rubbery veil that usually lacks a thickened cottony roll at the base; glandular dots on the stem that consist of bundles of <a href="septum">multiseptate</a> hyphae in a parallel arrangement ending in an even row of large, sterile cystidia (60–140 μm long) that resemble basidia; and small hyaline cystidia shaped like swollen bottles with narrowed bases. Other "Suillus" species with which "S. salmonicolor" might be confused include "<a href="Suillus%20acidus">S. acidus</a>" and "<a href="Suillus%20subalutaceus">S. subalutaceus</a>". Both of these species have a less well-developed partial veil, and their flesh is a duller tone lacking yellow-orange tints.

"Suillus salmonicolor" occurs in a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l association with various species of "<a href="pine">Pinus</a>". This is a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> relationship in which the subterranean fungal <a href="mycelium">mycelia</a> creates a protective sheath around the rootlets of the tree and a network of hyphae (the <a href="Hartig%20net">Hartig net</a>) that penetrates between the tree's epidermal and cortical cells. This association helps the plant absorb water and <a href="dietary%20mineral">mineral</a> nutrients; in exchange, the fungus receives a supply of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s produced by the plant's <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Two-, three-, and five-needled pines have all been recorded to associate with "S. salmonicolor". In North America, the fungus has been found growing with "<a href="Pinus%20banksiana">P. banksiana</a>", "<a href="Pinus%20palustris">P. palustris</a>", "<a href="Pinus%20resinosa">P. resinosa</a>", "<a href="Pinus%20rigida">P. rigida</a>", "<a href="Pinus%20strobus">P. strobus</a>" and "<a href="Pinus%20taeda">P. taeda</a>". In <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a> (in the Russian Far East) it has been found in association with "<a href="Pinus%20pumila">P. pumila</a>", in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> with "<a href="Pinus%20kesiya">P. kesiya</a>", and in southern India with "<a href="Pinus%20patula">P. patula</a>". The northern limit of its North American range is eastern Canada (<a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>), and the southern limit is <a href="Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n">Nuevo León</a> and near Nabogame in <a href="Tem%C3%B3sachi%20Municipality">Temósachi Municipality</a>, <a href="Chihuahua%20%28state%29">Chihuahua</a>, Mexico.

"Suillus salmonicolor" has been collected from the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> in the Caribbean, Japan, Taiwan, and from <a href="Mpumalanga">Mpumalanga</a>, South Africa. Because there are no native "Pinus" species in South Africa, the fungus is assumed to be an exotic species that has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> via <a href="pine%20plantation">pine plantation</a>s. It has also been introduced to Australia, where it is known from a single collection made in a plantation of <a href="Caribbean%20pine">Caribbean pine</a> ("Pinus caribaea") in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and has been found growing with Caribbean pine in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>. It is found in Hawaii under <a href="Slash%20Pine">Slash Pine</a> ("Pinus elliotii"), including lawns where those trees are used in <a href="landscaping">landscaping</a>. "S. salmonicolor" is one of several ectomycorrhizal species that have "traveled the thousands of kilometers from a mainland to Hawaii in the roots and soil of introduced seedlings."

Conservation of slow lorises

<a href="Slow%20loris">Slow loris</a>es are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="primate">primate</a>s in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Nycticebus" that live in the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s of <a href="South%20Asia">South</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. They are threatened by habitat loss and <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a> from <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, <a href="selective%20logging">selective logging</a>, and <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> agriculture, as well as by collection and hunting for the <a href="wildlife%20trade">wildlife trade</a>, including the <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a> trade, and for use in <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a> and as <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>. Because of these and other threats, all five species of slow loris are listed as either "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" or "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Their <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> was originally listed as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" in 2000 because of imprecise population surveys and the frequency in which these <a href="primate">primate</a>s were found in animal markets. Because of their rapidly declining populations and <a href="local%20extinction">local extinction</a>s, their status was updated and in 2007 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) elevated them to <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">Appendix I</a>, which prohibits international commercial trade. Local laws also protect slow lorises from hunting and trade, but enforcement is lacking in most areas.

Traditional beliefs regarding slow lorises have been part of the <a href="folklore">folklore</a> of Southeast Asia for at least several hundred years. Their remains are buried under houses and roads to bring good luck, and every part of their body is used in traditional medicine to make products ranging from love potions to unproven cures for <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a>, <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, and <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20diseases">sexually transmitted diseases</a>. The primary users of this traditional medicine are urban, middle-aged women who are reluctant to consider alternatives.

Despite being poor pets that are difficult to care for, with a dangerous toxic bite and a sleep cycle opposite to that of humans, a large number of slow lorises are traded as pets, both locally and internationally. Although it is illegal to import slow lorises for commercial sale, they are popular exotic pets in their native range, Japan and parts of Europe. This is mainly because of their "<a href="cuteness%23Juvenile%20traits%20and%20cuteness">cute</a>" appearance, popularized in highly viewed <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> videos, which is due in part to their large eyes, adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle. Hundreds of slow lorises have been confiscated at airports, but because they are easy to hide, these numbers are likely to be only a small fraction of the total number being <a href="Wildlife%20smuggling">trafficked</a>. Traders cut or pull the teeth of slow lorises to make them appear to be an appropriate pet for small children, but this practice often leads to extreme blood loss, infection, and death. Slow lorises lacking their teeth would be unable to fend for themselves and therefore are not <a href="Reintroduction">reintroduced</a> into the wild. Most captive lorises in the pet trade also receive improper care and die from poor nutrition, stress, or infection. Despite this, demand has risen, and slow lorises are no longer captured opportunistically, but are now hunted on a commercial scale using flashlights, from which the animals do not flee.

Connected <a href="protected%20areas">protected areas</a> are important for the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. <a href="Animal%20sanctuary">Sanctuaries</a> and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have grown too old to reproduce, although the <a href="pygmy%20slow%20loris">pygmy slow loris</a> is doing well at some facilities, such as the <a href="San%20Diego%20Zoo">San Diego Zoo</a>.

<a href="Slow%20loris">Slow loris</a>es (<a href="genus">genus</a> "Nycticebus") are primates that belong to the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">suborder</a> <a href="Strepsirrhini">Strepsirrhini</a>. They are found throughout <a href="South%20Asia">South</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and the surrounding islands, and live in the upper <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> of tropical <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s. They are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a>, sleeping during the day curled up in the fork of a tree. Slow lorises are slow and deliberate climbers and rarely come to the ground. They have a round face, woolly fur, a dark stripe down their back, and a tail that is reduced to a stump. Their head and body length ranges from . Their hands and feet are strong and good at grasping for long periods of time. Slow lorises are either solitary or live in pairs; the males are <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> and <a href="spraying%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mark their territories with urine</a>. Their diet consists of <a href="Mollusca">mollusk</a>s, small <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, and fruit.

Slow lorises can produce a <a href="secretion">secretion</a> on their brachial <a href="gland">gland</a> (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a>, noxious <a href="toxin">toxin</a> that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful swelling and is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an <a href="anaphylactic">anaphylactic</a> reaction is possible.

Five species are currently recognized. The <a href="Javan%20slow%20loris">Javan slow loris</a> ("N. javanicus") is native to the <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n island of <a href="Java">Java</a>, whereas the <a href="Bornean%20slow%20loris">Bornean slow loris</a> ("N. menagensis") can be found on <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> and nearby islands, including the <a href="Sulu%20Islands">Sulu Islands</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. The <a href="Sunda%20slow%20loris">Sunda slow loris</a> is found on the Indonesian island of <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> as well as <a href="Peninsular%20Malaysia">Peninsular Malaysia</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. The other two species are found entirely on the mainland, with the <a href="Bengal%20slow%20loris">Bengal slow loris</a> ("N. bengalensis") native to <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, southern <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Northeast%20India">Northeast India</a>, <a href="Laos">Laos</a>, <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, Thailand, and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and the <a href="pygmy%20slow%20loris">pygmy slow loris</a> ("N. pygmaeus") found in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southern China.

Slow lorises are threatened by <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> and the <a href="wildlife%20trade">wildlife trade</a>, which includes the <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a> trade, <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>, and <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>. Other threats includes road construction, <a href="selective%20logging">selective logging</a>, and <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> agriculture. <a href="Habitat%20fragmentation">Habitat fragmentation</a> obstructs <a href="biological%20dispersal">biological dispersal</a> for these species that rely on vines and <a href="liana">liana</a>s to move from tree to tree. Consequently, slow lorises are found dead on power lines or are victims of <a href="roadkill">roadkill</a> in areas where roads cut between forest patches.

All species are listed either as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" or "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Populations are rapidly declining, and their distribution is becoming patchy because of <a href="local%20extinction">local extinction</a>s throughout their range. Although all species are protected by law in every country in which they occur, conservation efforts are hindered by a lack of public awareness, since many local villagers and remoter buyers of captive specimens are unaware of their endangered status. Recognition and awareness of slow lorises is even low among <a href="national%20park">national park</a> staff. In places like Vietnam, where these nocturnal <a href="primate">primate</a>s have commonly been found, most local villagers were not familiar with them when shown photos. Only a few older hunters recognized them, but pointed out that they had not seen them in more than 10 or 15 years.

Traditionally, the slow lorises were thought to consist of very few species and were considered to be common across Southeast Asia. These assumptions were due to their <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal behavior</a> and their high frequency of occurrence in animal markets throughout the region. Furthermore, researchers from the 20th century and earlier perpetuated the notion that slow lorises were common by reporting them as either present or absent rather than noting low population densities in their field research. As a result, slow lorises were seldom studied, resulting in the initial "<a href="Least%20Concern">Lower Risk/least concern</a>" (LR/lc) <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> assessment on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> (version 2.3) in 2000. Even in the mid-2000s, population estimates were based only on small surveys.
In 2009, <a href="primatologist">primatologist</a> James Thorn used <a href="environmental%20niche%20modelling">environmental niche modelling</a> in Indonesia to supplement the poor population data gathered to date to predict the remaining available habitat for slow lorises on the islands of Sumatra, Java, and <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. These estimates indicated that the Javan slow loris was the most threatened by habitat loss, followed by the Sunda slow loris from Sumatra. The Bornean slow loris was in a better situation since much of its range consists of low-risk areas. Both the Bengal slow loris and pygmy slow loris are found in more than 20 protected areas, although their populations are either low or insufficiently recorded.

In Indonesia, logging and the clearing of land for agriculture have triggered large <a href="Wildfire">forest fires</a>, first in between 1982 and 1983 when burned in <a href="Kalimantan">Kalimantan</a>, and then again between 1997 and 1998 when burned in Kalimantan and Sumatra. These fires occurred within the native range of slow loris populations.

Although habitat loss has been significant throughout the range of the slow lorises, their decline is most closely associated with unsustainable trade, either for <a href="exotic%20pet">exotic pet</a>s or for <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>. Slow lorises are abundant at the markets and are among the most commonly sold <a href="primate">primate</a>s. Slow lorises are easy to catch because they do not leap from tree to tree, often freezing and covering their face when spotted. (For this reason, Indonesians call them "malu malu" or "shy one".) They are hunted not only by expert hunters, but are also easily caught by opportunist villagers because of the financial reward they bring at the markets.
Traditional beliefs and uses for slow lorises vary, and many practices appear to have deep roots going back at least 300 years. Oral traditions suggest these practices go back even further. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, it was reported that the people from the interior of the island of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for the heavens and that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.

In the <a href="Mondulkiri%20Province">Mondulkiri Province</a> of Cambodia, hunters believe that lorises can heal their own broken bones immediately after falling from a branch in order to climb back up the tree, and that slow lorises have medicinal powers because they require more than one hit with a stick to die. The hunters also believe that seeing a slow loris will bring bad luck on a hunting trip. In the province of <a href="North%20Sumatra">North Sumatra</a>, the slow loris is thought to bring good luck if it is buried under the foundation of a house. Similarly, villagers concerned about traffic safety might bury a slow loris under a road to prevent accidents. In Java, it is thought that putting a piece of its skull in a water jug would make a husband more docile and submissive, just like a slow loris in the daytime. Also, its body parts were used to place curses on enemies in North Sumatra. More recently, researchers have documented the belief that the consumption of loris meat was an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a> that improves "male power." The <a href="gall%20bladder">gall bladder</a> of the Bengal slow loris has historically been used to make ink for tattoos by the village elders in <a href="Pursat%20Province">Pursat</a> and <a href="Koh%20Kong%20Province">Koh Kong Province</a>s of Cambodia.

The trade in slow lorises, whether as pets or for medicine, is illegal because every nation in which they occur naturally has laws protecting them. Cambodia lists them as protected, with penalties of one month in prison and fines of to in 2010 for anyone who catches, hunts, poisons, or transports them. In Indonesia, the slow loris trade has been illegal since 1973, when the Agriculture Ministry passed Decree No. 66. This regulation was clarified in 1999 with Government Regulation No. 7 ("Protection of Wild Flora and Fauna") and Act No. 5 ("Biodiversity Conservation"). Violators are subject to five years in prison and a fine of 100 million <a href="Indonesian%20rupiah">rupiah</a> (~).

The <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) first listed the two known species of slow loris under <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20II">Appendix II</a> on 7 January 1975. All newly identified species were covered by Appendix II on 2 April 1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the CITES Secretariat is shown in the CITES trade database, where minimal trade by CITES Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">Appendix I</a>, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.

Before the CITES conference at which a vote would be taken on the proposal, support for the proposed change in status appeared to be limited because of the small amount of reported legal trade. In April 2007, the non-profit conservation group <a href="ProFauna%20Indonesia">ProFauna Indonesia</a> attracted news coverage with a demonstration held in <a href="Malang">Malang</a>, Java. The demonstration—an appeal for increased protection for slow lorises—involved organization members suspending themselves from bridges while holding banners that read ""Stop jual kukang"" ("Stop the slow loris trade") and ""Jangan beli kukang"" ("Don't buy slow lorises"). From early to mid-June, the 14th CITES Conference of the Parties (CITES COP-14) was held in <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a>, Netherlands. On 8 June, Cambodia presented the proposal along with their rationale. Indonesia followed by announcing their support, along with Japan, India, Laos, Thailand, the United States, the European Union, Qatar, and many <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a>s (NGOs). Although the proposal was adopted by consensus, some conservation groups objected on the grounds that rational analysis was being usurped by sentiment.

Despite the added protection of CITES Appendix I status, wild slow lorises still receive poor protection because enforcement of the international trade ban is difficult and the penalties are minor. Slow lorises are still found in large numbers at animal markets, most notably in Cambodia and Indonesia, but the traders show no concern for being caught. During a study by <a href="Anna%20Nekaris">Nekaris</a> "et al." published in 2010, vendors in <a href="Medan">Medan</a>, <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, and <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> spoke freely to researchers about how they obtain slow lorises, their uses in medicine, prices, and sales numbers. The markets were not concealed, but were open daily in a designated area in town. Even law enforcement is involved in the trade, with park rangers and police admitting to the purchase of slow lorises for medicinal purposes. The wife of another law enforcement official from the <a href="Mondulkiri%20Province">Mondulkiri Province</a> in Cambodia is one of the most notable sellers of slow loris parts.

Humans have been hunting mammals in Asia for at least 40,000 years, but until recently, slow lorises were only hunted at a <a href="Sustainability">sustainable</a> level. However, hunting pressure since the 1960s has become increasingly unsustainable, leading to <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a>, because of growing demand, decreased supply, and the subsequent increased value of the marketed wildlife. In 1985, large wildlife markets began to appear in <a href="Phnom%20Penh">Phnom Penh</a> and <a href="Senmonorom">Sen Monorom</a>, Cambodia, followed quickly by the development of networks of hunters, traders, and middlemen. Bright flashlights make spotting slow lorises much easier at night because of their <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">eye shine</a>, and in the 1990s, large-scale commercial harvesting of slow lorises began as improved batteries for spotlights became available.

The drive to capture wildlife, and particularly slow lorises, is increasingly dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In the case of long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable because they tend to freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.

Opportunistic hunting of lorises has been a traditional practice, for example, when a tree in which the primate is living is cut down. When forests are cleared to create <a href="oil%20palm">oil palm</a> ("Elaeis guineensis") plantations or for housing, the lorises are collected from the trees and then sold to the "loris man", who in turn sells them in the cities. Timber merchants in <a href="Kalimantan">Kalimantan</a> and <a href="Aceh">Aceh</a> also sell slow lorises to traders, and since the primates cling to branches instead of fleeing, they are often transported hundreds of miles on the original tree branches to which they clung.
Demand from middlemen and specialized animal trade mafias has increased the profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned to death with a stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a V-shaped stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.

Middlemen buy as many as 30 slow lorises from rural hunters over a wide area, and then sell them in the major city markets for 300,000 to 500,000 rupiahs ( to ) each. Western tourists and <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a>s pay as much as 1,000,000 rupiahs (). Traders have reported to researchers that they have difficulty keeping pace with demand, and one trader claimed to have sold nearly 1,200 pygmy slow lorises during 2001–2002. Hundreds of slow lorises are sold domestically each year in Indonesian at open-air animal markets (or "bird markets"), as well as in shopping malls. Slow lorises are the most commonly sold protected primate at these markets. Live trade is the most common, with only 13.6% of slow lorises traded for parts. In Phnom Penh, Cambodia during the 1990s, observers counted up to 204 slow lorises for sale at a single store; in 2007 a market in Mondulkiri Province displayed 30 dried specimens. A total of 234 slow lorises were confiscated by the Forestry Administration-Wildlife Alliance between 2002 and 2006. In Indonesia, nearly 6,000 to 7,000 slow lorises were traded domestically each year from 2000 to 2006. For international trade, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand were the biggest exporters, with exports having declined for all species except the pygmy slow loris from 1998 to 2007 (compared to 1978–1997).

Slow lorises are commonly used in traditional medicine across their geographic range, a practice that has been reported since at least 1900. Thousands of slow lorises are captured each year for such use. Many human factors drive the trade in slow loris parts, including social customs, economic factors, and traditional belief systems.

In Cambodia, the deeply rooted tradition of using the Bengal and pygmy slow lorises in traditional medicine is widespread, and the pygmy slow loris is the most commonly requested animal in traditional medicine shops in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh. Some people in the country believe dried slow loris can cure cancer. Slow lorises are also smoked for other traditional remedies. Traditional <a href="Khmer%20medicine">Khmer medicine</a> practitioners in that region claim that medicines made from slow lorises can cure 100 diseases, with some practitioners from the National Centre for Traditional Medicine reporting that slow loris are sometimes roasted alive under the assumption that this increases the medicine's potency. Slow lorises are also burned alive, causing their eyes to burst and release a liquid called "minyak kukang" (or loris oil), which is used in <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a> and traditional medicine and is supposed to have life-giving qualities and act as a love potion.

In the case of the Bengal slow loris, every part—including the brain, urine, and skin—is used in traditional medicine in order to heal wounds and <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>. With the Sunda slow loris, people trade the skin, feet, skeletons, and skulls. The fur is reported to heal wounds, the flesh to cure <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, eyes are used in love potions, and the meat is reported to cure <a href="asthma">asthma</a> and stomach problems. The pygmy slow loris is primarily valued for the medicinal use of its hair, but it is also used to make "bone glue of monkey", a medicine used mostly by local people, but sometimes sold to visitors. In general, wearing slow loris bones is considered good luck and the meat is sometimes thought to cure <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a>.

The main buyers of medicine made from slow lorises are middle- to upper-class women between the ages of 25 and 45 who primarily use loris rice wine tonic to alleviate the pain of childbirth. One bottle of wine is made by mixing <a href="rice%20wine">rice wine</a> with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20disease">sexually transmitted disease</a>s. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris "et al". (2010) showed that these belief systems were so strong that the majority of respondents expressed reluctance to consider alternatives to loris-based medicines.

In 1993, 200 dead slow lorises were found cut open and stretched out on sticks in the markets of Phnom Penh. In another shop, 150 dead slow lorises were found in two boxes. This suggests hunting on a commercial scale, which has had dramatic effects on local populations. At the time, these dried slow lorises were sold for . However, the prices doubled between 1997 and 2007 and continue to rise. Most vendors (80%) surveyed in 2010 attributed the price increases to a decline in loris numbers and increased enforcement.

Slow lorises are sold locally at street markets, but are also sold internationally over the Internet and in pet stores. They are especially popular or trendy in Japan, particularly among women. The reasons for their popularity, according to the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society (JWCS), are that "they're easy to keep, they don't cry, they're small, and just very cute." Along with the <a href="common%20squirrel%20monkey">common squirrel monkey</a> ("Saimiri sciureus"), slow lorises are the most popular primate pets in Japan. Pet shops frequently advertise them, even on their websites, with prices ranging between and more than , or . Despite these frequent advertisements, the <a href="World%20Conservation%20Monitoring%20Centre">World Conservation Monitoring Centre</a> (WCMC) reported only a few dozen slow lorises were imported in 2006, suggesting frequent <a href="Wildlife%20smuggling">smuggling</a>. Slow lorises are also smuggled to China, Taiwan, Europe, and Saudi Arabia for use as pets. Smuggling and trade in Poland and Russia are also common according to Nekaris.

Because of their "cuteness", <a href="viral%20video">viral video</a>s of pet slow lorises are some of the mostly frequently watched animal videos on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. In March 2011, a newly posted video of a slow loris holding a cocktail umbrella had been viewed more than two million times, while an older video of a slow loris being tickled had been viewed more than six million times. At the time, most viewers did not realize that the slow loris pet trade is illegal or that the docile behavior of the animals in the videos is a passive defensive reaction for dealing with stress. For instance, according to Nekaris, the slow loris with the umbrella—who was suffering from a head wound—was disoriented in the video by the bright lights and was grasping the umbrella like it would a piece of bamboo from its native habitat. Nekaris requested that YouTube remove the videos, but the UK-based newspaper, "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", reported that YouTube declined to comment on the slow loris videos. While YouTube currently has means for viewers to flag videos involving animal cruelty, pornography, and illegal weapons or drugs, it has no means for flagging videos involving illegally trafficked animals. The 'tickling slow loris' video was eventually removed in February 2012, after having received over 9 million views and generating over 12 thousand comments (although copies of it were later reposted). During the lifetime of the video two significant slow loris conservation-associated events occurred, the March 2011 posting of this Wikipedia article and the January 2012 airing of a BBC television production entitled "Jungle Gremlins of Java"; both events were associated with a spike in viewership of the video, and were often mentioned in the comments made during those periods (3.2% and 13.3%, respectively). Celebrity endorsements stimulated viewing of the video without providing any increase in conservation awareness. Over time, the proportion of comments indicating a desire to have a slow loris as a pet remained high but trended downward, while the proportion of comments indicating awareness of slow loris's legal and conservation status increased after the conservation-related events but did not follow a long term trend. The removal of the video followed shortly after the airing of the BBC documentary, which dramatized the exploitation of slow lorises for the pet trade. In 2015 Nekaris published that slow lorises were also used as a promotional photo-ops in bars and beaches frequented by tourists. This new use for the illegally acquired animal stems from the newfound popularity that emerged from the widely shared Youtube videos and television programs. 
Within their countries of origin, slow lorises are very popular exotic pets. Indonesian species are mostly sold as pets, despite myths about their magical and curative properties. They are seen as a "living toy" for children by local people or are bought out of pity (to save the animals) by Western tourists or expatriates. Neither local nor foreign buyers usually know anything about these primates, their endangered status, or that the trade is illegal. During the late 2000s, Sunda slow lorises were regularly sold throughout the Medan bird market in North Sumatra. According to 59 monthly surveys and interviews with local traders, nearly a thousand locally sourced slow lorises exchanged hands in the market. During the surveys, between 15 and 45 slow lorises were seen around the market.

International trade usually results in a high mortality rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems as a result of both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes <a href="Shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a> or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.

As part of the trade, infants are pulled prematurely from their parents, leaving them unable to remove their own urine, feces, and oily skin secretions from their fur. Slow lorises have a special network of blood vessels in their hands and feet, which makes them vulnerable to cuts when pulled from the wire cages they are kept in. Slow lorises are also very stress-sensitive and do not do well in captivity. Infection, stress, pneumonia, and poor nutrition lead to high death rates among pet lorises. The diets of wild slow lorises are poorly understood. Signs of an inappropriate diet in captivity include tooth decay, diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure. Pet owners also fail to provide proper care because they are often sleeping when the nocturnal pet is normally awake.

One of the first cases of slow loris smuggling was documented by the <a href="International%20Primate%20Protection%20League">International Primate Protection League</a> (IPPL) in November 1974. The <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Game">California Department of Fish and Game</a> in San Francisco found 15 slow lorises in a bag labeled "<a href="spitting%20cobra">spitting cobra</a>s" in a shipment from Thailand that also contained snakes, tortoises, and otters. Because of mistakes and inconsistencies in the order, it was unclear whether the receiving wildlife company was a target of a hoax or whether it had attempted to conceal the shipment.

Since the late 1990s, both high demand and resulting high prices have fueled increased smuggling of slow lorises to Japan. Although pet shop employees declare that their slow lorises are captive-bred, the advertisements on the pet store websites indicate that their stocks come from Java, Sumatra, or China. New arrivals to the stores are also variable in size and age, which has further led the JWCS to suspect the slow lorises are imported illegally. Official, legal trade of slow lorises prior to CITES Appendix I coverage (from 1998 to 2006) was limited to just ten Sunda slow lorises from Malaysia and Myanmar. A review of 24 surveys covering wildlife trade between 1990 and 2006 demonstrated 228 slow lorises were known to have been traded unofficially each year and had come from Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Laos. The major trade hubs were Jakarta, Medan, Singapore and Bangkok. Numerous illegal trade routes for each species were also documented prior to the 2007 CITES vote over Appendix I coverage in the "Notification to Parties" publication.
A report in 2010 by Nekaris "et al". reported that Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand were the primary exporters of slow lorises, with Singapore and Malaysia also involved. China and Indonesia were also known for international trade, although their local trade was more significant. Slow loris parts were typically exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400 illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).

In Japan alone, 39 confiscations including 363 live animals were made between 1998 and 2006, with 2006 being the peak year. During the same time period, Thai, Indonesian, and Singaporean officials discovered 358 lorises destined for Japan. Details of several confiscations from smuggling attempts between Thailand and Japan have been reported by the IPPL, including one event on 2 May 2007, where 40 slow lorises were confiscated at <a href="Narita%20Airport">Narita Airport</a> only a month before the CITES conference that elevated the slow loris status to Appendix I. Twelve of those animals died. The deaths are not unusual, with a mortality rate of 76% for all species of confiscated slow lorises, many dying before they are transferred to zoos. The JWCS suspects that the high mortality rate among smuggled slow lorises causes traders to smuggle more slow lorises than are needed to supply the market.

In Japan, enforcement is not considered very strict since only 23% of smugglers (9 out of 39 cases) were officially charged between 1998 and 2006. Instead, most only received fines. Based on reports taken from <a href="Kyodo%20News">Kyodo News</a>, the JWCS concluded that the primary concern of Customs officials was the prevention of infectious diseases, such as <a href="Ebola">Ebola</a>. Slow lorises are sometimes mixed in with other trade-restricted species, such as reptiles, and since confiscations target high-profile species, it is likely that the international smuggling numbers are "just the tip of the iceberg." Making detection even more difficult, slow lorises can easily be hidden in suitcases since they tend to instinctively curl up and remain quiet when startled.

Surveys are needed to determine existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas is important for slow lorises because they are not adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. For successful <a href="reintroduction">reintroduction</a>s, connectivity between sites with low <a href="population%20density">population density</a> is considered ideal. Protected area extensions are also needed in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.

Despite being included in CITES Appendix I protection and covered by local conservation laws, slow lorises are still threatened by both local and international trade because of problems with enforcement. The continued illegal trade in wildlife has seriously jeopardized both the success and the future of a investment program by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> for East and Southeast Asia biodiversity. In 2008, training workshops for enforcement officials and rescue center personnel were held in Singapore to help teach slow loris identification, conservation status, and <a href="Animal%20husbandry">husbandry</a>. Surveys prior to the training showed 87% of the trainees could not identify slow loris species, but the one-day workshops had a significant impact.

Rehabilitation is available to some confiscated slow lorises. Organizations such as the <a href="International%20Animal%20Rescue">International Animal Rescue</a> (IAR) run <a href="animal%20sanctuary">sanctuaries</a> that offer lifelong care to slow lorises that have had their teeth removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises as if they were from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> and conservation.

Populations of slow loris species, such as the Bengal and Sunda slow loris, are not faring well in zoos. In 2011, the <a href="International%20Species%20Information%20System">International Species Information System</a> (ISIS) had only 11 and 53 specimens (respectively) on file from reporting zoos worldwide. In North American zoos, for instance, several of the 29 captive specimens in 2008 were <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> that could not breed while most were past their reproductive years, and the last captive birth was in 2001 at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Zoo">San Diego Zoo</a>. Only three Javan slow lorises were kept in zoos in 2011 according to ISIS. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better, with 100 specimens reported from zoos worldwide in 2011. In North American zoos, for instance, the population has grown to 74 animals between the time they were imported in the late 1980s and 2008, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.

The San Diego Zoo has also written husbandry manuals for slow lorises, promoted public awareness, conducted field surveys, and supported slow loris rescue facilities. The Vietnamese postal service recognized slow lorises on a postage stamp by using a picture of a Bengal slow loris and her infant published by the San Diego Zoo in February 1999.

Air-tractor sledge

Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a converted <a href="fixed-wing%20aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> taken on the 1911–14 <a href="Australasian%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a>, the first plane to be taken to the <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a>. Expedition leader <a href="Douglas%20Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a> had planned to use the <a href="Vickers%20R.E.P.%20Type%20Monoplane">Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane</a> as a reconnaissance and <a href="search%20and%20rescue">search and rescue</a> tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer <a href="Frank%20Bickerton">Frank Bickerton</a> spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a <a href="sledge">sledge</a>, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a>. It was first tested on 15 November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.

Towing a train of four sledges, the air-tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at <a href="Cape%20Denison">Cape Denison</a>. The freezing conditions resulted in the jamming of the engine's pistons after just , and the air-tractor was left behind. Some time later it was dragged back to Cape Denison, and its frame was left on the ice when the expedition returned home in 1913. In 2008 a team from the <a href="Mawson%27s%20Huts">Mawson's Huts Foundation</a> began searching for the remains of the air-tractor sledge; a seat was found in 2009, and fragments of the tail assembly a year later.

The Mawson's Huts Foundation has undertaken extensive investigation using sophisticated equipment in 2009 and 2010. Results indicate that the air tractor, or parts of it, is still buried under 3m of ice where it was abandoned at Cape Denison.

<a href="Douglas%20Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a> had accompanied <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>'s 1907–09 <a href="Nimrod%20Expedition">British Antarctic Expedition</a>. Along with <a href="Edgeworth%20David">Edgeworth David</a> and <a href="Alistair%20Mackay">Alistair Mackay</a>, he had been part of a <a href="Manhauling">man-hauled</a> sledging expedition, the first to reach the area of the <a href="South%20Magnetic%20Pole">South Magnetic Pole</a>. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a>. Despite an offer from <a href="Robert%20Falcon%20Scott">Robert Falcon Scott</a> to join his <a href="Terra%20Nova%20Expedition">Terra Nova Expedition</a> to reach the <a href="South%20Pole">Geographic South Pole</a>, Mawson began planning his own Antarctic expedition. Mawson's plan, which led to the <a href="Australasian%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a>, envisaged three bases on the Antarctic continent, collectively surveying much of the coast directly south of Australia. He approached Shackleton, who not only approved of his plan but was prepared to lead the expedition himself. Although Shackleton withdrew from the expedition in December 1910, he continued to assist Mawson with publicity and fund-raising.

Mawson travelled to Britain in early 1911 to raise funds, hire crew, and purchase equipment. He considered taking a <a href="aeroplane">plane</a> to the Antarctic, which could work as a reconnaissance tool, transport cargo, and assist with search and rescue. Crucially, as no plane had yet been taken to the continent, it could also be used to generate publicity. Unsure of the type of plane he should take, but considering a <a href="Bl%C3%A9riot%20A%C3%A9ronautique">Blériot</a>, Mawson mentioned his plans to Scott's wife <a href="Kathleen%20Scott">Kathleen Scott</a>, an aircraft enthusiast. She recommended he take a <a href="monoplane">monoplane</a>, and conveyed his interest to Lieutenant <a href="Hugh%20Evelyn%20Watkins">Hugh Evelyn Watkins</a> of the <a href="Essex%20Regiment">Essex Regiment</a>. Watkins had connections with the ship and aircraft manufacturer <a href="Vickers%20Limited">Vickers Limited</a>, which had recently entered into a licence agreement to build and sell aircraft in Britain designed by the Frenchman <a href="Robert%20Esnault-Pelterie">Robert Esnault-Pelterie</a>. In a letter to Mawson on 18 May, Kathleen wrote:

On Kathleen Scott's advice, Mawson purchased a <a href="Vickers%20R.E.P.%20Type%20Monoplane">Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane</a>, one of only eight built. It was fitted with a five-cylinder R.E.P. engine developing , and had a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . Its wingspan was , and its length . The pilot used a <a href="joystick">joystick</a> for pitch and roll, with lateral control by <a href="wing%20warping">wing warping</a>. Mawson opted for a two-seater version, in a tandem arrangement, with a spare ski undercarriage. The total bill, dated 17 August 1911, came to <a href="%C2%A3sd">£</a>955 4s 8d. Mawson hired Watkins to fly the plane, and <a href="Frank%20Bickerton">Frank Bickerton</a> to accompany as engineer. After Vickers tested the aircraft at <a href="Dartford">Dartford</a> and <a href="Brooklands">Brooklands</a>, <a href="Peninsular%20and%20Oriental%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">P&O</a> shipped the plane to Adelaide aboard the <a href="steamship">steamship</a> "Macedonia", at half the usual rate of freight.

A series of public demonstrations were planned in Australia to assist in fund-raising, the first of which was scheduled for 5 October 1911 at the <a href="Cheltenham%20Park%20Racecourse">Cheltenham Racecourse</a> in Adelaide. During a test flight the day before, excessive pressure in the <a href="fuel%20tank">fuel tank</a> caused it to rupture, almost blinding Watkins. That problem resolved, Watkins took <a href="Frank%20Wild">Frank Wild</a>, whom Mawson had hired to command a support base during the expedition, on another test flight the morning of the demonstration. In Watkins' account, which he addressed to Vickers' Aviation Department, he wrote: "[we were] about 200 ft. up. I got into a fierce tremor, and then into an air pocket, and was brought down about 100 ft., got straight, and dropped into another, almost a vacuum. That finished it. We hit the ground with an awful crash, both wings damaged, one cylinder broken, and the Nose bent up, the tail in half, etc."

Although the two men were only slightly injured, the plane was damaged beyond repair. Mawson decided to salvage the plane by converting it into a motorised <a href="sledge">sledge</a>. He fitted the skis, and removed the wings and most of the sheathing to save weight. In his official account of the expedition, "The Home of the Blizzard", Mawson wrote that the advantages of this "air-tractor sledge" were expected to be "speed, steering control, and comparative safety from <a href="crevasse">crevasse</a>s owing to the great length of the runners". No longer needing a pilot, and believing him to be responsible for the crash, Mawson dismissed Watkins.

The air-tractor sledge was taken to Hobart, where the expedition ship <a href="SY%20Aurora">SY "Aurora"</a> was being loaded. It was secured on board in a crate lined with <a href="tin">tin</a>, which weighed far more than the sledge itself, on top of the ship's <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> and two boat-skids. To fuel the sledge, along with the <a href="Launch%20%28boat%29">motor launch</a> and the <a href="wireless">wireless</a> equipment, the "Aurora" also carried of <a href="Petroleum%20ether">benzine</a> and of <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>. Fully loaded, the ship left Hobart on 2 December 1911.

The "Aurora" reached the Antarctic mainland on 8 January 1912, after a two-week stop on <a href="Macquarie%20Island">Macquarie Island</a> to establish a wireless relay station and research base. The expedition's main base was established in <a href="Ad%C3%A9lie%20Land">Adélie Land</a>, at <a href="Cape%20Denison">Cape Denison</a> in <a href="Commonwealth%20Bay">Commonwealth Bay</a>. While the "Aurora" was unloading, a violent <a href="Whirlwind%20%28atmospheric%20phenomenon%29">whirlwind</a> lifted the lid off the air-tractor's crate, throwing it . The main hut was erected immediately, but the strong winds meant that work on the air-tractor's hangar was delayed until March. When the winds abated, a by hangar was constructed next to the main hut, from empty packing cases.

Bickerton began work on the air-tractor sledge on 14 April 1912. His first job was to repair the sledge, which had been damaged in transit when a violent storm hit the "Aurora". A giant wave had slammed into the crate containing the sledge, driving the fuselage through its side. With the repair completed, Bickerton began the serious work of converting the plane into a sledge. He constructed brakes from a pair of geological drills, and a steering system from the landing gear. Bickerton painted the engine and fuel tank black to absorb heat better and protect them from freezing. By June he had the engine running properly, and during a lull in the winds in early September he fitted the skis. Finally, he raised the fuselage off the ground to allow the propeller free movement.

On 27 October 1912, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying the coast and interior of Adélie Land and neighbouring <a href="King%20George%20V%20Land">King George V Land</a>. They were required to return to the base by 15 January, when the "Aurora" was due to depart; any later, it was feared, and she would be trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast to the west of the hut. Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds. Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave—a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison. The air-tractor reached a speed of , covering the , expedition member <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Laseron">Charles Laseron</a> recorded, "in great style". Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.

The Western party left Cape Denison on 3 December 1912. Accompanying Bickerton and the air-tractor were cartographer <a href="Alfred%20Hodgeman">Alfred Hodgeman</a> and surgeon <a href="Leslie%20Whetter">Leslie Whetter</a>. The air-tractor made slow progress hauling its train of sledges, and about out from the base its engine began experiencing difficulty. Bickerton shut it down and the three set up camp. At 4 am the next morning the party set off again, but the engine continued to struggle; oil ejected from an idle cylinder and the cylinder's lack of compression led Bickerton to suspect broken <a href="piston%20ring">piston ring</a>s to be the root of the problem. This would take only a matter of hours to fix. As he later recorded, "These thoughts were brought to a sudden close by the engine, without any warning, pulling up with such a jerk that the propeller was smashed. On moving the latter, something fell into the oil in the crank-case and fizzled, while the propeller could only be swung through an angle of about 30 [degrees]."

The party continued without the air-tractor, man-hauling the sledges to a point west of Cape Denison, and returned to base on 18 January 1913. Mawson's <a href="Far%20Eastern%20Party">Far Eastern Party</a> failed to return, and six men, including Bickerton, remained for an extra winter. On 8 February, just hours after "Aurora" left Commonwealth Bay after waiting for three weeks, Mawson staggered alone into base, his colleagues <a href="Belgrave%20Edward%20Sutton%20Ninnis">Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis</a> and <a href="Xavier%20Mertz">Xavier Mertz</a> dead. As Mawson was being nursed back to health, Bickerton dragged the air-tractor sledge back to base to diagnose the reason for its failure. He found that the freezing conditions had caused the <a href="Motor%20oil">engine oil</a> to congeal, jamming the pistons. He abandoned the sledge at Boat Harbour, next to the base. When "Aurora" returned to Cape Denison for the final time on 13 December 1913, only the engine and propeller were taken back to Australia.

The bill for the plane remained unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director <a href="Trevor%20Dawson">Sir Trevor Dawson</a> in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 <a href="Shackleton%E2%80%93Rowett%20Expedition">"Quest" Expedition</a>, but the <a href="Avro%20Baby">Avro Baby</a> remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16 November 1928—when <a href="Hubert%20Wilkins">Hubert Wilkins</a> and <a href="Carl%20Ben%20Eielson">Carl Ben Eielson</a> flew for 20 minutes around <a href="Deception%20Island">Deception Island</a>, just over a year before Admiral <a href="Richard%20Evelyn%20Byrd">Richard Evelyn Byrd</a>'s first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.

The frame of the air-tractor sledge remained on the ice at Boat Harbour where Bickerton had left it. The last expedition to Cape Denison to see the frame was in 1976; the next expedition, in 1981, could find no trace of it. The ice in that location does not move, and the implication is that the frame sank through the ice. It is therefore possible the frame is still there.

In 2007-8 a team from the <a href="Mawson%27s%20Huts">Mawson's Huts Foundation</a> began to search for the remnants of the plane. Using photographs from 1913, 1931 and 1976 it was possible to derive transits between the frame and distant objects which located the frame to a small area of ice about 50 m from the hut. Comparison with a 1931 photograph by Frank Hurley confirmed this location.

The following summer (2008–9), the team extensively surveyed the area where they believed the air-tractor to be, using <a href="ground-penetrating%20radar">ground-penetrating radar</a>. A 3 metre deep trench was dug in a promising area, but nothing was found except fragments of seaweed indicating the overlying ice must have melted sometime in the past. Temperature records from the nearby <a href="Dumont%20d%27Urville%20Station">Dumont d'Urville Station</a> showed that there had been extended periods (each of about six weeks) of above average temperatures in 1976 and 1981, suggesting the ice around the harbour could have melted. Dr Chris Henderson, the leader of the team, believes "the frame sank in situ to the rock surface, three metres below the present ice surface".

Next year (the 2009–10 season) further search was undertaken using <a href="differential%20GPS">differential GPS</a>, <a href="bathymetry">bathymetry</a> equipment, ice <a href="auger%28drill%29">auger</a>s, a magnetometer and a metal detector (whose sensor was placed down the ice auger holes after drilling). The ice showed signs of having extensively melted in the past, was about 3 metres thick and covering smooth rock which extended Northwards to become the harbour bottom. Visual examination of the harbour bottom during the bathymetry survey did not reveal any fragments of the frame in the first 30 metres of the harbour.

The most significant findings from the ice survey were a positive reading from the metal detector, coupled with a significant echo from the Ground Penetrating Radar, both from the small area where the frame is assumed to have sunk.

Parts of the Air Tractor are already known to exist: The Australian Antarctic Division has one wheel from the frame, and its ice-rudder – both of which were found in the harbour. In January 2009 the remains of a seat from the air-tractor were found in rocks near the hut, about from where the team believes the frame to be buried.<ref name="ABC 21/1/2009"></ref> On 1 January 2010, a day of unusually low tide, 4 small capping pieces from the end section of the tail were found by the edge of the harbour. The tail and a section of fuselage had been removed from the rest of the air-tractor before it was abandoned in 1913, therefore this discovery did not shed much light on the location of the rest of the frame, but it suggests that "the frame, or parts of it, can survive for nearly 100 years in this environment".

The team returned to Cape Denison over the 2010–11 summer, but the crash of a French helicopter near Dumont d'Urville Station in October 2010 forced deployment of a much reduced team with no resources to continue the search.<ref name="ABC 5/1/2011"></ref>

The findings to date (2011) suggest that metal object(s) exist at a depth of 3 metres, on rock, in the location where the frame was last known to have been seen in 1976. This is likely to be the remains of Mawson's Air Tractor, but confirmation awaits a future opportunity.

Pain fitzJohn

Pain fitzJohn (before 1100–10 July 1137) was an <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> nobleman and administrator, one of King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>'s "<a href="List%20of%20Henry%20I%27s%20new%20men">new men</a>", who owed their positions and wealth to the king.

Pain's family originated in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Normandy</a>, but there is little to suggest that he had many ties there, and he appears to have spent most of his career in England and the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>. A son of a minor nobleman, he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry's reign. In 1115, he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress, thereby gaining control of the town of <a href="Ludlow">Ludlow</a> and <a href="Ludlow%20Castle">its castle</a>, which he augmented with further acquisitions.

Although later medieval traditions described Pain as a <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a> to King Henry, that position is not securely confirmed in contemporary records. He did hold other offices, however, including that of <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a> in two counties near the border between England and Wales. In his capacity as a <a href="judge">royal justice</a>, Pain also heard legal cases for the king throughout much of western England.

After King Henry's death in 1135, Pain supported Henry's nephew, King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a>, and was with the new king throughout 1136. In July 1137, Pain was ambushed by the <a href="Wales%20in%20the%20High%20Middle%20Ages">Welsh</a> and killed while leading a relief expedition to the garrison at <a href="Carmarthen">Carmarthen</a>. His heirs were his daughters, Cecily and Agnes. Cecily married the son of one of Pain's close associates, <a href="Miles%20of%20Gloucester">Miles of Gloucester</a>. Pain was generous in his gifts of land to a number of monastic houses.

Pain was a son, probably the eldest, of John fitzRichard, a <a href="tenant-in-chief">tenant-in-chief</a> listed in "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>". John may have had two wives, therefore the identity of Pain's mother is uncertain. On the basis of landholding, it has been speculated that Pain's mother was a daughter of <a href="Ranulph%20de%20Mortimer">Ralph Mortimer</a>, who held <a href="Wigmore%2C%20Herefordshire">Wigmore</a> in "Domesday Book". As well as being a <a href="moneyer">moneyer</a>, Pain's paternal grandfather, who came from near <a href="Avranches">Avranches</a> in Normandy, owned a mill. Pain's brother, <a href="Eustace%20fitz%20John">Eustace fitzJohn</a>, became a royal official who owned lands in the north of England. His other siblings included William, Alice and Agnes. William was probably the same William who later held <a href="East%20Harptree">Harptree</a> in Somerset, and in 1130 was a royal justice in western England. Alice was the abbess of <a href="Barking%20Abbey">Barking Abbey</a> and Agnes became the wife of <a href="Roger%20de%20Valognes">Roger de Valognes</a>.

Pain was born some time before 1100. His father may have been in the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king. The family lands in England, which were not extensive, were mainly in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, and Pain appears to have inherited most of them; his payment for <a href="danegeld">danegeld</a>, a tax, in 1130 for his East Anglian properties was 40 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s, compared to only 9 shillings for his brother Eustace.

All accounts agree that Pain married in 1115 and that his wife was named <a href="Sybil%20%28wife%20of%20Pain%20fitzJohn%29">Sybil</a>, although the identity of Sybil's parents is unclear. Pain's "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>" entry states that he married Sybil Talbot, the niece of <a href="Hugh%20de%20Lacy%20%28before%201040-1085%29">Hugh de Lacy</a>. The "<a href="Complete%20Peerage">Complete Peerage</a>" states that he married Sybil, the daughter of <a href="Geoffrey%20Talbot%20%28died%201129%29">Geoffrey Talbot</a> and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was herself probably the daughter of <a href="Walter%20de%20Lacy%20%28died%201085%29">Walter de Lacy</a>. The historian <a href="Katharine%20Keats-Rohan">K. S. B. Keats-Rohan</a> states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy, the daughter of Hugh de Lacy, a view shared by fellow historians <a href="Judith%20Green%20%28historian%29">Judith Green</a> and Paul Dalton. Others such as Bruce Coplestone-Crow and <a href="David%20Crouch%20%28historian%29">David Crouch</a> agree with the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography"s designation of Sybil as Hugh's niece, and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes, the sister of Hugh de Lacy.

King Henry and King Stephen recognised Pain as the legitimate holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil. Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy was the son of <a href="Roger%20de%20Lacy">Roger de Lacy</a>, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow.
Pain is the presumed builder of <a href="Painscastle">Pain's Castle</a> in the Welsh county of <a href="Radnorshire">Radnor</a>. He also controlled <a href="Caus%20Castle">Caus Castle</a> in Shropshire, and through his wife <a href="Ludlow%20Castle">Ludlow Castle</a> in the same county. Although he held the title to <a href="Weobley%20Castle%2C%20England">Weobley Castle</a>, he does not appear to have exercised any control over it, which eventually went to <a href="Gilbert%20de%20Lacy">Gilbert de Lacy</a>. Pain was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to <a href="Jocelin%20de%20Dinan">Jocelin de Dinan</a> and some to Miles of Gloucester. Pain's share included property in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow, adding to the manors he held there through his wife; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 <a href="knight%27s%20fee">knights fees</a>. By 1130 he had evidently acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire, where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year.

Pain was too young to serve King <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William Rufus</a>, but according to the later 12th-century writings of <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a> he may have been a <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a>—one of the officials in charge of the royal household—for William's brother, King Henry I (reigned 1100–1135). There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely, given Map's story, that Pain was involved with Henry's financial affairs; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain, he was a <a href="servant">body servant</a>. Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night, providing Henry with wine if the king called for it. The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap. Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king's pleasure. Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details, it suggests that Pain's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental. Other evidence against Map's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office.

The author of the "<a href="Gesta%20Stephani">Gesta Stephani</a>" described Pain as having been a <a href="page%20%28occupation%29">page</a> at Henry's court, stating that he owed his position to being one of the "special and very intimate friends of King Henry" and that although Pain had been "taken into [Henry's] service as [one of his] court pages", it appears likely that the three fitzJohn brothers—Pain, Eustace and William—worked to advance each other's careers, as they are frequently found witnessing, or attesting, the same charters and other royal documents.

In 1115, Pain was a witness to a <a href="charter">charter</a> of confirmation that King Henry issued to <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Clive">Geoffrey de Clive</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, issued in the Welsh Marches. Sometime between 1123 and 1127 he was appointed <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Herefordshire">Sheriff of Herefordshire</a>, and in 1127 became <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Shropshire">Sheriff of Shropshire</a> also. He held the sheriffdoms of Hereford and Shropshire at least until 1136, and probably until his death. Pain is also often termed the king's "viceregent" or "justiciar" for those counties, and he had the custody of King Henry's prisoner, <a href="Waleran%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Waleran of Melun</a>, from September 1126 until late 1126, when Waleran was moved to <a href="Wallingford%20Castle">Wallingford Castle</a> and the custody of <a href="Brien%20FitzCount">Brian fitzCount</a>.

Pain was one of Henry's "new men", who owed their positions and wealth to the king. The medieval writer <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> described them as a group as "of base stock who had served him [Henry] well, raised them, so to say, from the dust" and that the king "stationed them above earls and famous <a href="castellan">castellan</a>s". Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status, this was probably an exaggeration on the chronicler's part. Pain's family was respectable enough, as his father held a number of properties directly from the king. It appears that Pain did not always take the king's side; the historian <a href="C.%20Warren%20Hollister">C. Warren Hollister</a> has argued that Pain was not among the supporters of Henry's only surviving legitimate child, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, in 1126, when Henry had his nobility swear that they would recognise her as his heiress. Hollister feels that the removal of Waleran from Pain's custody was a sign that Pain had not supported Matilda.

Pain consolidated much of his power in Shropshire and Herefordshire at <a href="Bridgnorth%20Castle">Bridgnorth Castle</a>, often using that site as a place of business in preference to Shrewsbury, which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff. As well as Waleran, Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128, <a href="Llywelyn%20ab%20Owain">Llywelyn ab Owain</a>, the nephew of <a href="Maredudd%20ap%20Bleddyn">Maredudd ap Bleddyn</a>, ruler of the Welsh principality of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Powys">Powys</a>. Besides Bridgnorth, Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>. During Henry's reign, the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh.

The "Gesta Stephani" indicates that Pain, along with Miles of Gloucester, was a major landholder in the western part of England, and the pair managed to dominate justice in that region. According to the document the two men "raised their power to such a pitch that from the Severn to the sea, all along the border between England and Wales, they involved everyone in litigation and forced services." The later medieval writer <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> called Miles and Pain "secretaries and privy councillors of the king".

The 1130 <a href="Pipe%20Roll">Pipe Roll</a> noted that Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the ordinary court, Pain also heard cases relating to the <a href="Royal%20forest%23Forest%20law">forest law</a> in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Diocese of Hereford</a> had been vacant since the death of <a href="Richard%20de%20Capella">Richard de Capella</a> in August 1127, and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—<a href="Robert%20de%20Bethune">Robert de Bethune</a>, the <a href="prior">prior</a> of <a href="Llanthony%20Priory">Llanthony Priory</a>. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.

By the end of Henry's reign, Pain had witnessed over 60 royal charters for the king, spanning a period from around 1115 until 1135. Although Pain witnessed a large number of royal documents, this activity took place mostly in England, as few of the documents he witnessed were drawn up while the king was in Normandy. As a reward for his service, Henry gave Pain the <a href="Honour%20%28feudal%20land%20tenure%29">lordships</a> of <a href="Ewyas%20Lacy">Ewias Lacy</a> and <a href="Archenfield">Archenfield</a>, both in Wales.

Following King Henry's death in 1135, the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—<a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a> and his elder brother, <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald II, Count of Champagne</a>—and Henry's surviving legitimate child <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>. King Henry's only legitimate son, <a href="William%20Adelin">William</a>, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to <a href="Geoffrey%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey, Count of Anjou</a>. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. Matilda, though, was less sanguine, and secured the support of the Scottish king, <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a>, who was her maternal uncle, and in 1138 also that of her half-brother, <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert, Earl of Gloucester</a>, an illegitimate son of Henry I.

On Henry's death in December 1135, Pain attended the king's funeral. Pain was an early supporter of King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a>, although he was said initially to have been afraid to appear at Stephen's court for fear of being confronted by those he had oppressed. Nevertheless, Pain was with the new king by early January 1136, when he witnessed one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king. Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136. The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.

After Henry's death, the Welsh attempted to drive out the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and to prevent him from defecting to Matilda's cause.

In 1119 Pope <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20II">Callixtus II</a> addressed letters to a group of Anglo-Norman landholders in the Welsh Marches, including Pain, accusing them of having appropriated the lands of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Llandaff">Diocese of Llandaff</a> and ordering their return. Pain was among a group of nobles similarly accused by Pope <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20II">Honorius II</a> in 1128. Honorius once again ordered the nobles to restore to the Church lands they had confiscated.

Pain gave lands to Llanthony Priory, helping to establish the endowment of that monastic house, although it is difficult to distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to <a href="Gloucester%20Abbey">Gloucester Abbey</a>, which had benefited from the generosity of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot. She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.

On 10 July 1137 Pain was killed by a javelin blow to the head during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief expedition to the garrison at <a href="Carmarthen">Carmarthen</a>. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey, following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester. Pain's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen. Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his new wife, setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh <a href="Romance%20%28heroic%20literature%29">romance</a> work "<a href="Fouke%20le%20Fitz%20Waryn">Fouke le Fitz Waryn</a>" is based.

Pain's heirs were his two daughters, Cecily and Agnes. His <a href="line%20of%20hereditary%20succession">heir male</a> was his brother, Eustace fitzJohn. The two daughters were married five times in total; Cecily married three times but failed to produce any direct heirs. Her first husband was <a href="Roger%20Fitzmiles%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Hereford">Roger</a>, the son of Miles of Gloucester. Pain arranged Cecily and Roger's marriage. The marriage contract specified that Roger would inherit all of Pain's lands, but as result of the latter's death the marriage was not contracted until December 1137, when King Stephen confirmed the terms of the settlement. The king also settled the bulk of the inheritance on Cecily, which led to disturbances and a minor war among disappointed claimants. Agnes married <a href="Warin%20de%20Munchensy">Warin de Munchensy</a> and after his death <a href="Haldenald%20de%20Bidun">Haldenald de Bidun</a>. She died after 1185, by which time she was described as a widow.

The historian W. E. Wightman described Pain as a "second-class baron and first-class civil servant".

1940 Brocklesby mid-air collision

On 29 September 1940, a <a href="mid-air%20collision">mid-air collision</a> occurred over <a href="Brocklesby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Brocklesby</a>, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual in that the aircraft involved, two <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Service Flying Training School RAAF</a>, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot of the upper Anson found that he was able to control the interlocked aircraft with his <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s and <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>, and made an emergency landing in a nearby <a href="Field%20%28agriculture%29">paddock</a>. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.

<a href="No.%202%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Service Flying Training School</a> (SFTS), based at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Wagga">RAAF Station Forest Hill</a> near <a href="Wagga%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a>, New South Wales, was one of several pilot training facilities formed in the early years of World War II as part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. After basic aeronautical instruction at an elementary flying training school, pupils went on to an SFTS to learn techniques they would require as operational (or "service") pilots, including instrument flying, night flying, cross-country navigation, advanced aerobatics, formation flying, dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. No. 2 SFTS's facilities were still under construction when its first course commenced with <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s on 29 July 1940.

On 29 September 1940, two Ansons took off from the Forest Hill air base for a cross-country training exercise over southern New South Wales. <a href="aircraft%20registration">Tail number</a> N4876 was piloted by <a href="Leading%20Aircraftman">Leading Aircraftman</a> Leonard Graham Fuller, 22, from <a href="Cootamundra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cootamundra</a>, with Leading Aircraftman Ian Menzies Sinclair, 27, from <a href="Glen%20Innes%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Glen Innes</a>, as navigator. Tail number L9162 was piloted by Leading Aircraftman Jack Inglis Hewson, 19, from <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a>, with Leading Aircraftman Hugh Gavin Fraser, 27, from <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, as navigator. Their planned route was expected to take them first to <a href="Corowa%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Corowa</a>, then to <a href="Narrandera">Narrandera</a>, and finally back to Forest Hill.

The Ansons were at an altitude of over the township of <a href="Brocklesby%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Brocklesby</a>, near <a href="Albury">Albury</a>, when they made a banking turn. Fuller lost sight of Hewson's aircraft beneath him and the two Ansons collided amid what Fuller later described as a "grinding crash and a bang as roaring propellors struck each other and bit into the engine cowlings". The aircraft remained jammed together, the lower Anson's turret wedged into the other's port wing root, and its fin and rudder balancing the upper Anson's port <a href="tailplane">tailplane</a>.

Both of the upper aircraft's engines had been knocked out in the collision but those of the one below continued to turn at full power as the interlocked Ansons began to slowly circle. Fuller described the "freak combination" as "lumping along like a brick". He nevertheless found that he was able to control the piggybacking pair of aircraft with his <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s and <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>, and began searching for a place to land. The two navigators, Sinclair and Fraser, bailed out, followed soon after by the lower Anson's pilot, Hewson, whose back had been injured when the spinning blades of the other aircraft sliced through his fuselage.

Fuller travelled five miles (eight kilometres) after the collision, then successfully made an emergency <a href="pancake%20landing">pancake landing</a> in a large <a href="Field%20%28agriculture%29">paddock</a> south-west of Brocklesby. The locked aircraft slid across the grass before coming to rest. As far as Fuller was concerned, the touchdown was better than any he had made when practising <a href="circuits%20and%20bumps">circuits and bumps</a> at Forest Hill airfield the previous day. His acting commanding officer, Squadron Leader Cooper, declared the choice of improvised runway "perfect", and the landing itself as a "wonderful effort". The RAAF's Inspector of Air Accidents, Group Captain <a href="Arthur%20William%20Murphy">Arthur "Spud" Murphy</a>, flew straight to the scene from Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne, accompanied by his deputy <a href="Henry%20Winneke">Henry Winneke</a>. Fuller told Murphy:

The freak accident garnered news coverage around the world, and cast a spotlight on the small town of Brocklesby. In preventing the destruction of the Ansons, Fuller was credited not only with avoiding possible damage to Brocklesby, but with saving approximately <a href="Australian%20pound">£</a>40,000 worth of military hardware. Both Ansons were repaired; the top aircraft (N4876) returned to flight service, and the lower (L9162) was used as an instructional airframe. Hewson was treated for his back injury at Albury District Hospital and returned to active duty; he graduated from No. 2 SFTS in October 1940. He was discharged from the Air Force as a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in 1946. Sinclair was discharged in 1945, also a flight lieutenant. Fraser was posted to Britain and flew as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B206%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 206 Squadron RAF</a>, based in <a href="RAF%20Aldergrove">Aldergrove</a>, Northern Ireland. He and his crew of three died on 1 January 1942 during a routine training flight, when their <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a> collided with a tree.

Fuller was promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> after his successful landing, but also confined to barracks for fourteen days and docked seven days' pay for speaking about the incident to newspapers without authorisation. He graduated from No. 2 SFTS in October 1940, and subsequently received a commendation from the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> for his "presence of mind, courage and determination in landing the locked Ansons without serious damage to the aircraft under difficult conditions". Fuller saw active service first in the Middle East, and then in Europe with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B37%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 37 Squadron RAF</a>. He earned the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Medal">Distinguished Flying Medal</a> for his actions over <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> in March 1942. <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">Commissioned</a> later that year, Fuller was posted back to Australia as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, and became an instructor at <a href="No.%201%20Operational%20Training%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 1 Operational Training Unit</a> in <a href="Sale%2C%20Victoria">Sale</a>, Victoria. He died near Sale on 18 March 1944, when he was hit by a bus while riding his bicycle.

According to the <a href="Greater%20Hume%20Shire">Greater Hume Shire Council</a>, the 1940 mid-air collision remains Brocklesby's "main claim to fame". Local residents commemorated the 50th anniversary of the event by erecting a marker near the site of the crash landing; it was unveiled by <a href="Tim%20Fischer">Tim Fischer</a>, the <a href="Division%20of%20Farrer">Federal Member for Farrer</a> and <a href="National%20Party%20of%20Australia">Leader of the National Party</a>, on 29 September 1990. On 26 January 2007, a memorial featuring an Avro Anson engine was opened during Brocklesby's <a href="Australia%20Day">Australia Day</a> celebrations.

Santa María de Óvila

Santa María de Óvila is a former <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> <a href="monastery">monastery</a> built in Spain beginning in 1181 on the <a href="Tagus%20River">Tagus River</a> near <a href="Trillo%2C%20Guadalajara">Trillo, Guadalajara</a>, about northeast of Madrid. During prosperous times over the next four centuries, construction projects expanded and improved the small monastery. Its fortunes declined significantly in the 18th century, and in 1835 it was confiscated by the Spanish government and sold to private owners who used its buildings to shelter farm animals.

American publisher <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> bought parts of the monastery in 1931 with the intention of using its stones in the construction of a grand and fanciful <a href="castle">castle</a> at <a href="Wyntoon">Wyntoon</a>, California, but after some 10,000 stones were removed and shipped, they were abandoned in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> for decades. These stones are now in various locations around California: the old church <a href="Portal%20%28architecture%29">portal</a> was erected at the <a href="University%20of%20San%20Francisco">University of San Francisco</a>, and the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> was reassembled by <a href="Trappist">Trappist</a> monks at the <a href="Abbey%20of%20New%20Clairvaux">Abbey of New Clairvaux</a> in <a href="Vina%2C%20California">Vina, California</a>. Other stones are serving as simple decorative elements in <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a>'s botanical garden. To support the chapter house project, a line of <a href="Beer%20in%20Belgium">Belgian-style beers</a> was produced by <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20Brewing%20Company">Sierra Nevada Brewing Company</a> under the Ovila Abbey brand.

In Spain, the new government of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Republic</a> declared the monastery a <a href="Monument%20%28Spain%29">National Monument</a> in June 1931, but not in time to prevent the mass removal of stones. Today, the remnant buildings and walls stand on private farmland.

The monastery of Santa María de Óvila was founded in 1175 by a grant of land from King <a href="Alfonso%20VIII%20of%20Castile">Alfonso VIII of Castile</a> to the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> monks of <a href="Valbuena%20Abbey">Valbuena Abbey</a> in <a href="Valbuena%20de%20Duero">Valbuena de Duero</a>, <a href="Valladolid%20Province">Valladolid Province</a>, <a href="Castile-Leon">Castile-Leon</a>, Spain. In this endeavor, the king was following a general strategy of establishing Catholic institutions on land he had recently won in battle from the <a href="Moors%23Moors%20of%20Iberia">Moors of Iberia</a>. The Cistercian "white monks" (wearing undyed <a href="Religious%20habit">habits</a>) first chose a site in Murel (now called Carrascosa de Tajo) on the Tagus, but after a few years, had to relocate to more fertile zone a few miles nearer to <a href="Trillo%2C%20Guadalajara">Trillo, Guadalajara</a>, where a flat hilltop by the river commanded a modest view.

The construction began in 1181. The monastic quarters and the church were built over the following three decades. The central <a href="cloister">cloister</a> was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a <a href="Barrel%20vault">barrel-vaulted</a> great <a href="nave">nave</a>, on the east by the <a href="sacristy">sacristy</a>, the priory cell, and the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a>, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the <a href="refectory">refectory</a> (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2 m) walls with slit windows, to serve as a refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built in the shape of a Latin cross with a nave divided into four sections, and a sanctuary with three square <a href="apse">apse</a>s. Its <a href="Presbytery%20%28architecture%29">presbytery</a> had a central square topped by a pentagon.

In 1191, the king confirmed the monastery and its surrounding fields as belonging to the Cistercian Order. The aged abbot of <a href="Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Huerta">Santa María de Huerta</a>, bishop <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20de%20Finojosa">Martín de Finojosa</a> (later <a href="Canonization">canonized</a>), consecrated the church in September 1213 and died days later. The surrounding area of Murel and Trillo along the Tagus prospered, giving tithes and gifts of land to the monastery. The <a href="cartulary">cartulary</a>, "Cartulario de Óvila", is preserved at the <a href="Complutense%20University%20of%20Madrid">University of Madrid</a>.

The first buildings were completed in the <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> style, including the church. The <a href="refectory">refectory</a> (dining hall) shows an architectural style in transition between earlier <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> and contemporary Gothic. A fine High Gothic <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> was built of best quality hard <a href="limestone">limestone</a>. The church was rebuilt sometime before 1650 in a late Gothic style with a prominent <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulted ceiling</a>. The cloister was rebuilt around 1617, and is of a simple design with little adornment surrounding a High Renaissance <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a>. The final phase of building took place around 1650, with a new doorway for the church, completed in late <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Plateresque">Plateresque</a> style full of detail. Because of its prosperity and the multiple expansion projects, Santa María de Óvila exhibited examples of every Spanish religious architectural style used from 1200 to 1600. However, even at its height, Óvila remained one of the smallest Cistercian monasteries in the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">region of Castile</a>.

From the 15th century, changes to the areas surrounding Santa María de Óvila initiated a slow decline. Civil wars depopulated the villages of the upper Tagus valley. The monastery's land holdings passed one by one into the hands of the new regional aristocracy: first the Count of Cifuentes, followed by <a href="Rui%20Gomes%20da%20Silva%2C%201st%20Prince%20of%20%C3%89boli">Rui Gomes da Silva, Duke of Pastrana</a>, and the Spanish Army. Neighbors looted more lands.

A fire destroyed part of the monastery during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. During the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>, French troops looted the buildings and used them as barracks. The monks were forced to leave in 1820 because of confiscations by a new liberal government, but they returned in 1823 after King <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand VII</a> restored conservative institutions. However, the nearby villagers denied support to the monastery despite its protection by the king. The monastery ceased to operate in 1835: the <a href="Ecclesiastical%20Confiscations%20of%20Mendiz%C3%A1bal">Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal</a> enforced a law declaring that minor religious holdings housing fewer than 12 residents were to be forfeit to the state; the monastery had only four monks and one <a href="lay%20brother">lay brother</a>, who were cast out.

After the Confiscations, many of the furnishings and artistic treasures of Santa María de Óvila passed to the surrounding parish churches, especially Ruguilla, Huet, Sotoca de Tajo and Carrascosa de Tajo. Other valuables, such as books and historic documents, were stolen and sold. The remaining contents were auctioned, including wine-making equipment and an oxcart. The precious 328-pages <a href="cartulary">cartulary</a> of the monastery () went to a private owner but was donated in 1925 to the <a href="Monastery%20of%20Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20la%20Real%20of%20Oseira">Monastery of Santa María la Real of Oseira</a>. The thick manuscript holds copies of royal privileges granted to the monastery throughout its history, as well as the "Abadologio", a comprehensive and thorough history of the Cistercian abbots and monks who lived in the monastery, which was written from March 1729 to February 1730 by Father Gerofeo, a Cistercian monk of the monastery of Valparaíso (Zámora).

The new owners of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the buildings. For a brief time, the former monastery was used as a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.

In 1928, the Spanish state sold the monastery to Fernando Beloso for a little more than 3,100 <a href="Spanish%20peseta">pesetas</a>, roughly $600 to $700 at the time. Beloso, director of the <a href="Banesto">Spanish Credit Bank</a> in Madrid, was the owner of Coto de San Bernardo in Óvila, which included expansive irrigated grain fields and forests surrounding the monastery.

<a href="Arthur%20Byne">Arthur Byne</a>, an art agent living in Madrid, whose biggest client was American newspaper magnate <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, was working for Hearst to acquire an old monastery in 1930. In 1925, Byne had bought Hearst the monastery of Santa María la Real de Sacramenia which was dismantled, crated and shipped to New York where it was stored in a warehouse in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>. (In 1954 it was re-assembled in Florida as a tourist attraction, and was subsequently acquired by the <a href="Episcopal%20Diocese%20of%20South%20Florida">Episcopal Diocese of South Florida</a> and called the <a href="St.%20Bernard%20de%20Clairvaux%20Church">St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church</a>.) Byne signaled Beloso to help him locate one; Beloso invited him to see the old Óvila monastery in December 1930, and Byne subsequently sent photographs and sketches to Hearst for approval. Byne listed specific elements, mostly architectural details, to be removed, such as vault ribs, door frames, window embrasures, columns and capitals. Some entire walls of fine facing stones were recommended for removal. He referred to the proposal as "Mountolive", possibly to misdirect the Spanish authorities who were in charge of protecting historical artifacts.

After Hearst conveyed his enthusiasm for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price roughly equivalent to $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect <a href="Julia%20Morgan">Julia Morgan</a> sent her associate architect <a href="Walter%20T.%20Steilberg">Walter T. Steilberg</a> who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red on the back of each stone.

To move all the stones, Byne and Steilberg had a road built to the Tagus, and a barge attached to a fixed cable was assigned to ferry stones across. An old <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> <a href="Trench%20railways">trench railway</a> was brought in to transport stones from the monastery to the ferry; its rails could be laid into any of the buildings. Men pushed the small rail cars along the narrow gauge tracks; the stones were then lifted into the ferry by crane, and another crane lifted them out of the ferry into trucks. One of the biggest problems that Byne encountered was that Spain's three <a href="Wood%20wool">excelsior</a> factories could not make enough packing material to keep the crate-packing crew supplied. At one point, realizing that the stones were likely to be used in California as external cladding for structural steel walls, Steilberg suggested the facing surface of each stone be sliced to a "veneer" of the thickness of for easier packing and shipping, but Hearst wanted to retain the authenticity of the full-sized stones. Byne and Steilberg judged certain walls and utility buildings worthless and left them in Spain. Steilberg returned home at the end of March.

Byne rushed the project in fear that it might be halted at any time by the authorities—Spanish law prohibited the removal of historic artifacts. However, the Spanish government was at that time in disarray and did not enforce the law. Government officials "simply looked the other way" as trucks hauled 700-year-old stones through <a href="Valencia%2C%20Spain">Valencia</a> to the docks. When King <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII</a> abdicated in April 1931, leaving the government in the control of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Republic</a>, the new officials stopped the project. Byne's lawyer persuaded the Minister of Labor to allow the work to continue on the grounds that the project employed more than a hundred men and put money into the severely depressed economy.

Doctor <a href="Francisco%20Layna%20Serrano">Francisco Layna Serrano</a> of nearby Ruguilla had for years tried to save the monastery but had failed to interest the government in the expensive preservation proposal. Realizing that this was his last chance to document the place as its stones were being removed, he wrote a <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of its history and included a site plan of the layout of buildings, written from memory. As a result of his efforts, on June 3, 1931, Santa María de Óvila was listed as a <a href="Monument%20%28Spain%29">National Monument of Spain</a>, or "<a href="Bien%20de%20Inter%C3%A9s%20Cultural">Bien de Interés Cultural</a>" (Cultural Property). Layna Serrano published his monograph in 1932. In 1933, the monastery's historic cartulary was brought to the <a href="Complutense%20University%20of%20Madrid">University of Madrid</a> and published; the original was archived at the <a href="University%20of%20Oviedo">University of Oviedo</a>.

By the time the dismantling was finished on July 1, 1931, some 10,000 stones weighing a total of were shipped on 11 different freighters traveling through the Panama Canal to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. In 1931 currency, the monastery project had cost Hearst about one million dollars.

Today, a few buildings remain of the original monastery in Spain. These include the winery or bodega, now the oldest surviving building on the site. This was built in the 13th century during the reign of <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20Castile">Henry I of Castile</a>, with the upper floor built as a dormitory covered by a long barrel-vaulted ceiling. Outside of the bodega, crumbling walls, open yards and part of the Gothic roof of the church are visible. The double arches in the walls of the Renaissance-era cloister are still standing, but the arched roof is lost. The foundation of the church can be seen.

Hearst first bought the monastery intending to replace the family retreat at <a href="Wyntoon">Wyntoon</a>, on the bank of the <a href="McCloud%20River">McCloud River</a> near <a href="Mount%20Shasta">Mount Shasta</a> in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's <a href="Bernard%20Maybeck">Bernard Maybeck</a>-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle <a href="folly">folly</a> that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.

At the <a href="Port%20of%20San%20Francisco">Port of San Francisco</a>, Steilberg inspected each shipment of stones, several thousand crates in all. The Haslett warehouse, between <a href="Fisherman%27s%20Wharf%2C%20San%20Francisco">Fisherman's Wharf</a> and the <a href="Hyde%20Street%20Pier">Hyde Street Pier</a>, was used for storage. With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced from the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.

In 1940, Hearst decided to give the monastery away. The government of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> requested that it be returned to Spain, but Hearst refused. In August 1941, <a href="Herbert%20Fleishhacker">Herbert Fleishhacker</a>, director of the <a href="M.%20H.%20de%20Young%20Memorial%20Museum">M. H. de Young Memorial Museum</a>, convinced Hearst to give the stones to the City of San Francisco in exchange for the city's payment of his $25,000 storage debt. Hearst stipulated the stones be used to construct a group of museum buildings adjoining the de Young Museum in <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a>. The city moved the crates from the warehouse to store them outdoors behind the museum and the <a href="Japanese%20Tea%20Garden%20%28San%20Francisco%2C%20California%29">Japanese Tea Garden</a>, allotting only $5,000 for trucking and for building rough sheds and protective covers. The museum plan was estimated to cost $500,000, but that amount was not available. Morgan prepared several layouts for the city to approve, each with a different arrangement of the buildings than in Spain. However, in December 1941, the U.S. was drawn into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the museum plans were shelved. Picking up the project in 1946, the city paid Morgan to construct a scale model of the complex of buildings which was to be the Museum of Medieval Arts, a West Coast version of <a href="The%20Cloisters">The Cloisters</a> in New York.

The city was unable to raise money to build the museum, and the stones were damaged in five fires. The first came soon after the crates were set down in Golden Gate Park. Morgan said that "piles of burning boxes were pulled over and down by the Fire Department, many hurled over a hundred and fifty feet." Hearst died in 1951, and Morgan died in 1957; neither of them saw anything built with the stones. Two fires in 1959 appeared to be arson, and many of the fire-heated stones were weakened or cracked from sudden cooling by water. In 1960, Steilberg was hired to inspect the stones once again; he used a ball-peen hammer to lightly strike each stone and listen for a solid ringing tone, or a dull thud which indicated cracking. He found that a little more than half the stones were sound.

In 1965, the Museum Society raised $40,000 to mount the grand portal of the old church. It was installed in the de Young Museum, the centerpiece of Hearst Court, the main exhibit hall. The rest of the stones were abandoned by the museum in May 1969 with the announcement that there would be no reconstruction. After this, stones were occasionally taken by park workers and used to decorate Golden Gate Park.

In 1989 or 1990, a San Francisco city worker dumped an unused granite <a href="bollard">bollard</a> amid the monastery stones; the tall bollard was once used as a <a href="traffic%20barrier">traffic barrier</a>. Some self-styled Hindu park users led by performance artist <a href="Michael%20Bowen%20%28artist%29">Michael Bowen</a>, calling himself Guru Baba Kali Das, began to worship the phallus-shaped bollard as a <a href="lingam">lingam</a>; they wrestled some of the monastery's stones into a religious circle, calling the circle Shiva Linga. The city sued to reclaim the area in 1993, but lost the battle in court. In January 1994 the city arranged to move the traffic bollard to Bowen's garage, serving as his temple. Bowen later offered the granite bollard for sale and admitted that the whole episode was a <a href="Performance%20art">performance piece</a>.

In 1999, some of the stones were used to construct an outdoor reading terrace adjoining the Helen Crocker Russell Library of Horticulture, part of the Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens in Golden Gate Park. Other stones were used for various purposes around Golden Gate Park and the Japanese Tea Garden, taken unofficially by park workers as they saw fit. Some of these ended up in the park's <a href="AIDS%20Memorial%20Grove">AIDS Memorial Grove</a>, others on a scent-based flower walkway named Garden of Fragrance.

In 2002, the old church portal was donated by the de Young Museum to the <a href="University%20of%20San%20Francisco">University of San Francisco</a> (a <a href="Association%20of%20Jesuit%20Colleges%20and%20Universities">Jesuit university</a>), and in 2008 it was associated with the construction of Kalmanovitz Hall. It serves as the backdrop of the outdoor Ovila Amphitheater (), near an older Romanesque portal from Northern Italy.

The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, first saw the stones and pictured them reassembled as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his first day in California. He arrived that day in San Francisco to serve as a new monk in <a href="Vina%2C%20California">Vina, California</a>, at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux. The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as <a href="Order%20of%20Cistercians%20of%20the%20Strict%20Observance">Cistercians of the Strict Observance</a>. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by <a href="Leland%20Stanford">Leland Stanford</a> to grow wine grapes. Davis's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds. From time to time in subsequent years, Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition.
In 1981, architectural historian Margaret Burke began working under a grant from the <a href="Hearst%20Foundation">Hearst Foundation</a> to inventory the remaining stones. She said it was "an excavation project" because of the weeds, blackberry brambles and tree roots growing over them. Burke identified about 60% of the stones belonging to the chapter house, a rectangular building originally spanning . She separated the chapter house stones, surrounded them with a fence and began creating templates for rebuilding the arched entrances. During 1980–1982 the museum board sought $45 million for an expansion project that included $3 million for rebuilding the chapter house. Meanwhile, Davis asked a museum staff member for permission to take several truckloads of stones to Vina to be used for architectural decoration. Park workers helped him load the most ornate pieces he could find, and they were hauled away. Not told of the arrangement, Burke discovered that Davis had taken some of the chapter house stones, and the museum board insisted these be returned. Davis was left with 58 stones from other monastery buildings.

In 1983 and 1987, Davis made unsuccessful requests for all of the chapter house stones. After the <a href="1989%20Loma%20Prieta%20earthquake">1989 Loma Prieta earthquake</a>, the de Young museum was to be rebuilt, and the future of the stones was reconsidered. In September 1993, museum director Harry Parker joined with Davis to sign an unconditional permanent loan of the chapter house stones to New Clairvaux. In 1994, the city approved the loan with the stipulation that the building be restored accurately and that it be occasionally open to the public. The stones were transported in 20 truckloads to Vina. Inside an old brick barn built by Stanford to make brandy, the stones began to be fitted together, laid flat on Burke's plywood templates.
Ground was broken in 2003 on the site of an orchard () next to the main cloister building. Architect Patrick Cole of Arcademe, overseeing the rebuilding project, said that there were more than half of the required stones for the chapter house. Of the missing stones, more than 90% were repeating-pattern stones with available templates to carve replacements. <a href="Stonemasonry">Stonemasons</a> Oskar Kempf and Frank Helmholz used modern <a href="hydraulic%20lime">hydraulic lime</a> as <a href="Lime%20mortar">mortar</a> rather than making their own as was done in the Middle Ages. Helmholz said of the opportunity offered by the project that it was "something most stonemasons don't do in all their career."

The strength of the building is twice what it was in Spain, with the stones supporting their own weight as designed, augmented by an external framework of steel and concrete to hold them together when the California ground shakes. Contractor Phil Sunseri said that the building foundation was earthquake resistant as well; with a three-foot-thick (1 m) mat of concrete and steel underneath, such that "the entire building will move as one unit." The reassembled chapter house is the largest example of original Cistercian Gothic architecture in the Western Hemisphere, and it is the oldest building in America west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

Nearby <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20Brewing%20Company">Sierra Nevada Brewing Company</a> partnered with the monks of New Clairvaux to make a series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer producer launched a website to tell about the making of the beer product line and the story of the restoration of the stones. Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a <a href="Dubbel">Dubbel</a>, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a <a href="Saison">Saison</a> and in November by a <a href="Quadrupel">Quadrupel</a>. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.

Cyclone Rewa

Severe Tropical Cyclone Rewa affected six countries and caused 22 deaths on its 28-day journey across the South Pacific Ocean in December 1993 and January 1994. Cyclone Rewa developed from a tropical disturbance on 28 December south of <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a>. After forming, Rewa moved southwest through the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, crossing the <a href="160th%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmeridian%20east">160th meridian east</a> from the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20basins%23South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific basin</a> into the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20basins%23Australian%20region">Australian region</a>. The cyclone began to strengthen steadily and turned southward, paralleling the eastern Australian coast through 31 December. Rewa reached its initial peak intensity as a <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20scales">Category 4</a> tropical cyclone on 2 January. It maintained this intensity for about 12 hours before an increase in <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> induced its weakening by 3 January. The cyclone turned southeastward and moved back into the South Pacific basin on 4 January, before it passed over <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> between 5–6 January. After affecting New Caledonia, Rewa weakened to a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> and turned northwestward before re-entering the Australian basin on 10 January.

Over the following days, the cyclone showed signs of restrengthening and executed an elongated cyclonic loop to the southeast of <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. Rewa subsequently entered a phase of quick intensification while proceeding southeastward, peaking in intensity as a <a href="Australian%20scale">Category 5 severe tropical cyclone</a>. It recurved toward the southwest while gradually weakening for several days. Although forecasters had predicted Rewa to make <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay, Queensland</a>, the cyclone began interacting with an <a href="Upper%20tropospheric%20cyclonic%20vortex">upper-level trough</a> on 18 January, causing it to divert to the southeast and move along the Queensland coast. Rewa transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> on 20 January, with its remnants bringing heavy rain to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> three days later.

The cyclone caused the deaths of 22 people on its course, affecting parts of the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, <a href="Eastern%20states%20of%20Australia">Eastern Australia</a>, New Caledonia, <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> and New Zealand. Nine people in a banana <a href="dinghy">dinghy</a> en route to <a href="Rossel%20Island">Rossel Island</a> went missing at the height of the storm; they were presumed drowned after wreckage from their boat turned up at the island. In Queensland, three people died in traffic accidents caused by the storm, and another fatality occurred when a boy became trapped in a storm pipe. One death took place in New Caledonia, while flooding caused eight drownings in Papua New Guinea. After this usage of the name Rewa, the name was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20South%20Pacific%20tropical%20cyclone%20names%23Tropical%20cyclone%20names%20retired%20in%20the%201990s">retired</a>.

During 26 December, the <a href="Fiji%20Meteorological%20Service">Fiji Meteorological Service</a> (FMS) started to monitor a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> that had developed within the <a href="Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a>, about 575 km (355 mi) to the south-east of <a href="Nauru">Nauru</a>. Over the next few days the depression gradually developed and organised further, as it moved towards the west-southwest under the influence of a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Over the next few days, the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29 December and affecting the southeastern islands of <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20basins%23South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific basin</a> and into the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20basins%23Australian%20region">Australian region</a>, where the Australian <a href="Bureau%20of%20Meteorology">Bureau of Meteorology</a> (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.

On 30 December, the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale</a> ; early the next day the BoM reported that the system had developed into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, and an <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2 January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">1-minute windspeeds</a> of 230 km/h (145 mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205 km/h (125 mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24 hours before the system started to weaken during 3 January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to move towards the south-east, before it started to take a more eastwards track as it approached 160°E.

During 4 January, Rewa moved back into the South Pacific basin and continued eastward as a weakening category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with the FMS estimating the 10-minute sustained windspeeds at 150 km/h (90 mph). During the next day, its eye became obscured after the mountains of New Caledonia affected Rewa's circulation by creating a hot and dry <a href="Foehn%20wind">Foehn wind</a>. The FMS reported that the system had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become a tropical storm. The system subsequently made landfall in the vicinity of <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20Bay">Saint Vincent Bay</a> on New Caledonia's south-western coast, before it emerged near <a href="Thio%2C%20New%20Caledonia">Thio</a> from the east coast during 6 January. By 7 January, Rewa's circulation had become exposed under the influence of upper level north-westerlies; as a result both the FMS and JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a depression. Over the next 3 days, the residual low-level circulation was steered towards the northwest and Papua New Guinea in a southeasterly <a href="trade%20wind">trade wind</a> flow generated by a powerful area of high pressure located between New Zealand and <a href="Kermadec%20Islands">Kermadec Islands</a>. During 10 January, Rewa's remnants moved out of the South Pacific basin and back into the Australian region while starting to re-intensify into a tropical cyclone, as a mid to upper level trough over eastern Australia increased in size.

As moved into the Australian region, Rewa began to move in a long arc to the northwest and then to the north, and on 13 January, both the JTWC and the <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> National Weather Service reported that the system had re-intensified into a tropical cyclone around Papua New Guinea's southern islands. Later that day, Rewa executed a sharp clockwise turn near <a href="Vanatinai">Tagula Island</a> and started to move towards the southeast and the BoM's area of responsibility while gradually intensifying further. During 15 January, the BoM reported that the system had re-intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that Rewa had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane again. Later that day, the system started to rapidly intensify as an upper level trough approached the system. During the next day the JTWC reported that the system had peaked with 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km/h (145 mph). The BoM then reported later that day, that Rewa had peaked with 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 205 km/h (125 mph), which made it a category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After it had peaked in intensity the system recurved towards the south-southwest, and started to gradually weaken. By 18 January the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened into a tropical storm, while throughout that day the BoM assessed Rewa as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During the next day, the BoM reported that Rewa had weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone as it recurved and started to move towards the south-east about 265 km (165 mi) to the east of <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay, Queensland</a>. Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south-southeast along the Queensland coast while maintaining its intensity. During 21 January, the BoM and the JTWC reported that Rewa had weakened below cyclone strength, as the system moved back into the South Pacific basin for the third and final time. Rewa's remnants were last noted late on 23 January, by New Zealand's <a href="Metservice">Metservice</a>, bringing heavy rain to New Zealand, while dissipating over water about to the east of <a href="Wellington%2C%20New%20Zealand">Wellington, New Zealand</a>.

Twenty-two people lost their lives in accidents caused by Cyclone Rewa, while it affected parts off the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Due to the impact of this storm, the name Rewa was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20South%20Pacific%20tropical%20cyclone%20names%23Tropical%20cyclone%20names%20retired%20in%20the%201990s">retired</a>.

The Solomon Islands were affected by the developing tropical cyclone between 28 – 30 December and was the first <a href="Island%20country">Island country</a> to be impacted by Rewa. As it developed into a tropical cyclone on 28 December, the system passed to the north of the outer lying <a href="atoll">atoll</a>s of <a href="Malaita%20Province">Malaita Province</a> in the Solomon Islands. Rewa then passed over the southern tip of <a href="Malaita">Malaita Island</a>, before passing to the south of <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal Island</a> and the north of <a href="Rennell%20Island">Rennell Island</a> during 29 December.

Cyclone Rewa started to affect New Caledonia on 5 January, before it passed over <a href="New%20Caledonia">Grand Terre</a> Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300 mm (12 in) of rain on parts of the archipelago, which made all of the major rivers overflow and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the <a href="Loyalty%20Islands">Loyalty Island</a> of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour wall at Tadine's port.

The system had no effect on Vanuatu while it passed through the Solomon Islands between 28 – 30 December; however the southern islands of Vanuatu were affected by the cyclone after it had passed through New Caledonia during 5 January. As it moved towards the north-west between 6–8 January, Rewa brought high seas and strong winds to parts of the island nation including the provinces of <a href="Shefa%20Province">Shefa</a> and <a href="Tafea%20Province">Tafea</a>. Some damage was recorded to Port Villa's harbours <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal zone</a>, as the system passed about to the southeast of the city.

Between 19–24 January, Rewa's remnants, a slow moving <a href="weather%20front">weather front</a> over <a href="Fiordland">Fiordland</a> and a <a href="southerly">southerly</a> brought widespread rainfall and flooding to New Zealand's South Island. In <a href="Westland%20District">Westland</a>, Fiordland and the <a href="Southern%20Lakes%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Southern Lakes</a>, landslides and flooding occurred on 21 January, while several roads and bridges were damaged.

Cyclone Rewa affected Papua New Guinea on two separate occasions while it was active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28 December and 1 January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14 January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">alerts and warnings</a> were issued for <a href="Vanatinai">Sudest</a>, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people not to go to beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100 km/h (60 mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and <a href="copra">copra</a> destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500 people homeless and caused 17 deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other people went missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00 UTC on 30 December, the automatic weather station at <a href="Rossel%20Island">Jingo</a> on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55 km/h (35 mph).

During the opening days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards parallel to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600 km (370 mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it was too far away from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4 January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18  January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in <a href="Shoalwater%20Bay">Shoalwater Bay</a> had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to <a href="Rockhampton">Rockhampton</a> to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Queensland">Gladstone</a> were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.

On 19 January Rewa started to affect Queensland with torrential rain and storm force windspeeds which caused some damage along the coast. However it did not make its predicted landfall near Mackay, instead it recurved to the south-southeast and came to within 100 km (60 mi) of the coast. Two men off <a href="Yeppoon">Yeppoon</a>'s coast were rescued from a fishing trawler by an army <a href="Sikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">Black Hawk</a> helicopter after high seas damaged the trawler's propeller and snapped its heavy anchor chain, leaving it drifting helplessly in the cyclone's path. The worst affected island was <a href="Lady%20Elliot%20Island">Lady Elliot</a> as it bore the brunt of the wind, while on <a href="Heron%20Island%20%28Queensland%29">Heron Island</a>, several rare trees and bird rookeries were either destroyed or severely damaged. As Rewa interacted with an upper trough of low pressure on 19 January, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were observed in parts of Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Brisbane received over 144 mm (5.7 in) in just six hours, which led to some localised flash flooding in parts of the city and four deaths. Three of the deaths were from people crashing their cars, while the other death occurred when a person went surfing Brisbane's flood water and got trapped in a storm drain. Within Brisbane, 100 homes and 20 cars were damaged by the flood waters, while a <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match between Western Australia and Queensland was delayed, after <a href="the%20Gabba">the Gabba</a> resembled a small lake.

John Balmer

John Raeburn Balmer, (3 July 1910 – 11 May 1944) was a senior officer and bomber pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a>, Victoria, he studied law before joining the RAAF as an air cadet in 1932. An <a href="Flight%20instructor">instructor</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Wiiliams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a> from 1935 to 1937, he achieved renown in Air Force circles when he reportedly parachuted from a training aircraft to motivate his pupil to land single-handedly. He also became known to the general public as a cross-country motorist, setting records for trans-Australia and round-Australia trips prior to <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

A <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> when war broke out, Balmer was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in June 1940, becoming the inaugural commanding officer of <a href="No.%2013%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 13 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s out of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. He was raised to temporary <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in April 1941, and within a year had taken charge of the RAAF's first <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> unit, <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron</a>. Appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in June 1942, he led the Beauforts on bombing and torpedo missions against Japanese targets in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>.

Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took command of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B467%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 467 Squadron RAAF</a>, flying <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a>s in the <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command%23Strategic%20Bombing%201943-45">air war over Europe</a>. He led his unit through the <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin%20%28RAF%20campaign%29">Battle of Berlin</a> from November 1943 to March 1944. In April he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>, and the following month promoted to temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No. 467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have been shot down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>.

The son of lawyer Sydney Balmer and his wife Catherine ("Kittie"), John Balmer was born in <a href="Bendigo">Bendigo</a>, Victoria, on 3 July 1910. He attended <a href="Scotch%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Scotch College</a> before studying law at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, where he was a resident of <a href="Trinity%20College%20%28University%20of%20Melbourne%29">Trinity College</a>, and rowed in the Second Eight. In December 1932, he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). Nicknamed "Sam", Balmer undertook flying instruction on the 1933 "B" (reservists) course conducted at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Station Point Cook</a>, Victoria, where his classmates included future <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> <a href="John%20Lerew">John Lerew</a>. Balmer qualified as a pilot and was commissioned in April 1933. His first posting was to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>s; he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in November.

Promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, from July 1935 to November 1937 Balmer was assigned to <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a>, Point Cook, as an instructor. He gained a reputation as a hard taskmaster, and on one occasion—according to RAAF folklore—parachuted from a training aircraft to give his student the proper motivation to make a solo landing, though at least one newspaper at the time reported that he had in fact fallen out. On 15 August 1938, Balmer was forced to crash land an <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a> near <a href="Whitfield%2C%20Victoria">Whitfield</a>, Victoria, after its wings iced up—one of a series of accidents that befell the type following its introduction to Australian service. By mid-1939 he was instructing on <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a> biplane fighters with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales.

Parallel to his Air Force career, in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II Balmer gained national attention as a long-distance motorist. Partnered by a fellow officer, he set a cross-country record of 65 hours and 10 minutes travelling from <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Western Australia, to Melbourne in December 1936. He and another driver followed this up with a record-breaking round-Australia journey in October–November 1938, completing their run in 23½ days, almost halving the previous best time.

When <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">Australia declared war</a> in September 1939, Flight Lieutenant Balmer was a member of <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron</a>, which conducted coastal surveillance out of Richmond with Ansons and, later, <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s. Promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, he was posted to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Station Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, on 1 June 1940, becoming the inaugural commander of <a href="No.%2013%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 13 Squadron</a>, which had been "cannibalised" from the base's resident unit, <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron</a>. Retaining its Wirraway flight, No. 12 Squadron gave up its two flights of Ansons to the new formation; these were replaced later that month by more capable <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s. From August 1940 until February 1941, No. 13 Squadron was responsible for patrolling the sea lanes off Australia's north coast. On occasion, Balmer detected Japanese <a href="lugger">lugger</a>s that were illegally fishing in Australian waters and, according to <a href="Mark%20Johnston%20%28historian%29">Mark Johnston</a>, overflew them at such a low altitude that "his Hudson's slipstream rocked the boats violently" and the crew "shook their fists" at him. He was promoted to temporary <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in April. The following month, No. 13 Squadron conducted familiarisation flights over the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Balmer handed over command of the unit in August, and transferred to a liaison post at Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin.
In January 1942, Balmer briefly took charge of <a href="No.%207%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 7 Squadron</a>, flying Hudsons on maritime patrol and convoy escort duties from <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria. Two months later he assumed command of the first RAAF unit to operate Australian-built <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s, <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 100 Squadron</a>. It was formed at Richmond using the number of <a href="No.%20100%20Squadron%20RAF">a Royal Air Force (RAF) squadron</a> that had been decimated in the <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malayan Campaign</a>. In tribute to its original incarnation, Balmer adopted the RAF unit's crest, which featured a skull-and-crossbones emblem and the motto "Sarang Tebuan Jangan Dijolok" (<a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> for "Do not stir up a hornet's nest"). No. 100 Squadron transferred to <a href="Mareeba">Mareeba</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a> on 22 May, after Balmer decided that a proposed base at <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> was unsuitable owing to periodic flooding. While his crews at Mareeba gained experience on maritime patrols, he travelled to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, New Guinea, on 26 May to test the Beaufort in operational conditions; as he came in to land he was fired upon by US anti-aircraft batteries, whose gunners had "never seen a Goddamn aircraft like that before", but escaped damage.

Balmer was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> on 11 June 1942. On 25 June he took five of No. 100 Squadron's Beauforts to Port Moresby, joining two other Beauforts that were already stationed there. That night he led five aircraft from his squadron on their first bombing mission, against a Japanese ship reported in the <a href="Huon%20Gulf">Huon Gulf</a> near <a href="Lae">Lae</a>. Despite finding his bomb release gear faulty, necessitating three low-level attack runs in the face of increasingly heavy anti-aircraft fire, Balmer managed to score two hits, while his companions also successfully bombed the vessel. The ship appeared to be on fire and sinking, and the squadron received credit for its destruction at the time, but later investigation could not confirm its loss. The unit withdrew to Laverton for training and patrol work during July and August, before moving to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> to again take part in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. On 7 September 1942, Balmer commanded a combined force of <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>s from <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 75</a> and <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">76 Squadrons</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a>s from <a href="No.%2030%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 30 Squadron</a>, Hudsons from <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 Squadron</a>, and his own No. 100 Squadron Beauforts in an assault on Japanese shipping near Milne Bay. It was the first time the Beauforts had been armed with torpedoes in combat, and they failed to score any hits.
Beginning in October 1942, Nos. 6 and 100 Squadrons were given what the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the RAAF in World War II</a> called the "huge task" of keeping open the sea lanes between Australia and New Guinea, while disrupting as best they could Japanese lines of communication and supply. The units kept up a punishing schedule of daily long-range reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols, according to the official history, "practically without navigation aids, frequently through rain storms and heavy cloud" but, "supported by ground staffs as enduring as themselves, the crews maintained an almost inflexibly high standard and achieved considerable success". On the night of 4/5 October, Balmer took ten of his Beauforts from Milne Bay on a far-ranging assault against Japanese ships in the vicinity of the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a>, near <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a>. Two aircraft disappeared along the way in storms and the remainder became separated into two flights that nevertheless managed to rendezvous near the target. Seven of these launched their torpedoes against as many ships and the crews believed that four were accurate, but were unable to confirm any hits because of dwindling visibility. The mission was considered a failure but this was put down to problems with the torpedoes and not the aircrew. Subsequent reports suggested that three ships had in fact been damaged.

Balmer came down with <a href="malaria">malaria</a> in November 1942, and went on three weeks sick leave the following month; he returned to operations on 2 January 1943. In March, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, No. 100 Squadron launched its last torpedo attack; bad weather prevented all but two aircraft finding their targets, and no hits were registered. Towards the end of the month the unit dropped of bombs on Japanese installations in <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a>.

Balmer relinquished command of No. 100 Squadron in April 1943, and was posted from the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> to the <a href="European%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European theatre</a> that June. His planned secondment to the RAF was for two years. Partly in an effort to bolster Australian aspirations to form a distinct RAAF <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">group</a> within <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>, in August he was appointed commanding officer of <a href="No.%20467%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 467 Squadron</a>, based at <a href="RAF%20Bottesford">RAF Bottesford</a>, Leicestershire. The squadron had been raised under <a href="Article%20XV%20squadrons">Article XV</a> of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, and operated <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bombers. Balmer led his unit in a costly raid on <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> the night of 27/28 August, before attacking <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a> in September and October. From its new base at <a href="RAF%20Waddington">RAF Waddington</a>, Lincolnshire, Balmer then took No. 467 Squadron through the <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin%20%28RAF%20campaign%29">Battle of Berlin</a> that commenced in November 1943 and continued until March 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50 per cent, and during the Battle of Berlin, loss rates were far higher. No. 467 Squadron was the only Australian unit to take part in all sixteen heavy attacks against the German capital during the battle. In the same period it also raided <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>, <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, <a href="Essen">Essen</a>, and <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>.

Following the Battle of Berlin, No. 467 Squadron began to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">invasion of the continent</a>. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B5%20Group%20RAF">No. 5 Group RAF</a> in an assault on <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The bombing was highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.
Considered a "dynamic" leader and a "brilliant" pilot, Balmer was decorated with the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) for "great skill and devotion to duty" during "a varied tour of operations"; promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 18 April, the award citation further described him as "a most efficient squadron commander, whose keenness and zeal have set a fine example". He also earned the respect of his crews with displays of empathy such as the occasion one of his young pilots, who had flown on 15 missions, refused to take off on his next sortie. Rather than take disciplinary action, Balmer allowed the man medical leave and sought out respite for him in the country, after which the pilot returned to active duty and completed his tour of operations. From early April, No. 467 Squadron began playing a leading role in a series of attacks against railways, which continued into the following month.

Balmer was promoted to temporary group captain on 4 May 1944. On 10/11 May, his Lancasters took part in a raid on <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, losing three of their number. In an effort to shore up the morale of his younger crews, Balmer decided to personally lead their next mission the following night, against a military camp at Bourg-Léopold (<a href="Leopoldsburg">Leopoldsburg</a>), Belgium. It was planned to be his last operation before going on to a more senior position. His aircraft failed to return from the raid, causing considerable shock to his unit. The next day, Balmer's place as commanding officer of No. 467 Squadron was taken by Wing Commander <a href="William%20Brill%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">William Brill</a>, previously a member of <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B463%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 463 Squadron RAAF</a>, which was also based at Waddington.

Initially posted as missing, Balmer and his crew were later confirmed to have died when their Lancaster crashed near <a href="Herenthout">Herenthout</a> in <a href="Antwerp%20%28province%29">provincial Antwerp</a> after being attacked by a <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>. Balmer was buried in <a href="Heverlee%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Heverlee War Cemetery</a>, outside <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. The "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" reported that he had accumulated almost 5,000 flying hours, and compared his place in the RAAF to that of <a href="Leonard%20Cheshire">Leonard Cheshire</a>'s in the RAF. Aged 33, Balmer was unmarried at his death. His DFC was presented to his mother Kittie by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> shortly after the end of the war. Balmer's name appears at panel 110 of the Commemorative Area at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra.

4 (Beyoncé album)

4 is the fourth studio <a href="album">album</a> by American singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>. It was released on June 24, 2011 by <a href="Parkwood%20Entertainment">Parkwood Entertainment</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. Following a career hiatus that reignited her creativity, Beyoncé was inspired to create a record with a basis in traditional <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> that stood apart from contemporary <a href="pop%20music">popular music</a>. Her collaborations with songwriters and record producers <a href="The-Dream">The-Dream</a>, <a href="Tricky%20Stewart">Tricky Stewart</a> and <a href="Shea%20Taylor">Shea Taylor</a> produced a mellower tone, developing diverse vocal styles and influences from <a href="funk">funk</a>, <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>, and <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>.

Severing professional ties with father and manager <a href="Mathew%20Knowles">Mathew Knowles</a>, Beyoncé eschewed the music of her previous releases in favor of an intimate, personal album. "4"s lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic credibility. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition.

"4" was promoted in mid-2011 by television performances and festival appearances, such as Beyoncé's headlining <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival%202011">Glastonbury Festival</a> set. The album received generally positive reviews by music critics; several publications included it on their year-end lists. It was her fourth consecutive album to debut at number one on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, and it also reached number one in Brazil, France, Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. "4" spawned the international singles "<a href="Run%20the%20World%20%28Girls%29">Run the World (Girls)</a>", "<a href="Best%20Thing%20I%20Never%20Had">Best Thing I Never Had</a>", "<a href="Party%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Party</a>", "<a href="Love%20on%20Top">Love on Top</a>" and "<a href="Countdown%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Countdown</a>". "Love on Top" won the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Traditional%20R%26amp%3BB%20Performance">Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance</a> at the <a href="55th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">55th annual ceremony</a>. As of December 2015, "4" has sold 1.5 million copies in the United States.

Following the release of her third album "<a href="I%20Am...%20Sasha%20Fierce">I Am... Sasha Fierce</a>" (2008) and a world tour, Beyoncé took a career hiatus in 2010 "to live life [and] to be inspired by things again". During her hiatus, she "killed" Sasha Fierce, the alter-ego used in her <a href="I%20Am...%20Sasha%20Fierce">previous studio album</a>, as she felt she could now merge her two personalities. She severed professional ties with father and manager <a href="Mathew%20Knowles">Mathew Knowles</a>, who had guided her career since the 1990s with <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a>, noting that the decision made her feel vulnerable.

In an interview for "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>", Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio. She intended "4" to help change that status, commenting, "Figuring out a way to get <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> back on the radio is challenging ... With "4", I tried to mix R&B from the '70s and the '90s with <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock 'n' roll</a> and a lot of horns to create something new and exciting. I wanted musical changes, <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridges</a>, <a href="vibrato">vibrata</a>, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." On her website she wrote, "The album is definitely an evolution. It's bolder than the music on my previous albums because I'm bolder. The more mature I become and the more life experiences I have, the more I have to talk about. I really focused on songs being classics, songs that would last, songs that I could sing when I'm 40 and when I'm 60." Beyoncé also sought to make more artistic music, rather than purely commercially oriented songs.
Although much of "4"s inspiration came from "touring, travelling, watching rock bands and attending festivals", the album's early musical direction was influenced by Nigerian <a href="Afrobeat">Afrobeat</a> musician <a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti</a>, whose passion for music motivated Beyoncé. She worked with the band from "<a href="Fela%21">Fela!</a>", the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> musical based on Kuti's life. <a href="DJ%20Swivel">DJ Swivel</a>, one of "4"s <a href="audio%20engineer">engineers</a>, later described how Kuti's use of percussion and horns influenced the track "<a href="End%20of%20Time%20%28song%29">End of Time</a>". In 2015, <a href="The-Dream">The-Dream</a> revealed that he and Beyoncé had composed a whole album based on Kuti's music, although this was scrapped in favor of creating "4", therefore explaining how "End of Time" became so heavily influenced.

She also found additional influences in <a href="Earth%2C%20Wind%20%26amp%3B%20Fire">Earth, Wind & Fire</a>, <a href="The%20Stylistics">The Stylistics</a>, <a href="Lauryn%20Hill">Lauryn Hill</a>, <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, and <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>. She used <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> for a "broader sound" and looked to bring <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> singing back, stating, "I used a lot of the brassiness and grittiness in my voice that people hear in my live performances, but not necessarily on my records."

Three months into her hiatus in March 2010, Beyoncé began recording at her husband <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>'s Roc the Mic Studios in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. One song—"<a href="Party%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Party</a>"—was recorded because she wanted to see what working relationship would develop with engineer <a href="DJ%20Swivel">DJ Swivel</a>. <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a> assisted the production of "Party" after Beyoncé was impressed by his work on "<a href="My%20Beautiful%20Dark%20Twisted%20Fantasy">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>" (2010). <a href="Andr%C3%A9%203000">André 3000</a>, the only featured artist on "4", contributed a rap verse to the song, which he recorded in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>.

Six weeks later, in May 2010, she asked Swivel to work on the entire project. Concerning his working relationship with Beyoncé, he commented, "There was no 'We're doing "this" today.' It was a very kind of open project, where whatever she felt like recording at that time was what we'd work on. It was based on how she felt, her mood, and also her listening to the demos that writers would give us." With Swivel, she experimented with horns, drums, guitars and percussion instruments. Mostly inspired by the "<a href="Fela%21">Fela!</a>" sessions, Swivel began to formulate beats using their own recordings and those from "Fela!" The project was moved to KMA Studios for a week and a half because Roc the Mic was not large enough. There they began recording "<a href="I%20Care%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">I Care</a>", "<a href="Best%20Thing%20I%20Never%20Had">Best Thing I Never Had</a>" and "<a href="Rather%20Die%20Young">Rather Die Young</a>", and completed "Party". They recorded the songs "<a href="Schoolin%27%20Life">Schoolin' Life</a>", "<a href="1%2B1%20%28song%29">1+1</a>" and "<a href="Start%20Over%20%28song%29">Start Over</a>" at <a href="Jungle%20City%20Studios">Jungle City Studios</a> in New York.

<a href="MSR%20Studios">MSR Studios</a> was the final New York City-based studio used, and where most of "4" was recorded—only "Party" and "<a href="I%20Was%20Here%20%28song%29">I Was Here</a>" were recorded entirely at other studios. At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of <a href="live%20instrumentation">live instruments</a> on songs such as "I Care" and "End of Time". Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by <a href="Jeff%20Bhasker">Jeff Bhasker</a> and <a href="Shea%20Taylor">Shea Taylor</a>. Beyoncé asked <a href="Frank%20Ocean">Frank Ocean</a> to write and record "<a href="I%20Miss%20You%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">I Miss You</a>" at MSR, saying to "Complex", "[Jay-Z] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally the next morning. I asked him to fly to New York and work on my record."

After listening to each song, Beyoncé would often request the addition of specific instruments, leaving her production team to make the sounds cohesive. Her vocals were recorded through an Avalon Design 737 preamp and compressed in a <a href="1176%20Peak%20Limiter">1176 Peak Limiter</a> with a 4:1 ratio. After recording the lead vocals for a track, Swivel cut them in different ways and he and Beyoncé picked the best, then recording the backing vocals. Beyoncé composed her own vocal <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>s and <a href="harmony">harmonies</a> for each song. Her microphones were carefully placed to achieve a blend of sounds with a clear quality. Swivel spoke of her work ethic in an interview for "Sound on Sound":

After the move to MSR, Beyoncé and her production team began travelling. In the United Kingdom, they worked at <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>'s <a href="Real%20World%20Studios">Real World Studios</a> in Wiltshire—particularly using Gabriel's multi-instrument room—to create "<a href="Love%20on%20Top">Love on Top</a>". Soon after, Beyoncé joined Jay-Z in a Sydney mansion, as he was working on his collaboration album "<a href="Watch%20the%20Throne">Watch the Throne</a>" (2011) with Kanye West. There they created a "primitive studio" using a microphone, a rig out and <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> software to record. Sessions were also held in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Honolulu.

In February 2011, MTV reported the project was nearing completion. "4" was <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> mostly at MixStar Studios in Virginia and <a href="audio%20mastering">mastered</a> at Sterling Sound in New York City. The audio mastering was delayed by a week following the unexpected recording of "I Was Here". <a href="Diane%20Warren">Diane Warren</a> had played the song to <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> during a telephone conversation, leading him to put Warren and Beyoncé in contact. In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs in preparation for the album's release. According to Swivel, an eclectic range of songs were recorded, including ballads, "weird ethereal things" and 1990's R&B and Afrobeat-inspired songs. Columbia Records were reportedly overwhelmed with the "sheer volume of material she presented to them".

The final cut of "4" comprises twelve tracks on the standard edition and eighteen on the deluxe edition—three of which are remixes of "<a href="Run%20the%20World%20%28Girls%29">Run the World (Girls)</a>". Critics viewed "4" as a major departure from Beyoncé's previous catalogue, with a distinctive mellower sound. The album consists mostly of mid-tempo R&B songs, with 1970s <a href="funk">funk</a>, 1980s <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and 1990s soul influences. The second half was more eclectic, exploring a variety of genres including <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a> and <a href="adult%20contemporary%20music">adult contemporary</a>. "The Guardian" complimented the album's divergence from the "layering [of] <a href="Eurodance">Euro</a>-<a href="synthesizer">synths</a> on pop-step woomphs" that characterize the music of Beyoncé's contemporaries.

The balladry of the first half of "4" combines diverse vocal styles with the use of live instrumentation. "1+1" demonstrates Beyoncé's vocal-flexing over "magnificent guitar bombast" and a soft backing beat, while "Start Over", a mid tempo R&B ballad, uses a futuristic beat with electric elements and synthesizers. "I Miss You", with its "layers of atmospheric <a href="keyboard%20instrument">keyboards</a>", ambient synthesizers and tinny <a href="Roland%20TR-808">808 drums</a> was sung in a half-whisper to exhibit intense emotion. "I Was Here", an understated pop-R&B ballad with indie rock inflections, primarily concerns self-reflection with dramatic vocals.

On other songs, Beyoncé explores womanhood. "Best Thing I Never Had", "4"s fourth track, was described as a moment of self-realization and a "female call to arms". With vocals that allude to a "wounded bird turned resilient lioness", the song is built on a "winkly piano riff and beefy bass drums". "<a href="Dance%20for%20You">Dance for You</a>" conveys a more sexual tone through breathy vocals and blaring electric guitars. It forgoes her typical empowerment themes in favor of sensual imagery and comfort with one's partner. "Run the World (Girls)", a female empowerment anthem reminiscent of Beyoncé's more contemporary work on "I Am... Sasha Fierce", uses an energetic sample of <a href="Major%20Lazer">Major Lazer</a>'s "<a href="Pon%20de%20Floor">Pon de Floor</a>". The song incorporates "layered melodics", most prominently a military marching drumbeat, while Beyoncé's near-chanted delivery encompasses her full vocal range.
The tracks "<a href="Countdown%20%28Beyonc%C3%A9%20song%29">Countdown</a>" and "End of Time" were distinguished by their musical and lyrical experimentalism. "Countdown" was described as "everywhere on the genre map", although predominantly <a href="dancehall">dancehall</a>-led with a "bristling brass arrangement". Its chorus describes a relationship by counting backwards from ten, using a sample from <a href="Boyz%20II%20Men">Boyz II Men</a>'s "<a href="Uhh%20Ahh">Uhh Ahh</a>". "End of Time"s pulsating, brass sound—reminiscent of a marching-band—was heavily influenced by Afrobeat musician Fela Kuti. Kuti's use of horns and percussion instruments was recreated and combined with elements of <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> and synthesizers. "<a href="Lay%20Up%20Under%20Me%23Beyonc%C3%A9%20version">Lay Up Under Me</a>" is also built on retro horns, featuring upbeat vocals, a sound Ryan Dombal of "Pitchfork" associated with Michael Jackson's 1979 album "<a href="Off%20the%20Wall%20%28album%29">Off the Wall</a>".

Other tracks were noted for their retro stylization. "Rather Die Young" is a throwback to 1960s <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> and <a href="Philadelphia%20soul">Philadelphia soul</a>, with a slow tempo and modern drums. "Party" achieves a vintage aesthetic through minimalistic production, replete with heavy synthesizers and a 1980s smooth-funk groove. The song is unique for its conversation-like structure, in which Beyoncé and guest-vocalist <a href="Andr%C3%A9%203000">André 3000</a> sing verses that allude to socialization at parties. Elements of <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>'s style was found on "Schoolin' Life" and "I Care". "Schoolin' Life" is an uptempo funk song, with lyrics that advise the listener to live life to the fullest while cautioning them about the consequences of excess. The chorus of "I Care" was compared to "<a href="Purple%20Rain%20%28song%29">Purple Rain</a>", with themes of sadness and resentment, the song uses soft background vocals and dense percussion. "Love on Top" was noted for its energetic key changes with a joyful tone, evoking the work of Michael and <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>. Its retro sound is marked by a melding of <a href="French%20horn">horns</a> as well as sweet backing harmonies that are most prominent on its bridge and chorus.

In an interview for "Billboard", Beyoncé stated that despite having another concept for the album, she was ultimately influenced by her <a href="fan%20%28person%29">fan</a>s to name the album "4". She described the number four as being "special" to her, as her and Jay-Z's birthday, several other family and friends' birthdays, and her wedding anniversary fall on the fourth day of the month. The cover of the standard edition was revealed on Beyoncé's website on May 18, 2011. Shot on the rooftop of the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Meurice">Hôtel Meurice</a> in Paris, Beyoncé is looking into the distance with her arms raised over her head, wearing smokey eye makeup, thick gold cuffs and a fox-fur stole by cult French designer Alexandre Vauthier, embellished with <a href="Swarovski">Swarovski crystals</a> by the <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lesage">Lesage</a> embroidery house. The cover of the deluxe edition was shown on June 16, where Beyoncé is dressed in a tight-fitting blue-purple dress by French designer Maxime Simoens, holding her hands in her hair. For its artwork, she opted for clothing made by lesser-known designers. The promotional and interior-package images for "4" were shot at the same time.

On May 18, 2011, "4"s release date in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> was confirmed on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was <a href="internet%20leak">leaked</a> onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>, commenting, "My music was leaked and while this is not how I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" reported that <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music</a> were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of "4".

"4" received positive reviews from music critics. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">weighted mean</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 36 reviews. Michael Cragg of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called it Beyoncé's "most accomplished album yet". "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s Eric Henderson believed "4" succeeds vocally as an album of mostly intimate and slow-tempo ballads. Mikael Wood of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine applauded its ballads, mid-tempo songs, and evocations of late 1970s and early 1980s <a href="Soul%20music%23Detroit%20%28Motown%29%20soul">pop-soul</a>. In his review for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Jody%20Rosen">Jody Rosen</a> wrote that Beyoncé eschews contemporary production styles for a more personal and idiosyncratic album. Jon Caramanica of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" viewed it as a good showcase for Beyoncé as a <a href="torch%20song">torch singer</a>, because she convincingly sings about heartbreak and the strong emotional effect of love. "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">"Pitchfork"</a>" critic Ryan Dombal found it easygoing, retro-informed, and engaging because it shows "one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Andy Kellman said that the quality of Beyoncé's singing and the songwriting compensate for the assorted arrangement of the songs. "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" viewed it is an exceptional album in spite of occasionally trite lyrics.

In a less enthusiastic review, Adam Markovitz of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" said the first half of "4" is marred by boring ballads and the songwriting in general are not on-par with Beyoncé's vocal talent. In his review for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a> was ambivalent towards the album's 1980s influence and argued that, despite well written songs, it is not very consequential. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's Claire Suddath said the songs lack lyrical substance, even though they are performed well. <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a>, writing in the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", called "4" inconsistent, short, and unfinished. "NME" magazine's Hamish MacBain felt Beyoncé did not progress from her past work and that "even the OK bits here" sounded "uninspired".

"4" was included on various publication's year-end lists. It was ranked as the best album of the year by "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", and came in the runner-up spot on lists produced by "Spin" and <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a>. The album was ranked within the top 10 by MSN, where it came in at number three, "<a href="The%20Guardian%20%28newspaper%29">The Guardian</a>" and "<a href="MTV">MTV</a>", which placed it at number four, and the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", which placed it at number six. The "<a href="BBC">BBC</a>" ranked it at number seven, while "The New York Times" listed it as the 10th best album of the year. The album had strong showings on other lists, where it was placed number 13 by "<a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>", number 18 by "<a href="Stereogum">Stereogum</a>", number 25 by "Rolling Stone", number 39 by "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", number 10 by "<a href="Club%20Fonograma">Club Fonograma</a>," number 34 by "Pretty Much Amazing" and number 27 by "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork</a>". "4" was included in <a href="NPR">NPR</a>'s Top 50 Favorite Albums of 2011, and was ranked at number 26 in the "<a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>"'s critics poll. It was listed at 37 on "Rolling Stone"s Women Who Rock: 50 Greatest Albums of All Time. Pitchfork Media ranked the album at 39 on their list of the Top 100 Best Albums of the decade thus far, Kyle Kramer wrote that "4" "avoided the trappings of safe, later-career bids, instead setting up the perfect platform for Beyoncé as the pop star, a queen for all the people." The album was included on Consequence of Sound's list of The 10 Best Summer Albums of All Time with Kenneth Partridge writing that "whether she's hopelessly heartbroken or crazy in love, Queen Bey works damn hard to make you feel exactly what she's feeling".

"4" won R&B Album of the Year at the <a href="2012%20Billboard%20Music%20Awards">2012 "Billboard" Music Awards</a> and received nominations at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202011">2011 American Music Awards</a>, the <a href="Soul%20Train%20Music%20Awards">2011 Soul Train Music Awards</a>, the <a href="38th%20People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">38th People's Choice Awards</a>, the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award">43rd NAACP Image Awards</a> and the <a href="Grammis">2012 Grammis</a>.

"4"s first-week sales became Beyoncé's lowest sales start with a studio album to date. Keith Caulfield of "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine noted that the album was not released during the festive season and that Beyoncé was so far lacking a hit single, which could help explain the album's softer entry. It marks the third-largest sales week of the year, after the number-one bows of <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a>'s "<a href="Born%20This%20Way%20%28album%29">Born This Way</a>" and <a href="Adele">Adele</a>'s "<a href="21%20%28Adele%20album%29">21</a>".

Oxalaia

Oxalaia (in reference to the African deity "<a href="Oxal%C3%A1">Oxalá</a>") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Spinosauridae">spinosaurid</a> <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in what is now the <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeast Region</a> of Brazil during the <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> <a href="Geological%20stage">stage</a> of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geologic%20time%29">Period</a>, sometime between 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. Its only known <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s were found in 1999 on <a href="Cajual%20Island">Cajual Island</a> in the rocks of the <a href="Alc%C3%A2ntara%20Formation">Alcântara Formation</a>, which is known for its abundance of fragmentary, isolated fossil specimens. The remains of "Oxalaia" were described in <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a> by Brazilian <a href="palaeontologist">palaeontologist</a> <a href="Alexander%20Kellner">Alexander Kellner</a> and colleagues, who assigned the specimens to a new genus containing one <a href="species">species</a>, Oxalaia quilombensis. The species name refers to the Brazilian <a href="quilombo">quilombo</a> settlements. "Oxalaia quilombensis" is the eighth officially named theropod species from Brazil and the largest carnivorous dinosaur discovered there. It is closely related to the African genus "<a href="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>".

Although "Oxalaia" is known only from two partial skull bones, Kellner and colleagues found that its teeth and had a few distinct features not seen in other spinosaurids or theropods, including two replacement teeth in each socket and a very sculptured <a href="secondary%20palate">secondary palate</a>. "Oxalaia" habitat was tropical, heavily forested, and surrounded by an arid landscape. This environment had a large variety of lifeforms also present in <a href="Middle%20Cretaceous">Middle-Cretaceous</a> North Africa, due to the connection of South America and Africa as parts of the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. As a spinosaurid, the traits of "Oxalaia" skull and dentition indicate a partly <a href="piscivorous">piscivorous</a> (fish-eating) lifestyle similar to that of modern <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns. Fossil evidence suggests spinosaurids also preyed on other animals such as small dinosaurs and <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s.

"Oxalaia" stems from the <a href="Alc%C3%A2ntara%20Formation">Alcântara Formation</a>, a succession of <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a>s that is part of the <a href="Itapecuru%20Group">Itapecuru Group</a> of the <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Lu%C3%ADs-Graja%C3%BA%20Basin">São Luís-Grajaú Basin</a>, in northeastern Brazil. These rocks have been dated by scientists to the <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28geology%29">stage</a> of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geologic%20time%29">Period</a>, 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. Outcropping at the northern coast of the formation, the Laje do Coringa locality is made up mostly of <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s and <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>s, along with <a href="Conglomerate%20%28geology%29">conglomerate</a> rock layers containing fossil plant and <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> fragments. These sediments were deposited under marine and <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> conditions similar to those of the <a href="Bahariya%20Formation">Bahariya Formation</a> in Egypt, where "<a href="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>" remains have been found. In 1999, <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of "Oxalaia" were recovered from the Laje do Coringa. <a href="Palaeontologist">Palaeontologist</a> Elaine Machado, of the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">National Museum of Rio de Janeiro</a>, was surprised to find such a well-preserved fossil at the site and stated in a press release that "this is how most scientific discoveries happen, it was by accident". The finding was a rare occurrence due to the erosive nature of the tides at the deposit, which are responsible for the fragmented state of most fossils in the <a href="bone%20bed">bone bed</a>; remains not found on site are often removed from the formation by wave action. Generally, the majority of fossil remains found at the Alcântara Formation consist of teeth and isolated skeletal elements, of which the Laje do Coringa site has yielded hundreds.

"Oxalaia" is one of three <a href="Spinosauridae">spinosaurids</a> discovered in Brazil, the other two being "<a href="Irritator">Irritator</a>" and its possible <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> "Angaturama", both of which were also initially known from partial skulls. They were discovered in the <a href="Romualdo%20Formation">Romualdo Formation</a> of the <a href="Santana%20Group">Santana Group</a>, part of the <a href="Araripe%20Basin">Araripe Basin</a>. <a href="Microfossils">Microfossils</a> date this formation to the <a href="Albian">Albian</a>, around nine to six million years before "Oxalaia". The fossil record of spinosaurids is poor compared to those of other <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> groups; very few body fossils are known and most <a href="genera">genera</a> have been erected from isolated elements such as vertebra or teeth. The <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of "Oxalaia quilombensis", designated <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Brazil">MN</a> 6117-V, was found "in situ" (at its original place of deposition) with part of the left side embedded in the rock matrix; it consists of the fused <a href="Premaxilla">praemaxillae</a> (frontmost snout bones) from a large individual. An isolated and incomplete left (main upper jaw bone) fragment (MN 6119-V) was referred to "Oxalaia" because it showed the same general traits occurring in spinosaurids, the maxilla was discovered on the rock surface, having possibly moved from its original location after erosion. Both bone fragments were found on <a href="Cajual%20Island">Cajual Island</a>, <a href="Maranh%C3%A3o">Maranhão</a>, in the <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Northeast Region</a> of Brazil, and were housed at the National Museum of <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. In 2018, <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Brazil%20fire">a fire</a> engulfed the palace housing the museum, possibly destroying "Oxalaia"s specimens, along with various other fossils found in Brazil. Besides the partial skull bones, numerous spinosaurid teeth had earlier been reported from the Laje do Coringa site.

The discoveries of "Oxalaia" and of the Late Cretaceous reptiles "<a href="Pepesuchus">Pepesuchus</a>" and "<a href="Brasiliguana">Brasiliguana</a>" were announced in a presentation by the <a href="Brazilian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Brazilian Academy of Sciences</a> in March 2011. Machado described "Oxalaia" as "the dominant reptile of [what is now] Cajual Island". She stated that there is interest in spinosaurids in Brazil and abroad because of their debut in the "<a href="Jurassic%20Park">Jurassic Park</a>" franchise and their distinctiveness among other carnivorous dinosaurs. The <a href="species%20description">species description</a> of "Oxalaia" was written by Brazilian palaeontologists <a href="Alexander%20Kellner">Alexander Kellner</a>, Elaine Machado, Sergio Azevedo, Deise Henriques, and Luciana Carvalho. This paper, among many others, were composed into a volume of 20 works on prehistoric biodiversity that was published by the Academy in March <a href="2011%20in%20paleontology">2011</a>. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "Oxalaia quilombensis" is the eighth officially named species of theropod from Brazil. The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> "Oxalaia" is derived from the name of the African deity <a href="Oxal%C3%A1">Oxalá</a>, which was introduced into Brazil during the slavery period. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "quilombensis" refers to the <a href="quilombo">quilombo</a> settlements like those on Cajual Island, which were founded by escaped slaves.

The holotype praemaxillae are together approximately long, with a preserved width of (maximal estimated original width is ), and a height of . Based on skeletal material from related spinosaurids, the skull of "Oxalaia" would have been an estimated long; this is smaller than "Spinosaurus" skull, which was approximated at long by Italian palaeontologist <a href="Cristiano%20Dal%20Sasso">Cristiano Dal Sasso</a> and colleagues in 2005. Kellner and his team compared the Dal Sasso specimen (MSNM V4047) to "Oxalaia" original snout in 2011; from this they estimated "Oxalaia" at in length and in weight, making it the largest known theropod from Brazil, the second largest being "<a href="Pycnonemosaurus">Pycnonemosaurus</a>," which was estimated at by one study.

The tip of the <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> (snout) is enlarged and the rear-end constricted, forming the terminal <a href="Rosette%20%28design%29">rosette</a> shape that distinguishes spinosaurids; this form would have interlocked with the also-expanded front of the (tooth-bearing bone of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a>). The rostrum of "Oxalaia" features broad, deep (holes) that are possibly <a href="nutrient%20canal">nutrient canal</a>s for blood vessels and nerves; it is also rounder in side view than that of "Spinosaurus", whose upper jaw ends in a more acute downward angle as shown by specimens MSNM V4047 and MNHN SAM 124. The maxillae show a pair of elongated and thin processes extending forwards along the midline of the roof of the mouth; they are encased between the praemaxillae and border an elaborate, triangle-shaped pit at their front end. Similar processes are present in "<a href="Suchomimus">Suchomimus</a>", "<a href="Cristatusaurus">Cristatusaurus</a>", and MNHN SAM 124, although not as exposed. These structures compose the animal's <a href="secondary%20palate">secondary palate</a>. The undersides of the praemaxillae are greatly ornamented in "Oxalaia", in contrast to the smoother condition it has in other spinosaurids.

The praemaxillae have seven (tooth sockets) on each side, the same number found in "<a href="Angaturama">Angaturama</a>", "Cristatusaurus", "Suchomimus", and MNHN SAM 124 (referred to "Spinosaurus"); MSNM V4047, another upper jaw specimen from "Spinosaurus", had only six. It cannot be confirmed whether this lower number of teeth is due to <a href="ontogeny">ontogeny</a>; for that, a larger <a href="Sample%20size%20determination">sample size</a> is necessary. A large <a href="diastema">diastema</a> (gap in tooth row) separates the third tooth socket from the fourth; this is observed in all other spinosaurids, being smaller in "Suchomimus". Another diastema of nearly equal length is found between the fifth and sixth alveolus; this diastema is seen in MNHN SAM 124 and is much longer in MSNM V4047 but is absent from "Suchomimus" and "Cristatusaurus". The maxilla fragment referred to "Oxalaia" (MN 6119-V) has two alveoli and a broken third one that includes a partial tooth. Like the praemaxilla, it had preserved nutrient canals. It also features a shallow dent in the middle, suggesting it was located near the (bony nostrils). Small fragments inside some of the remaining alveoli show that unlike its <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> relatives "Suchomimus" and "Cristatusaurus", "Oxalaia" lacked on its teeth. Apart from the single, functional tooth in each socket, there were two <a href="replacement%20teeth">replacement teeth</a>, which according to Kellner are "a common feature in <a href="Shark%20tooth">sharks</a> or in some reptiles, but not in theropods". A cross-section of the teeth showed the typical oval shape exhibited by spinosaurs rather than the lateral compression of other theropod teeth.

The spinosaurid teeth reported from Laje do Coringa were classified into two primary <a href="morphotype">morphotype</a>s by Brazilian palaeontologist <a href="Manuel%20Medeiros">Manuel Medeiros</a> in 2006. Both show typical spinosaurine dentition, though morphotype II has smoother tooth enamel than the first. "Oxalaia" teeth display a closer morphology to morphotype I while the second grouping of teeth represent either worn down morphotype I teeth or an undescribed spinosaurine from the Alcântara Formation.

The type elements of "Oxalaia" closely resemble those of specimens MSNM V4047 and MNHN SAM 124, both referred to "Spinosaurus aegyptiacus," but "Oxalaia" can be differentiated from it and other spinosaurids by its <a href="Autapomorphy">autapomorphic</a> (distinguishing) craniodental features, like its sculptured palatal part of the premaxillae, and the possession of two replacement teeth in each position. More fragmentary spinosaurids such as "<a href="Siamosaurus">Siamosaurus</a>" and "<a href="%26quot%3BSinopliosaurus%26quot%3B%20fusuiensis">"Sinopliosaurus" fusuiensis</a>" are based only on teeth, making them difficult to separate from other <a href="taxa">taxa</a>. The habit of naming theropods from isolated teeth or tooth fragments has resulted in many invalid and synonymous genera; it has also occurred with spinosaurids and is compounded by the common lack of overlapping skeletal remains—a precondition of validly distinguishing taxa.

In 2017, a phylogenetic analysis by the Brazilian palaeontologists Marcos Sales and Cesar Schultz concluded that "Oxalaia" was more closely related to African spinosaurines than to Brazilian spinosaurines like "Angaturama", as indicated by a wider snout and the lack of a dorsal <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> on the praemaxillae. The Brazilian genera "Oxalaia" and "Angaturama" were recovered as the two closest relatives of "Spinosaurus", "Oxalaia" forming its <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a>. Though fragmentary, the Brazilian material indicates that spinosaurines were more diverse than previously recognized. "Spinosaurus" differs from "Oxalaia" by its significantly more widely spaced tooth sockets, the presence of a slight narrowing between its third and fourth sockets, and the sharper slope of its snout. "Oxalaia" is currently assigned to the <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Spinosauridae">Spinosaurinae</a> due to the morphology of its upper jaw and the absence of fine serrations on its teeth that typify <a href="baryonychine">baryonychine</a>s. Below is a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> by Sales and Schultz, in which "Oxalaia" is grouped in the Spinosaurinae, as a closer relative to "Spinosaurus" than "Angaturama".

The Late Cretaceous deposits of the Alcântara Formation have been interpreted as a humid habitat of tropical forests dominated by <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, <a href="fern">fern</a>s, and <a href="horsetails">horsetails</a>. These forests were surrounded by an arid-to-<a href="Semi-arid%20climate">semi-arid</a> landscape that was probably subjected to brief periods of heavy rainfall followed by lengthy dry periods. A great abundance and variety of animal taxa, such as dinosaurs, <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, snakes, <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, <a href="crocodilia">crocodilia</a>ns, <a href="Notosuchidae">notosuchids</a>, and fish have been discovered in the formation. Aquatic taxa known from the deposits include the large <a href="coelacanth">coelacanth</a> "<a href="Mawsonia%20gigas">Mawsonia gigas</a>"; the ray "<a href="Myliobatis">Myliobatis</a>"; two <a href="Sclerorhynchidae">sclerorhynchid</a> <a href="sawfish">sawfish</a>es; as well as several <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a>, <a href="Ray%20finned%20fish">ray-finned fish</a>, and <a href="lungfish">lungfish</a> species. Dinosaur fossil remains suggest the presence of <a href="Diplodocid">diplodocoids</a>, basal <a href="titanosaur">titanosaur</a>s, the giant theropod "<a href="Carcharodontosaurus">Carcharodontosaurus</a>", a <a href="Noasauridae">noasaurid</a> closely related to "<a href="Masiakasaurus">Masiakasaurus</a>", and a possible <a href="velociraptorine">velociraptorine</a> <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a>. Also, characteristic teeth and a single vertebral centrum were referred to "Spinosaurus sp."

Most of the flora and fauna discovered in the Alcântara Formation was also present in North Africa in the <a href="Kem%20Kem%20Beds">Kem Kem Beds</a> of Morocco during the Cenomanian; with a few exceptions including "Oxalaia quilombensis, <a href="Atlanticopristis">Atlanticopristis</a> equatorialis, <a href="Equinoxiodus">Equinoxiodus</a> alcantariensis", and "<a href="Coringasuchus">Coringasuchus</a> anisodontis". According to Medeiros and colleagues, the Laje do Coringa assemblage may also be linked to the contemporaneous Bahariya Formation in Egypt, which holds a distinct combination of key taxa constituting "Spinosaurus aegyptiacus", "Carcharodontosaurus saharicus", and "<a href="Onchopristis">Onchopristis</a> numidus." This extreme similarity between the Cretaceous <a href="Biota%20%28biology%29">biota</a> of Brazil with that of Africa is a result of their connection as parts of the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> (which comprised most landmasses of the modern southern hemisphere). This connection was broken by rifting and sea-floor spreading 130–110 million years ago. Afterwards, the transoceanic assemblages would have continued to evolve separately, contributing to small differences between taxa. Machado stated that Cajual Island was still attached to the African continent during the Cenomanian. Similarly, Medeiros and colleagues noted that the presence of an island chain or other lasting land connection during that time could explain the faunal similarities.

Spinosaurids likely spent most of their time near or in water and fed mostly on aquatic animals, avoiding direct competition with other large predators but being able to sustain themselves on terrestrial animals if necessary. Such behavior is observed in cases such as juvenile "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>" bones found in the stomach cavity of a "<a href="Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a>" fossil and an "Irritator" tooth embedded in pterosaur remains. The conical, transversely oval-shaped teeth of "Oxalaia" and its nasal openings, that were retracted further back on the skull than in most theropods (likely to avoid water entering its nostrils while fishing) are characteristic of spinosaurids. Both features are useful adaptations for catching and feeding on fish. The expanded, interlocking front jaws and piercing teeth of spinosaurs worked as an efficient fish trap, a trait also exhibited by the <a href="Indian%20Gharial">Indian gharial</a>—the most <a href="piscivorous">piscivorous</a> extant crocodilian. Kellner compared the general appearance of spinosaurid skulls to those of <a href="alligator">alligator</a>s.

Operation Kita

Before departing Singapore, the Japanese ships, which were designated the Completion Force, were loaded with supplies of <a href="oil">oil</a> and other important raw materials. This formed part of an effort to run increased quantities of supplies through the Allied <a href="blockade">blockade</a> of Japan before the country was cut off from its empire. The Allies had learned of the Completion Force's composition and goals through <a href="military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> gained from decrypting Japanese radio signals, and plans were developed for coordinated attacks on it by submarines and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) aircraft. As part of these preparations, 26 submarines were eventually positioned along the ships' expected route.

The Completion Force sailed on 10 February 1945 and was sighted leaving port by a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> submarine. However, attempts by it and several <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> submarines to attack between 11 and 14 February were unsuccessful. More than 88 USAAF aircraft attempted to bomb the Completion Force on 13 and 14 February, but were unable to do so because of bad weather. A further submarine attack on 16 February did not damage any of the Japanese ships. As a result, the Completion Force reached its destination of <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a> in Japan on 20 February without having suffered any casualties. Despite this success, the Japanese Government was forced to discontinue its efforts to ship oil from Southeast Asia to Japan in March due to the heavy losses Allied submarines were inflicting on <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a>s, and all the ships of the Completion Force were sunk in or near Japanese home waters before the end of the war.

During 1944, <a href="Allied%20submarines%20in%20the%20Pacific%20War">Allied submarine attacks</a> effectively cut off the supply of oil from Southeast Asia to Japan and greatly reduced Japanese imports of other commodities. By this stage of the war, the oil reserves in Japan had been largely depleted. U.S. Navy submarines sank many Japanese warships during 1944, including the battleship , seven <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, two <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy</a> and seven <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s. In early 1945, the Japanese Government assessed that all <a href="convoy">convoy</a> routes from the south would eventually be cut, and attempted to supplement the supplies of oil brought in by <a href="Oil%20tanker">tankers</a> by loading drums of oil on <a href="Cargo%20ship">freighters</a>. Several IJN <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s were also used to transport drums of oil from <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> to Japan.

On 11 November 1944, the two "Ise"-class hybrid battleship-aircraft carriers— and , which were grouped as <a href="Fourth%20Carrier%20Division">Carrier Division 4</a> and under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Matsuda%20Chiaki">Matsuda Chiaki</a>—sailed from the Japanese home islands to join the main body of the IJN in the Southwest Pacific. This deployment was made to both reinforce the remaining elements of the IJN in the area and place the ships near a source of fuel. During their voyage from Japan, each of the battleship-carriers was loaded with about of munitions for the units defending <a href="Manila">Manila</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Due to heavy Allied air attacks on Manila, the two warships unloaded their supplies in the <a href="Spratly%20Islands">Spratly Islands</a> from 14 November. They sailed for <a href="Lingga%20Roads">Lingga Roads</a> near Singapore on the 20th of the month and arrived there two days later. The Allies learned from intelligence gained by <a href="Cryptanalysis">decrypting</a> Japanese radio signals that the battleship-carriers had sailed. Allied submarines were ordered to keep watch for the ships, but did not intercept "Ise" or "Hyūga" during their voyage to Singapore. The two battleship-carriers were deployed to <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a> in Indochina during December and returned to Singapore on 11 January 1945. The <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">U.S. Third Fleet</a> <a href="South%20China%20Sea%20raid">raided the South China Sea</a> between 10 and 20 January in search of the Japanese fleet, but did not locate "Ise" or "Hyūga".
In early February 1945, "Ise", "Hyūga" and an escort of smaller warships received orders to sail to Japan in what was designated Operation "Kita". The goal of this operation was to return some of the IJN warships in the Southwest Pacific to Japan loaded with important supplies. The ships selected to accompany the battleship-carriers were the light cruiser (which became part of Carrier Division 4 from 10 February) and destroyers , and . Carrier Division 4 and its escorts was designated the Completion Force.

The ships of the Completion Force departed the Lingga Roads on 6 February and began loading their cargoes in Singapore the next day. Shortly before docking, "Ise" sustained a small amount of damage when she struck a <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> which had been <a href="Bombing%20of%20Singapore%20%281944%E2%80%931945%29">dropped by Allied aircraft</a>. During the Completion Force's period at Singapore all six ships were loaded with supplies and "Ise" received temporary repairs. "Hyūga" embarked 4,944 drums of <a href="Avgas">aviation gasoline</a> as well as 326 drums of standard <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> and 440 oil field workers. "Ise" was loaded with 5,200 drums of aviation gasoline and 551 oil workers; each of the battleship-carriers also embarked of <a href="rubber">rubber</a>, 1,750 short tons of <a href="tin">tin</a> and of other metals. "Ōyodo" was loaded with of tin, of <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, 70 tons of aviation gasoline, of rubber, of <a href="zinc">zinc</a> and of <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>. A further of rubber and tin was split among the three destroyers.

Through code breaking, Allied intelligence was aware of the Completion Force's composition and objectives. Allied <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> units carefully monitored radio transmissions in the Singapore region, and the resulting "<a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>" intelligence provided details of the two battleship-carriers' movements to Singapore, preparations to return to Japan and planned route. The commander of Allied submarines in the South-West Pacific Area (<a href="Task%20Force%2071">Task Force 71</a>), Rear Admiral <a href="James%20Fife%2C%20Jr.">James Fife, Jr.</a>, placed a high priority on stopping "Ise" and "Hyūga" from reaching Japan, and stationed 15 submarines along their expected route. A plan for coordinated attacks on the ships by the U.S. Navy and USAAF was developed. At the time, the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">U.S. Seventh Fleet</a> was assigned four battleships in Filipino waters to guard the Allied beachhead at <a href="Lingayen%20Gulf">Lingayen Gulf</a> in <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> against attacks by the Japanese forces based at Lingga Roads and the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a> until the USAAF forces in the region were strong enough to assume this responsibility. As of early February, the USAAF units in the Philippines were focused on supporting the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>–led <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">Philippines Campaign</a> and attacking Japanese facilities in <a href="Taiwan">Formosa</a>. An intensive campaign against Japanese shipping in the South China Sea had been planned, but was yet to begin.

The Completion Force sailed from Singapore on the evening of 10 February. The timing of its departure was set by a long-term forecast of bad weather for the voyage to Japan. The British submarine observed the ships leaving port and attempted to attack them on 11 February, but was driven off by a Japanese aircraft. Following this action, "Tantalus" radioed a contact report to Fife's headquarters. The four U.S. Navy battleships at Lingayen Gulf sailed on 10 February bound for U.S. bases in the Pacific where they were to receive repairs and undertake preparations ahead of their role supporting the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invasion of Okinawa</a>. The ships left the Philippines area on 14 February without having played any part in efforts to intercept the Completion Force.

U.S. Navy submarines unsuccessfully attempted to attack the Japanese ships on 12 February. At about 1:45 pm, detected the Completion Force at a distance of using her radar and transmitted a contact report. An hour later, made radar contact with the Japanese ships at a range of . Over the next 14 hours the submarines "Blackfin", "Charr", , and attempted to reach a position where they could attack the Japanese ships, but were unable to do so. A group of submarines to the north—comprising , and —was unable to reach a position where they could attack the Completion Force.

USAAF patrols made contact with the Completion Force on 12 February; following this, it was tracked almost continuously by radar-equipped Army Air Forces and U.S. Navy aircraft. On the morning of 13 February, a force of <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers and 40 <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers escorted by 48 <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> fighters was dispatched from several bases on the islands of <a href="Leyte">Leyte</a> and <a href="Mindoro">Mindoro</a> to attack the Japanese ships. While the aircraft successfully rendezvoused near the Completion Force, heavy cloud cover kept them from spotting any of the ships. As radar-directed blind bombing was prohibited to avoid accidental attacks on the Allied submarines in the area, the strike force returned to its bases without attacking. On the same day, the Australian destroyers and departed Lingayen Gulf and proceeded to a position about west of Manila where they were held in readiness to rescue the crews of any aircraft downed while attacking the Completion Force.

More submarines attempted to attack the Japanese force on 13 February. A group of three boats—comprising , and —was deployed along its route, and "Bergall" sighted the Japanese ships at 12:30 pm. The submarine was submerged at the time and attempted to maneuver into a firing position, but could not get any closer to the ships than . Nevertheless, it fired six <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es at the Japanese force, all of which missed. "Blower" attempted a submerged attack, but the five torpedoes it fired at one of the battleship-carriers and "Ōyodo" missed. and , the northernmost submarines that Rear Admiral Fife had deployed, encountered the Completion Force during the afternoon of 13 February. "Bashaw" sighted the Japanese ships as they emerged from a rain squall at 3:15 pm, but one of the battleship-carriers spotted the submarine and launched an aircraft to attack it. "Bashaw" was forced to dive when the battleship-carrier began shelling it with her <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a>, and neither it nor "Flasher" was able to intercept the Completion Force. During this period the other submarines in the area continued to chase the Japanese ships but did not regain contact with them.

An air attack was attempted against the Completion Force on 14 February. The number of B-24s, B-25s and escorting P-51s dispatched on this day was smaller than the force which had been used on 13 February, as the Japanese ships were now beyond the range of aircraft based at Leyte. Once again, cloud cover over the Completion Force prevented the Allied aircraft from sighting the Japanese ships, and they were unable to attack due to the prohibition on radar-aimed bombing. This was the USAAF's last attempt to bomb the Japanese force. As a result, the only successes gained by the USAAF aircraft involved in the operation were to shoot down a <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-57">Mitsubishi Ki-57</a> "Topsy" transport plane near the Completion Force on 13 February as well as several fighters in the area of the ships between the 12th and 14th of the month. The two Australian destroyers were released for other duties on 15 February.

Vice Admiral <a href="Charles%20A.%20Lockwood">Charles A. Lockwood</a>—the commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">U.S. Pacific Fleet's</a> submarine force—followed the unsuccessful attempts to intercept the Completion Force in the South China Sea, and stationed a further eleven submarines along its projected route between the <a href="Luzon%20Strait">Luzon Strait</a> and Japan. The Completion Force reached the <a href="Matsu%20Islands">Matsu Islands</a> at the northern end of the <a href="Taiwan%20Strait">Formosa Strait</a> in the evening of 15 February, and anchored there for five hours. The Japanese ships resumed their journey to Kure via Korea and the <a href="Shimonoseki%20Strait">Shimonoseki Strait</a> at midnight, and the destroyers and were attached to the force for part of the day. At 5:07 am on 16 February, intercepted the Completion Force south of the Chinese city of <a href="Wenzhou">Wenchow</a> and fired six torpedoes at one of the escorts, but all missed. At this time the Japanese ships were sailing at a speed of . None of the other American submarines made contact with the Japanese force as it sailed to the east of where they had been positioned by Lockwood.

The Completion Force finished its entire voyage in about 10 days; after slipping the Allied patrols it anchored off <a href="Zhoushan">Chusan Island</a> near <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> from 9:06 pm on 16 February until 7:00 am on 18 February, when it sailed for Sanzenpo Harbor near <a href="Sacheon">Sacheon</a> on the southern coast of Korea. It arrived there at 4:00 pm that day, and anchored overnight. The Completion Force departed Sanzenpo Harbor at 7:00 am on 19 February and reached the Japanese island of <a href="Mutsurejima">Mutsurejima</a> at 4:00 pm that day. After anchoring overnight, the Completion Force docked at Kure at 10:00 am on 20 February. The ships of the Completion Force were among the last Japanese warships to reach the home islands from the Southwest Pacific.

The Allied naval commanders were disappointed by the failure of the 26 submarines directed against the Completion Force to inflict any damage on the ships. Fife concluded that this was due to the Completion Force's high speed, the poor weather conditions at the time of the operation and the Japanese ships being fitted with equipment that enabled them to detect submarines' radar signals. In a letter to Lockwood, he wrote that the failure of the submarines under his command "was a bitter pill to take and I make no alibi". Lockwood attributed the decision to deploy his submarines too far to the west on faulty intelligence, and told Fife that "our dope certainly went sour at the last moment. Perhaps I depended too much on it".

The use of freighters and warships to carry oil was successful in increasing Japanese oil imports, and the total level quality of oil which reached the country during the first quarter of 1945 was greater than the amounts achieved in late 1944. Nevertheless, Allied submarines sank the majority of the merchant tankers that attempted to sail from Southeast Asia to Japan during February, and in March the Japanese ceased attempting to import oil from this source. Following the departure of the Completion Force, the only major seaworthy Japanese warships remaining in the Southwest Pacific were the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and as well as the light cruiser . These three cruisers did not attempt to return to Japan, and all were sunk by Allied submarines and destroyers between April and June.

After reaching Japan, "Ise" and "Hyūga" were assigned to bolster the anti-aircraft defenses of the city of Kure and its naval base. Due to shortages of fuel and aircraft, the ships did not put to sea again, and both were sunk during the U.S. Navy's <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kure%20%28July%201945%29">attacks on Kure</a> between 24 and 28 July 1945. "Ōyodo" became part of the Kure Training Force and remained in port until she was sunk on 28 July. The three destroyers also failed to survive the war; "Asashimo" and "Kasumi" fell victim to American carrier aircraft while escorting the battleship during <a href="Operation%20Ten-Go">Operation "Ten-Go"</a> on 6 April, and "Hatsushimo" sank after striking a mine near <a href="Maizuru%2C%20Kyoto">Maizuru</a> on 30 July.

William Brill (RAAF officer)

William Lloyd Brill, & <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> (17May 1916 – 12October 1964) was a senior officer and bomber pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> district of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, he was a farmer and a member of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> before joining the RAAF in 1940. After <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">training in Australia and Canada</a>, he was posted to Britain in 1941 to take part in the <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command%23Strategic%20bombing%201942%E2%80%9345">air war over Europe</a>. Brill first saw combat with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B460%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 460 Squadron RAAF</a>, flying <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> medium bombers. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) in May 1942 for attacking a target after his plane was badly damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Following assignment as an instructor with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF), he returned to the bombing campaign in January 1944 as a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B463%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 463 Squadron RAAF</a>, flying <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bombers.

Brill's leadership and determination to complete his missions despite damage to his aircraft—on one occasion inflicted by another Lancaster's bombs from above—earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. Promoted to <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in May 1944, he took over <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B467%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 467 Squadron RAAF</a> after the death in combat of its then-commander, Group Captain <a href="John%20Balmer">John Balmer</a>. Brill was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DFC in July, for his skill in evading three German <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s. Returning to Australia, he remained in the Air Force after the war and led <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a> in 1949–50. He went on to command air bases at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Rathmines">Rathmines</a>, <a href="Fairbairn%2C%20Canberra">Canberra</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Townsville</a> during the 1950s and 1960s. Brill served two terms as RAAF Director of Personnel Services, in 1956–59 and 1960–63, by which time he had been promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>. His final posting was at the <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Department of Air</a> in Canberra. He died of a <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> in October 1964.

Brill was born on 17 May 1916 in the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> town of <a href="Ganmain">Ganmain</a>, New South Wales. He was the fourth of seven children of farmer Edward Brill and his wife Bertha, who were originally from <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. The Brills owned a property called "Clearview", and Bill attended the local school. He completed his education at <a href="Yanco%20Agricultural%20High%20School">Yanco Agricultural High</a>, gaining his <a href="Intermediate%20Certificate%20%28Australia%29">Intermediate Certificate</a> before joining his brothers in wheat farming. Thickly set and physically strong, he was a keen <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>er, playing for Ganmain, <a href="Grong%20Grong">Grong Grong</a>, and <a href="Matong">Matong</a>. On 5 January 1939, Brill enlisted in the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">21st Light Horse Regiment</a>, a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> unit, at <a href="Narrandera">Narrandera</a>. He was promoted to <a href="corporal">corporal</a> in May. The previous month he had been tested as a potential air cadet, the interview panel finding him a "quiet country chap" who was "rather slow" but "intelligent".

On 11 November 1940, Brill transferred to the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He went through the <a href="Empire%20Air%20Training%20Scheme">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS), undergoing initial instruction at <a href="RAAF%20Bradfield%20Park">RAAF Bradfield Park</a> in Sydney. Selected to be a pilot, he received his elementary flying training on <a href="De%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">De Havilland Tiger Moth</a>s at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Narrandera">RAAF Station Narrandera</a>. In March 1941, Brill was posted to Canada for advanced instruction on <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s at <a href="RCAF%20Station%20Calgary">No. 3 Service Flying Training School, Calgary</a>. He was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 28 July 1941, and sailed to Britain the next month. In October he began converting to <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> medium bombers at <a href="RAF%20Lichfield">No. 27 Operational Training Unit, Lichfield</a>, and was assigned to <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B460%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 460 Squadron RAAF</a>, which formed at <a href="RAF%20Molesworth">RAF Molesworth</a> the following month.

Raised under the <a href="Article%20XV%20squadrons">Article XV</a> provisions of EATS, No. 460 Squadron was one of several nominally Australian formations taking part in <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>'s strategic air campaign against Germany. In January 1942, the unit moved from Molesworth to <a href="RAF%20Breighton">RAF Breighton</a>, Yorkshire. Brill flew as a co-pilot in No. 460 Squadron's first operation, against the German port of <a href="Emden">Emden</a> in March. He was soon in command of his own Wellington, attacking targets in northern France. On 5 April 1942, he undertook his first <a href="sortie">sortie</a> against a well-defended city deep in enemy territory, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. He later recorded his apprehension before the raid:
On the night of 29/30 May 1942, Brill's was one of 27 aircraft detailed to bomb the <a href="Gnome%20et%20Rh%C3%B4ne">Gnome et Rhône</a>, <a href="Thomson-Houston%20Electric%20Company">Thomson Houston</a>, and <a href="Goodrich%20Corporation">Goodrich</a> factories in the Paris suburb of <a href="Gennevilliers">Gennevilliers</a>. The crews were required to have good visibility of the target area before bombing, to ensure accuracy and reduce civilian casualties. Due to foul weather over the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a>, Brill flew at an altitude of less than until crossing the French coast. The clouds had begun to clear over Paris and searchlights swept the sky, accompanied by heavy anti-aircraft fire. Most of the bombers released their loads from between , but Brill dropped to before making his attack. With the bomb bay doors open, his Wellington was struck by flak, damaging the hydraulics and rear gun turret, and leaving one of the bombs hanging after the others dropped on target. Returning to England through more bad weather, he spotted an emergency landing ground and brought the crippled Wellington down with the bomb doors still open and one tyre flat; the plane was later scrapped. Brill's was the only one of four Wellingtons from No. 460 Squadron to find the target area and successfully attack. For his "splendid courage and determination" in pressing home the assault, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> on 26 June, the first pilot in his squadron to be decorated.

No. 460 Squadron participated in <a href="Bombing%20of%20Cologne%20in%20World%20War%20II">1,000-bomber raids against Cologne</a>, <a href="Essen">Essen</a> and <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> in May and June 1942. Brill was promoted to acting <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in July, and completed his first tour of operations, numbering 31 sorties, on 11 August. He was seconded to the RAF as an instructor in November 1942, returning to No. 27 Operational Training Unit at Lichfield. He spent the next eleven months there, leading a training <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> and gaining promotion to acting <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in April 1943. In August, he was best man at the wedding of his friend and fellow RAAF pilot, Arthur Doubleday. The press would come to refer to the pair as the "Flying Twins", as their wartime careers closely paralleled one another—both men came from the Riverina district, joined the Air Force together on <a href="Remembrance%20Day">Remembrance Day</a> 1940, arrived in England in August 1941, flew Wellingtons in No. 460 Squadron, volunteered for second tours in Bomber Command, and received many decorations and promotions in tandem. Doubleday would go on to survive the war and become active in civil aviation.

Having volunteered for his second tour, Brill underwent conversion to <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Handley Page Halifax</a> and <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> heavy bombers in the last months of 1943. In the new year, he was appointed a flight commander in <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B463%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 463 Squadron RAAF</a>, operating Lancasters out of <a href="RAF%20Waddington">RAF Waddington</a>, Lincolnshire. Waddington was also home to another Australian squadron, <a href="No.%20467%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 467</a>, and Brill took an active part in the station's raucous mess life. His younger brother Vic, who had joined the RAAF in 1941, was in the same squadron. Brill returned to combat in the middle of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin%20%28RAF%20campaign%29">Battle of Berlin</a>, flying his first sortie to the "Big City" on 20 January 1944. The statistical likelihood of surviving an operational tour of 30 missions in Bomber Command was never more than 50%, but loss rates during the Battle of Berlin were far higher.

Brill took off for his second mission to Berlin on 27 January. The Lancaster he flew was said to be jinxed, possessed of an engine that lost power in the air but always tested well on the ground, and suffering oxygen failure that killed its rear gunner on the previous sortie. One of the engines did begin to falter before Brill reached Berlin, forcing him to fly lower than normal. Having released his bombs over target, he felt the plane take several strikes that he assumed were anti-aircraft fire, but were in fact the <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiaries</a> of a Lancaster flying above. His aircraft's nose, rudder controls, and electricals were all severely damaged, and the <a href="Port%20and%20starboard">port</a> wing was on fire. Having warned his crew to prepare to bail out, Brill dived the Lancaster and succeeded in putting out the flames. The crew was able to remain on board and, after a nine-hour flight, the plane landed back at Waddington. Brill's verdict on the mission was, as he later wrote, "not my idea of an evening's entertainment". He flew a total of eleven operations during the Battle of Berlin, including Bomber Command's costliest raid of the war, against <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> in March. On that occasion, one of his engines failed and another was damaged when he had to fly through a cloud of debris from a Lancaster that was blown to pieces directly in his path.
By April 1944, No. 463 Squadron had begun to concentrate on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">invasion of the continent</a>. On 8 May, Brill was the bombing controller for a raid on an airfield near <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>. The controller was required to arrive ahead of the main Allied force, check that flares marking the target were in place, and warn his fellows if they were bombing inaccurately. By the time Brill had completed this task and gone in himself to attack, the ground defences were fully alert and peppered his Lancaster with 140 bullet holes, but he refused to take evasive action until he had delivered his bombload. Promoted to acting <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, Brill assumed control of No. 467 Squadron on 12 May, following the death in combat of its previous commanding officer, Group Captain <a href="John%20Balmer">John Balmer</a>. According to the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the RAAF in World War II</a>, Brill "proved a very worthy successor to Balmer both in administration and in the dashing type of leadership which had brought the Waddington squadrons to the fore in <a href="No.%205%20Group%20RAF">No. 5 Group</a>". He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> on 19 May for "leadership, skill and gallantry of the highest order" and "his determination to make every sortie a success" in spite of frequent damage to his aircraft. Early the next month he led No. 467 Squadron in raids on Axis radar stations in northern France. The unit <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%20Battle%20of%20Normandy">was in action on D-Day</a> over <a href="Pointe%20du%20Hoc">Pointe du Hoc</a> and, later, clearing a corridor for Allied troops advancing up the <a href="Cherbourg%20peninsula">Cherbourg peninsula</a>.

On the night of 4/5 July, Nos. 463 and 467 Squadrons bombed supply depots for <a href="V-weapons">V-weapons</a> near <a href="Saint-Leu-d%27Esserent">Saint-Leu-d'Esserent</a>. Brill's Lancaster was attacked by three German <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a>s, but he was able to evade them with only a few bullets striking his plane. His "fine leadership and courage" during the action earned him a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DFC; the award was promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 16 January 1945. Brill completed his second tour of operations later in July but stayed on to fly more missions, often mentoring less experienced crews. By now he had earned a reputation for being quite "mad", as he would often circle back and check over his handiwork after a bombing run, rather than making his escape from the target area as quickly as possible. During non-operational periods, he made a habit of taking a Lancaster on a so-called test flight to the southern border of Northern Ireland, where he and his crew would change into civilian clothes, cross into Ireland and stock up on food and liquor for a party back at Waddington; he always made a point of inviting the Air Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Overseas%20Headquarters">RAAF Overseas Headquarters</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a>, to such events, which Wrigley attended without fail. Brill handed over command of No. 467 Squadron on 12 October 1944, becoming the first man to survive his time as its leader. He had flown a total of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he returned to Australia in the new year. On 29 January 1945 he married Ilma Kitto, a teacher, at Ganmain's Methodist Church. The couple had been engaged since before the war; they later had two sons and a daughter.

Brill remained in the Air Force following the end of hostilities. From February 1946 to August 1947 he served as the first and only commanding officer of the RAAF's newly formed and soon-disbanded Heavy Bomber Crew Conversion Unit at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">RAAF Station East Sale</a>, Victoria. Little support or direction on its use as a training facility was forthcoming from higher command, and in the summer months its <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> bombers were employed in bushfire patrols over <a href="East%20Gippsland">East Gippsland</a>, reporting 44 outbreaks in February 1947 alone. Brill transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force in 1948, and reverted to the rank of squadron leader. In March 1949 he became the inaugural commanding officer of a re-formed <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron</a>, which had been disbanded in 1945 after service throughout World War II. In its new guise the squadron was established from the staff and facilities of RAAF Station Garbutt in <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>. Brill's main tasks were organising to absorb or close surplus wartime facilities in North Queensland, and preparing No. 10 Squadron for <a href="search-and-rescue">search-and-rescue</a> operations. The unit took delivery of its first four Lincoln <a href="Mark%20%28designation%29">Mk</a> 30s in September 1949, and Brill handed over command the following January.

Raised to substantive wing commander, Brill served as a director at <a href="RAAF%20Staff%20College">RAAF Staff College</a> in <a href="RAAF%20Williams">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, until his appointment as Staff Officer to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal Sir <a href="Donald%20Hardman">Donald Hardman</a>, in March 1952. He was posted to command the <a href="Officers%27%20Training%20School%20RAAF">Officer Training School</a> (OTS) at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Rathmines">RAAF Base Rathmines</a>, New South Wales, in December 1953. In this role he was also the commanding officer of the base. His title changed in May 1956 as Rathmines and OTS were reorganised under the newly established RAAF School of Ground Training, with Brill taking charge of the school until July. Considered an empathetic leader, he then became Director of Personnel Services. Promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, Brill served throughout 1959 as commanding officer of <a href="Fairbairn%2C%20Canberra">RAAF Base Canberra</a> before again being appointed Director of Personnel Services. Active in local charities and youth organisations, he became a <a href="Freemason">Freemason</a> and in the early 1960s was assistant commissioner for the <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>–<a href="Monaro%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Monaro</a> Boy Scouts. In January 1964 he assumed command of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Base Townsville</a>, returning to Canberra that October for assignment to the Department of Air. He died of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> at his home in <a href="Campbell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Campbell</a> on 12 October. Survived by his wife and children, Brill was buried in Canberra. He is commemorated by Brill Place, in <a href="Gowrie%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Gowrie</a>.

Manchester Cenotaph

Manchester Cenotaph is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a>, with additions for later conflicts, designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> for <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Square%2C%20Manchester">St Peter's Square</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, England. Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in <a href="Albert%20Square%2C%20Manchester">Albert Square</a> required the removal and relocation of several statues, and was opposed by the city's artistic community. The next choice was <a href="Piccadilly%20Gardens">Piccadilly Gardens</a>, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a stone cross commemorating the former St Peter's Church. Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the cenotaph was built with the cross in situ. 

The choice of architect was initially to be decided by open competition, but the committee was criticised in the local press when it reserved the right to overrule the result. It abandoned the competition and approached Lutyens, who produced a variation of his design for <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">his cenotaph</a> in London. The memorial consists of a central <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> and a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> flanked by twin <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s, all features characteristic of Lutyens' works. The cenotaph is topped by an effigy of a fallen soldier and decorated with relief carvings of the imperial crown, Manchester's coat of arms and inscriptions commemorating the dead. The structures, based on <a href="classical%20architecture">classical architecture</a>, use abstract, ecumenical shapes rather than overt religious symbolism. The memorial was unveiled on 12 July 1924 by <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">the Earl of Derby</a>, assisted by Mrs Bingle, a local resident whose three sons had died in the war. It cost £6,940 and the remaining funds were used to provide hospital beds. 

In 2014, Manchester City Council dismantled the memorial and reconstructed it at the northwest corner of St Peter's Square next to <a href="Manchester%20Town%20Hall">Manchester Town Hall</a> to make room for the expanded <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Metrolink</a> tram network. It is a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed structure</a> and in 2015, <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> recognised Manchester Cenotaph as part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Virtually every town or city erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead. During the war, only London provided more recruits to the British Army than Manchester. The <a href="Manchester%20Regiment">Manchester Regiment</a> and the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a>, which largely recruited from the city and towns to the north, were swollen by <a href="pals%20battalion">pals battalion</a>s drawn from local employers, social groups, and neighbourhoods. By the end of the war, over 13,000 men of the Manchester Regiment, including more than 4,000 from the pals battalions and 13,600 Lancashire Fusiliers, had been killed. An estimated 22,000 Mancunians died and 55,000 were wounded.

Many towns and cities began to erect war memorials after <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">the armistice</a>, but Manchester did not get underway until 1922. As a result of pressure from the local branch of the <a href="Royal%20British%20Legion">Royal British Legion</a>, the city council formed a war memorial committee, chaired by the mayor, to explore options for commemoration. The committee raised £10,000 in subscriptions and donors were told that local firms would benefit from the construction and resulting employment. Nonetheless, the letters pages of local newspapers featured several ex-servicemen who felt that the cenotaph was a waste of money and that the funds would be better spent on the survivors and war widows, many of whom faced extreme hardship as a result of high levels of unemployment in the aftermath of the war. 

Three potential sites were considered for the memorial: <a href="Albert%20Square%2C%20Manchester">Albert Square</a>, <a href="Piccadilly%20Gardens">Piccadilly Gardens</a> and <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Square%2C%20Manchester">St Peter's Square</a>. With the support of the Royal British Legion, Albert Square emerged as the favourite. The site proved controversial after the artistic community led the objections to the removal and relocation of statues in the square, which would have been required to create a suitable space for the war memorial. <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> consented to the relocation of the <a href="Albert%20Square%2C%20Manchester%23Albert%20Memorial">memorial to his German grandfather</a>, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, but objections persisted and the city architect estimated the cost of relocating the statues at £8,400. The city council voted to reject Albert Square and identified Piccadilly Gardens as its second choice. The city council was considering building an art gallery on the open space left after the old infirmary was demolished. Siting the memorial in front of it was supported by the Art Gallery Committee. As nothing was decided, any plans for the area would have delayed the war memorial project further and the council settled on St Peter's Square.
More controversy surrounded the choice of architect. The Manchester Art Federation and other bodies petitioned the city council to hold an open competition, to which the council agreed. The war memorial committee appointed <a href="Percy%20Worthington">Percy Worthington</a>, a local architect, as the assessor for the competition but attracted severe criticism in the local press when it reserved the right to veto Worthington's choice. After further debate, the competition was abandoned and a subcommittee approached <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>.

Lutyens, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation", was amongst the most prominent designers of war memorials in Britain. Before the war, he had established his reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy patrons but the war had a profound effect on him and from 1917 onwards he dedicated much of his time to memorialising the casualties. The <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> that he designed in 1917 appears in all large <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (IWGC) cemeteries and in several of his civic memorials, including Manchester's. His <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">cenotaph</a> on Whitehall in London became the focus for national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations and one of the most influential designs for war memorials in Britain. Manchester's cenotaph, a close replica, is one of seven in England based on it.

Lutyens designed the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a> of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme</a>, the largest British war memorial in the world, for the IWGC in 1928. Around the same time he designed his only other commission in Manchester, the Midland Bank at <a href="100%20King%20Street">100 King Street</a>.
Manchester's war memorial is a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>, flanked by twin <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s, and a Stone of Remembrance, all in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> on a raised coved platform. The memorial covers an area of approximately by . The cenotaph is high made from of Portland stone. The <a href="Pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a> is surmounted by a sculpture of an unknown soldier, partially covered by his <a href="greatcoat">greatcoat</a>, lying on a <a href="catafalque">catafalque</a>. The pylon rises from the base in diminishing stages, narrowing as it rises. Below the catafalque, on the front and rear, are moulded swords and imperial crowns, and to the sides are Manchester's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> surrounded by <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurel wreath</a>s. The cenotaph bears inscriptions below the coat of arms: "" (on the north-west side) and "" (on the south east). Identical, high obelisks stand either side of the cenotaph and the Stone of Remembrance is set in front. The stone, a <a href="monolith">monolith</a> in the shape of an altar, is long and <a href="entasis">subtly, aesthetically curved</a>; it is devoid of decoration and inscribed, "".

Lutyens' design, with flanking objects, recumbent figure and a Stone of Remembrance set in front of the cenotaph, is reminiscent of his <a href="Southampton%20Cenotaph">earlier cenotaph in Southampton</a>. While many First World War memorials feature sculpture or overt religious symbolism, Manchester's, like many of his memorials, uses abstract and ecumenical shapes inspired by <a href="classical%20architecture">classical architecture</a>. Its effigy of the unknown soldier raised high on the pylon rather than at eye level is reminiscent of ancient tower tombs. The sculpture's position high above eye level gives the soldier anonymity, complimenting the abstract shapes of the structures and allowing an onlooker to project an image of their own choosing onto it, and distances the viewer from the fact of the death and focuses on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice.
The "Pevsner City Guide" to Manchester described the cenotaph as one of the few impressive war memorials in Manchester but lamented its original cluttered setting and its proximity to overhead wires. The cenotaph, obelisks, and stone are features typical of Lutyens' war memorial work, although Manchester's is one of only two with flanking obelisks—<a href="Northampton%20War%20Memorial">Northampton's</a> has a similar pair of obelisks flanking a Stone of Remembrance.

St Peter's Square already housed a memorial cross by <a href="Temple%20Moore">Temple Moore</a> marking the location of the former St Peter's Church, which was demolished in 1907. The church trustees and the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Manchester">Bishop of Manchester</a> had consented to relocating the cross to accommodate the war memorial, but the trustees reversed their decision by the time building work commenced. Lutyens agreed for the work to continue with the cross in situ. Negotiations about relocating it recommenced after the unveiling ceremony but the trustees remained reluctant and after further discussion Lutyens said he did not object to it remaining. According to Tim Skelton, author of "Lutyens and the Great War" (2008), "the heated discussions resulted in a compromise that clearly show[ed]" as Moore's cross "severely impinged on the setting of the memorial and appear[ed] to be an integral part of it".

Despite the war memorial committee's promise that local labour would be used, the monument was built by <a href="Nine%20Elms%20Stone%20Masonry%20Works">Nine Elms Stone Masonry Works</a> of London,resulting in a sense of betrayal in the local community. Having cost of £6,940, it was unveiled on 12 July 1924 by <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby</a>. Derby's family had been involved in politics for generations, and who held various public offices during the war including <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>. He was assisted by Mrs Bingle, a local woman from Rylance Street, <a href="Ancoats">Ancoats</a>, who lost three sons in the war. Two years earlier, Lord Derby had unveiled Lutyens' <a href="Rochdale%20Cenotaph">Rochdale Cenotaph</a>, away. Mrs Bingle represented "the mothers and wives of Manchester who had made sacrifices greater than life itself". She wore the eight medals awarded to her sons: Sergeant Ernest Bingle aged 34 and Gunner Charles Bingle aged 27 of the <a href="Royal%20Garrison%20Artillery">Royal Garrison Artillery</a>, and Corporal Nelson Bingle aged 21 of the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>. All were killed in 1918—Nelson in March and Ernest and Charles in May. 

The unveiling ceremony at Manchester took place in front of a large crowd and a <a href="guard%20of%20honour">guard of honour</a> from the Manchester Regiment and ex-servicemen. The service was led by the <a href="Dean%20of%20Manchester">Dean of Manchester</a>, the Very Reverend <a href="Gough%20McCormick">Gough McCormick</a>, and the Baptist minister Reverend John Edward Roberts of Union Chapel on Oxford Road. Several dignitaries gave speeches including the lord mayor and Lord Derby, who remarked that the memorial was not only a tribute to the dead but a warning as to the cost of war. After the unveiling, a procession of women laid flowers around the base of the memorial. The remainder of the £10,000 raised by the war memorial committee was used to provide hospital beds for ex-servicemen and their families. The controversies that arose during the memorial's gestation largely disappeared after its unveiling; the "<a href="Manchester%20City%20News">Manchester City News</a>" praised the design for its "simplicity of forms and rhythmic beauty of proportion". 

A marble plaque, added nearby and dedicated to "", was removed during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> but later returned. In 1949 the dates for World War II were added and the surrounding area was laid out as a garden of remembrance designed by the city architect, <a href="Leonard%20Cecil%20Howitt">L. C. Howitt</a>. Another plaque was added later to commemorate the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>.

The suitability of St Peter's Square re-emerged in 1925 during discussions about the proposed art gallery and consideration was given to moving the cenotaph to Piccadilly. In March 2011 <a href="Manchester%20City%20Council">Manchester City Council</a> began a public consultation on moving the cenotaph to an alternative site in the square to allow for expansion of the <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Metrolink</a> tram network. The plans had a mixed reception. Some objections were made by the public but there was support from veterans, church, and heritage groups. The relocation was approved in 2012, and in January 2014 it was dismantled before it was cleaned and restored. In 2014 it was reconstructed in a new memorial garden on the opposite side of the square aligned with <a href="Manchester%20Town%20Hall">Manchester Town Hall</a>'s southern entrance. The city council commissioned conservation architects Stephen Levrant Heritage Architecture to manage the relocation and design the new setting which places the cenotaph, obelisks and stone on a plinth in an oval surrounded by a low wall. The garden opened to the public in September 2014. The cenotaph was damaged in the first week when skateboarders began using the area as a skatepark. Repair work costing £4,000 started shortly afterwards, and extra security measures (including 24-hour <a href="CCTV">CCTV</a>) were put in place.

The cenotaph was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed structure</a> on 12 February 1985. Listed status provides legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II is applied to about 92% of listed buildings of "special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them". It was upgraded in 1994 to grade II*, which is reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applies to about 5.5% of listed buildings. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Manchester Cenotaph was recognised as part of the "national collection" of Lutyens' war memorials.

Taxonomy of lemurs

The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic history</a> of <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s dates back to 1758 when <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> first <a href="Biological%20classification">classified</a> them, and the taxonomy remains controversial today, with approximately 70 to 100 <a href="species">species</a> and <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> recognized, depending on <a href="Species%20problem">how the term "species" is defined</a>. Having undergone <a href="Evolutionary%20history%20of%20lemurs">their own independent evolution</a> on Madagascar, lemurs have diversified to fill many <a href="Ecological%20niche">niches</a> normally filled by other types of mammals. They include the smallest primates in the world, and once included some of the largest. Since the arrival of humans approximately 2,000 years ago, lemurs have become restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately , and many face <a href="extinction">extinction</a>. Concerns over <a href="Lemur%23Conservation">lemur conservation</a> have affected lemur taxonomy, since distinct species receive increased conservation attention compared to subspecies.

The relationship between the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a> and the rest of the lemurs has had the greatest impact on lemur taxonomy at the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> rank and above. Genetic analysis of this relationship has also clarified lemur <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogeny</a> and supports the hypothesis that lemurs <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafted</a> to Madagascar. Despite general agreement on phylogeny, the taxonomy is still under debate. At the <a href="genus">genus</a> level, the taxonomy has been relatively stable since 1931, but a number of additional genera have been recognized since then.

Since the 1990s, there has been a steep increase in the number of <a href="List%20of%20lemur%20species">recognized lemur species and subspecies</a> through the discovery of new species, the elevation of existing subspecies to full species status, and the recognition of new species among previously known populations that were not even distinct subspecies. Currently living lemur species are divided into five families and 15 genera. If the extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s are included, three families, eight genera, and 17 species would be added to the count. The recent rise in species numbers is due to both improved genetic analysis and a push in conservation to encourage the protection of isolated and distinct lemur populations. Not everyone in the scientific community supports these taxonomic changes, with some preferring instead an estimate of 50 living species.

Since their arrival on Madagascar, a <a href="biogeography">biogeographically</a> isolated island with a unique mammalian fauna, lemurs have diversified both in behavior and morphology. Their diversity rivals that of the monkeys and apes found throughout the rest of the world, especially when the recently extinct <a href="subfossil%20lemur">subfossil lemur</a>s are considered. Ranging in size from the <a href="Madame%20Berthe%27s%20mouse%20lemur">Madame Berthe's mouse lemur</a>, probably the world's smallest primate, to the extinct "<a href="Archaeoindris%20fontoynonti">Archaeoindris fontoynonti</a>", the largest known <a href="prosimian">prosimian</a>, lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate. They went on to fill many niches normally occupied by monkeys, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, and large grazing <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s. In addition to the incredible diversity between lemur families, there has also been great diversification among closely related lemurs.

The arrival of humans on the island 1,500 to 2,000 years ago has taken a significant toll, not only on the size of lemur populations, but also on their diversity. Due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and hunting, at least 17 species and 8 genera have gone extinct and many others have become threatened. Historically, lemurs ranged across the entire island inhabiting a wide variety of habitats, including <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">dry deciduous forests</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20lowland%20forests">lowland forests</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny thickets</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20subhumid%20forests">subhumid forests</a>, <a href="Cloud%20forest">montane forest</a>, and <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>. Today, their collective range is restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately . Most of the remaining forests and lemurs are found along the periphery of the island. The center of the island, the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">Hauts-Plateaux</a>, was converted by early settlers to <a href="Paddy%20field">rice paddies</a> and <a href="grassland">grassland</a> through <a href="Slash%20and%20burn">slash-and-burn agriculture</a>, known locally as "tavy". As <a href="erosion">erosion</a> depleted the soil, the cyclical forest regrowth and burning ended as the forest gradually failed to return. In 2008, 41% of all lemur taxa were threatened with extinction while 42% were classified on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>".

In the first volume of the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of "Systema Naturae"</a> (1758), <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, the founder of modern <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>, created the genus "Lemur" to include three species: "Lemur tardigradus" (the <a href="red%20slender%20loris">red slender loris</a>, now known as "Loris tardigradus"), "Lemur catta" (the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>), and "Lemur volans" (the <a href="Philippine%20flying%20lemur">Philippine colugo</a>, now known as "Cynocephalus volans"). Although the term "lemur" was at first intended for <a href="loris">loris</a>es, it was soon applied to the <a href="endemic">endemic</a> Malagasy primates, which have been known as "lemurs" ever since. The name derives from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> term "<a href="lemures">lemures</a>", which refers to the "spirits of the dead" from <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman mythology</a>. According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris. Being familiar with the works of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> and <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term "lemur" for these nocturnal primates. However, it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">reflective eyes</a>, and ghostly cries of lemurs. It has also been speculated that Linnaeus may also have known that the some Malagasy people have held legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors, but this is unlikely given that the name was selected for slender lorises from India.

Since the first taxonomic <a href="biological%20classification">classification</a> of lemurs, many changes have been made to lemur taxonomy. Within the primate order, <a href="treeshrew">treeshrew</a>s (order Scandentia) were considered basal, prosimian primates—close relatives of lemurs—until the 1980s. <a href="Colugo">Colugo</a>s, also incorrectly referred to as "flying lemurs", were once considered lemur-like primates, but were reclassified as close relatives of bats, and more recently as close relatives of primates within their own order, Dermoptera. Primates, together with their closest relatives, the treeshrews, colugos, and long-extinct <a href="Plesiadapiformes">plesiadapiform</a>s, form the taxonomically unranked <a href="Euarchonta">Euarchonta</a> <a href="clade">clade</a> within the <a href="Euarchontoglires">Euarchontoglires</a>. <a href="Lorisidae">Lorisids</a>, some of which were originally placed in the genus "Lemur" by Carl Linnaeus, have since been moved into either their own infraorder (Lorisiformes) or their own superfamily (Lorisoidea) within Lemuriformes.

For the Malagasy primate fauna, taxonomic nomenclature proliferated during the 1800s, with the aid of museum <a href="systematics">systematists</a>, such as <a href="Albert%20G%C3%BCnther">Albert Günther</a> and <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a>, as well as naturalists and explorers, such as <a href="Alfred%20Grandidier">Alfred Grandidier</a>. This nomenclature was not sorted out until decades later, when <a href="Ernst%20Schwarz%20%28zoologist%29">Ernst Schwarz</a> standardized it in 1931. It was not until the 1990s that this nomenclature started to see a new wave of taxonomic change.
Although Carl Linnaeus originally grouped the first "lemurs" he classified under the order Primates, lemurs and other non-human primates were later separated from humans by being placed in the order <a href="Quadrumana">Quadrumana</a> by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Blumenbach">Johann Friedrich Blumenbach</a> in 1775. (He also placed humans in the order Bimana.) This view was upheld by other famous naturalists and <a href="Zoology">zoologists</a> of the time, including <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a> (who first placed lemurs in Strepsirrhini in 1812), <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>, and (initially) John Edward Gray. By 1862, <a href="William%20Henry%20Flower">William Henry Flower</a>, a <a href="Comparative%20anatomy">comparative anatomist</a>, was arguing against moving strepsirrhines out of Quadrumana into <a href="Insectivora">Insectivora</a> (a now-abandoned biological grouping), claiming that their brain had features transitional between other primates and "inferior" mammals. In 1863, <a href="Thomas%20Henry%20Huxley">Thomas Henry Huxley</a> restored the order Primates to include humans, other apes, monkeys, lemurs, and even colugos. However, opposition continued with many specialists arguing that lemurs (or "Half-apes") should be placed in their own order. In 1873, English comparative anatomist <a href="St.%20George%20Jackson%20Mivart">St. George Jackson Mivart</a> countered these arguments and proceeded to define the primates by a list of anatomical features.

Since the 19th century, the classification of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the dwarf and mouse lemurs with the galagos. In 1915, <a href="William%20King%20Gregory">William King Gregory</a> published a classification that remained generally accepted over the next decades. He placed all the lemurs together in a "series" Lemuriformes and recognized three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae (including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae). <a href="George%20Gaylord%20Simpson">George Gaylord Simpson</a>'s influential 1945 classification of mammals placed the treeshrews and the fossil "<a href="Anagale">Anagale</a>" (both now classified outside Primates) inside Lemuriformes and classified the fossil families <a href="Plesiadapidae">Plesiadapidae</a> and <a href="Adapidae">Adapidae</a> in a superfamily Lemuroidea with most of the lemurs.

Although treeshrews, plesiadapids, and the like are now no longer considered to be closely related to lemurs, disagreements persist over the classification of lemurs and related groups, resulting in competing arrangements of the <a href="taxonomic%20rank">infraorders and superfamilies</a> within Strepsirrhini. In one taxonomy, infraorder Lemuriformes contains all living strepsirrhines in two superfamilies, Lemuroidea for all lemurs and Lorisoidea for the lorisoids (<a href="Lorisidae">lorisids</a> and galagos). Alternatively, the lorisoids are sometimes placed in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes, separate from the lemurs. Yet another classification published by Colin Groves placed the aye-aye in its own infraorder, Chiromyiformes, while the rest of the lemurs were placed in Lemuriformes and the lorisoids in Lorisiformes.

The classification of several lemur taxa has elicited particular debate. Most significantly, the placement of the aye-aye has been controversial since its introduction to Western science in 1782, and it has been a topic of debate until very recently. Arguing against <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a> claimed in 1863 that the aye-aye's distinct characteristics, including its ever-growing <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and unique, highly flexible middle finger, are so perfectly adapted for their uses in extractive <a href="foraging">foraging</a> that they could not have evolved gradually through natural selection. More recently, the aye-aye's placement has posed problems for the rafting hypothesis for the primate colonization of Madagascar. If this species does not form a <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic group</a> with the rest of the lemurs, then multiple colonization events would have had to occur to explain the occurrence of lemurs on Madagascar.
Until Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus "Daubentonia") was a <a href="primate">primate</a>, <a href="rodent">rodent</a>, or <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>. In the late eighteenth century, for example, the aye-aye was classified under the squirrel genus "<a href="Sciurus">Sciurus</a>". By emphasizing its primate features, such as its <a href="postorbital%20bar">postorbital bar</a>, <a href="Stereopsis">stereoscopic vision</a>, and <a href="hallux">opposable hallux</a>, over its rodent-like teeth, Owen demonstrated its affinity with other primates. In 1996, Ankel-Simons demonstrated that the shape and arrangement of the aye-aye's diminutive <a href="deciduous%20tooth">deciduous incisors</a> indicate that this genus has a shared ancestry with the <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a>ed primates. However, the placement of the aye-aye within the primates remained problematic until very recently. The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> of the aye-aye is noticeably different from that of its closest relatives, the lorises and the rest of the lemurs, with a <a href="Ploidy%23Diploid">diploid</a> <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> count of 2n=30. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus "Daubentonia" as a specialized <a href="Indriidae">indriid</a>, a <a href="Cladistics">sister group</a> to all strepsirrhines, and an indeterminate taxon within the primates. In 1931, Schwarz labeled the aye-aye as an offshoot of Indriidae, claiming that all lemurs were monophyletic, whereas <a href="Reginald%20Innes%20Pocock">Reginald Innes Pocock</a> had previously placed the aye-aye outside of the lemurs. In that same year, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines. Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs, despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuroidea.
Another interpretation of the aye-aye's origins has once again called into question the single origins of the lemurs. The aye-aye and a fossil strepsirrhine primate from Africa, "<a href="Plesiopithecus">Plesiopithecus</a>", share similarities in the shape of the skull and the morphology of the lower jaw, which suggest that the latter could be an early relative of the aye-aye. However, the placement of an aye-aye ancestor in Africa would require multiple colonizations of Madagascar by strepsirrhine primates. Molecular tests may offer support, since they show that the aye-aye was the first to diverge in the lemur clade and that the other lemur families did not diverge until much later.

Often classified with the galagos by early students, the cheirogaleids (dwarf and mouse lemurs) were placed with the other lemurs from Gregory's 1915 classification until the early 1970s, when several anthropologists proposed that they were more closely related to lorisoids, based on morphological data. However, relevant genetic studies unanimously place cheirogaleids within the lemuroid clade and Groves himself, who had promoted the cheirogaleid-lorisoid relationship in a 1974 paper, by 2001 regarded the idea as refuted.

Classifications in the first half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the <a href="greater%20bamboo%20lemur">greater bamboo lemur</a>). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.

From the 1970s to the 1990s, there have been suggestions that the ruffed lemurs might be related to indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs, but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny. The sportive lemurs and the extinct <a href="koala%20lemur">koala lemur</a>s (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition, and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">takes precedence</a>. Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs). The <a href="sloth%20lemur">sloth lemur</a>s (Palaeopropithecidae) and <a href="monkey%20lemur">monkey lemur</a>s (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982, but are now recognized as separate families.

The relationships among the families of lemurs have been problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved. Two competing <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenies</a> exist based on genetic and molecular data. One approach (Horvath "et al".) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species. This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. The other approach (Orlando "et al".) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species. Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae. Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuroid clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families. However, two problems create complications for both approaches. First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10 million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence. In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42 mya; such distant splits create a lot of <a href="Statistical%20noise">noise</a> for molecular techniques.

Early distribution of lemur species among genera differed in a number of ways from current taxonomy. For example, the <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s were initially placed in "Lemur" and then in "Microcebus" with the mouse lemurs before being placed in their own genus "Phaner", and <a href="Charles%20Immanuel%20Forsyth%20Major">Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major</a> split the "Cheirogaleus medius" species group of the dwarf lemurs into a separate genus "Opolemur", but this was not accepted. Genus-level taxonomy was largely stabilized by Schwarz in 1931, but a number of later changes have become accepted:


There is widespread disagreement on aspects of species-level lemur taxonomy, particularly concerning the recent increase in the number of recognized species. According to <a href="Russell%20Mittermeier">Russell Mittermeier</a>, the president of <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> (CI), taxonomist <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a>, and others, there are currently 101 recognized species or subspecies of extant lemur, divided into five families and 15 genera. Conversely, other experts in the field label this as a possible example of <a href="taxonomic%20inflation">taxonomic inflation</a>, and prefer instead an estimate of at least 50 species. All sides generally agree that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs should be classified in three <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, eight <a href="genus">genera</a>, and 17 species.
Over the past two decades, the number of recognized lemur species has more than tripled according to some experts. In 1994, 32 distinct species were named in the first edition of <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a>'s field guide, "<a href="Lemurs%20of%20Madagascar%20%28book%29">Lemurs of Madagascar</a>", and 68 were described in the 2nd edition, published in 2006. In December 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and other experts co-wrote an article in the "International Journal of Primatology" classifying 99 species and subspecies. In late 2010, the 3rd edition of "Lemurs of Madagascar" listed 101 taxa. The number of lemur species is likely to continue growing in the coming years, as <a href="Field%20study">field studies</a>, <a href="Cytogenetics">cytogenetic</a> and <a href="Molecular%20genetics">molecular genetic</a> research continues, particularly on <a href="cryptic%20species">cryptic species</a>, such as mouse lemurs, which cannot be distinguished visually.

This threefold increase in less than two decades has not had universal support among taxonomists and lemur researchers. In many cases, classifications ultimately depends upon which <a href="Species%23Definitions%20of%20species">species concept</a> is used. Due to the critical condition that most Malagasy primate populations are in, <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomists</a> and <a href="conservation%20movement">conservationists</a> sometimes favor splitting them into separate species to develop an effective strategy for the conservation of the full range of lemur diversity. Implicitly, this means that full species status will help grant genetically distinct populations added environmental protection.

The first large wave of new lemur species descriptions came in 2000, when Colin Groves split two species of <a href="dwarf%20lemur">dwarf lemur</a> ("Cheirogaleus") into seven species while <a href="Rodin%20Rasoloarison">Rodin Rasoloarison</a> and colleagues recognized seven species of mouse lemur in western Madagascar. Then in 2001, Colin Groves elevated the <a href="red%20ruffed%20lemur">red ruffed lemur</a> ("Varecia rubra"), five subspecies of brown lemur ("Eulemur albifrons", "E. albocollaris", "E. collaris", "E. rufus" and "E. sanfordi"), and four subspecies of <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a> ("Propithecus coquereli", "P. deckenii", "P. edwardsi", and "P. perrieri") to full species status. Additional elevations of all remaining subspecies within the "Eulemur" and "Propithecus" genera were made in the years that followed. These and subsequent changes in taxonomy were largely due to a shift to the <a href="phylogenetic%20species%20concept">phylogenetic species concept</a>, and are not universally endorsed.

By far the most explosive growth in species numbers (in absolute terms) has been in the genera "Microcebus" and "Lepilemur". In 2006, 15 new species of "Lepilemur" were described, with three new species reported in February, one in June, and 11 in September. Since then, three additional species have been described, one of which turned out to be identical to a previously described species. Genetic and morphological differences seem to suggest that they are cryptic species, but there is still debate whether these merit full species status or should be regarded as subspecies of previously identified, "core" species.
Both brown lemurs and mouse lemurs were initially divided into a small number of species, either with no distinguishable <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> (in the case of mouse lemurs) or with several distinguishable subspecies (in the case of brown lemurs). With molecular research suggesting a more distant split in both genera, these subspecies or undistinguished populations have been promoted to species status.

In the case of mouse lemurs, the rise in species numbers has been only slightly less sudden and dramatic. Classified as one species by <a href="Ernst%20Schwarz%20%28zoologist%29">Ernst Schwarz</a> in 1931 (excluding one, <a href="Coquerel%27s%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">Coquerel's giant mouse lemur</a>, that is no longer classified in "Microcebus"), the genus was revised to contain two species, the <a href="gray%20mouse%20lemur">gray mouse lemur</a> ("Microcebus murinus") and the <a href="brown%20mouse%20lemur">brown mouse lemur</a> ("M. rufus"), after an extensive field study in 1972 showed both living in <a href="sympatry">sympatry</a> in southeastern Madagascar. At the time, the gray mouse lemur was known in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown mouse lemur inhabited the humid rainforest regions of the east. However, we now know the <a href="species%20diversity">species diversity</a> and distribution to be significantly more complex. Revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new species through genetic testing using <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, demonstrating that the genus is represented by a multitude of cryptic species. Many, but not all of these defined species have been supported by <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> tests.

However, there are still concerns that species are being identified prematurely. <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a>, an anthropologist who recognized 42 species of lemur in 1982, has expressed concern that the geographically organized variety in lemur populations is being recognized with full species status while the number of subspecies in lemur genera has virtually disappeared. He has argued that taxonomists are confusing differentiation and <a href="speciation">speciation</a>, two processes that are often unrelated, while denying the role of <a href="microevolution">microevolution</a> in evolutionary processes. Still other researchers who emphasize the framework of the "general lineage concept of species" contend that lineage divergence or differentiation demarcates the beginning of a new species.

New species have been identified due to differences in <a href="Comparative%20anatomy">morphology</a>, karyotypes, cytochrome "b" sequences, and other genetic tests, as well as several combinations of these. When nuclear DNA (nDNA) was tested in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mouse lemurs, a few species, such as <a href="Claire%27s%20mouse%20lemur">Claire's mouse lemur</a> ("Microcebus mamiratra") were demonstrated to be indistinguishable from other closely related species. In such cases, nDNA did not vary, but the mtDNA that had been used to define it as a species was still distinct. Differences in results between nDNA, which is inherited from both parents, and mtDNA, which is inherited from the mother, was attributed to female <a href="philopatry">philopatry</a>, where females remain within or close to the <a href="home%20range">home range</a> into which they were born while males disperse. Since the isolated population known as Claire's mouse lemur has distinct mtDNA, but not nDNA, it is likely to contain a population descended from a related group of females, but which still disperses and interbreeds with nearby populations.

Traditionally, karyology has been considered when determining species status. For example, in 2006, three new species of sportive lemur were named based partly on karyotypes. From the lemurs studied so far, the diploid number of chromosomes varies between 2n=20 and 2n=66. In the case of the brown lemurs, the diploid number ranges from 2n=44 to 2n=60 while the individual chromosome sizes vary considerably, despite strong similarities in morphology.

Sometimes distinctions are made due to very slight differences in <a href="pelage">pelage</a> coloration. For instance, three distinctly colored types of mouse lemur were discovered in a multi-year study in <a href="Beza%20Mahafaly%20Reserve">Beza Mahafaly Reserve</a> in southern Madagascar, but rather than being separate species, DNA tests revealed that they all belonged to a single species, the <a href="reddish-gray%20mouse%20lemur">reddish-gray mouse lemur</a> ("Microcebus griseorufus"). For this reason, further research is needed to confirm or deny the recent species splits. Only through detailed studies of morphology, ecology, behavior, and genetics can the true number of lemur species be determined.

All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes

All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes, published in 1986, is the fifth book in <a href="African-American">African-American</a> writer and poet <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou's</a> seven-volume autobiography series. Set between 1962 and 1965, the book begins when Angelou is 33 years old, and recounts the years she lived in <a href="Accra">Accra</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>. The book, deriving its title from a <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">Negro spiritual</a>, begins where Angelou's previous memoir, "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20a%20Woman">The Heart of a Woman</a>", ends — with the traumatic car accident involving her son Guy — and closes with Angelou returning to America.

As she had started to do in her first autobiography, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>", and continued throughout her series, Angelou upholds the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she makes a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou had matured as a writer by the time she wrote "Traveling Shoes", to the point that she was able to play with the form and structure of the work. As in her previous books, it consists of a series of anecdotes connected by theme. She depicts her struggle with being the mother of a grown son, and with her place in her new home.

Angelou examines many of the same subjects and themes that her previous autobiographies covered. Although motherhood is an important theme in this book, it does not overwhelm the text as it does in some of her other works. At the end of the book, she ties up the mother/son plot when she leaves her son in Ghana and returns to America. According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, "Angelou's exploration of her African and African-American identities" is an important theme in "Traveling Shoes". By the end of the book, Angelou comes to term with what scholar Dolly McPherson calls her "<a href="double%20consciousness">double-consciousness</a>", the parallels and connections between the African and American parts of her history and character. Racism continues to be an important theme as she learns more about it and about herself. Journey and a sense of home is another important theme in this book; Angelou upholds the African-American tradition of the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> and of her own series of autobiographies. This time she focuses on "trying to get home", or on becoming assimilated in African culture, which she finds unattainable.

"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes" received a mixed reception from critics, but most of their reviews were positive.

"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes", published in 1986, is the fifth installment of <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s series of seven autobiographies. The success of Angelou's previous autobiographies and the publication of four volumes of poetry had brought Angelou a considerable amount of fame by 1986. "<a href="And%20Still%20I%20Rise">And Still I Rise</a>", published in 1978, reinforced Angelou's success as a writer. Her first volume of poetry, "<a href="Just%20Give%20Me%20a%20Cool%20Drink%20of%20Water%20%27fore%20I%20Diiie">Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie</a>" (1971) was nominated for a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>.

As writer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> states, Angelou was one of the first African-American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books, something she continues in "Traveling Shoes". Writer Julian Mayfield, who calls her first autobiography "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" "a work of art that eludes description", states that Angelou's work sets a precedent not only for other Black women writers, but for the genre of autobiography as a whole.

Als called Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and "be honest about it". Through the writing of her life stories Angelou has become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. It made her, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".

According to McPherson, "Traveling Shoes" is "a mixture of Maya Angelou's personal recollection and a historical document of the time in which it is set", the early 1960s. This was the first time that many Black Americans, due to the independence of <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> and other African states, as well as the emergence of African leaders such as <a href="Kwame%20Nkrumah">Kwame Nkrumah</a>, were able to view Africa in a positive way. Ghana was "the center of an African cultural renaissance" and of <a href="Pan-Africanism">Pan-Africanism</a> during this time.

According to Angelou, the title of "Traveling Shoes" comes from a <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spiritual</a>. African-American scholar Lyman B. Hagen reports that the title comes from the spiritual "All God's Chillun Got Wings", Angelou's "clever reference" to her ongoing search for a home while being aware of "our ultimate home". The title demonstrates Angelou's love of African-American spirituals and deep sense of religion that appears in all of her works. Critic Mary Jane Lupton finds the appearance of the word "traveling" purposeful, since it emphasizes the journey theme, one of Angelou's most important themes of the book. Like Angelou's previous volumes in her series, the title contributes to its plot and thematic impact.

"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes" begins as Angelou's previous book, "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20a%20Woman">The Heart of a Woman</a>", ends: with her depiction of a serious automobile accident involving her son Guy. After spending two years in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, they come to Accra to enroll Guy in the <a href="University%20of%20Ghana">University of Ghana</a>, and the accident occurs three days after they arrive. Following Guy's long convalescence, they remain in Ghana, Angelou for four years, from 1962 to 1965. Angelou describes Guy's recovery, including her deep depression. She is confronted by her friend <a href="Julian%20Mayfield">Julian Mayfield</a>, who introduces her to writer and actor <a href="Efua%20Sutherland">Efua Sutherland</a>, the Director of the <a href="National%20Theatre%20of%20Ghana">National Theatre of Ghana</a>. Sutherland becomes Angelou's "sister-friend" and allows her to cry out all her pain and bitterness.

Angelou finds a job at the University of Ghana and "falls in love" with the country and with its people, who remind her of African Americans she knew in Arkansas and California. As the parent of an adult, she experiences new freedoms, respects Guy's choices, and consciously stops making her son the center of her life. She creates new friendships with her roommates and native Africans, both male and female. She becomes part of a group of American expatriates whom she calls the "Revolutionist Returnees", people such as Mayfield and his wife <a href="Ana%20Livia">Ana Livia</a>, who share her struggles.

Angelou strengthens her ties with Africa while traveling through eastern Ghanaian villages, and through her relationships with several Africans. She describes a few romantic prospects, one of which is with a man who proposes that she become his "second wife" and accept West African customs. She also becomes a supporter of Ghana president <a href="Kwame%20Nkrumah">Kwame Nkrumah</a> and close friends with tribal leader <a href="Nana%20Nketsia">Nana Nketsia</a> and poet <a href="Kwesi%20Brew">Kwesi Brew</a>. During one of her travels through West Africa, a woman identifies her as a member of the <a href="Bambara%20people">Bambara</a> tribe based solely upon her appearance and behavior, which helps Angelou discover the similarities between her American traditions and those of her West African ancestors.

Although Angelou is disillusioned with the nonviolent strategies of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, she and her friends commemorate his 1963 march on Washington by organizing a parallel demonstration in Ghana. The demonstration becomes a tribute to African-American <a href="W.E.B.%20Du%20Bois">W.E.B. Du Bois</a>, who has died the previous evening. A few pages later, she allies herself with <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>, who visits Ghana in 1964 to elicit the support of Black world leaders. He encourages Angelou to return to America to help him coordinate his efforts, as she had done for King in "The Heart of a Woman". While driving Malcolm X to the airport, he chastises her for her bitterness about Du Bois' wife <a href="Shirley%20Graham">Shirley Graham</a>'s lack of support for the civil rights movement.

Angelou and her roommates reluctantly hire a village boy named Kojo to do housework for them. He reminds her of her brother Bailey, and he serves as a substitute for her son Guy. She accepts a maternal role with Kojo, helping him with his schoolwork and welcoming the thanks of his family. "Traveling Shoes", like Angelou's previous autobiographies, is full of conflicts with Guy, especially surrounding his independence, his separation from his mother, and his choices. When she learns that he is dating a woman older than her, she reacts with anger and threatens to strike him, but he patronizes her, calls her his "little mother", and insists upon his autonomy from her.

The African narrative in "Traveling Shoes" is interrupted by "a journey within a journey" when she decides to join a theatrical company in a revival of "<a href="The%20Blacks%20%28play%29">The Blacks</a>", a play by French writer <a href="Jean%20Genet">Jean Genet</a>. As she had done in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and described in her previous autobiography "The Heart of a Woman", she plays the White Queen and tours <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="Venice">Venice</a> with the company, which include <a href="Cicely%20Tyson">Cicely Tyson</a>, <a href="James%20Earl%20Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, <a href="Lou%20Gossett%2C%20Jr.">Lou Gossett, Jr.</a> and <a href="Roscoe%20Lee%20Brown">Roscoe Lee Brown</a>. While in Berlin, she accepts a breakfast invitation with a racist, wealthy German family.

The book ends with Angelou's decision to return to America. At the airport, a group of her friends and associates, including Guy, are present to wish her farewell as she leaves. She metaphorically connects her departure from the African continent with the forced enslavement of her ancestors and her departure from Guy.

All seven of Angelou's installments of her life story continue the long tradition of African-American autobiography. Starting with "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing her books to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>. Angelou expressed in a 1989 interview her opinion that she was the only "serious" writer to choose the genre to express herself. Angelou reports not one person's story, but the collective's. She represents the convention in African-American autobiography, which serves as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. As Angelou had done in her previous autobiographies, she uses elements of the African-American <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a>, including as Lupton puts it, "the journey, the quest for freedom; [and] empathy for the horrors suffered by slaves".

All of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. Although Angelou referred to her books as autobiographies in 1983 interview with African-American literature critic <a href="Claudia%20Tate">Claudia Tate</a>, she acknowledged that there are fictional aspects to all her books, with the tendency to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". When speaking of her unique use of the genre, Angelou acknowledges that she follows the slave narrative tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". McPherson states that Angelou is a master of this autobiographical form, especially the "confrontation of the Black self within a society that threatens to destroy it", but departs from it in "Traveling Shoes" by taking the action to Africa. Lupton, referring to the journey motif in the book, insists that its narrative point of view is "again sustained through the first-person autobiographer in motion".

Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to all her books, although there is less fictionalization in "Traveling Shoes" than in her previous autobiographies. Her approach parallels the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insists that Angelou has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. Journalist <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> asked her in a 1998 interview if she changed the truth to improve her story; she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about". Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she fictionalizes them to make an impact and to enhance her readers' interest. Angelou's long-time editor, <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a> stated that she could have rewritten any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.

For the first and only time in Angelou's series, she repeats the same episode in detail—her son's automobile accident—at the end of her fourth autobiography "The Heart of a Woman" and the beginning of this one, a technique that both centralizes each installment and connects each book in the series with each other. Additionally, each volume "ends with abrupt suspense". It also creates a strong and emotional link between the two autobiographies. Angelou has said that she used this technique so that each book would stand alone and to establish the setting in "Traveling Shoes"—"who she was and what she was doing in Africa".

In "Traveling Shoes", Angelou has matured as a writer to the point that she can experiment with form. For the first time, instead of using traditional numbered chapters, the book consists of anecdotes separated with a few inches of white space. Lupton calls these segments "short stories or vignettes", a technique that Angelou had used before, to portray dynamic characters such as <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a>. Angelou's stories are told within the context of her entire life story, but each vignette can be read or analyzed individually, without harming the text's consistency. Most of Angelou's anecdotes no longer focus on the famous or her family, but on Ghanaians; for example, according to Lupton, her description of her houseboy Kojo is her most delightful character sketch in the book.

In "Traveling Shoes", Angelou continues to demonstrate her strengths as an autobiographer, especially her ability to connect emotionally with her audience, which Lupton calls her "superb use of language in recording moments of emotional intensity". As in her previous books, Angelou uses inventive metaphors and personifications of abstract objects and concepts. Even her descriptions exhibit the style, developed after years of maturity as a writer, of "displaying vivid and captivating sentences and phrases". Angelou's self-portrait of a Black woman and her ability to communicate her misfortunes destroys stereotypes and demonstrates "the trials, rejections, and endurances which so many Black women share". Hagen calls this book "reflective" and its writer "introspective and deeply moved".

Even though "Traveling Shoes" can be read on its own, Angelou connects the events in this book with her previous volumes, as she had done throughout her series. As McPherson states, "Everyday experiences serve as links to Angelou's past and thus embody powerful meanings". Events that occur in this book and Angelou's responses to them evoke earlier moments in her previous books; for example, Angelou responds to her son's accident with muteness, as she had responded to her rape in "Caged Bird". As is customary in autobiography in general, she uses the literary convention of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> in order to tie this book to its predecessors. She uses humor, another convention she has used before, both to criticize racism and to balance her weighty insights. She also uses quotes from literary sources, especially the Bible, which demonstrates that she has not lost contact with her family roots as she searches for a home and for her identity.

"Traveling Shoes" is "more tightly controlled" than Angelou's previous books, most likely due to the dominance of the travel motif. Setting, always an important element for Angelou, becomes even more important in this book. Unlike her previous books, most of this book's action occurs in one setting, Accra, which contributes to and is tightly connected with her personal development. Angelou's feelings towards living in Ghana are ambivalent, which provides "Traveling Shoes" with richness and depth. Many feel that Angelou's inclusion of her tour with "The Blacks" to Berlin and Venice as a digression that detracts from the African setting, but Lupton sees it as a contribution to her character development and provides the book with a "universal quality" as Angelou reaches beyond the confines of her personal life and encounters racism in Germany. During this trip, she comes to see her fellow African-Americans differently, as more spirited than the Africans she has met in Ghana.

A major theme in "Traveling Shoes", one that many critics overlook, is Angelou's love for her son. The theme of motherhood is one of Angelou's most consistent themes throughout her series of autobiographies, although it does not overwhelm this book as it does in "Gather Together in My Name" and "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>". Motherhood is present in many of the book's subthemes—her relationship with her houseboy Kojo, her delight in being called "Auntie" by many African children, and her feelings toward "Mother Africa". "Traveling Shoes" begins with Guy's accident, his long recovery, and his mother's reaction to it, thus universalizing the fear of every parent—the death of a child. The main character is a mother of a grown son, so liberation from the daily responsibilities of motherhood is emphasized, but it is complicated by the recognition that part of motherhood is letting go, something Angelou struggles with. Confrontations between Angelou and Guy are minimal, consisting of their conflict over his choice of dating a much-older woman and of his demands for autonomy after she returns from the Genet tour. Angelou seems to vacillate between wanting to supervise him and wanting to let go throughout this book. In this way, as Lupton says, the motherhood theme, like the identity theme, is "dual in nature".

Like many of her previous books, Angelou is conflicted about her feelings towards Guy, and is skilled at expressing it in this book. One way she expresses her conflict is through her reluctant relationship with Kojo. She compares her feelings for Kojo with the pain of childbirth, and he serves as substitute for Guy. At the end of the book Angelou leaves Guy in Africa to continue his education, suggesting, as Lupton puts it, the "apparent end of the mother/son plot". Lupton also reports that some reviewers have criticized Angelou for "the willful cutting of the maternal ties that she established throughout the series", but Angelou implies in "Traveling Shoes" that motherhood is never over.

Angelou's exploration of her African and African-American identities is an important theme in "Traveling Shoes". The alliances and relationships with those she meets in Ghana contribute to Angelou's identity and growth. Her experiences in Ghana helped her come to terms with her personal and historical past, and by the end of the book she is ready to return to America with a deeper understanding of both the African and American parts of her character. McPherson calls Angelou's parallels and connections between Africa and America her "<a href="double%20consciousness">double-consciousness</a>", which contribute to her understanding of herself.

Angelou is able to recognize similarities between African and African-American culture; as Lupton puts it, the "blue songs, shouts, and gospels" she has grown up with in America "echo the rhythms of West Africa". She recognizes the connections between African and American Black cultures, including the children's games, the folklore, the spoken and non-verbal languages, the food, sensibilities, and behavior. She connects the behavior of many African mother figures, especially their generosity, with her grandmother's behaviors. In one of the most significant sections of "Traveling Shoes", Angelou recounts an encounter with a West African woman who recognizes her, on the basis of her appearance, as a member of the <a href="Bambara%20people">Bambara</a> group of West Africa. As Lupton states, these and other experiences in Ghana demonstrate her maturity, as a mother who is able to let go of her adult son, as a woman who is no longer dependent upon a man, and as an American who is able to "perceive the roots of her identity" and how they affect her personality.

Angelou comes to terms with her difficult past, both as a descendant of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African-American who has experienced racism. As she tells interviewer <a href="Connie%20Martinson">Connie Martinson</a>, she brought her son to Ghana to protect him from the negative effects of racism because she did not think he had the tools to withstand them. She remains in Accra after his accident because it was traumatic for her as well—so traumatic it reduces her to silence, similar to her muteness after she was raped as a child in "Caged Bird". Her friend Julian Mayfield introduces her to Efua Sutherland, who becomes Angelou's "Sister friend" and allows her to cry out her pain, grief, and fear, something Angelou later admitted went against her American upbringing of emotional restraint.

Racism, an important theme in all of Angelou's autobiographies, continues to be important in this book, but she has matured in the way she deals with it in "Traveling Shoes". For the first time in Angelou's life, she "does not feel threatened by racial hate" in Ghana. She finds a strong support system there, and as Hagen states, she "has come far from the mute, shy little girl of Stamps, Arkansas". As Hagen states, Angelou "is not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". This is demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that is often overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. Angelou is taught an important lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compares it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts, even the efforts of <a href="Shirley%20Graham%20DuBois">Shirley Graham DuBois</a>, whom Angelou resents, is needed.

Angelou learns lessons about herself and about racism throughout "Traveling Shoes", even during her brief tour of Venice and Berlin for "The Blacks" revival. She revives her passion for African-American culture as she associates with other African-Americans for the first time since moving to Ghana. She compares her experiences of American racism with Germany's history of racial prejudice and military aggression. The verbal violence of the folk tales shared during her luncheon with her German hosts and Israeli friend is as significant to Angelou as physical violence, to the point that she becomes ill. Angelou's first-hand experience with fascism, as well as the racist sensibilities of the German family she visits, "help shape and broaden her constantly changing vision" regarding racial prejudice.

I never agreed, even as a young person, with the <a href="Thomas%20Wolfe">Thomas Wolfe</a> title "<a href="You%20Can%27t%20Go%20Home%20Again">You Can't Go Home Again</a>". Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s in the way you smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.

--Maya Angelou, 1990
The journey, or travel, is a common theme in American autobiography as a whole; as McPherson states, it is something of a <a href="national%20myth">national myth</a> to Americans as a people. This is also the case for African-American autobiography, which has its roots in the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a>. Like those narratives that focus on the writers' search for freedom from bondage, modern African-American autobiographers such as Angelou seek to develop "an authentic self" and the freedom to find it in their community. McPherson states, "The journey to a distant goal, the return home, and the quest which involves the voyage out, achievement, and return are typical patterns in Black autobiography".

The travel motif is seen throughout Angelou's series of autobiographies, emphasizing what Lupton describes as Angelou's "continuing journey of the self". Angelou continues the travel motif in "Traveling Shoes", as evidenced in the book's title, but her primary motivation in living in Africa, as she told interviewer <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>, was "trying to get home". Angelou not only relates her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compares to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a> and <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>.

Angelou was one of over two hundred Black American expatriates living in Accra at the time. She was able to find a small group of expatriates, humorously dubbed "the Revolutionary Returnees", who became her main source of support as she struggled with her place in African culture—"the conflicting feelings of being 'home' yet simultaneously being 'homeless,' cut off from America without tangible roots in their adopted black nation". For many Black Americans, it was the first time they were able to positively identify with Africa. Angelou describes the group of Black American expatriates as "a little group of Black folks, looking for a home". Reviewer Jackie Gropman has stated that Angelou presents her readers with "a wealth of information and penetrating impressions of the proud, optimistic new country of Ghana". Angelou also presents a "romanticized" view of Africa. She "falls in love" with Ghana and wishes to settle into her new home "as a baby nuzzles in a mother's arms".

Angelou soon discovers that her fellow Black expatriates "share similar delusions" and that their feelings towards Ghana and its people are not reciprocated. Lupton states, "Angelou's alliance with the African-American community often focuses on their indignation over the Ghanaians' refusal to fully welcome them". Angelou uses the parallel demonstration to King's 1963 <a href="March%20on%20Washington">March on Washington</a> to demonstrate both her and her fellow expatriates' tenuous relationship with Africa and her desire for full citizenship and assimilation, an "unattainable goal that falls outside of her desire for assimilation" and something she can never acquire in Ghana. Not only is Angelou a Black American, whether she likes it or not, "she is a Black American in exile". <a href="Houston%20A.%20Baker%2C%20Jr.">Houston A. Baker, Jr.</a>, in his review of "Traveling Shoes", states that Angelou is unable to experience a connection with what Angelou calls the "soul" of Africa, and that Angelou speculates that only the American Black, forcibly displaced and taken from the home of her ancestors, can truly understand "that home is the place where one is created".

Angelou's issues are resolved at the end of "Traveling Shoes" when she decides to leave Guy to continue his education in Accra and return to America. The final scene of the book is at <a href="Kotoka%20International%20Airport">the Accra airport</a>, with Angelou surrounded by Guy and her friends as they wish her farewell. Even though she "forsakes her new embraced alliance with Mother Africa," she claims she is "not sad" to be leaving. She calls her departure a "second leave-taking", and compares it to the last time she left her son, with his grandmother in "<a href="Singin%27%20and%20Swingin%27%20and%20Gettin%27%20Merry%20Like%20Christmas">Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas</a>" when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. As Lupton states, "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World".

"All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes" was greeted with both praise and disappointment, although reviews of the book were generally positive. According to the Poetry Foundation, "Most critics have judged Angelou’s subsequent autobiographies in light of her first, and "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" remains the most highly praised". Hagen states that "Traveling Shoes", as in her previous books, demonstrated Angelou's "broad appeal" to both her readers and her critics. The book's accuracy was verified by her close friend and fellow expatriate Julian Mayfield.

Even though "Traveling Shoes" is Angelou's fifth book in her series of autobiographies, it is able to stand on its own. Houston A. Baker, Jr., in his review of the book, called Angelou "one of the geniuses of Afro-American serial autobiography". Interviewer Connie Martinson told Angelou, "You make me, the reader...live through it with you". Scholar Eugenia Collier, writing when the possibility of the publication of consequent autobiographies in Angelou's series was uncertain, considered "Traveling Shoes" "the apex toward which the other autobiographies have pointed". Hagen considered "Traveling Shoes" "another professional, rich, full, journeyman text", and saw a higher-quality of writing, especially her "often lyrical and soaring" prose, than in her previous books. Other reviewers agree. Reviewer Janet A. Blundell found the book "absorbing reading", and reviewer Jackie Gropman stated that the "prose sings".

Some critics were less favorable in their views of "All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes". Even though the book left interviewer Russell Harris with "a haunting feeling", he found the book more "pedantic" than her previous books, and thought that it contained fewer fictional aspects compared to Angelou's other autobiographies. Scholar John C. Gruesser found the conflicts in the book unresolved and the ending "too easily manufactured at the last minute to resolve the problem of the book". Reviewer Deborah E. McDowell agreed, and found the resolution of the plot to be "stereotyped and unauthentic".

A Song Flung Up to Heaven

A Song Flung Up to Heaven is the sixth book in author <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s series of <a href="autobiographies">autobiographies</a>. Set between 1965 and 1968, it begins where Angelou's previous book "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>" ends, with Angelou's trip from <a href="Accra%2C%20Ghana">Accra, Ghana</a>, where she had lived for the past four years, back to the United States. Two "calamitous events" frame the beginning and end of the book—the assassinations of <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> and <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> Angelou describes how she dealt with these events and the sweeping changes in both the country and in her personal life, and how she coped with her return home. The book ends with Angelou at "the threshold of her literary career", writing the opening lines to her first autobiography, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>".

As she had begun to do in "Caged Bird", and continued throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. By the time "Song" was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. She recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" at the inauguration of President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a> at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy's</a> in 1961. She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. Angelou was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer". She had also become, as reviewer <a href="Richard%20A.%20Long">Richard Long</a> stated, "a major autobiographical voice of the time".

The title of "Song" was based upon the same poem, by African-American poet <a href="Paul%20Lawrence%20Dunbar">Paul Lawrence Dunbar</a>, the basis of her first autobiography. Like Angelou's other autobiographies, the book was greeted with both praise and disappointment, although reviews were generally positive. Reviewers praised Angelou for "the culmination of a unique autobiographical achievement", while others criticized her for coming across as "smug". The 2002 <a href="spoken-word%20album">spoken-word album</a> by the same name, based on the book, received a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Spoken%20Word%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album</a> in 2003.

"A Song Flung Up to Heaven" (2002) is the sixth of Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies, and at the time of its publication it was considered to be the final installment. It was completed 16 years after the publication of her previous autobiography, "<a href="All%20God%27s%20Children%20Need%20Traveling%20Shoes">All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes</a>" (1986) and over thirty years after the publication of her first, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>". Angelou wrote two collections of essays in the interim, "<a href="Wouldn%27t%20Take%20Nothing%20for%20My%20Journey%20Now">Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Even%20the%20Stars%20Look%20Lonesome">Even the Stars Look Lonesome</a>" (1997), which writer <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> called her "wisdom books" and "homilies strung together with autobiographical texts". She also continued her poetry with several volumes, including a collection of her poems, "<a href="The%20Complete%20Collected%20Poems%20of%20Maya%20Angelou">The Complete Collected Poems of Maya Angelou</a>" (1994). In 1993, Angelou recited her poem "<a href="On%20the%20Pulse%20of%20Morning">On the Pulse of Morning</a>" at the inauguration of President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a> at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy's</a> inauguration in 1961. Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal "across racial, economic, and educational boundaries".

By 2002, when "Song" was published, Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. She was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer". She had also become "a major autobiographical voice of the time". Angelou was one of the first African-American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called her first autobiography "a work of art that eludes description", stated that Angelou's series set a precedent not only for other Black women writers, but for the genre of autobiography as a whole.

Als called Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and to "be honest about it". "Song" took 16 years to write because it was so painful for her to relive the events she described, including the assassinations of <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> and <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> She did not celebrate her birthday, April 4, for many years because it was also the anniversary of King's death, choosing instead to send his widow <a href="Coretta%20Scott%20King">Coretta Scott King</a> flowers. Although "Song" was considered the final installment in her series of autobiographies, Angelou continued writing about her life story through essays, and at the age of 85, published her seventh autobiography "<a href="Mom%20%26amp%3B%20Me%20%26amp%3B%20Mom">Mom & Me & Mom</a>" (2013), which focused on her relationship with her mother. The <a href="spoken%20word%20album">spoken word album</a> based on "Song" and narrated by Angelou received a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Spoken%20Word%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album</a> in 2003.

Angelou returned to the same poem she based the title of "Caged Bird" upon for the title of "A Song Flung Up to Heaven," from the third stanza of the <a href="Paul%20Laurence%20Dunbar">Paul Laurence Dunbar</a> poem "Sympathy". Along with <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, Angelou has credited Dunbar with forming her "writing ambition". The caged bird, a symbol for the chained <a href="slave">slave</a>, is an image Angelou uses throughout all her writings.

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,When he beats his bars and would be free;It is not a carol of joy or glee,But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings— I know why the caged bird sings.

"A Song Flung Up to Heaven", which takes place between 1965 and 1968, picks up where Angelou's previous book, "All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes", ends, with Angelou's airplane trip from <a href="Accra%2C%20Ghana">Accra, Ghana</a>, where she has spent the previous four years, back to the United States. Two "calamitous events" frame the beginning and end of the book—the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Her nineteen-year-old son Guy has become an adult and is attending college in Ghana, and she is leaving a controlling relationship—her "romantic other", whom she described as "a powerful West African man who had swept into my life with the urgency of a Southern hurricane". She had also been invited to return to the US by Malcolm X, whom she had become friends with during his visit to Accra, to help her create the <a href="Organization%20of%20African%20Unity">Organization of African Unity</a>.

She postpones meeting with Malcolm X for a month and visits her mother and brother in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Malcolm X is assassinated two days later. Devastated and grief-stricken, she moves to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> to be near her brother and to resume her singing and performing career, which she had given up before leaving for Africa several years earlier. She realizes, after seeing <a href="Della%20Reese">Della Reese</a> perform, that she lacks the desire, commitment, and talent to be a singer. She instead returns to her writing career, but this time in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> instead of in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> as she had earlier in her life. To earn extra money, Angelou becomes a market researcher in Watts and gets to know the neighborhood and its people. She witnesses the 1965 <a href="Watts%20Riots">Watts Riots</a>, knowing that doing so could lead to her arrest, and she is genuinely disappointed that it does not.

At one point, Angelou's lover from Ghana, whom she calls "the African", arrives in Los Angeles to take her back to Accra. Angelou enlists the aid of her mother and brother; they come to her rescue once again by diverting the African first to Mexico and then back to Ghana. Guy, during a visit to his grandmother in San Francisco, gets into another car accident, similar to what happened before he began college in Ghana. His maturity is striking to his mother, and she leaves him in the care of his grandmother.

Angelou returns to New York, where she dedicates herself to her writing and renews many of the friendships made there in the past. She also describes her personal and professional relationships with <a href="Ruby%20Dee">Ruby Dee</a>, <a href="Ossie%20Davis">Ossie Davis</a>, <a href="Beah%20Richards">Beah Richards</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Silvera">Frank Silvera</a>. Martin Luther King, Jr. asks her to travel around the country promoting the <a href="Southern%20Christian%20Leadership%20Conference">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a>. She agrees, but "postpones again", and he is assassinated on her 40th birthday. Again devastated, she isolates herself until invited to a dinner party also attended by her friend <a href="James%20Baldwin">James Baldwin</a> and cartoonist <a href="Jules%20Feiffer">Jules Feiffer</a> and his wife Judy. Judy Feiffer, inspired by her tales about Angelou's childhood, contacts editor Robert Loomis, who challenges Angelou to write her autobiography as literature. She accepts his challenge, and "Song" ends with Angelou at "the threshold of her literary career", writing the opening lines to her first autobiography, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings":

"What are you looking at me for. I didn't come to stay".

Starting with "Caged Bird", Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including "Song", to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>. Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only "serious" writer to choose the genre to express herself. As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar <a href="Selwyn%20R.%20Cudjoe">Selwyn R. Cudjoe</a> agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. Angelou's editor <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a> was able to dare her into writing "Caged Bird" by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered "high art", which she continued throughout her series, including her final autobiography.

Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they were written by a single author, they were chronological, and they contained elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic <a href="Claudia%20Tate">Claudia Tate</a>, Angelou called her books autobiographies. When speaking of her unique use of the genre, Angelou acknowledged that she has followed the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". Reviewer <a href="Elsie%20B.%20Washington">Elsie B. Washington</a> agreed, and stated that "A Song Flung Up to Heaven" "offers a glimpse into the life of a literary icon in the making" influenced by historical events and personalities such as Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Baldwin.

Angelou recognized that there were fictional aspects to all her books; she tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". Her approach paralleled the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. Author Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insisted that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form. In a 1998 interview with journalist <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>, Angelou discussed her writing process, and "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs. When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen stated, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". Hagen also stated that Angelou "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis, agreed, stating that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader.

Like Angelou's previous autobiographies, "Song" received mostly positive reviews, although as the <a href="Poetry%20Foundation">Poetry Foundation</a> has said: "Most critics have judged Angelou's subsequent autobiographies in light of her first, and "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" remains the most highly praised." Kim Hubbard of "<a href="People%20Magazine">People Magazine</a>", for example, found "Song" unsatisfying and "hastily assembled", but poetic like "Caged Bird". Many reviewers appreciated what "Kirkus Reviews" called Angelou's "nice structural turn" of framing "Song" with two assassinations. Paula Friedman of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">The New York Times Book Review</a>" appreciated Angelou's "occasions of critical self-assessment and modesty" not present in many other autobiographies. Patricia Elam of "The New Crisis" agreed, stating that there is much to admire both about the book and about the "large life", full of tension, laughter, and love, it describes. Elam also called "Song" "a spirit-moving work that describes Angelou's journey through an authentic and artistic life".

Reviewer <a href="Margaret%20Busby">Margaret Busby</a>, who saw this book "not so much an ending as a beginning", called "Song" "the culmination of a unique autobiographical achievement, a glorious celebration of indomitable spirit". Like other reviewers, Busby considered "Song" a series of "beautifully crafted vignettes" and found the book concise and readable. Scholar <a href="John%20McWhorter">John McWhorter</a> did not look at Angelou's use of vignettes as positively, and stated that all of her books were short, divided into "ever shorter" chapters as her series progressed, and "sometimes seem written for children rather than adults". McWhorter recognized, however, that Angelou's precise prose and "striking and even jarring simplicity" was due to Angelou's purposes of depicting African-American culture in a positive way. Busby also recognized Angelou's ability to find inspirational lessons from adversity, both nationally and personally, although the emphasis in this book was on the personal, especially her dilemmas as a mother and as a lover.

Amy Strong of "<a href="The%20Library%20Journal">The Library Journal</a>", perhaps because Angelou's life during the time the book took place was full of more personal loss than conflict and struggle, considered "Song" less profound and intense than the previous books in Angelou's series. She predicted that "Song"′s direct and plainspoken style would be popular. "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>", in its review of the book, agreed with Strong and saw "a certain resignation" in "Song", instead of "the contentiousness" in Angelou's other autobiographies. The reviewer also stated that those who lived through the era Angelou described would appreciate her assessment of it, and that "Song" was "a story of tragedy and triumph, well stated and clearly stamped by her own unique blend of Afro-Americanism". The assassinations in "Song" provided the book with depth as Angelou described the events of her life, which would be "mere meanderings" if described by a less skilled writer. The reviewer was able to see Angelou's "gracious spirit" and found the book "satisfying", although he considered it a "sometimes flat account" that lacked "the spiritual tone of Angelou's essays, the openness of her poetry and the drama of her other autobiographies".

Both McWhorter and scholar Hilton Als found Angelou's writing throughout her series self-important. Although McWhorter has admitted to being charmed by Angelou's sense of authority she has inserted into her works, which he calls her "black-mother wit", he considered Angelou's autobiographies after "Caged Bird" "smug", and has stated that she "implicitly dares the reader to question her private line to God and Truth". Als agreed, stating what made "Song" different from her preceding volumes is her "ever-increasing unreliability". Als stated that Angelou, in her six autobiographies, "has given us ... the self-aggrandizing, homespun, and sometimes oddly prudish story of a black woman who, when faced with the trials of life, simply makes do". Als believed that Angelou's essays, written in the 1990s, were a better culmination of her work as an autobiographer.

Philitas of Cos

Philitas of Cos (; , "Philītas ho Kōos"; – ), sometimes spelled Philetas (; , "Philētas"; see <a href="%23Bibliography">Bibliography</a> below), was a scholar and poet during the early <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>. A Greek associated with <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, he <a href="flourished">flourished</a> in the second half of the 4th century BC and was appointed tutor to the heir to the throne of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Egypt">Ptolemaic Egypt</a>. He was thin and frail; <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a> later caricatured him as an academic so consumed by his studies that he wasted away and died.

Philitas was the first major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet. His reputation continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in <a href="elegiac">elegiac</a> meter. His vocabulary "Disorderly Words" described the meanings of rare literary words, including those used by <a href="Homer">Homer</a>. His poetry, notably his elegiac poem "Demeter", was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.

Little is known of Philitas' life. Ancient sources refer to him as a Coan, a native or long-time inhabitant of <a href="Kos">Cos</a>, one of the <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a> islands in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> just off the coast of Asia. His student <a href="Theocritus">Theocritus</a> wrote that Philetas' father was Telephos (Τήλεφος, ') and his mother, assuming the manuscript is supplemented correctly, Euctione (Εὐκτιόνη, '). From a comment about Philitas in the "<a href="Suda">Suda</a>", a 10th-century AD historical encyclopedia, it is estimated he was born , and that he might have established a reputation in Cos by . During the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Diadochi">Wars of the Diadochi</a> that followed the death of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and divided Alexander's empire, <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy</a> had captured Cos from his rival successor, <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus</a>, in 310 BC; his son, <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, was born there in 308 BC. It was a favorite retreat for men of letters weary of Alexandria.

Philetas was appointed Philadelphus' tutor, which suggests he moved to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> and moved back to Cos in the later 290s BC. He may also have tutored <a href="Arsinoe%20II%20of%20Egypt">Arsinoe II</a>, Philadelphus' older sister and eventual wife. Later tutors of royal offspring in Ptolemaic Egypt generally headed the <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>, but it is unknown whether Philitas held that position. Philitas also taught the poets <a href="Hermesianax">Hermesianax</a> and Theocritus and the <a href="Philologist">grammarian</a> <a href="Zenodotus">Zenodotus</a>, and after he returned to Cos he seems to have spent at least ten years leading a brotherhood of intellectuals and poets that included <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a>, Hermesianax, and Theocritus.

Hermesianax wrote of "Philitas, singing of nimble Bittis", and <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> twice calls her "Battis". It is commonly thought that Bittis or Battis was Philitas' mistress, and that Hermesianax referred to love poetry; another possibility is that her name connoted "chatterbox", and that she was a humorous personification of Philitas' passion for words.

Philitas was thin and frail, and may have suffered and died from a <a href="wasting%20disease">wasting disease</a>. He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280s BC. His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a <a href="plane%20tree">plane tree</a> by the people of Cos, depicting him as "frail with all the glosses". His contemporary <a href="Posidippus">Posidippus</a> wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus, which "included nothing from the physique of heroes. No, ... he cast the old man full of cares." The 3rd century AD Roman author <a href="Claudius%20Aelianus">Aelian</a> skeptically passed along a story that Philitas was so thin that he put lead weights in the soles of his shoes to avoid being blown away by a stiff wind.
A 2nd century AD Greek author, <a href="Athenaeus%20of%20Naucratis">Athenaeus of Naucratis</a>, wrote that Philitas studied false arguments and erroneous word-usage so intensely that he wasted away and starved to death, and that his <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> read:

St. George Stock analyzed the story as saying Philitas studied the <a href="Megarian%20school%20of%20philosophy">Megarian school of philosophy</a>, which cultivated and studied <a href="paradox">paradox</a>es such as the <a href="liar%20paradox">liar paradox</a>: if someone says "I am lying", is what he says true or false? Stock wrote that Philitas worried so much over the liar paradox that he died of <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, and translated the epitaph as follows:

<poem style='margin-left: 1em'>

</poem>

A more literal translation suggests that the invented epitaph pokes fun at Philitas' focus on using the right words:

<poem style='margin-left: 1em'>
Stranger, I am Philitas. The lying word and nights' evening cares destroyed me.
</poem>

Philitas wrote a vocabulary explaining the meanings of rare literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms; it probably took the form of a lexicon. The vocabulary, called "Disorderly Words" (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, '), has been lost, with only a few fragments quoted by later authors. One example, quoted in <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a>, is that the word πέλλα (') meant "wine cup" in the ancient Greek region of <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>; this was evidently contrasted to the same word meaning "milk pail" in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". "Hermeneia", another scholarly work, probably contained Philitas' versions and <a href="Exegesis">critical interpretations</a> of Homer and other authors.

About thirty fragments of Philitas' poetry are known, along with four definite titles:
Another possible poem is "Telephus", which may have been a companion to "Demeter".

At most fifty verses of Philitas survive. Below is an example fragment of two verses, which was quoted in the "Collection of Paradoxical Stories", whose putative author Antigonus (often identified with <a href="Antigonus%20of%20Carystus">Antigonus of Carystus</a>, a near-contemporary) does not specify which work they came from; indirect evidence suggests "Demeter". These two verses show the confluence of Philitas' interests in poetry and obscure words:

<poem style='margin-left: 1em'>

</poem>

According to Antigonus, the "cactus" (κάκτος, "") was a thorny plant from Sicily, and "When a deer steps on it and is pricked, its bones remain soundless and unusable for flutes. For that reason Philitas spoke of it." Antigonus quotes one more passage, and the 5th century AD anthologist <a href="Stobaeus">Stobaeus</a> quotes eleven passages from Philitas; the remaining fragments are derived from ancient commentators who quoted Philitas when discussing rare words or names used by other authors.

Philitas was the most important intellectual figure in the early years of <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic civilization</a>. He gained instant recognition in both poetry and literary scholarship, and, as far as is known, was the first person called "poet as well as scholar" (ποιητὴς ἅμα καὶ κριτικός, "poiētḕs [h]áma kaì kritikós"). As tutor to Philadelphus he is assumed to have had great influence on the development of the "<a href="Musaeum">Mouseion</a>" at Alexandria, a scholarly institution that included the famous <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>. A statue was erected of him, possibly at a "Mouseion" at Cos, and his work was explicitly acknowledged as a classic by both Theocritus and <a href="Callimachus">Callimachus</a>.

His reputation for scholarship endured for at least a century. In Athens, the comic playwright <a href="Straton%20of%20Sardis">Strato</a> made jokes that assumed audiences knew about Philitas' vocabulary, and the vocabulary was criticized more than a century later by the influential Homeric scholar <a href="Aristarchus%20of%20Samothrace">Aristarchus of Samothrace</a> in his "Against Philitas" (Πρὸς Φιλίταν, ""). The geographer <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> described him three centuries later as "simultaneously a poet and a critic".

Philitas was the first writer whose works represent the combination of qualities now regarded as <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20literature%23Hellenistic%20poetry">Hellenistic</a>: variety, scholarship, and use of Homeric sources in non-<a href="Epic%20poetry">epic</a> works. He directly influenced the major Hellenistic poets Callimachus and <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Rhodes">Apollonius of Rhodes</a>. His poetry was mentioned or briefly quoted by Callimachus and by other ancient authors, and his poetic reputation endured for at least three centuries, as <a href="Augustan%20poets">Augustan poets</a> identified his name with great elegiac writing. <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a> linked him to Callimachus with the following well-known couplet:
The 1st-century AD rhetorician <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a> ranked Philitas second only to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' influence has been found or suspected in a wide range of ancient writing; <a href="Longus">Longus</a>' 2nd century AD novel "<a href="Daphnis%20and%20Chloe">Daphnis and Chloe</a>" contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd century BC read any but a few of his lines.

Philitas' fragments were edited by Spanoudakis with commentary in English:

Adam Eckfeldt

John Adam Eckfeldt (June 15, 1769 – February 6, 1852; usually Adam Eckfeldt) was a worker and official in the early days of the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a>. A lifelong <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>n, Eckfeldt served as the second chief <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29">coiner</a> of the Mint, from 1814 until 1839.

Eckfeldt's father owned a large smithy and involved himself in early attempts at American coinage. Adam Eckfeldt built early presses for the Mint, engraved some of its early <a href="Die%20%28manufacturing%29">die</a>s, and was responsible for the designs of early American copper coinage, as well as the <a href="1792%20half%20disme">1792 half disme</a> which some authorities consider the first United States coin. He was appointed assistant coiner of the Mint in 1796, and became chief coiner on his predecessor's death in 1814.

Eckfeldt served a quarter century as chief coiner, during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises. As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion, he started the Mint's coin cabinet, which evolved into the <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a>. Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt continued to perform the duties of chief coiner; his death in 1852 caused his replacement, <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>, to seek an assistant.

John Adam Eckfeldt was born in Philadelphia on June 15, 1769, the son of John Jacob Eckfeldt, a large-scale manufacturer of edge-tools and implements. At the time, it was common for those of German descent to bear the name "John" but be referred to by middle name. The elder Eckfeldt and his wife Maria Magdalena had immigrated from <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, around 1764. John Jacob Eckfeldt, in his large smithy, made dies for the 1783 coinage under the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> authorized by Philadelphia financier <a href="Robert%20Morris%20%28financier%29">Robert Morris</a>. Adam was his father's apprentice, and was skilled in iron work and machinery.

During Eckfeldt's childhood, the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">thirteen British colonies</a> along the Atlantic coast of what is now the United States revolted, and so the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">United States of America</a> secured its independence. After the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> was ratified, Congress and many government offices came to be housed in Philadelphia, including the newborn <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a>. Adam Eckfeldt built the first <a href="screw%20press">screw press</a> for the new facility in 1792, the same year that the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201792">Mint Act of 1792</a> was passed by Congress authorizing a mint, and cut the obverse die for the experimental <a href="Birch%20cent">Birch cent</a> of that year. He also built other machinery for the Mint, and helped superintend the early coining.
In 1792, the Mint acquired three balances from Eckfeldt, who also lent the Mint his <a href="lathe">lathe</a> (used for turning dies). Eckfeldt is believed to have made the die from which the <a href="1792%20half%20disme">1792 half disme</a>, considered by some the first official U.S. coin, was struck—in 1829, a visitor to the Mint met Eckfeldt and later described him as "an artist <nowiki>[who]</nowiki> made the first die used in it". Other later accounts document Eckfeldt's role in this striking: an 1863 auction sold a half disme supposedly given by Eckfeldt to demonstrate his work. Eckfeldt is given as the source for the tradition that the half dismes were struck at the request of President <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> to be used as presents. Eckfeldt operated his screw press to strike these roughly 1,500 pieces on July 13, 1792. Since the first Philadelphia Mint was still under construction at the time, these coins were produced in the cellar of John Harper, saw maker, at Sixth and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia. In his <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20address">annual message to Congress</a> late that year, Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated: "There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes, the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them."
Eckfeldt also produced <a href="Dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29%23%26quot%3BDisme%26quot%3B%20%281792%29">a pattern disme</a>, of which only a few were struck. When the Mint's first cents (produced in 1793) were found to be excessively crude and attracted public ridicule, Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements. He placed <a href="Wreath%20cent">a wreath</a> on the back of the cent instead of <a href="Chain%20cent">the original chain</a>, and placed a <a href="trefoil">trefoil</a> under <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty's</a> head on the obverse. He also engraved the first <a href="Half%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half cent</a> dies later the same year.

Eckfeldt continued to work intermittently for the Philadelphia Mint; in 1793, he built a device for automatically feeding planchets into the die collar and ejecting the struck coins, and the mint's records reveal that he did <a href="piecework">piecework</a> there in July 1795. By October 1795 he was on the mint's payroll, as a <a href="Die%20%28manufacturing%29">die</a> <a href="Forging">forger</a> and <a href="Turning">turner</a>, at a salary of $500 per year. On January 1, 1796, Mint Director <a href="Elias%20Boudinot">Elias Boudinot</a> appointed him as assistant coiner, with the consent of President Washington. His duties in that capacity were broad.

In 1805, at Boudinot's request, Eckfeldt eliminated a security problem for the Mint by renting two houses adjacent to its operations, allowing it to shut an internal alley to public access. The following year, new Mint Director <a href="Robert%20Patterson%20%28educator%29">Robert Patterson</a> requested a pay increase of $200 for Eckfeldt, writing to President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> that Eckfeldt had "the management of the whole coining department". When the dies used proved too brittle and cracked easily, Eckfeldt came up with the idea of spraying water on the face of the die so the steel would temper evenly.

As a boy, inventor <a href="George%20Escol%20Sellers">George Escol Sellers</a> knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's father was partner in a firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work at the end of the day. Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and then he could spend it on candy.

On the death of the first chief coiner, <a href="Henry%20Voigt">Henry Voigt</a>, in early 1814, Eckfeldt was appointed by President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> as successor. He served in that capacity for a quarter century. During his tenure, he continued to improve the machinery at the Philadelphia Mint.

Eckfeldt set aside "master coins"—coins struck with extra care using new dies and polished planchets. He also put aside interesting foreign coins sent to the mint as <a href="bullion">bullion</a>. These pieces became the Mint's Cabinet, or coin collection. To fill gaps in this collection, he used old dies to strike postdated coins. Specialists have discovered that some dies he chose for this purpose had not been used together to strike coins for commerce, thus creating unique specimens. Among the pieces acquired for the Mint was a <a href="Brasher%20Doubloon">Brasher doubloon</a>, of which only six are known today. Eckfeldt often spent from his own funds to acquire the coins for the Mint. The collection eventually evolved into the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="National%20Numismatic%20Collection">National Numismatic Collection</a>.

In 1828, Eckfeldt again became involved in the real estate transactions to expand operations at the Philadelphia Mint. For $1,000, he purchased one of the lots he had rented in 1805. After the mint moved to new premises in the 1830s, Eckfeldt discovered that the lot he had purchased had a <a href="cloud%20on%20title">cloud, or irregularity, on its title</a>; he was able to clear it and sold it in 1837 for the same sum for which he had bought it. The new mint building was at Juniper and Chestnut Streets, only six blocks from Eckfeldt's home at Juniper and Vine.

Sellers, in his memoirs, described Eckfeldt as "a man of staunch integrity, a cautious, careful, orderly and painstaking man; he was not one of the dashing, pushing, inventive mechanics, though under his care many apparently slight improvements were gradually adopted that in the aggregate amounted to a great deal in the economy of working. He was by no means deficient in inventive ability." Nevertheless, as Eckfeldt aged in the service of the Mint in the late 1820s and into the 1830s, he was reluctant to adopt the innovations being proposed by his fellow Mint officer, Melter and Refiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>. Peale, like Eckfeldt of a mechanical bent, had many suggestions for improvements to the coinage machinery, some of which Eckfeldt adopted. Eckfeldt stated to Sellers, "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down". According to Sellers, "the giving up of almost life-long pets that had been Mr. Eckfeldt's constant care would naturally go hard, and still harder coming from another department, but as improvements gradually crept in and proved their efficiency Mr. Eckfeldt gave full credit where it belonged, and I remember him becoming quite enthusiastic over the labor saving [in the use of the Contamin <a href="reducing%20lathe">portrait lathe</a>] in duplicating working dies".
In 1833, Peale was sent on a tour of European mints and came home with ideas for new machines and innovations, including the introduction of steam power, used at Britain's <a href="Royal%20Mint">Royal Mint</a> since 1810 on equipment purchased from the firm of <a href="Matthew%20Boulton">Boulton</a> & <a href="James%20Watt">Watt</a>. Although Eckfeldt would have preferred to apply steam to the existing coin presses, a new one was built for steam power, and commemorative medals were the first pieces struck by steam at the Philadelphia Mint, in early 1836.

In 1839, Eckfeldt retired after 25 years as chief coiner and over forty as a Mint employee. His fellow officers at the Mint presented him with a gold medal, with silver and bronze duplicates also struck. The obverse was designed by Philadelphia engraver <a href="Moritz%20Fuerst">Moritz Fuerst</a>, who sometimes did work for the Mint; the reverse may be by Fuerst or by Peale. Eckfeldt recommended Peale as his successor, and Peale was appointed. Nevertheless, Eckfeldt continued to perform the functions of chief coiner without pay until a few days before his death on February 6, 1852. After Eckfeldt's death, Peale, wrote what Taxay terms a "frantic letter" to Mint Director <a href="George%20N.%20Eckert">George N. Eckert</a>, seeking the appointment of an assistant. Peale had spent the freed-up time designing and selling medals for private gain.

Eckfeldt married twice. No children were born of his brief first marriage in 1792 to Maria Hahn, which ended with her death; his second marriage to Margaretta Bausch produced six children. Among them were his daughter Susanna, who married William Ewing DuBois, first curator of the Mint's coin collection. <a href="Jacob%20R.%20Eckfeldt">Jacob Reese Eckfeldt</a>, one of Adam's sons, was for forty years (1832–1872) Assayer of the United States Mint. Jacob's son Jacob Branch Eckfeldt exceeded both forebears in time of service, working at the Mint for 64 years, from 1865 to 1929.

Adam Eckfeldt had a taste for <a href="horticulture">horticulture</a> and owned rural property in <a href="Upper%20Darby%2C%20Pennsylvania">Upper Darby, Pennsylvania</a>, which was inherited by his two sons after his death. He was the first president of the Good Will Fire Company, holding that office for nearly all of his adult life, and designed a system of levers for use in fire engines. A member of Concordia Lodge No. 67 of the <a href="Masonic%20Order">Masonic Order</a> from 1795 to 1806, he served as lodge master in 1803; a <a href="Chinese%20export%20porcelain">Chinese export porcelain</a> punch bowl with his name and Masonic symbols survives in the <a href="Philadelphia%20Museum%20of%20Art">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a>. A biographical sketch of Eckfeldt, published in 1897, describes him:

Far Eastern Party

The Far Eastern Party was a sledging component of the 1911–14 <a href="Australasian%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a>, which investigated the previously unexplored coastal regions of Antarctica west of <a href="Cape%20Adare">Cape Adare</a>. Led by expedition commander <a href="Douglas%20Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a>, the party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in <a href="Ad%C3%A9lie%20Land">Adélie Land</a>, pushing about towards <a href="Victoria%20Land">Victoria Land</a>. Accompanying Mawson were <a href="Belgrave%20Edward%20Sutton%20Ninnis">Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis</a>, a lieutenant in the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a>, and the Swiss ski expert <a href="Xavier%20Mertz">Xavier Mertz</a>; the party used <a href="sledge%20dog">sledge dog</a>s to increase their speed across the ice. Initially they made good progress, crossing two huge glaciers on their route south-east.

On 14 December 1912, with the party more than from the safety of the main base at <a href="Cape%20Denison">Cape Denison</a>, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a <a href="crevasse">crevasse</a> and were lost. Their supplies now severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz turned back west, gradually shooting the remaining sledge dogs for food to supplement their scarce rations. As they crossed the first glacier on their return journey Mertz became sick, making progress difficult. After almost a week of making very little headway Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone.

For almost a month he pulled his sledge across the Antarctic, crossing the second glacier, despite an illness that increasingly weakened him. Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin's Cave—a food depot from the main base—on 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there for a week while a <a href="blizzard">blizzard</a> raged outside. As a result, he missed the ship back to Australia; the <a href="SY%20Aurora">SY "Aurora"</a> had sailed on 8 February, just hours before his return to Cape Denison, after waiting for more than three weeks. With a relief party, Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the "Aurora" returned the following summer in December 1913.

The causes of Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain; a 1969 study suggested <a href="hypervitaminosis%20A">hypervitaminosis A</a>, presumably caused by the men eating the livers of their <a href="Greenland%20Dog">Greenland Huskies</a>, which are now known to be unusually high in <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>. While this is considered the most likely theory, dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses. In 1976 explorer and mountaineer <a href="Edmund%20Hillary">Sir Edmund Hillary</a> described Mawson's month-long journey as "probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration".

The <a href="Australasian%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Australasian Antarctic Expedition</a>, commanded by <a href="Douglas%20Mawson">Douglas Mawson</a>, explored part of <a href="East%20Antarctica">East Antarctica</a> between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base was established in January 1912 at <a href="Cape%20Denison">Cape Denison</a> in <a href="Commonwealth%20Bay">Commonwealth Bay</a>, <a href="Ad%C3%A9lie%20Land">Adélie Land</a>. This was much farther west than originally intended; dense <a href="Drift%20ice">pack ice</a> had prevented the expedition ship <a href="SY%20Aurora">SY "Aurora"</a> from landing closer to <a href="Cape%20Adare">Cape Adare</a>, the original eastern limit. Only after the "Aurora"—heading west—had rounded the ice tongue of the <a href="Mertz%20Glacier">Mertz Glacier</a> was a landing made.

Battling <a href="katabatic%20wind">katabatic wind</a>s that swept down from the <a href="Antarctic%20Plateau">Antarctic Plateau</a>, the shore party erected their hut and began preparations for the following summer's sledging expeditions. The men readied clothing, sledges, tents and rations, conducted limited survey parties, and deployed several caches of supplies. The most notable of these depots was Aladdin's Cave, excavated from the ice on the slope to the south of the main hut.

On 27 October 1912 Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, led by the geologist <a href="Cecil%20Madigan">Cecil Madigan</a>, was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by <a href="Frank%20Leslie%20Stillwell">Frank Stillwell</a>, which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.

The final party, led by Mawson, would push rapidly inland to the south of the Coastal Party towards <a href="Victoria%20Land">Victoria Land</a>, an area he had explored during <a href="Ernest%20Shackleton">Ernest Shackleton</a>'s <a href="Nimrod%20Expedition">British Antarctic Expedition</a> in 1908–09. He hoped to travel about east, collecting geological data and specimens, mapping the coast, and claiming territory for the crown.

Assisting him on this Far Eastern Party would be <a href="Belgrave%20Edward%20Sutton%20Ninnis">Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis</a>, a lieutenant in the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a>, and the Swiss ski expert <a href="Xavier%20Mertz">Xavier Mertz</a>. They were in charge of the expedition's <a href="sledge%20dogs">sledge dogs</a>—<a href="Greenland%20Dog">Greenland Huskies</a>—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges. Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the "Aurora" to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.

Blizzards prevented the parties from leaving Cape Denison until 10 November 1912, four days after the scheduled start date. In his diary, Mertz recorded the clearing weather as "definitely a good omen". Mawson wrote a short letter to his fiancée, Paquita Delprat:

Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the seventeen dogs left Cape Denison early in the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later. Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half the weight of the party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.

Heading south the following day to avoid <a href="crevasse">crevasse</a>s to the east, they travelled about before poor weather forced them to stop and camp. Strong winds confined them to the tent until 13 November, and they were able to travel just a short distance before the weather picked up again. For three more days they remained in their tent, unable even to light the stove. When the weather cleared on 16 November, Madigan and Stillwell's parties joined them. The three parties travelled together for much of the following day, before Mawson's party separated and pushed on ahead in the late afternoon.

Heading south-east towards the Mertz Glacier, with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis driving the dogs, the party covered on 18 November. This was despite encountering <a href="sastrugi">sastrugi</a>—ridges in the ice caused by wind—as high as , that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll. During the day they passed two peaks, which Mawson named <a href="Madigan%20Nunatak">Madigan Nunatak</a> and <a href="Aurora%20Peak">Aurora Peak</a>, after the leader of the Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition's ship. The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier. After the sledges several times overtook the dogs, the huskies were allowed to run free down the slope.

Following a particularly steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they fell into a crevasse. They were hauled out, but Mawson decided to camp when one of the dogs, Ginger Bitch, gave birth to the first in a litter of fourteen pups.

Over the next several days, the party continued across the glacier. They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses; the forerunner, on skis, would cross the snow covering the hole (the lid), and once across the first of the two dog teams would follow. Only after the first dog team was across would the second follow, "otherwise", wrote Mawson, "the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be, cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse". But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses, once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip.

After Mawson slipped into a crevasse, they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed <a href="photokeratitis">photokeratitis</a> (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with <a href="zinc%20sulfate">zinc sulfate</a> and <a href="cocaine%20hydrochloride">cocaine hydrochloride</a>. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse. On 24 November, the party reached the eastern side of the glacier and ascended to the plateau.

On level ground again, they began to make quick progress. They awoke on the morning of 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the <a href="Ninnis%20Glacier">Ninnis Glacier</a>) far larger than the first. As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once at the bottom of the glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.

In the harsh conditions, the dogs began to grow restless; one of them, Shackleton, tore open the men's food bag and devoured a pack of butter, crucial for their nourishment to supplement the <a href="hoosh">hoosh</a>. On 30 November, the party reached the eastern limit of the glacier and began the ascent to the plateau beyond, only to find themselves confronted at the top by <a href="sastrugi">sastrugi</a> so sharp-edged the dogs were useless. Worse still, temperatures rose to , melting the snow and making pulling difficult; the party switched to travelling at night to avoid the worst of the conditions.

From atop the ridge on the eastern side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the accuracy of the reports of land to the east by <a href="Charles%20Wilkes">Charles Wilkes</a> during the 1838–42 <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">United States Exploring Expedition</a>. By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, "We now appear to be off the real continent edge." Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days. On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed <a href="neuralgia">neuralgia</a> on the left side of his face and a <a href="whitlow">whitlow</a> on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger.

On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.

By noon the next day they had covered from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted:

Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as , too far for their ropes to reach. "Dog ceased to moan shortly", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. "We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called & sounded for an hour. Read the burial service."

Along with the heavy-weather tent, most of their own food and all of the dogs' food, they had lost the <a href="pickaxe">pickaxe</a>, the shovel, and Mertz's <a href="Waterproofing">waterproof</a> overpants and helmet. On Mawson's sledge they had their stove, fuel, <a href="sleeping%20bag">sleeping bag</a>s, and ten days' worth of food. Their best immediate hope was to reach the camp of two days earlier where they had left the abandoned sledge and supplies, west. They reached it in five-and-a-half-hours, where Mertz used the tent cover, with the runners from the abandoned sledge and a ski as poles, to erect a shelter.

They were faced with two possible routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with <a href="seal%20meat">seal meat</a>, and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly to the south of their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed. Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to <a href="dog%20meat">eating their remaining dogs</a>. The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. "On the whole it was voted good" wrote Mawson of the meat, "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".

Before setting off again they raised the flag—which they had forgotten to do at their furthest point—and claimed the land for the crown. With the temperature rising, they switched to travelling at night to take advantage of the harder surface the cold provided. With the five remaining dogs, Mawson and Mertz pushed on. Starving, the dogs began to struggle; two more—Johnson and Mary—were shot and divided between men and dogs over the following days. Mawson and Mertz found most of the meat tough, but enjoyed the liver; it, at least, was tender. With the pulling power of the dogs now severely depleted, Mertz stopped making trail and instead helped Mawson to pull the sledge. Despite the challenges, they made good progress; in the first four nights they travelled . As they approached the Ninnis Glacier on 21 December, Haldane—once the largest and strongest of the dogs—was shot.

Both men were suffering, but Mertz in particular started to feel ill. He complained of stomach pains, and this began to slow them down. Pavlova was killed, leaving only one remaining dog. Mawson decided to lighten their sledge, and much of the equipment—including the camera, photographic films, and all of the scientific equipment save the <a href="theodolite">theodolite</a>—was abandoned. On 29 December, the day they cleared the Ninnis Glacier, the last dog was killed. Mawson recorded: "Had a great breakfast off Ginger's skull—thyroids and brain". Two days later Mawson recorded that Mertz was "off colour"; Mertz wrote that he was "really tired [and] shall write no more".

They made on 31 December, no progress for the following two days, and 5 miles more on 3 January. "[The] cold wind frost-bit Mertz's fingers" recorded Mawson, "and he is generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc—so had to camp though going was good." Not until 6 January did they make any more progress; they went before Mertz collapsed. The following day Mawson placed Mertz onto the sledge in his sleeping bag and continued, but was forced to stop and camp when Mertz's condition again deteriorated. Mawson recorded:

Strong winds prevented Mawson from continuing for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a> for the stove, he boiled the remainder of the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.

As the weather cleared on 11 January, Mawson continued west, estimating the distance back to Cape Denison at . He travelled 2 miles before pain in his feet forced him to stop; he found that the soles of his feet had separated as a complete layer. Applying <a href="lanolin">lanolin</a> to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued. "My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment" he recorded, "frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body". Averaging around 5 miles a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.

To save himself from future crevasses, Mawson constructed a rope ladder, which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses. Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling 5 miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about to his right. In it he found food and a note from <a href="Archibald%20Lang%20McLean">Archibald Lang McLean</a>, who along with <a href="Frank%20Hurley">Frank Hurley</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Hodgeman">Alfred Hodgeman</a> had been sent out by "Aurora"'s captain <a href="John%20King%20Davis">John King Davis</a> to search for the Far Eastern Party.

From the note, Mawson learned he was south-east of Aladdin's Cave, and near two further food depots. The note also reported on the other parties of the expedition—all had returned to the hut safely—and on <a href="Roald%20Amundsen">Roald Amundsen</a>'s <a href="Amundsen%27s%20South%20Pole%20expedition">attainment of the South Pole</a> in December 1911. The cairn had been left there just six hours before, when the three men had returned to the hut. Struggling on his injured feet and lacking <a href="crampons">crampons</a> (he had thrown his away after he crossed the Mertz Glacier), Mawson took three days to reach Aladdin's Cave.

Although supplies had been left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed up the hill to meet him.

The "Aurora" arrived at Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east along the coast as far as the Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and reaching the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the "Aurora" was recalled by <a href="wireless">wireless</a> radio, but powerful <a href="katabatic%20wind">katabatic wind</a>s sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.

The "Aurora" returned to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, to take the men home. The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told <a href="Phillip%20Law">Phillip Law</a>, then-director of <a href="Australian%20National%20Antarctic%20Research%20Expeditions">Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions</a> (ANARE), that he did not believe he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.

The cause of Mawson and Mertz's illnesses remains in part a mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon and one of the men who had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to <a href="colitis">colitis</a>; Mawson wrote in "The Home of the Blizzard", his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. A 1969 study by <a href="John%20Burton%20Cleland">Sir John Cleland</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Vernon%20Southcott">R. V. Southcott</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>, <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered <a href="hypervitaminosis%20A">hypervitaminosis A</a>, an excessive intake of <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.

While hypervitaminosis A is the generally accepted medical diagnosis for Mertz's death and Mawson's illness, the theory has its detractors. Law believed it was "completely unproven ... The symptoms that were described are exactly the ones you get from cold exposure. You don't have to predicate a theory of this sort to explain the soles coming off your feet." A 2005 article in "<a href="The%20Medical%20Journal%20of%20Australia">The Medical Journal of Australia</a>" by Denise Carrington-Smith suggested it may have been "the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for", and a switch from a predominately vegetarian diet that killed Mertz, not hypervitaminosis A.
Suggestions of <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a>—that Mawson may have eaten Mertz after his death—surfaced during Mawson's lecture tour of the United States following the expedition. Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz, but these claims were denied by Mawson, who labelled them "outrageous" and an "invention". Mawson's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong; <a href="Beau%20Riffenburgh">Beau Riffenburgh</a> notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days, even at the possible risk to his own life. Moreover, he notes, Mawson had no way of knowing why Mertz died; eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous. These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres, who also notes that with Mertz's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism. Law, who knew Mawson well, believed "He was a man of very solid, conservative morals. It would have been impossible for him to have considered it."

In November 1913, shortly before the "Aurora" arrived to return them to Australia, the men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut. The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk. The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986. The two glaciers the Far Eastern Party crossed—previously unnamed—were named by Mawson for Mertz and Ninnis. At a celebration in the centre of Adelaide on his return from Antarctica, Mawson praised his dead companions: "The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all".

Mawson's return was celebrated at the <a href="Adelaide%20Town%20Hall">Adelaide Town Hall</a>, in an event attended by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Denman%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Denman">Lord Denman</a>. A typical speaker stated that "Mawson has returned from a journey that was absolutely unparalleled in the history of exploration—one of the greatest illustrations of how the sternest affairs of Nature were overcome by the superb courage, power and resolve of man". Including the Far Eastern Party, sledging parties from the Cape Denison base covered over of previously unexplored land; the expedition's <a href="Western%20Base%20Party">Western Base Party</a> on the <a href="Shackleton%20Ice%20Shelf">Shackleton Ice Shelf</a>, under <a href="Frank%20Wild">Frank Wild</a>, covered a further .

The expedition was the first to use wireless radio in the Antarctic—transmitting back to Australia via a relay station established on <a href="Macquarie%20Island">Macquarie Island</a>—and made several important scientific discoveries. First published in 1915, Mawson's account of the expedition, "The Home of the Blizzard", devotes two chapters to the Far Eastern Party; one contemporary reviewer commented that "undoubtedly to the general public the interest of the book centres in [this] moving account".

A later analysis by J. Gordon Hayes, while commending most of the expedition, was critical of Mawson's decision not to use skis, but Fred Jacka, writing in the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>", suggests that "for Mawson and Ninnis, who were manoeuvring heavy sledges, this would have been difficult much of the time". In his 1976 foreword to Lennard Bickel's book on the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, explorer and mountaineer <a href="Edmund%20Hillary">Sir Edmund Hillary</a> described Mawson's journey as "probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration".

Money in the Bank (2011)

Money in the Bank (2011) was the seventh of thirteen <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20pay-per-view%20events">events</a> held by <a href="WWE">WWE</a> that year, and the second installment in the annual <a href="WWE%20Money%20in%20the%20Bank">Money in the Bank</a> series of events. It took place on July 17, 2011, at the <a href="Allstate%20Arena">Allstate Arena</a> in the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> suburb of <a href="Rosemont%2C%20Illinois">Rosemont, Illinois</a>.

The event featured six matches, including two <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20ladder%20match">Money in the Bank ladder match</a>es. <a href="Alberto%20Del%20Rio">Alberto Del Rio</a> won the match for wrestlers from the <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> <a href="WWE%20Brand%20Extension">brand</a> to earn a <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Championship</a> match at a time of his choosing within the next year, while <a href="Daniel%20Bryan">Daniel Bryan</a> won the match for wrestlers from the <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown</a> brand for the same opportunity for the <a href="World%20Heavyweight%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Heavyweight Championship</a>. In the World Heavyweight Championship match also held at the event, <a href="Christian%20%28wrestler%29">Christian</a> defeated <a href="Randy%20Orton">Randy Orton</a> by disqualification and became the new champion as per the match stipulation. The main event featured <a href="CM%20Punk">CM Punk</a> defeating <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a> to become the new <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Champion</a>.

Money in the Bank was broadcast globally and received mostly positive reviews from critics, with the main event receiving the most praise. For pay-per-view buys, 195,000 customers paid to watch the event compared with 165,000 for the <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282010%29">previous year</a>.

WWE's Money in the Bank pay-per-view events feature their own variant of <a href="ladder%20match">ladder match</a>es, where multiple wrestlers use ladders to retrieve a briefcase hanging above the ring. Two briefcases were contested at the 2011 event, one each for members of the Raw and SmackDown brands. The respective winners were guaranteed a match for the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships at a time of their choosing within the next year. The <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282010%29">2010</a>, 2011, <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282012%29">2012</a>, and <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20%282014%29">2014</a> Money in the Bank events featured a main event involving John Cena, albeit in different storylines.

By November 2010, WWE had announced that the 2011 Money in the Bank event would take place on July 17, 2011, at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois. Tickets went on sale in May 2011 through <a href="Ticketmaster">Ticketmaster</a> with prices ranging from $25 to $300. The event, sponsored by confectionery brand <a href="Skittles%20%28confectionery%29">Skittles</a>, was the second annual Money in the Bank pay-per-view (PPV) event and the seventh of thirteen in the 2011 WWE PPV schedule. The theme song, "Money in the Bank", was composed by <a href="Jim%20Johnston%20%28composer%29">Jim Johnston</a>.

The <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types">professional wrestling matches</a> at Money in the Bank featured professional wrestlers performing as <a href="Character%20%28arts%29">characters</a> in <a href="Kayfabe">scripted events</a> pre-determined by the hosting <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a>, WWE. Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows "Raw" and "SmackDown" with the Raw and SmackDown brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs. These storylines provided the background to the 2011 event, which continued the storylines from the previous event in WWE's 2011 pay-per-view schedule, <a href="WWE%20Capitol%20Punishment">Capitol Punishment</a>.
The main event featured John Cena defending the WWE Championship against CM Punk. Punk pinned Cena in a non-title match on the June 13, 2011 episode of "Raw", and then became the number one contender by winning a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20non-elimination%20matches">triple threat</a> <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Falls%20Count%20Anywhere%20match">falls count anywhere match</a> against Alberto Del Rio and <a href="Rey%20Mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> on the June 20 episode of "Raw". After the match, Punk revealed that his WWE contract would expire at midnight on July 17, immediately after the Money in the Bank PPV ended; Punk vowed to win the championship and leave the company with it. On the next episode of "Raw", Punk cost Cena a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Tables%20match">tables match</a> against <a href="Ron%20Killings">R-Truth</a>, then delivered a <a href="Shoot%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Worked%20shoots">worked shoot</a> promo saying that he, rather than Cena, was "the best in the world"; he also berated WWE for not promoting him properly. Punk called Cena an "ass-kisser" and insulted WWE management—including chairman <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> and executive <a href="John%20Laurinaitis">John Laurinaitis</a>. In addition to saying that he was breaking the <a href="Fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a> by talking to the camera, Punk proposed that he could defend the WWE Championship by wrestling in <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20promotion">other companies</a> such as <a href="Ring%20of%20Honor">Ring of Honor</a> and <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro%20Wrestling">New Japan Pro Wrestling</a> after leaving the company with the title. As a result, Punk was given a storyline suspension and stripped of his championship match. Cena confronted McMahon and threatened to walk out on him and return the WWE Championship if Punk were not reinstated. McMahon relented on the condition that if Cena lost the title, he would be fired. On the following episode of "Raw", McMahon tried to sign Punk to a new contract to ensure the WWE Championship would stay in WWE; McMahon agreed to Punk's demands and apologized to Punk before Cena interrupted the proceedings. The segment resulted in Cena punching Punk, so Punk tore up the agreed contract.

The main feud from SmackDown was Randy Orton defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Christian. The storyline started on the May 6 episode of "SmackDown", when Orton defeated Christian to become the champion less than a week after Christian had won the title. Christian would then invoke his rematch clause against Orton at <a href="Over%20the%20Limit%20%282011%29">Over the Limit</a>, in which he lost. At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Orton defeated Christian to retain the title again by pinning him, after the referee failed to notice his foot under the bottom rope. On the June 24 episode of "SmackDown", Christian demanded another attempt at the title from SmackDown General Manager <a href="Theodore%20Long">Theodore Long</a>; his demand was granted with the proviso that he could defeat <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a>. Christian lost the match against Kane by disqualification after interference from <a href="Mark%20Henry">Mark Henry</a>. Long then made a tag team match for later that same episode, pitting the team of Christian and Henry against Kane and Orton with a similar stipulation; Henry pinned Orton in the bout. Afterward, Long offered Henry an attempt at the championship if Henry could defeat Orton again. Henry lost the match by countout after Christian engineered a distraction. This set up a match between Orton and Christian for the title at Money in the Bank. On the July 8 episode of "SmackDown", Christian's lawyers in the storyline added a stipulation to the match that if Orton was disqualified or there was "poor officiating", he would lose the title to Christian.

The Raw Money in the Bank competitors were announced on the June 27 episode of "Raw" with no qualifying matches; these were Alberto Del Rio, <a href="Alex%20Riley">Alex Riley</a>, <a href="Evan%20Bourne">Evan Bourne</a>, <a href="Jack%20Swagger">Jack Swagger</a>, <a href="Kofi%20Kingston">Kofi Kingston</a>, Rey Mysterio, <a href="Ron%20Killings">R-Truth</a>, and <a href="The%20Miz">The Miz</a>. The SmackDown Money in the Bank competitors were announced on the July 1 "SmackDown" as <a href="Cody%20Rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a>, Daniel Bryan, <a href="Heath%20Slater">Heath Slater</a>, <a href="Justin%20Gabriel">Justin Gabriel</a>, Kane, <a href="Sheamus">Sheamus</a>, <a href="M%C3%ADstico">Sin Cara</a>, and <a href="Wade%20Barrett">Wade Barrett</a>.

The feud between <a href="Big%20Show">Big Show</a> and Mark Henry started on the June 17 episode of "SmackDown", when Big Show was forced to face Henry in a match. Big Show knocked out Henry before the bout began, creating a rivalry between the two. Henry interfered in Big Show's match with Alberto Del Rio at Capitol Punishment and on the June 27 episode of "Raw" in a cage match. Henry versus Big Show was later announced for Money in the Bank. 

When <a href="Brie%20Bella">Brie Bella</a> lost her <a href="WWE%20Divas%20Championship">Divas Championship</a> to <a href="Kelly%20Kelly">Kelly Kelly</a> on the June 20 episode of "Raw", a title rematch was announced for Money in the Bank. Kelly had been feuding with the Bella Twins since May 2011.

The event, featuring commentary by <a href="Michael%20Cole%20%28wrestling%29">Michael Cole</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Lawler">Jerry Lawler</a> and <a href="Booker%20T%20%28wrestler%29">Booker T</a>, began with the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match. During the bout, Sheamus slammed Sin Cara through a ladder propped between the ring apron and the announcers' table with a <a href="Powerbomb">powerbomb</a>. The ladder was bent in half and Cara was stretchered away from ringside. Near the end of the match, Barrett, Rhodes and Bryan were the only three in the ring. Bryan put Rhodes in a <a href="Guillotine%20choke">guillotine choke</a> submission hold on top of the ladder in the middle of the ring while Barrett sneaked up the other side of the ladder. After Bryan knocked Rhodes off the ladder, Barrett got Bryan onto his shoulders and tried to throw him off. Bryan countered with repeated <a href="Elbow%20%28strike%29">elbow strikes</a> to Barrett's head. Bryan then <a href="Roundhouse%20kick">kicked</a> Barrett in the head and unhooked the briefcase to win the contest.

In the show's second match, Kelly Kelly defeated Brie Bella to retain the Divas Championship. Kelly won the bout after performing her <a href="Leg%20drop%23Leg%20drop%20bulldog">K2</a> maneuver on Brie.

In the show's third match, Mark Henry defeated Big Show. Henry gained a two-count after a <a href="Powerslam%23Falling%20powerslam">World's Strongest Slam</a> on Big Show. Henry then performed the move again and two <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Big%20splash">running splashes</a> for the <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">pinfall</a> victory. After the match, Henry wrapped a chair around Big Show's ankle and jumped on it, causing an injury to Big Show.

The next match was the Raw Money in the Bank match, where all the wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne performed his signature <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Shooting%20star%20press">Air Bourne</a> aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a <a href="Powerbomb%23Sunset%20flip%20powerbomb">sunset flip powerbomb</a>. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled on top of the ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.

In the show's fifth match, Randy Orton defended his World Heavyweight Championship against Christian, with the condition that Christian would win the title if Orton were disqualified or if there was poor officiating. Christian opened the bout by bringing a steel chair into the ring and trying to goad Orton into getting disqualified. Orton balked and threw the chair to the floor. Christian performed his signature <a href="Facebuster%23Inverted%20double%20underhook%20facebuster">Killswitch</a>, but Orton kicked out of the pin at the two count. As Orton was prepared to perform his signature <a href="Cutter%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Jumping%20cutter">RKO</a> move, Christian spat in his face. An enraged Orton <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Low%20blow">kicked Christian in the groin</a> and was disqualified, so Christian became the new champion. Afterwards, Orton viciously attacked Christian and gave him two RKOs onto the announcers' table.

The final match was for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> had threatened to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature <a href="professional%20wrestling%20throws%23Fireman%27s%20carry%20takeover">Attitude Adjustment</a> moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Go%202%20Sleep">Go to Sleep</a> maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena to fall out of the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20holds%23STF">STF</a> submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis to ring the bell. This was reminiscent of the <a href="Montreal%20Screwjob">Montreal Screwjob</a> in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to <a href="Bret%20Hart">Bret Hart</a> losing his WWF Championship to <a href="Shawn%20Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a> by submission despite Hart never submitting.

Not wanting a tainted victory, Cena broke the hold and attacked Laurinaitis. As Cena returned to the ring, Punk performed a Go to Sleep on Cena and pinned him to win the WWE Championship. McMahon ordered the winner of the Raw Money in the Bank match, Alberto Del Rio, to cash in his contract on Punk. When Del Rio ran out and tried to cash in his contract for an immediate WWE Championship match, Punk performed a <a href="Roundhouse%20kick">roundhouse kick</a> on Del Rio before he could do so. After blowing a kiss to a distraught McMahon, Punk fled the arena and left as WWE Champion.

During the event, WWE announced that its attendance was 14,815. It was later reported that 12,000 attendees had paid, earning WWE $750,000. The event drew 195,000 pay-per-view purchases, which was an increase of 18.2% from the 165,000 of the previous year's event. This contributed to WWE's PPV revenue of $15.8 million for the third quarter of 2011 compared with $13.6 million for the third quarter of 2010. The 2012 Money in the Bank event received 188,000 purchases, a drop of 3.6%.

Money in the Bank received mostly positive reviews from critics. <a href="Dave%20Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a> of the "<a href="Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>" awarded the Cena–Punk main event five stars out of five, the first WWE match to receive such a rating. The "Wrestling Observer Newsletter" later awarded the event the <a href="List%20of%20Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter%20awards%23Best%20Major%20Show">Best Major Show</a> of 2011, over other professional wrestling events by companies including <a href="Pro%20Wrestling%20Guerrilla">Pro Wrestling Guerrilla</a> and New Japan Pro Wrestling, as well as over a <a href="kickboxing">kickboxing</a> <a href="K-1%20World%20Grand%20Prix">event by K-1</a> and <a href="mixed%20martial%20arts">mixed martial arts</a> events by <a href="Ultimate%20Fighting%20Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>. The main event won the Observer award for <a href="List%20of%20Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter%20awards%23Match%20of%20the%20Year">Match of the Year</a>.

Alex Roberts of the "Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter" attended the event. He criticized the ladder matches as "dangerous spectacles" where many wrestlers "took plenty of painful-looking bumps" but often failed to score "a corresponding crowd reaction". He also stated that the apparent injuries suffered by Sin Cara and the Miz in those matches had unnerved the audience. In contrast, Roberts felt that the two world title matches, which focused on "in-ring psychology and storytelling", were much more "memorable" or even "legendary". Regarding the main event, Roberts said, "even a match-ending run-in bypassed the expected convoluted machinations and played perfectly to the narrative at hand". At the end of 2011, Nathan Kyght of the "Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter" ranked Money in the Bank the best of 34 pay-per-views in 2011, including those from WWE, <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a>, Ring of Honor, and <a href="Dragon%20Gate%20USA">Dragon Gate USA</a>.
Wade Keller, also from the "Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter", awarded the Cena–Punk bout five stars out of five, and said the "athleticism wasn't at the A+ level, but everything else that equals magic in pro wrestling happened in the last 40 minutes". Keller awarded the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match four stars and said there were "lots of good workers taking a lot of big bumps, but also selling them, during the course of the match". For the Orton–Christian match, Keller said that it was "paced well, executed well, and the finish played into the personalities and storyline of this feud". Regarding the outcome of the Henry–Big Show match, Keller commented that it was "interesting to see WWE really truly get behind Henry for the first time after all of this time".

Dave Hillhouse at the <a href="Canoe.ca">Canadian Online Explorer's</a> said Money in the Bank featured "exactly what a main event is supposed to be. A match that overshadows every other bout on the card, that has you, no matter how good each other contest is, looking forward to an ending just to be one step closer to the final contest." Hillhouse rated the main event eight out of ten and the overall event six out of ten. When the Canadian Online Explorer polled its readers on the event, 26% did not watch the event, 5% thought it was disappointing, 6% thought it was okay and 63% thought it was great.

Rob McNichol at the United Kingdom's "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" rated the event nine and a half out of ten, describing it as a "flawless exercise in the booking, promotion and performance of a wrestling show ... full of excitement, emotion and great wrestling". McNichol described Bryan's win in the "very good" opener as memorable and "a great way to inspire the crowd, who would become so important during the night". He said of the Orton–Christian match, "Christian’s character development was excellent" and that while the audience were initially "pro-Christian, who was supposed to be playing the <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">heel</a>" (a villainous character), they eventually cheered Orton's post-match beatdown of Christian. McNichol described the main event as "professional wrestling at [its] finest" and "probably the most gripping angle in wrestling this century". He said the audience's "astonishing" reception to the main event was as good as "any major match you have ever seen or cared about in history", and the match itself "was methodical, played to both wrestlers' strengths, and was beautifully paced".

In 2013, WWE released a list of their "15 best pay-per-views ever", with 2011's Money in the Bank ranked the second best. WWE also released "the 50 greatest WWE Championship Matches ever" in 2013, with the Cena–Punk match from the event ranked fourth.

Money in the Bank 2011 was released on DVD by <a href="WWE%20Home%20Video">WWE Home Video</a> on August 16, 2011; it included <a href="Matt%20Striker">Matt Striker</a> interviewing Daniel Bryan as extra content. Eric Cohen of <a href="About.com">About.com</a> awarded the DVD five stars out of five, and said the event was one of the greatest PPV events of all time and warranted his highest possible recommendation. "DVD Talk" gave a "Highly Recommended" rating to the DVD, despite "an average technical presentation (no Blu-ray option, either) and no real bonus features".

After CM Punk left the Allstate Arena with the WWE Championship belt, celebrity website <a href="TMZ">TMZ</a> pictured him showing off his newly won title belt on the streets of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> with <a href="Colt%20Cabana">Colt Cabana</a> and <a href="Ace%20Steel">Ace Steel</a>.

To crown a new WWE Champion, WWE Chairman <a href="Vince%20McMahon">Vince McMahon</a> started an eight-man tournament on the July 18 episode of "Raw", which included all the participants of the Raw Money in the Bank ladder match except Evan Bourne, whose place was filled by <a href="Dolph%20Ziggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>. The Miz and Rey Mysterio made it to the tournament finals, which McMahon postponed so he could fire John Cena as a result of the conditions imposed on the Money in the Bank match. <a href="Triple%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BH">Triple H</a> interrupted and announced that the WWE <a href="Board%20of%20directors">Board of Directors</a> had removed McMahon from power in a <a href="Motion%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a>, and that Triple H was to take over the day-to-day operations of WWE. Triple H refused to fire Cena.
On July 21, Punk gatecrashed the joint WWE–<a href="Mattel">Mattel</a> panel at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a> with title belt in hand. He confronted Triple H and took exception to WWE attempting to crown a new WWE Champion. Two days later, Punk made a surprise appearance at a show hosted by the <a href="All%20American%20Wrestling">All American Wrestling</a> company without his title belt to endorse <a href="Gregory%20Iron">Gregory Iron</a>, a wrestler with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a>, as an inspiration for overcoming his impediment.

On the July 25 episode of "Raw", Mysterio won the tournament to become the new WWE Champion, and immediately had to fend off Alberto Del Rio to prevent him from cashing in his Money in the Bank. Triple H, now <a href="Chief%20Operating%20Officer">Chief Operating Officer</a>, decreed that Mysterio was to face ex-champion Cena later that night for the title; Cena won and again became WWE Champion. After the match, Punk made an unannounced return to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to confront Cena. Cena and Punk later fought in a match at <a href="SummerSlam%20%282011%29">SummerSlam</a> on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion, which Punk won controversially as Triple H didn't see Cena's leg was on the rope and it was actually a rope break. As Punk celebrated, <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a> made his WWE return and assaulted him. Del Rio then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Punk to become the new champion after kicking Punk in the head. Punk regained the WWE Championship from Del Rio at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282011%29">Survivor Series</a> in November 2011; starting a 434-day reign until <a href="Dwayne%20Johnson">The Rock</a> beat him at the 2013 <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282013%29">Royal Rumble</a> event.

After losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Christian, Randy Orton was granted a rematch at SummerSlam, where he won a <a href="No%20Disqualification%20match">No Holds Barred match</a> to win the title. Meanwhile, in the storyline, Mark Henry went on to crush Kane and <a href="Vladimir%20Kozlov">Vladimir Kozlov</a>'s ankles with steel chairs. He defeated Orton at <a href="Night%20of%20Champions%20%282011%29">Night of Champions</a> in September to become World Heavyweight Champion for the first time. Big Show returned from injury in October 2011 to feud with Henry over his title. Daniel Bryan initially declared that he would only cash in his Money in the Bank contract for a World Heavyweight Championship match at <a href="WrestleMania%20XXVIII">WrestleMania XXVIII</a>. However, on the November 25 episode of "SmackDown", Bryan cashed in the briefcase after Henry had been knocked out by Big Show to become the World Heavyweight Champion. The match was voided by General Manager Theodore Long as Henry was not medically cleared to compete, and the briefcase was returned to Bryan. At WWE's PPV in December 2011, Henry lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Big Show. After the match, Henry assaulted Big Show which allowed Bryan to cash in his contract and pin Big Show to win the title. Bryan held on to his title long enough to have a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XXVIII in April 2012, where he lost his championship to Sheamus.

Kelly Kelly's next contender for the Divas Championship was <a href="Beth%20Phoenix">Beth Phoenix</a>; Kelly defeated Phoenix to retain her title at SummerSlam, and Night of Champions, but Phoenix ultimately beat Kelly for the title at <a href="Hell%20in%20a%20Cell%20%282011%29">Hell in a Cell</a> in October 2011.

John Laurinaitis continued to appear on television after Money in the Bank. In October 2011, he was appointed Raw General Manager, replacing Triple H as the on-screen authority figure. During Laurinaitis' rule, he feuded with CM Punk and later with John Cena, until he was fired in the storyline at <a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%282012%29">No Way Out</a> in June 2012.

In later Money in the Bank events, John Cena, Randy Orton and Sheamus won Money in the Bank ladder matches in 2012, 2013 and 2015 respectively. Cena cashed in on CM Punk and won via disqualification; thus Punk retained the WWE Championship. Orton cashed in on Daniel Bryan and captured the WWE Championship. Sheamus cashed in on <a href="Roman%20Reigns">Roman Reigns</a> and captured the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

In WWE's documentary "CM Punk: Best in the World" released in 2012, it was documented from the out-of-universe perspective that a disenchanted Punk rejected signing a new contract with WWE for more than a year leading up to Money in the Bank. After being persuaded by <a href="Joey%20Mercury">Joey Mercury</a> and <a href="Lars%20Frederiksen">Lars Frederiksen</a> that he could only help wrestlers underappreciated by WWE (like himself) if he stayed, Punk signed a new contract with WWE about an hour before capturing the WWE Championship from Cena, while the pay-per-view event was ongoing.

William F. Raynolds

William Franklin Raynolds (March 17, 1820 – October 18, 1894) was an explorer, engineer and U.S. army officer who served in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> and <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. He is best known for leading the 1859–60 <a href="Raynolds%20Expedition">Raynolds Expedition</a> while serving as a member of the U.S. Army <a href="Corps%20of%20Topographical%20Engineers">Corps of Topographical Engineers</a>.

During the 1850s and again after his participation in the American Civil War, Raynolds was the head engineer on numerous lighthouse construction projects. He oversaw riverway and harbor dredging projects intended to improve accessibility and navigation for shipping. As a cartographer, Raynolds surveyed and mapped the islands and shorelines on the Great Lakes and other regions. At least six lighthouses whose construction he oversaw are still standing. Some are still in use and of these, several are listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

In 1848, during the American occupation of Mexico after the Mexican–American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel were the first confirmed to have reached the summit <a href="Pico%20de%20Orizaba">Pico de Orizaba</a>, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set what may have been a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition to venture into the upper <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone</a> region that was later to become <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>. Heavy winter snowpack in the <a href="Absaroka%20Range">Absaroka Range</a> of <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross <a href="Union%20Pass">Union Pass</a> at the northern end of the <a href="Wind%20River%20Range">Wind River Range</a>. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered <a href="Jackson%20Hole">Jackson Hole</a> and surveyed the <a href="Teton%20Range">Teton Range</a>, now within <a href="Grand%20Teton%20National%20Park">Grand Teton National Park</a>.

During the American Civil War, Raynolds participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cross%20Keys">Battle of Cross Keys</a> during the <a href="Valley%20Campaign">Valley Campaign</a> of 1862 and a year later was in charge of fortifications in the defense of the military arsenal at <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry, West Virginia</a>. On March 13, 1865 Raynolds was <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevetted</a> <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> for meritorious service during the Civil War. Raynolds retired from the army on March 17, 1884 with the permanent rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a> after a 40-year military career.

William Franklin Raynolds was born on March 17, 1820 in <a href="Canton%2C%20Ohio">Canton, Ohio</a>, the fourth of six children to William Raynolds (November 2, 1789 – September 20, 1829) and Elizabeth Seabury (née Fisk 1796 – April 13, 1853). William F. Raynolds's grandfather was also named William Raynolds (1764–1814) and had been a veteran of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, serving as a <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a> from April 12, 1812 until April 13, 1813. During the War of 1812, the grandfather Raynolds rose to the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> while serving under <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a>.

William F. Raynolds entered the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>, on July 1, 1839 after being appointed from Ohio. He graduated fifth out of 39 classmates in his class of 1843, which included <a href="William%20B.%20Franklin">William B. Franklin</a>, Raynolds's friend <a href="Joseph%20J.%20Reynolds">Joseph J. Reynolds</a> and future <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">president</a> <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. Raynolds married at a young age; he and his wife had no children.

Initially appointed a brevet <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 5th U.S. Infantry, within a few weeks Raynolds was transferred to the U.S. Army <a href="Corps%20of%20Topographical%20Engineers">Corps of Topographical Engineers</a>. The Topographical Engineers performed surveys and developed maps for army use until their merger with the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a> in 1863. Raynolds's first assignments from 1843 to 1844 were as an assistant topographical engineer involved in improving navigation on the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> and surveying the northeastern boundary of the U.S. between 1844 and 1847.

When war with Mexico seemed imminent, topographic engineers were sent to the border to assist with the army's preparations. Raynolds served in <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>'s <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a> campaign which marched overland to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> from the Gulf of Mexico seaport at <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a>. After the war, the American army occupied Mexico City and the surrounding region. During the occupation, Raynolds and others set out to map and explore nearby mountains. Raynolds's party is credited with being the first confirmed to climb to the summit of <a href="Pico%20de%20Orizaba">Pico de Orizaba</a> () which at is the tallest mountain in Mexico and third tallest in North America. Over a period of several months, Raynolds and other officers from both the army and navy mapped the best approach route to Pico de Orizaba. To assist them in their climb, the party planned on taking <a href="Grappling%20hook">grapnels</a> attached to long ropes and primitive <a href="crampon">crampon</a>s in the form of shoes with projecting points to help ensure they could safely climb up cliffs and across glaciers. Told by local villagers that any attempt to reach the summit would be fruitless because no one had ever done it before, the Americans became even more determined to show the Mexicans it could be climbed.

As the expedition left to ascend the mountain, a long pack train of nearly fifty officers, soldiers and native guides departed from the town of Orizaba in early May 1848. After several days of hiking through dense jungle, the expedition slowly gained altitude and established a base camp at . Starting from base camp in the early morning of May 10 nearly two dozen climbers made the final push to the top of the mountain, but only Raynolds and a few others reached the summit. According to mountaineer and author Leigh N. Ortenburger, this feat may have inadvertently set the American <a href="mountaineering">mountaineering</a> altitude record for the next 50 years. Raynolds estimated the summit of Pico de Orizaba to be above sea level, which was slightly greater than previous estimates but below the modern known altitude. As no higher peaks were known in North America at that time, Raynolds believed Pico de Orizaba was the tallest mountain on the continent. The summit crater was covered in snow but estimated to be between in diameter and deep. The American achievement was disputed by the Mexicans until an 1851 French expedition discovered an American flag on the summit with the year 1848 carved in the flagpole.

After returning from Mexico, Raynolds resumed mapping the U.S.–Canada border which he had been surveying before the war, then embarked on a project to develop water resources for the nation's growing capital of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Raynolds traveled the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> for several years surveying and mapping shorelines while identifying potential <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> locations. After promotion to <a href="First%20Lieutenant">first lieutenant</a> and then captain, in 1857 he was assigned to design and supervise the construction of lighthouses along the <a href="Jersey%20Shore">Jersey Shore</a> and the <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a> regions. in the late 1850s Raynolds supervised construction of the <a href="Fenwick%20Island%20Light">Fenwick Island Light</a> in <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a> and the <a href="Cape%20May%20Light">Cape May Light</a> in New Jersey. In 1859, he made alterations to the <a href="Jupiter%20Inlet%20Light">Jupiter Inlet Light</a> in <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter, Florida</a>.

In early 1859, Raynolds was charged with leading an expedition into the <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone</a> region of <a href="Montana">Montana</a> and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> to determine, "as far as practicable, everything relating to ... the Indians of the country, its agricultural and mineralogical resources ... the navigability of its streams, its topographical features, and the facilities or obstacles which the latter present to the construction of rail or common roads ...". The expedition was carried out by a handful of technicians, including photographer and topographer <a href="James%20D.%20Hutton">James D. Hutton</a>, artist and mapmaker <a href="Anton%20Sch%C3%B6nborn">Anton Schönborn</a>, and geologist and naturalist <a href="Ferdinand%20Vandeveer%20Hayden">Ferdinand V. Hayden</a>, who led several later expeditions to the Yellowstone region. Raynolds's second-in-command was lieutenant Henry E. Maynadier. The expedition was supported by a small infantry detachment of 30 and was federally funded with $60,000. Experienced <a href="mountain%20man">mountain man</a> <a href="Jim%20Bridger">Jim Bridger</a> was hired to guide the expedition.

The expedition started in late May 1859 at <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, then was transported by two steamboats up the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> to <a href="New%20Fort%20Pierre">New Fort Pierre</a>, <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>. In late June the expedition left New Fort Pierre and headed overland to <a href="Fort%20Sarpy">Fort Sarpy</a> where they encountered the <a href="Crow%20Nation">Crow Indians</a>. Raynolds stated that the Crow were a "small band compared to their neighbors, but are famous warriors, and, according to common report, seldom fail to hold their own with any of the tribes unless greatly outnumbered." Raynolds was impressed with the Crow chief Red Bear, and after assuring him that the expedition meant only to pass through Crow Indian territory and not linger, traded with the Crows for seven horses.

Raynolds divided his expedition, sending a smaller detachment under Maynadier to explore the <a href="Tongue%20River%20%28Montana%29">Tongue River</a>, a major tributary of the <a href="Yellowstone%20River">Yellowstone River</a>. Two of Maynadier's party, James D. Hutton and Zephyr Recontre, the expedition's <a href="Siouan%20languages">Sioux</a> interpreter, took a side trip to locate and investigate an isolated rock formation that had been seen from great distance by a previous expedition in 1857. Hutton was the first person of European descent to reach this rock formation in northeastern Wyoming, later known as <a href="Devils%20Tower">Devils Tower</a>; Raynolds never elaborated on this event, mentioning it only in passing. By September 2, 1859, Raynolds's detachment had followed the Yellowstone River to the confluence with the <a href="Bighorn%20River">Bighorn River</a> in south-central Montana. The two parties under Raynolds and Maynadier reunited on October 12, 1859 and wintered at Deer Creek Station, on the <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a> in central Wyoming.

The expedition recommenced its explorations in May 1860. Raynolds led a party north and west up the upstream portion of the Bighorn River, which is today called the <a href="Wind%20River%20%28Wyoming%29">Wind River</a>, hoping to cross the mountains at <a href="Togwotee%20Pass">Togwotee Pass</a> in the <a href="Absaroka%20Range">Absaroka Range</a>, a <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a> known to expedition guide Jim Bridger. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back north to the Bighorn River to explore it and its associated tributary streams more thoroughly. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at <a href="Three%20Forks%2C%20Montana">Three Forks, Montana</a>, so they could make observations of a total <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a> forecast for July 18, 1860. Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter to the top of Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline for reaching Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass in the northern <a href="Wind%20River%20Range">Wind River Range</a> that Raynolds named <a href="Union%20Pass">Union Pass</a>, to the west of which lay <a href="Jackson%20Hole">Jackson Hole</a> and the <a href="Teton%20Range">Teton Range</a>. From there the expedition went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at <a href="Teton%20Pass">Teton Pass</a> and entering <a href="Pierre%27s%20Hole">Pierre's Hole</a> in present-day <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. Though Raynolds and his party managed to get to Three Forks by the scheduled date, Maynadier's party was several days late, which prevented a detachment heading north to observe the solar eclipse. The reunited expedition then headed home, traveling from <a href="Fort%20Benton%2C%20Montana">Fort Benton, Montana</a>, to <a href="Fort%20Union%20Trading%20Post%20National%20Historic%20Site">Fort Union</a> near the Montana-North Dakota border via steamboat. It then journeyed overland to <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, where the expedition members were disbanded in October 1860.
Though the Raynolds Expedition was unsuccessful in exploring the region that later became Yellowstone National Park, it was the first federally funded party to enter Jackson Hole and observe the Teton Range. The expedition covered over and explored an area of nearly . In a preliminary report sent east in 1859, Raynolds stated that the once-abundant <a href="bison">bison</a> were being killed for their hides at such an alarming rate that they might soon become extinct. Raynolds's immediate participation in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, followed by a severe illness, delayed him from presenting his report on the expedition until 1868. Research data and botanical specimens, as well as fossils and geological items that had been collected during the expedition, were sent to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>, but were not studied in detail until after the war. Much of the artwork created by Hutton and especially Schönborn was lost, though several of Schönborn's <a href="Chromolithography">chromolithographs</a> appeared in Ferdinand V. Hayden's 1883 report that was submitted after later expeditions.

Raynolds returned to Washington at the outbreak of the war, and was made chief topographic engineer of the <a href="Department%20of%20Virginia%20and%20North%20Carolina%23Department%20of%20Virginia">Department of Virginia</a> in July 1861. The army lacked adequate maps for military use, so Raynolds and his team of engineers began to survey and draw up maps of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and the region of the western portion of that state that had remained loyal to the Union and would become the new state of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>. In 1862, Raynolds was engaged with <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont's</a> Mountain Department in chasing <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a> up the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cross%20Keys">Battle of Cross Keys</a>.

Raynolds spent two months recovering from illness after the <a href="Valley%20Campaign">Valley Campaign</a>, then was assigned as chief engineer of Middle Department and <a href="VIII%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">VIII Corps</a> in January 1863. Promoted to major in the Corps of Engineers, he found himself in charge of the defenses of vital <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry, West Virginia</a> in March 1863 during <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee's</a> second <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> invasion of the north during the <a href="Gettysburg%20Campaign">Gettysburg Campaign</a>. On March 31, 1863, the Corps of Topographical Engineers ceased to be an independent branch of the army and was merged into the Corps of Engineers and Raynolds served in that branch of the army for the remainder of his career. Officers from the two corps maintained their ranks based on the time at which they received their promotion.

As the end of war approached and hostilities with the <a href="Sioux%20Indians">Sioux Indians</a> loomed, Raynolds's knowledge of and experiences in the Great Lakes region became more important to the army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry. As a result, he returned to the Great Lakes as superintending engineer of surveys and lighthouses in April 1864, and saw no further combat for the rest of his career. Before the war was over, on March 13, 1865 Raynolds was brevetted to <a href="Brigadier%20General">brigadier general</a> for meritorious service.

After the Civil War, the Corps of Engineers undertook a program of river and harbor improvements. Raynolds supervised the dredging and improvement of navigation on the <a href="Arkansas%20River">Arkansas</a>, <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> and Missouri Rivers. He also helped supervise several harbor dredging and construction projects, involving the harbor in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, the Harbor of Refuge in <a href="New%20Buffalo%2C%20Michigan">New Buffalo, Michigan</a>, <a href="Erie%20Harbor">Erie Harbor</a> in <a href="Erie%2C%20Pennsylvania">Erie, Pennsylvania</a>, and the river harbors of St. Louis, Missouri and <a href="Alton%2C%20Illinois">Alton, Illinois</a>. Raynolds sited and oversaw the installation of dozens of lighthouses in the Great Lakes area, where he served as the superintending engineer from 1864 to 1870. Raynolds was promoted to permanent rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> in the Corps of Engineers on March 7, 1867. He then supervised lighthouse construction along the <a href="Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a> and in New Jersey where he managed the construction of the <a href="Hereford%20Inlet%20Light">Hereford Inlet Light</a>house in 1874. From May 5 to October 7, 1877, Reynolds led a procession of American engineers to an engineering conference in Europe.

Promoted to the permanent rank of colonel on January 2, 1881, Raynolds continued serving with the Corps of Engineers supporting a variety of harbor and river navigational improvements until his retirement in 1884, after a military career that spanned 40 years. As he approached retirement, Raynolds was elected a trustee of the <a href="Presbyterian%20Church">Presbyterian Church</a>. According to West Point classmate Joseph Reynolds, who saw him at the West Point graduates reunion in 1893, Raynolds maintained a vigorous and healthy appearance long after his retirement, his brown hair, "then but slightly sprinkled with gray". Raynolds died on October 18, 1894 in <a href="Detroit%20Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a>, leaving his widow a substantial estate for the time, estimated at between US $50,000 ($ today) and $100,000 ($ today). After providing for his widow, his <a href="Will%20and%20testament">will</a> directed that after her death, the entire estate would be donated to the Presbyterian Church. Raynolds was interred in <a href="West%20Lawn%20Cemetery">West Lawn Cemetery</a> in Canton, Ohio.

Raynolds's 1848 expedition to the summit of Pico de Orizaba in Mexico predated what is known as the <a href="Golden%20age%20of%20alpinism">Golden age of alpinism</a> (1854–65), when many major mountain peaks in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> were first climbed. The effort to summit the mountain was one of the earliest deliberate attempts to climb a major mountain peak, and involved logistics, planning and use of rudimentary climbing equipment, "making it one of the more serious mountaineering expeditions undertaken to that point in history." Though unable to penetrate into the heart of what later became Yellowstone National Park, the Raynolds Expedition produced maps that were used by subsequent explorers to the greater Yellowstone region. Raynolds also located suitable wagon routes in the <a href="Bighorn%20Basin">Bighorn Basin</a> and was able to help narrow down the most appropriate routes for a future transcontinental railroad. The Raynolds Expedition further determined that few if any rivers in the region would be suitable for steamboats due to numerous rapids and steep gradients. Several lighthouses whose construction was designed or supervised by Raynolds are still in use and several are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

At least two geographical locations are named for William Raynolds. The mountain gap where the Raynolds Expedition crossed the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a> between southwest Montana and northeast Idaho is named <a href="Raynolds%20Pass">Raynolds Pass</a> () and <a href="Raynolds%20Peak">Raynolds Peak</a> () is an isolated peak in the Teton Range that was named after him in 1938. The fossil remains of the extinct <a href="Gastropoda">gastropod</a> "<a href="Viviparus">Viviparus raynoldsanus</a>" was named by Ferdinand V. Hayden in honor of Raynolds after the specimen was collected in the <a href="Powder%20River%20Basin">Powder River Basin</a> during the expedition.

Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)

"Here We Go Again" is a <a href="country%20music">country music</a> <a href="standard%20%28music%29">standard</a> written by <a href="Don%20Lanier">Don Lanier</a> and <a href="Red%20Steagall">Red Steagall</a> that first became notable as a <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> <a href="single%20%28music%29">single</a> by <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> from his 1967 album "<a href="Ray%20Charles%20Invites%20You%20to%20Listen">Ray Charles Invites You to Listen</a>". It was <a href="record%20producer">produced</a> by Joe Adams for <a href="ABC%20Records">ABC Records</a>/<a href="Tangerine%20Records%20%281963%29">Tangerine Records</a>. To date, this version of the song has been the biggest commercial success, spending twelve consecutive weeks on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart</a>, peaking at number 15.

The most notable <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> is a duet by Charles and <a href="Norah%20Jones">Norah Jones</a>, which appeared on the 2004 album "<a href="Genius%20Loves%20Company">Genius Loves Company</a>". This version has been the biggest critical success. After "Genius Loves Company" was released, "Here We Go Again" earned <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Best Pop Collaboration</a> at the <a href="47th%20Grammy%20Awards">47th Grammy Awards</a> in February 2005, posthumously for Charles, who died before the album's release. Another notable version by <a href="Nancy%20Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a> charted for five weeks in 1969. <a href="Johnny%20Duncan%20%28country%20singer%29">Johnny Duncan</a> charted the song on "Billboard" <a href="Hot%20Country%20Songs">Hot Country Songs</a> chart for five weeks in 1972, while <a href="Roy%20Clark">Roy Clark</a> did so for seven weeks in 1982.

The song has been covered in a wide variety of musical genres. In total, five different versions have been listed on the music charts. Although its two most successful versions have been rhythm and blues recordings, many of its other notable covers were featured on country music albums. "Here We Go Again" was first covered in an instrumental <a href="jazz%20music">jazz</a> format, and many of the more recent covers have been sung as <a href="duet">duet</a>s, such as one with <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> and Norah Jones with <a href="Wynton%20Marsalis">Wynton Marsalis</a> accompanying. The song was released on their 2011 <a href="tribute%20album">tribute album</a> "". The song lent its name to Red Steagall's 2007 album as well. Cover versions have appeared on <a href="compilation%20album">compilation album</a>s by a number of artists, even some who did not release "Here We Go Again" as a single.

In November 1959, after twelve years as a professional musician, Ray Charles signed with ABC Records, following the expiration of his <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a> contract. According to Will Friedwald in "A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers", "His first four ABC albums were all primarily devoted to <a href="standard%20%28music%29">standards</a>..." In the 1960s, he experienced <a href="crossover%20%28music%29">crossover</a> success with both rhythm and blues and country music. Because Charles was signed to ABC as a rhythm and blues singer, he decided to wait until his contract was up for its three-year renewal before experimenting with country music, although he wanted to do so sooner. With the assistance of ABC executive <a href="Sid%20Feller">Sid Feller</a>, he gathered a set of country songs to record, despite the wishes of ABC. The release of his 1962 country albums "<a href="Modern%20Sounds%20in%20Country%20and%20Western%20Music">Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</a>" and its follow-up "<a href="Modern%20Sounds%20in%20Country%20and%20Western%20Music%20Volume%20Two">Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, Vol. 2</a>" broadened the appeal of his music to the mainstream. At this point, Charles began to appeal more to a white audience. In 1962 he founded his own record label, Tangerine Records, which ABC-Paramount promoted and distributed.

"Here We Go Again" was recorded during a phase in Charles' career when he was focused on performing country music. Thus, "Here We Go Again" was a country music song released by the Tangerine label ABC-Paramount, but performed in Charles' rhythm and blues style. However, his works did not bear the Tangerine label until 1968. Feller left ABC in 1965, but he returned to <a href="arrangement">arrange</a> Charles' 1967 album, "Ray Charles Invites You to Listen". Joe Adams produced and <a href="audio%20engineer">engineered</a> the album, which included "Here We Go Again".

First released by Charles in 1967, "Here We Go Again" was written by Lanier and Steagall and published by the Dirk Music Company. Charles recorded it at RPM International Studios, Los Angeles, and the song was listed as the sixth of ten tracks on "Ray Charles Invites You to Listen". Starting in 1987, it was included in numerous <a href="greatest%20hits%20album">greatest hits</a> and compilation albums. When "Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music" was reissued in 1988, the song was added as a bonus track. It was also included on the 1988 album "<a href="Ray%20Charles%20Anthology">Ray Charles Anthology</a>".

Steagall endured <a href="polio">polio</a> as a teen and learned how to play the <a href="guitar">guitar</a> and <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> during his recuperation. This activity helped him regain the use of his left arm and hand. When he enrolled at <a href="West%20Texas%20State%20University">West Texas State University</a>, he formed his first country band. Don Lanier formed a group by the name of The Rhythm Orchids along with <a href="Buddy%20Knox">Buddy Knox</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Bowen">Jimmy Bowen</a>. He was hired as a soil chemist but played weekends at country dances. After he quit his professional role, he formed a band that became popular in the Rocky Mountain ski-resort clubs. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 and embarked on folk club performing and songwriting. He wrote for two music publishers, Tree and Combine, before signing with <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. Eventually, Steagall joined Lanier and Bowen. Steagall and Lanier co-wrote "Here We Go Again". Steagall's first break came when Charles covered "Here We Go Again". Steagall says that the song "came about in a very unusual manner and very quickly". One source even claims that Steagall did not come to Hollywood until after Charles recorded the song.

According to the sheet music published by Dirk Music, "Here We Go Again" is set in 12/8 time with a slow shuffle <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of sixty-nine <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>. The song is written in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of <a href="B-flat%20major">B major</a>. It is primarily a country song, but contains <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a> influences. According to Matthew Greenwald of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>, "'Here We Go Again' is a soulful ballad in the Southern <a href="blues">blues</a> tradition. Lyrically, it has a resignation and pain that makes the blues, simply, what it is. The recording has a simple and sterling gospel arrangement and, in retrospect, is one of Charles' finer attempts in the studio from the 1960s."

The playlist of the 1967 tour promoting "Ray Charles Invites You to Listen" is not readily available, but "Here We Go Again" was the best-charting song on the album (and likely on the playlist). Charles' tour began with a <a href="benefit%20concert">benefit concert</a> on the <a href="USS%20Constellation%20%28CV-64%29">USS "Constellation"</a>, which was preparing to depart for the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> from <a href="San%20Diego%20Harbor">San Diego Harbor</a>. The tour, Charles' first since 1964, continued to Europe in mid-April where it visited the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>, London and <a href="Salle%20Pleyel">Salle Pleyel</a>, Paris, as well as Vienna. In May, the band played back in the United States at New York City's <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> before returning to California. The tour received bad reviews from publications such as "Jazz Journal", "<a href="Jazz%20Magazine">Jazz Magazine</a>" and the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>". Later that summer, the band played <a href="Constitution%20Hall">Constitution Hall</a>, Washington, D.C. In the fall, Charles had his first lucrative Nevada casino performances, which started with a three-week run at <a href="Harrah%27s%20Reno">Harrah's Reno</a> that was praised in "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>". The tour also had an extended fall run at New York's <a href="Copacabana%20%28nightclub%29">Copacabana nightclub</a>.

Greenwald described the original version of "Here We Go Again" as "Another excellent example of how Ray Charles was able to fuse blues and country". In a review for the single, a writer for "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine wrote that the song could easily be a "blockbuster" for Charles.

The original version debuted at number 79 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in the May 20, 1967, issue and number 48 on the <a href="Hot%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Songs">US "Billboard" Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles top 50 chart</a> on June 10, 1967. For the weeks ending July 15, 22 and 29, the song spent three weeks at its peak position of number 15 on the Hot 100 chart. It spent July 22 and 29 at its peak position of number 5 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. By August 12, it fell out the Hot 100 chart, ending a 12-week run. It remained on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart for 13 weeks ending on September 2. "Here We Go Again" was Charles' last single to enter the top twenty of the Hot 100. For the year 1967 the song finished at number 80 on the <a href="Billboard%20Year-End">US "Billboard" Year-End</a> Hot 100 chart and 33 on the Year-End Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart.

Abroad, it debuted on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> top 40 at number 38 on July 8, 1967, which would be its peak. It totalled 3 non-consecutive weeks on the chart. In the Netherlands, "Here We Go Again" appeared on the <a href="Single%20Top%20100">singles chart</a> at number 10 on July 15, 1967, and later peaked at number three.

According to <a href="Will%20Friedwald">Will Friedwald</a>, this song is an example of Charles vocalizing in what would ordinarily be a generally extraneous manner for dramatic effect by using a different voice than he had ever previously exhibited. He sang "... not just using the squeak—using a whole new kind of squeak, in fact—for additional coloring on the sidelines, but making it the heart of the matter, literally squeaking out the words and notes in harmony with <a href="the%20Raelettes">the Raelettes</a>" (his <a href="background%20singer">background singer</a>s).

According to Allmusic, the solo version is listed at lengths between 3:14 and 3:20 on various albums.

Charles is credited as vocalist and pianist with unknown accompaniment. Feller is credited for having arranged and <a href="conducting">conducted</a> the recording. This is one of two songs on the album ("<a href="Yesterday%20%28Beatles%20song%29">Yesterday</a>" being the other) that in addition to being listed as <a href="ABC%20Records">ABC-Par</a> ABC595 is credited as <a href="Dunhill%20Records">Dunhill</a> DZS036 [CD]. The individual song had a label number ABC/TRC 10938. "<a href="In%20the%20Heat%20of%20the%20Night%20%28Ray%20Charles%20song%29">In the Heat of the Night</a>" also had a Dunhill credit but a different number for both Dunhill and ABC.

<a href="Nancy%20Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a> recorded a cover of the song for her 1969 album "<a href="Nancy%20%28album%29">Nancy</a>", which was her first album after ending her business relationship with producer <a href="Lee%20Hazlewood">Lee Hazlewood</a>. The cover, which according to programming guides had an <a href="easy%20listening">easy listening</a> and country music appeal, was produced by <a href="Billy%20Strange">Billy Strange</a>. The <a href="B-side">B-side</a> to the single, "<a href="Memories%20%28Elvis%20Presley%20song%29">Memories</a>", was written by Strange along with <a href="Mac%20Davis">Mac Davis</a>. "Billboard" magazine staff reviewed the song favorably, stating that the cover was a "smooth sing-a-long pop style". They also commended Sinatra's singing, calling it a "fine" performance, noting that it would likely return her to the "Billboard" charts. Sinatra's version was later <a href="remaster">remaster</a>ed and reissued in 1996.

Although <a href="CD%20Universe">CD Universe</a> describes the song as a country music song, it never charted on country music charts. For the week ending May 17, 1969, the song was listed among <a href="Bubbling%20Under%20Hot%20100%20Singles">US "Billboard" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart</a> at number 106 and debuted on the <a href="Adult%20Contemporary%20%28chart%29">US "Billboard" Easy Listening Top 40 chart</a> at number 30. The following week it debuted on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart at number 98, its apex for its two-week stay. The song then spent a total of two weeks on the Hot 100. For the week ending June 7, the song spent a second consecutive week at its peak position of number 19 on the Easy Listening chart. The song remained on the chart for five weeks until June 14, 1969. In Canada "Here We Go Again" debuted at number 38 on the "<a href="RPM%20%28magazine%29">RPM</a>" Adult Contemporary chart (previously Young Adult Chart) on June 2, 1969. It peaked at number 21 for the week of June 16, 1969. The song spent a total of five weeks on the chart. According to Allmusic databases, 1969 was the final year in <a href="Nancy%20Sinatra%20discography%23Singles">her career</a> that Sinatra reached the Hot 100 chart (with "Here We Go Again", "God Knows I Love You" and "Drummer Man").


According to Allmusic the original track was 3:09, but when it appeared on the 2006 compilation album "Essential Nancy Sinatra", it was 3:11. The single was initially released through Reprise Records. In a non-exclusive <a href="music%20licensing">licensing</a> agreement, Reprise (part of <a href="Warner%20Music">Warner Music</a>) gave <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a> the rights to distribute the records of some of their artists including Sinatra and <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>. In 1971, Sinatra and Reprise parted ways, so she signed a long-term contract with RCA Records.

The following musicians performed on this track:

The following musicians performed on this album:

In 2004, Charles re-recorded "Here We Go Again" as a duet with American <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a> <a href="Norah%20Jones">Norah Jones</a>, who grew up listening to his music. During Jones' "Billboard" interview for her 2010 collaboration album "<a href="...Featuring%20%28album%29">...Featuring</a>", which included her "Here We Go Again" duet, she said "I got a call from Ray asking if I'd be interested in singing on this duets record. I got on the next plane and I brought my mom. We went to his studio and did it live with the band. I sang it right next to Ray, watching his mouth for the phrasing. He was very sweet and put me at ease, which was great because I was petrified walking in there." She noted in one "...Featuring" interview that the only part that was not done live was a piano overlay that she added afterwards to complement Charles' keyboard. In the same interview, she noted that she had been given the opportunity to select a song from Charles' songbook to perform as a duet and felt that this one provided the best opportunity to harmonize rather than alternate vocal verses. On the record, the two singers vocalize, accompanied by <a href="Billy%20Preston">Billy Preston</a> on <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a>, who had at one time been the regular organist in Charles' band.

As part of Charles' <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a>-winning "Genius Loves Company", the song proved to be the most popular and critically acclaimed on the album. Although the song had its early detractors, it received mostly favorable reviews. Several reviewers noted the complementarity of Jones and Charles. "The Daily Vault" Jason Warburg described the song as a "jazzy, slinky <a href="pas%20de%20deux">pas de deux</a>" in which Charles matches Jones note for note." "<a href="JazzTimes">JazzTimes</a>"' Christopher Loudon said Charles "blends seamlessly with Jones on a velvet-and-<a href="buckram">buckram</a>" performance. The song was described by the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>" Jim Abbott as a recreation of one of the gems from Charles' country music phase of the 1960s that produced the perfect "combination of voices and instruments" with Preston's accompanying role on <a href="Hammond%20B3">Hammond B3</a>. As opposed to other tracks on the album, when Charles' voice was understated, this song was said to represent his "indomitable spirit", while Jones performed as "an empathetic foil, [with] her warm, lazy vocals meshing convivially with his over a spare but funky arrangement". Author Mike Evans wrote that "there's a mutual warmth of purpose in every breath [Charles and Jones] take" on the song. "<a href="Music%20Week">Music Week</a>" staff noted the timeliness of the release with the biographical film "<a href="Ray%20%28film%29">Ray</a>" in theaters and described the song as soulful, that finely combines Charles' "deep, honeyed growl with Jones's lighter timber", while noting Preston for his "sweeping" organ work.

The song received other specific forms of praise. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> notes that Jones carried the vocal burden as did many of Charles's duet partners on the album. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" Steve Jones said the song "strikes an easy groove". <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>' Kevin Jagernauth says "Jones nicely compliments Charles on this beautiful opening track". Preston's performance was favorably described by "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" Richard Harrington as "smoky". Critic Randy Lewis from the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" noted that the song's "countrified ache" represented that part of Charles' career.

When the song was included on Jones' "...Featuring", which included three of her collaborations from Albums of the Year and several from albums that were nominees, the song did not stand out. Few of the reviews at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> had substantive comments on the duet when included among her group of collaborations. While reviewing "...Featuring", Jonathan Keefe of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" wrote that the duet was a "more staid and less compelling recording" on the album. However, Allmusic staff noted that she worked comfortably with Charles and Chris Rizik of "Soul Tracks" said the track was more than just filler.

In December 2004, the Jones–Charles version of the song was nominated in two categories at the <a href="47th%20Grammy%20Awards">47th Grammy Awards</a>. At the February 13, 2005 awards ceremony, the duet earned the award for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals</a>. It was the second Record of the Year winner not to make the Hot 100 (following "<a href="Walk%20On%20%28U2%20song%29">Walk On</a>" in 2001 by <a href="U2">U2</a>). The song won Record of the Year, but not <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Song%20of%20the%20Year">Song of the Year</a>. Record of the Year is awarded to the artist(s), producer(s), recording engineer(s) and/or mixer(s), if other than artist for newly recorded material. Song of the Year is awarded to the songwriter(s) of a new song or a song first achieving prominence during the eligibility year. Steagall and Lanier are credited as the writers of this song from their work on its original version in 1967. Thus, the song was not a new song.

For the week ending September 18, 2004, "Genius Loves Company" sold 202,000 copies, ranking second on the <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200 chart</a> and becoming Charles' highest-charting album in over 40 years. Digital singles sales saw 12 of the 13 tracks on the album make the US "Billboard" Hot Digital Tracks Top 50 chart. "Here We Go Again" was the <a href="music%20download">download</a> sales leader among the album's songs that totaled 52,000 digital downloads. During the week the album was released, the song debuted on the US "Billboard" <a href="Hot%20Digital%20Tracks">Hot Digital Tracks</a> chart at number 26. "Here We Go Again" fell out of the top 50 two weeks later. It was released as a single for digital download on January 31, 2005.

After the album earned eight Grammy Awards and the song won Record of the Year, sales picked up and the album was re-promoted. "Here We Go Again" entered the US "Billboard" Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart at number five in the issue dated (for the week ending) February 26, 2005. The song charted for a week on both the US "Billboard" <a href="Hot%20Digital%20Songs">Hot Digital Songs</a> top 75 at number 73 and the US "Billboard" <a href="Pop%20100">Pop 100</a> at number 74 for the week ending March 5, 2005, but still did not make the Hot 100, ranking 113th before falling out of the chart. However, it ascended to its Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart peak position of number two for the week ending March 5, 2005. A <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> single of the song was released on April 19, 2005.

In Austria, the duet debuted on the <a href="%C3%963%20Austria%20Top%2040">Ö3 Austria Top 40</a> chart at number 53 on March 6, 2005, and peaked the following week at number 52. It logged six weeks on the chart. "Here We Go Again" entered the <a href="French%20Singles%20Chart">French Singles Chart</a> at number 54 on April 2, 2005 and peaked one week later at number 51. It lasted 10 weeks on the top 100 chart.

According to Allmusic, the duet version was between 3:56 and 3:59 on various albums.



The song was recorded at RPM International Studio (Los Angeles), mixed at <a href="Capitol%20Studios">Capitol Studios</a> and mastered at the Mastering Lab.

<a href="Johnny%20Duncan%20%28country%20singer%29">Johnny Duncan</a> charted a version of the song for <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> that missed the Hot 100 chart. It debuted on the Hot Country Songs chart on September 30, 1972, peaking at number 66 and spending a total of five weeks on the chart. The song also spent five weeks on the "<a href="Cashbox%20%28magazine%29">Cashbox</a>" Country Singles Chart, debuting on October 7, 1972, and peaking at number 61 three weeks later.

In 1982, <a href="Roy%20Clark">Roy Clark</a> produced a version of the song on his "Turned Loose" album for Churchill Records that he performed on the November 6, 1982 (season 15, episode 9), episode of "<a href="Hee%20Haw">Hee Haw</a>". It missed the Hot 100 chart, but it entered the Hot Country Songs chart for the week ending October 30, 1982, at 88. The song was one of only two mentioned in the October 30, 1982, "Billboard" album review and was described as "a solid country number". The song peaked at number 65 in the week ending November 27 and remained in the chart for two more weeks, making the total run seven weeks. The song also spent seven weeks on the "Cashbox" Country Singles Chart, debuting on November 6, 1982, and peaking at number 61 for two weeks (December 4 and 11).

<a href="Billy%20Vaughn">Billy Vaughn</a> covered "Here We Go Again" on his 1967 "Ode to Billy Joe" instrumental album, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 album "<a href="My%20Woman%2C%20My%20Woman%2C%20My%20Wife%20%28Dean%20Martin%20album%29">My Woman, My Woman, My Wife</a>". <a href="Glen%20Campbell">Glen Campbell</a>'s version appeared on his 1971 album "<a href="The%20Last%20Time%20I%20Saw%20Her">The Last Time I Saw Her</a>", <a href="Eddy%20Arnold">Eddy Arnold</a>'s on his 1972 album "Lonely People", and <a href="George%20Strait">George Strait</a>'s on his 1992 album "<a href="Holding%20My%20Own">Holding My Own</a>". Steagall performed it with <a href="Reba%20McEntire">Reba McEntire</a> on his 2007 "Here We Go Again" album, but she did not include it on her 2007 duets album "", which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of "ABQ Journal". Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 "Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2". It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 "Greatest Collection" at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10. R&B and <a href="boogie-woogie">boogie-woogie</a> pianist and singer <a href="Little%20Willie%20Littlefield">Little Willie Littlefield</a> recorded a version for his 1997 album "<a href="The%20Red%20One%20%28Little%20Willie%20Littlefield%20album%29">The Red One</a>". <a href="Peters%20and%20Lee">Peters and Lee</a> made a version of the song on their 1976 on their "Serenade" album. <a href="Joe%20Dolan">Joe Dolan</a> produced a 1972 single of the song that he included on his 1976 album "Golden Hour Of Joe Dolan Vol. 2" and several of his greatest hits albums.

Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis, along with Norah Jones, performed two concerts at <a href="Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center</a>'s Rose Theatre on February 9 and 10, 2009. A 2011 <a href="live%20album">live</a> tribute album by Nelson and Marsalis featuring Jones entitled "" was recorded on these two live dates. The album, which was released on March 29, 2011, included a track entitled "Here We Go Again". The vocals on "Here We Go Again" were performed by Jones and Nelson, while instrumental support was provided by Marsalis (trumpet), <a href="Dan%20Nimmer">Dan Nimmer</a> (piano), <a href="Mickey%20Raphael">Mickey Raphael</a> (<a href="harmonica">harmonica</a>), Walter Blanding (<a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>), Carlos Henriquez (<a href="bass%20%28instrument%29">bass</a>) and <a href="Ali%20Jackson%20%28jazz%20drummer%29">Ali Jackson</a> (drums and <a href="percussion">percussion</a>). The song, which had a length of 5:10, was arranged by Andy Farber and performed in a rhythm and blues <a href="Time%20signature%23Most%20frequent%20time%20signatures">12/8 shuffle</a>. <a href="BBC">BBC</a> music reviewer Bill Tilland noted that Jones added her usual "style and panache" to this performance. At one concert performance, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" critic Nate Chinen felt the song sounded unrehearsed. Although critique of this track is sparse, "<a href="Pop%20Matters">Pop Matters</a>" Will Layman notes that the album reveals "how decisive and strong Jones sounds while singing with a truly legitimate jazz group" and how Nelson predictably "breezes through his tunes with cavalier grace". Meanwhile, he praises the professional mastery of Marsalis' quintet. Tilland also notes that on the album Marsalis' band "compensates quite adequately for occasional lacklustre vocals."

George Strait's country music version was performed with the instrumental support of Joe Chemay (bass guitar), <a href="Floyd%20Domino">Floyd Domino</a> (piano), <a href="Buddy%20Emmons">Buddy Emmons</a> (steel guitar), Steve Gibson (<a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>), <a href="Johnny%20Gimble">Johnny Gimble</a> (<a href="fiddle">fiddle</a>), Jim Horn (<a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>, <a href="alto%20flute">alto flute</a>), <a href="Larrie%20Londin">Larrie Londin</a> (drums), Liana Manis (background vocals), Curtis Young (background vocals), and <a href="Reggie%20Young">Reggie Young</a> (<a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>).

In 1992 "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" <a href="Alanna%20Nash">Alanna Nash</a> regarded the album as Strait's "most hard-core country album" up to that point in his career. Allmusic staff noted that the album held its own at the time of release against most of its competitors and has aged better than most country music albums. Ralph Novak, Lisa Shea, Eric Levin, and Craig Tomashoff of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" said the album represents the most straightforward style of singing. The <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> describes the album as the result of a transition in eras of country music.

The song plays during the opening credit dance by Franz (<a href="Harry%20Baer">Harry Baer</a>) and Margarethe (<a href="Margarethe%20von%20Trotta">Margarethe von Trotta</a>) in <a href="Rainer%20Werner%20Fassbinder">Rainer Werner Fassbinder</a>'s 1970 film "<a href="Gods%20of%20the%20Plague">Gods of the Plague</a>". However, the song was on neither the <a href="Ray%20%28soundtrack%29">eponymous soundtrack</a> for the 2004 film "<a href="Ray%20%28film%29">Ray</a>" nor the limited edition additional soundtrack album "More Music From Ray".

X-Cops

"X-Cops" is the twelfth episode of the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> of the American science fiction television series "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>". Directed by <a href="Michael%20W.%20Watkins">Michael Watkins</a> and written by <a href="Vince%20Gilligan">Vince Gilligan</a>, the installment serves as a "Monster-of-the-Week" story—a stand-alone plot unconnected to the <a href="Mythology%20of%20The%20X-Files">overarching mythology</a> of "The X-Files". Originally aired in the United States by the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on February 20, 2000, "X-Cops" received a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> of 9.7 and was seen by 16.56 million viewers. The episode earned positive reviews from critics, largely due to its unique presentation, as well as its use of humor. Since its airing, the episode has been named among the best episodes of "The X-Files" by several reviewers.

"The X-Files" centers on <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) special agents <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>), who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal; the skeptical Scully was initially assigned to debunk his work, but the two have developed a deep friendship. In this episode, Mulder and Scully are interviewed for the Fox reality television program "<a href="Cops%20%28TV%20series%29">Cops</a>" during an X-Files investigation. Mulder, hunting what he believes to be a werewolf, discovers that the monster terrorizing people instead feeds on fear. While Mulder embraces the publicity of "Cops", Scully is more uncomfortable about appearing on national television.

"X-Cops" serves as a fictional crossover with "Cops" and is one of only two "X-Files" episodes to be shot in <a href="Real%20time%20%28media%29">real time</a>, in which events are presented at the same rate that the audience experiences them. Gilligan, who was inspired to write the script because he enjoyed "Cops", pitched the idea several times to series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> and the series writing staff, receiving a mixed reception; when the crew felt that the show was nearing its end with the conclusion of the seventh season, Gilligan was given the <a href="Green-light">green light</a> because it was seen as an experiment. In the tradition of the real-life "Cops" program, the entire episode was shot on <a href="videotape">videotape</a> and featured several members of the crew of "Cops". The episode has been thematically analyzed for its use of <a href="postmodernism">postmodernism</a> and its presentation as reality television.

The episode begins with the standard opening credit sequence of the reality television program "<a href="Cops%20%28TV%20series%29">Cops</a>" and its theme song "<a href="Bad%20Boys%20%28Inner%20Circle%20song%29">Bad Boys</a>". Keith Wetzel (<a href="Judson%20Mills">Judson Mills</a>), a deputy with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Sheriff%27s%20Department">Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department</a>, is accompanied by a "Cops" film crew at Willow Park, California, a fictional high-crime district of Los Angeles. Wetzel visits the home of Mrs. Guererro (Perla Walter), who has reported a monster in the neighborhood. Wetzel, expecting to find a dog, follows the creature around a corner but runs back screaming for the crew to flee. They return to Wetzel's police car, but before they can escape, it is overturned by an unseen entity.

When backup arrives on the scene, an injured Wetzel claims that he encountered gang members. The police soon discover and surround <a href="Fox%20Mulder">Fox Mulder</a> (<a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>) and <a href="Dana%20Scully">Dana Scully</a> (<a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>), believing them to be criminals, before they realize that the pair are <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agents. Mulder and Scully claim that they are investigating an alleged <a href="werewolf">werewolf</a> that killed a man in the area during the last <a href="full%20moon">full moon</a>. According to Mulder, the entity that they are tracking only comes out at night. Scully is irritated by the constant presence of the "Cops" crew, but Mulder is enthused at the prospect of paranormal proof being presented to a national television audience. The agents and the police interview Mrs. Guerrero, who describes the monster to Ricky (Solomon Eversol), a sketch artist. To Mulder's surprise, Mrs. Guerrero describes not a werewolf, but the horror movie villain <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>. Ricky expresses a fear of being alone in the dangerous neighborhood and is found a short time later with serious slashes in his chest. Mulder and Scully find a pink fingernail at the scene. The group also meets Steve and Edy (J. W. Smith and Curtis C.), a couple who witnessed the incident but did not see Ricky's attacker, saying that it appeared he was being attacked by nothing. Scully shows the couple the fingernail, which they identify as belonging to Chantara Gomez (Maria Celedonio), a prostitute.

When the agents track down Chantara, whose face is <a href="pixelization">pixelated</a>, she claims that her <a href="pimp">pimp</a> attacked Ricky and fears that he will kill her. She pleads with the agents for protection. Mulder and Scully have Wetzel guard Chantara while they assist the police in the raid of a <a href="Crack%20cocaine">crack house</a>. The two are drawn back outside when Wetzel encounters the entity, wildly shooting at it. Inside a police car, the agents find Chantara with her neck broken. When Mulder questions Wetzel, he admits that he thought he saw the "wasp man", a monster his older brother told him about when he was a kid. Though other deputies express skepticism, Mulder finds flattened bullets; indicating they physically impacted something, though no trace is found of what they struck. Mulder formulates a theory that the entity <a href="shapeshifter">changes its form</a> to correspond with its victims' worst fears. Wetzel, Ricky, and Chantara all expressed fear shortly before their run-ins with the entity; it was visible to them, but not to others. The agents think that Steve and Edy may be the entity's next target because they were in the vicinity of Ricky's attack. They head to their house, only to find the couple in the middle of an argument. After Edy expresses fear of a separation from Steve, the couple reconciles. Based on this situation, Mulder proposes that the entity ignored Steve and Edy because they did not exhibit "mortal" fear.

Mulder believes that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (<a href="Tara%20Karsian">Tara Karsian</a>) causes the latter to panic about a <a href="Hantavirus">Hantavirus</a> outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel is in danger of being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the incident is over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. Mulder remains hopeful, noting that it all comes down to how the production crew edits the footage together.

"X-Cops" was inspired by the Fox television program "Cops", which <a href="Vince%20Gilligan">Vince Gilligan</a> (the writer of this episode) describes as a "great slice of <a href="Americana">Americana</a>." Gilligan first pitched the idea during the show's <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> to the "X-Files" writing staff and series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a>, the latter of whom was concerned that the concept was too "goofy". Fellow writer and producer <a href="Frank%20Spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz</a> concurred, although he was more uncomfortable with Gilligan's idea of using <a href="videotape">videotape</a> instead of <a href="Film%20stock">film</a>; the show's production crew liked to use film to create "effective scares", and Spotnitz worried that shooting exclusively on videotape would be too challenging as the series would be unable to cut and edit the final product. During the show's <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a>, Carter relented. Many critics and fans believed, erroneously, that the seventh season of "The X-Files" would be the show's last. Similarly, Carter felt that the show had nearly run its course, and seeing the potential in Gilligan's idea, he decided to <a href="green-light">green-light</a> the episode. Gilligan noted that "the longer we've been on the air, the more chances we've taken. We try to keep the show fresh ... I think [Carter] appreciates that". "X-Cops" was not Gilligan's first attempt at writing a cross-over. Almost three years before, he had developed a script that would have taken the form of an "<a href="Unsolved%20Mysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a>" episode, with unknown actors playing Mulder and Scully and <a href="Robert%20Stack">Robert Stack</a> appearing in his role as narrator. This script was later aborted, and re-written as the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%205%29">fifth-season</a> episode "<a href="Bad%20Blood%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Bad Blood</a>".

Gilligan reasoned that, because Mulder and Scully would appear on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the <a href="psychological%20horror">psychological horror</a> film "<a href="The%20Blair%20Witch%20Project">The Blair Witch Project</a>" (1999) to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. <a href="Michael%20W.%20Watkins">Michael Watkins</a>, who directed the episode, hired several real Sheriff's deputies as extras for the episode. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of cops on the job." During the crack house scene, real <a href="SWAT%20team">SWAT team</a> members were hired to break down the doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained that, because there were few cameramen and owing to the manner in which the episode was filmed, "people just behaved as if we were [real] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up the way they do amongst themselves. It was quite funny".

When members of "The X-Files" staff asked "Cops" producer <a href="John%20Langley">John Langley</a> about a potential cross-over, the crew of "Cops" liked the idea and "offered their total cooperation." Gilligan even attended the shooting of an episode. Inspired by "Cops", Watkins' directing style was unique for this episode, and he even directly filmed some of the scenes himself. He also brought in <a href="Bertram%20van%20Munster">Bertram van Munster</a>, a cameraman for "Cops", to shoot scenes to give the finished product an authentic feel. In an attempt at realism, other staff members from "Cops" participated in the production: Daniel Emmet and John Michael Vaughn, two "Cops" crew members, were featured during the episode's climax. During rehearsals, Watkins kept the cameras away from the set, so that when filming commenced, the cameramen's unfamiliarity would create the "unscripted" feel of a <a href="Documentary%20television%20series">documentary</a>. In addition, a "Cops" editor was brought in "to insert the trademark blur over the faces of innocent bystanders." "X-Cops" was filmed in <a href="Venice%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Venice, Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>.

The episode was one of two "X-Files" episodes to take place in <a href="Real%20time%20%28media%29">real time</a> (that is, the events in the episode are presented at the same rate that the audience experiences them), with the other being the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> episode "<a href="Triangle%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Triangle</a>". Due to the nature of the shooting schedule, the episode was relatively cheap to film and production moved at a quick pace. Initially, the actors struggled with the new <a href="cin%C3%A9ma%20v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9">cinéma vérité</a> style of the episode, and several takes were needed for scenes during the first few days, but these problems receded as filming progressed. On one night, three-and-a-half pages of script were shot in only two hours; the normal rate for "The X-Files" was three to four pages a day. Both Watkins and Mills likened the filming process to live theater, with the former noting, "In a sense, we were doing theater: we were doing an act or half of a whole act in one take." Anderson called the performance "fun" to shoot, and highlighted "Scully getting pissed off at the camera crew" as her favorite part to play. She further noted that "it was interesting to make the adjustment to playing something more real than you might play for television."

Although filmed to create the illusion that events occurred in real time, the episode employed several camera tricks and effects. For the opening shot, a "surreptitious cut" helped to replace actor Judson Mills with a stunt person when the cop car is overturned by the monster. Usually, an episode of "The X-Files" required editors to make between 8001200 film cuts, but "X-Cops" only required 45. During post-production, a minor argument broke out between Vince Gilligan and the network. Originally, Gilligan did not want the "X-Files" logo to appear at any time during the episode. He stressed that he wanted "X-Cops" to feel like an "episode of "Cops" that happened to involve Mulder and Scully." The network, fearing that people would not understand that "X-Cops" was actually an episode of "The X-Files", vetoed this idea. A compromise was eventually reached: the episode would open with the "Cops" theme song, but "The X-Files" credits would also appear after the opening scene. In addition, the <a href="Bumper%20%28broadcasting%29">commercial bumpers</a> would feature red and blue lights flashing across "The X-Files" logo while dialogue is heard in the background, in a similar fashion to the "Cops" logo. The episode also features a disclaimer at the beginning informing viewers that the episode is a special installment of "The X-Files" to prevent watchers from thinking that the show "has been preempted this week by "Cops"".

Several critics, such as M. Keith Booker, have argued that "X-Cops" is an example of "The X-Files" delving into the <a href="postmodernism">postmodern</a> school of thought. Postmodernism has been described as a "style and concept in the arts [that] is characterized by the self-conscious use of earlier styles and conventions [and the] mixing of different artistic styles and media". According to Booker, the episode helps to "identify the series as postmodern [due to its] cumulative summary of modern American culture", or, in this case, the show's merging with another popular television series. The episode also serves as an example of the series' "self-consciousness in terms of its status as a (fictional) television" show.

According to Jeremy Butler in the book "Television Style", the episode, along with many other found footage-type movies and shows, helps to suggest that what is being promoted as "live TV", is actually a series of events that have already unfolded in the past. Even though the episode is "self-conscious", "reflexive", and humorous, the real-time aspects of "X-Cops" "heighten[s] the sense of realism within the episode", and makes the result come across as hyper-realistic. This sense of realism is further heightened by the near lack of music in the episode; aside from the title theme, <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a>'s soundtrack is not to be heard.

<a href="Sarah%20Stegall">Sarah Stegall</a> proposed that the episode works on two separate layers. On the top-most superficial layer, it functions as an outright parody, mimicking both the stylings of "The X-Files" as well as "Cops". On the other layer, she notes that "it's a serious look at validation." Throughout the episode, Mulder is attempting to capture the monster on camera and expose it to a national audience. All of the witnesses to the monster function as <a href="unreliable%20narrator">unreliable narrator</a>s: a Hispanic woman with "a history of medications"; a black, homosexual "Drama Queen"; a prostitute with a drug problem; a "terrified morgue attendant", and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall argues that all of these characters are from "the wrong side of the tracks" and would not be accepted, let alone believed, by "a placid, middle-class society". In the end, the only reliable witness is the camera, but Stegall points out that "the camera, suspiciously, never quite manages to find [the monster]." Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's biggest fear is not finding the monster responsible for the murders. To back this idea up, she points out that not only does Mulder fail to capture any evidence of the paranormal, but he also fails before a live audience on national television.

"X-Cops" was first broadcast in the United States on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> network on February 20, 2000. Watched by 16.56 million viewers, according to the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> system, it was the second-highest rated episode of the season, after "<a href="The%20Sixth%20Extinction%20%28The%20X-Files%29">The Sixth Extinction</a>". It received a Nielsen rating of 9.7, with a 14 share among viewers, meaning that 9.7 percent of all households in the United States, and 14 percent of people watching television at that time, tuned into the episode. It originally aired in the United Kingdom on <a href="Sky1">Sky1</a> on June 4, 2000, receiving 850,000 viewers, making it the channel's third-most watched program for that week. On May 13, 2003, "X-Cops" was released on DVD as part of the complete seventh-season box set.
Initial critical reaction to the episode was generally positive, although a few reviewers felt that the episode was a gimmick. Eric Mink of the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" described it as "nifty" and "exceptionally clever." While noting that ""The X-Files" hasn't exactly smoked this season", Kinney Littlefield from "<a href="The%20Orange%20County%20Register">The Orange County Register</a>" called "X-Cops" a stand-out episode from the seventh season. Stegall praised the episode and likened the episode's monster to the <a href="Magical%20creatures%20in%20Harry%20Potter%23Boggarts">Boggart</a> from the "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" series. Stegall wrote of Vince Gilligan: "top honors must go to Vince Gilligan, whose work on "The X-Files" is consistently the sharpest and most consistent." Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a largely positive review. He called the entry "one of the most entertaining episodes of the season" and "60 minutes of pure fun". Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that "some might view it as a stunt, but having Mulder and Scully be part of a spot-on "Cops!" parody (complete with full "Bad Boys, bad boys" intro) is just brilliant stuff". Not all reviews were positive. Kenneth Silber from <a href="Space.com">Space.com</a> gave the episode a negative review and wrote, "'X-Cops' is a wearisome episode. Watching the agents and police repeatedly run through the darkened streets of Los Angeles after an unseen—and uninteresting—foe evokes merely a sense of futility. The use of the format of the Fox TV show "Cops" provides some transient novelty but little drama or humor."

Contemporary reviews have praised the episode as one of the show's best installments. <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote that the episode was "funny, it's clever, and it's actually quite frightening". Shearman and Pearson also wrote positively of the faux documentary style, likening it to "The Blair Witch Project". Zack Handlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" awarded the episode an "A" and called it "witty, inventive, and intermittently spooky". He argued that the episode was a late-series "gimmick episode" and compared it to the last few seasons of "<a href="House%20%28TV%20series%29">House</a>"; although he reasoned that "House" relied on gimmicks to prop itself up, "X-Cops" is "the work of a creative team which may be running out of ideas, but still has enough gas in the tank to get us where we need to go." Furthermore, Handlen felt that the show used the "Cops" format to the best of its ability and that many of the scenes were humorous, startling, or a combination of both.

Since its airing, "X-Cops" has appeared on several best-of lists. <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>'s <a href="The%20Gazette%20%28Montreal%29">"The Gazette"</a> named it the eighth best "X-Files" episode, writing that it "pushed the show to new post-modern heights."
Rob Bricken from <a href="Topless%20Robot">Topless Robot</a> named it the fifth funniest "X-Files" episode, and Starpulse described it as the funniest "X-Files" episode, writing that when the series "did comedy, it was probably the funniest drama ever on television". <a href="UGO">UGO</a> named the episode's main antagonist as one of the greatest "Top 11 X-Files Monsters," noting that the creature is a "perfect [Monster-of-the-Week] if only because the monster in question is a living, breathing metaphor, a never-seen specter that shifts to fit the fears of the person witnessing it." Narin Bahar from "<a href="SFX%20%28magazine%29">SFX</a>" named the episode one of the "Best Sci-Fi TV Mockumentaries" and wrote, "Whether you see this as a brilliantly post-modern merging of fact and fiction or shameless cross-promotion of two of the Fox Network's biggest TV shows, there's lots of nods to the real "Cops" show in this episode". Bahar praised the scene featuring the terrified lady telling Mulder that Freddy Krueger attacked her—calling the scene the "best in-joke"—and applauded the two series' cohesion.

Prometheus (2012 film)

Prometheus ( ) is a 2012 <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> directed by <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>, written by <a href="Jon%20Spaihts">Jon Spaihts</a> and <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a> and starring <a href="Noomi%20Rapace">Noomi Rapace</a>, <a href="Michael%20Fassbender">Michael Fassbender</a>, <a href="Guy%20Pearce">Guy Pearce</a>, <a href="Idris%20Elba">Idris Elba</a>, <a href="Logan%20Marshall-Green">Logan Marshall-Green</a>, and <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a>. It is set in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship "Prometheus" as it follows a <a href="star%20map">star map</a> discovered among the artifacts of several ancient Earth cultures. Seeking the origins of humanity, the crew arrives on a distant world and discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human species.

Development of the film began in the early 2000s as a fifth installment in the <a href="Alien%20%28franchise%29">"Alien" franchise</a>. Scott and director <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> developed ideas for a film that would serve as a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> to Scott's 1979 science-fiction horror film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>". In 2002, the development of "<a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator%20%28film%29">Alien vs. Predator</a>" took precedence, and the project remained dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. Spaihts wrote a script for a prequel to the events of the "Alien" films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010, Lindelof joined the project to rewrite Spaihts's script, and he and Scott developed a story that precedes the story of "Alien" but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, although the film shares "strands of "Alien"s DNA, so to speak", and takes place in the same <a href="fictional%20universe">universe</a>, "Prometheus" explores its own mythology and ideas.

"Prometheus" entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases during which the technology and creatures that the film required were developed. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began in March 2011, with an estimated $120–130 million budget. The project was shot using <a href="3D%20film">3D</a> cameras throughout, almost entirely on practical sets, and on location in England, Iceland, Spain, and Scotland. It was promoted with a marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. Three videos featuring the film's leading actors in character, which expanded on elements of the fictional universe, were released and met with a generally positive reception and awards.

"Prometheus" was released on June 1, 2012, in the United Kingdom and on June 8, 2012, in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The film received praise for the aesthetic design and the acting, especially Fassbender's performance as the android David, while plot elements that remained unresolved or predictable were the main source of criticism. The film grossed over $403 million worldwide. A sequel, "", was released in May 2017.

As a spacecraft departs a planet, a <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> alien drinks an <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> liquid, causing its body to dissolve. As its remains cascade into a waterfall, the alien's DNA falls apart and recombines.

In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a <a href="star%20chart">star map</a> in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the "Engineers." Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel "Prometheus," to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in <a href="stasis%20%28fiction%29">stasis</a> while the <a href="android%20%28robot%29">android</a> David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.

The "Prometheus" lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to "Prometheus", but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.

Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to "Prometheus", but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being previously <a href="Infertility">infertile</a>, is now in advanced <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard "Prometheus." He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as "Father".

A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the "Prometheus" and kills several crew members before he is killed. The "Prometheus" captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the "Prometheus" into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. David's still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an <a href="ovipositor">ovipositor</a> down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers' homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.

In the lifeboat, an <a href="Alien%20%28creature%20in%20Alien%20franchise%29%23Deacon">alien creature</a> bursts out of the Engineer's chest.




Other cast members include <a href="Kate%20Dickie">Kate Dickie</a> as the ship's medic, Ford; <a href="Emun%20Elliott">Emun Elliott</a> and <a href="Benedict%20Wong">Benedict Wong</a> as, respectively, ship pilots Chance and Ravel; and <a href="Patrick%20Wilson%20%28American%20actor%29">Patrick Wilson</a> as Shaw's father. <a href="Ian%20Whyte%20%28actor%29">Ian Whyte</a> and Daniel James portray Engineers.

The central theme in "Prometheus" concerns the <a href="Prometheus">eponymous Titan</a> of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> who defies the gods and gifts humanity with fire, for which he is subjected to eternal punishment. The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods. The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find God and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the "Prometheus" crew suffer consequences for their pursuit. Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants her religious beliefs affirmed, and believes she is entitled to answers from God; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her <a href="hubris">hubris</a>. The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered. Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ. However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be "a little too on the nose."

<a href="Artificial%20intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a>, a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in "Prometheus", primarily through the android David. David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in "robotic storytelling" such as "Blade Runner". David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the "Prometheus" ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is underwhelmed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own. Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David. At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.

Another theme is creation and the question of "Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?" Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of man, but Scott was interested in <a href="Greco-Roman">Greco-Roman</a> and <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> creation myths about gods who create man in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a "gardener in space" to bring life to a world. One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations. Scott likened the Engineers to the dark angels of <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>", and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.

Shaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that "Prometheus" is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.

Beside drawing several influences from "Paradise Lost", "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>"s <a href="Govindini%20Murty">Govindini Murty</a> noted further influences, and wrote that "[t]he striking images Ridley Scott devises for "Prometheus" reference everything from <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s "" to <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>'s "<a href="Vitruvian%20Man">Vitruvian Man</a>" and <a href="Mario%20Bava">Mario Bava</a>'s "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Vampires">Planet of the Vampires</a>". Scott also expands on the original "Alien" universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's "Paradise Lost" and the symbolic drawings of <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>."

Development on a fifth film in the "Alien" franchise was in progress by 2002. Scott considered returning to the series he created with his 1979 science fiction horror film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>", to pursue a sequel that would explore the engineered origins of the series's <a href="Alien%20%28creature%20in%20Alien%20franchise%29">Alien creatures</a>, and the "space jockey"—the <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial being</a>, who briefly appears in "Alien", as the deceased pilot of a derelict spaceship. "Alien" star <a href="Sigourney%20Weaver">Sigourney Weaver</a> also expressed interest in returning to the series. "Aliens" director <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> discussed the potential for a sequel with Scott, and began working with another writer on a story for the film. It was then that <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> approached Cameron with a script for a crossover film that would pit the series's monsters against the title characters of the "<a href="Predator%20%28franchise%29">Predator</a>" films; this project became the 2004 science fiction film "<a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator%20%28film%29">Alien vs. Predator</a>". After Fox confirmed that it would pursue the crossover, Cameron stopped working on his own project, believing the crossover would "kill the validity of the franchise." In 2006, Cameron confirmed that he would not return to the "Alien" sequel project, believing that the series was Fox's asset, and he was unwilling to deal with the studio's attempts to influence the potential sequel.

In May 2009, Fox said that the project was a "reboot" of the "Alien" franchise, and soon afterwards was reported as an untitled prequel to "Alien". Development stopped in June 2009 when Fox clashed with Scott over his selection of former <a href="Television%20advertisement">television advertisement director</a> <a href="Carl%20Rinsch">Carl Erik Rinsch</a> as director. Fox was only interested in pursuing the project if Scott directed. By July 2009, Scott was contracted to direct the film, and screenwriter Jon Spaihts was hired to write the script based on his pitched idea for a direct "Alien" prequel. With the director and writer in place, and pleased with Spaihts's pitch, Fox scheduled a release date for December 2011, but this was eventually canceled. In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and that pre-production would begin, and a filming date was set for January 2011. Fox eventually pushed to develop the project into an original work, and by July 2010, Lindelof had been hired to redevelop Spaihts's screenplay. In October 2010, Lindelof submitted his rewritten screenplay to Fox. Scott had initially requested a $250 million budget and an adult oriented project, but Fox was reluctant to invest this amount of money, and wanted to ensure the film would receive a lower age-rating to broaden the potential audience.

In December 2010, it was reported that the film would be called "Paradise", named after John Milton's poem "Paradise Lost", but Scott considered that this would convey too much information about the film. Fox CEO <a href="Thomas%20Rothman">Thomas Rothman</a> suggested "Prometheus", which was confirmed as the title in January 2011. A release date was scheduled for , but weeks later the release was postponed until . With the name confirmed, the production team began to publicly distance the film from its "Alien" origins, and were deliberately vague about the connection between the films, believing it would build audience anticipation for "Prometheus". Scott stated that "while "Alien" was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place. The keen fan will recognize strands of "Alien"s DNA, so to speak, but the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative." In June 2011, Scott and Lindelof confirmed that "Prometheus" takes place in the same universe as the events of the "Alien" series. In July 2011, Scott stated that "by the end of the third act you start to realize there's a DNA of the very first "Alien", but none of the subsequent [films]."

Spaihts met Scott in late 2009 and they discussed Scott's desire to pursue an "Alien" prequel. Spaihts offered his concept, including a "bridge" that would connect the story of the film's human characters to the "Alien" saga. Spaihts was quickly hired, which he credited to the reception of his "bridge" idea. Spaihts claimed he created the concept spontaneously, without preconception. Spaihts wrote a 20-page "extremely detailed outline"; within three and a half weeks he had completed his first draft, and he submitted it to the producers on Christmas Day, 2009. Within 12 hours, Scott returned the script with notes for changes, and Spaihts spent the Christmas holiday redrafting.

Spaihts was tasked with exploring unresolved mysteries from "Alien", such as the Space Jockey. He considered the mysteries of "Alien" to be alien in nature, and said, "all the mysteries have alien players: the exoskeleton nightmare and ... the elephantine titan that was called the 'space jockey' ... How do you make anyone care about events between creatures like this?" His solution was to link the alien mysteries to the past and future of humanity. He said: "If that story is somehow ours and deeply enmeshed with the human story, that story changes meaning within our life, things of such significance that we think of our own lives differently." Spaihts found translating Scott's stylistic visual concepts to text difficult, and he periodically constrained some of Scott's ideas. He reminded Scott that in the scene they were discussing, the characters were subject to gravity and so could not simply float. By April 2010, the script was on the fourth draft. Scott said about the script, "we are talking about gods and engineers. Engineers of space. And were the aliens designed as a form of biological warfare? Or biology that would go in and clean up a planet?" In June 2010, Scott announced that the script was complete and ready for filming.

However, Scott instead contacted Lindelof and asked him to review Spaihts's script. Within the hour, a messenger delivered the script to Lindelof and informed him that he would wait outside to return it as soon as Lindelof had finished reading it. Lindelof was unaware of what Scott and the producers liked about the existing script, and informed them that he found the general concept appealing, but that the story relied too heavily on elements of the "Alien" films, such as the "Alien" creatures' life-cycle. As a direct prequel to "Alien", the story was shaped to lead into that film's story, and to recreate the familiar cues of that series, and Scott wanted to avoid repeating his previous accomplishments. Lindelof said, "If the ending to ["Prometheus"] is just going to be the room that <a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a> walks into that's full of [alien] eggs [in "Alien"], there's nothing interesting in that, because we know where it's going to end. Good stories, you don't know where they're going to end." "A true prequel should essentially precede the events of the original film, but be about something entirely different, feature different characters, have an entirely different theme, although it takes place in that same world."
Lindelof said that the other parts of the script were strong enough to survive without the "Alien" hallmarks, such as the "Alien" creature, which he believed had been diluted by the exposure it had received. He said, "[The producers] were just looking for someone to say to them, Hey, we don't need the "Alien" stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can be a part of this movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about." Lindelof said that the film could instead run parallel to the "Alien" series and that a sequel would be "Prometheus 2" and not "Alien", and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010. Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's "Alien" prequel into an original creation. Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the "Alien" symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010. Inspired by "Blade Runner" and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an "Alien" story of action and horror with "the "Blade Runner" thematic," to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said,

Scott's story concept was partially inspired by "<a href="Chariots%20of%20the%20Gods%3F">Chariots of the Gods?</a>", <a href="Erich%20von%20D%C3%A4niken">Erich von Däniken</a>'s work about the theory of <a href="ancient%20astronauts">ancient astronauts</a> which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, "NASA and the Vatican agree that [it is] almost mathematically impossible that we can be where we are today without there being a little help along the way ... That's what we're looking at [in the film], at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about." Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but does not want to be anything like them, eschewing a common theme in "robotic storytelling" such as "Blade Runner". He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from "Alien"s Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.

Pre-production began in April 2010. A team developed graphic designs for the film. Scott convinced Fox to invest millions of dollars to hire scientists and conceptual artists to develop a vision of the late 21st century. The production of "Prometheus" was marked by a high degree of secrecy and story details were kept "extremely under-wraps." Ridley Scott was determined to maintain the secrecy of the plot, and he required the cast to sign clauses to prevent them disclosing story details, and the cast were allowed to read the script only under supervision in Scott's production office. One exception was made when a courier flew the script to one actor outside the US, and then stood guard while the actor read it. Scott said, "I was insistent that the script not leak onto the internet, where it gets dissected out of context, which spoils it for everyone."

In July 2011, Lindelof said that the film would rely upon <a href="practical%20effects">practical effects</a>, and would use <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that "you can pretty much do anything you want" with digital technology, and, "<a href="Douglas%20Trumbull">Doug Trumbull</a> once said to me 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." Cinematographer <a href="Dariusz%20Wolski">Dariusz Wolski</a> convinced Scott that it would be possible to film in <a href="3D%20film">3D</a> with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company <a href="3ality%20Technica">3ality Technica</a> provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the "Alien" films was added in post-production using <a href="Color%20grading">color grading processes</a>, and the 3D equipment was based on post-<a href="Avatar%20%282009%20film%29">"Avatar"</a> technology.

Principal photography began on March 21, 2011, lasted 82 days, and had an estimated $120–130 million budget. Filming began at <a href="Shepperton%20Studios">Shepperton Studios</a> and <a href="Pinewood%20Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> in England. Scott used eight sound stages for filming, including the <a href="007%20Stage">007 Stage</a>. Studio space was limited and the crew had to make five stages work for approximately 16 sets, and increased the size of the 007 stage by over 30%.

Exterior shots of the alien world were shot in Iceland, where filming occurred for two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, at the base of <a href="Hekla">Hekla</a>, an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, "If one is afraid of nature in this profession then it would be best to find a different job". Filming also took place at <a href="Dettifoss">Dettifoss</a>, one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe. The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew. Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented the beginning of time. <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a> protests forced the change of venue. Alternatives including the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a> had been considered, but Scott explained that <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> was ultimately chosen because "here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive".

In September 2011, filming moved to the <a href="Ciudad%20de%20la%20Luz">Ciudad de la Luz</a> audiovisual complex in <a href="Alicante">Alicante</a>, Spain. Shooting areas included the complex's large water tank, and a nearby beach. The complex was booked from August 22, 2011, through to December 10, 2011, and set construction occurred from August until late September. Approximately 250 people worked on the three-month-long Spain shoot, generating over <a href="Euro">€</a>1 million in the local economy. Filming also took place in the <a href="Wadi%20Rum">Wadi Rum</a> valley in Jordan.

Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so the actors would know where they should be looking in any particular scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with <a href="Red%20Digital%20Cinema%20Camera%20Company">Red Epic</a> 3D cameras set on <a href="Camera%20dolly">camera dollies</a> and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a <a href="steadicam">steadicam</a>, which was used only occasionally.

Scott used the 3D footage to increase the <a href="stereoscopy">illusion of depth</a>. Despite this being his first 3D film he found the process easy. He said, "You can literally twiddle a knob and the depth will increase", and, "the trick is not to overdo it". In December 2011, Rapace undertook <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">additional dialogue recordings</a> for the film. Additional <a href="Pick-up%20%28filmmaking%29">pick-up</a> scenes were filmed during January 2012, including a one-day shoot on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Skye">Isle of Skye</a>, Scotland, and a new scene shot at a cave in the Scottish mountains. For dark scenes, the film was color graded to specifically compensate for the light loss of 3D glasses, to ensure the image was comparable to the 2D version.

In July 2011, Scott said that he was filming "Prometheus" with both adult-oriented R and more accessible PG-13 <a href="Film%20rating%23United%20States">film ratings</a> in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, Scott said, "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference ... essentially it's kinda R ... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful." Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would be the only way to gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.

<a href="Marc%20Streitenfeld">Marc Streitenfeld</a>, who had worked with Scott on earlier projects, composed the musical score for "Prometheus". It took just over a week to record with a 90-piece orchestra at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London, England. Streitenfeld began writing ideas for the score after reading the script before filming commenced. He used some unusual techniques to compose the score, and said, "I actually wrote out the sheet music backwards so the orchestra played it backwards and then I digitally flipped it. So you're hearing the score as it's written, the same melody, but with a backwards sounding orchestra which gives it a kind of unusual, unsettling sound." The "Prometheus (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)" album was released on <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes</a> on May 15, 2012, and on CD on June 4, 2012. It features 23 tracks by Streitenfeld and two supplemental tracks by <a href="Harry%20Gregson-Williams">Harry Gregson-Williams</a>. <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>s "<a href="Raindrop%20prelude">Raindrop prelude</a>" (1838) is also featured in the film.

<a href="Production%20designer">Production designer</a> <a href="Arthur%20Max">Arthur Max</a> led the film's design staff. His art team were tasked with deconstructing the art and visuals of "Alien", and reverse-designing them for the chronologically earlier setting of "Prometheus". Influence was drawn from the work of "Alien" creature designer <a href="H.%20R.%20Giger">H. R. Giger</a>, and designers <a href="Ron%20Cobb">Ron Cobb</a> and <a href="Chris%20Foss">Chris Foss</a>, including their designs for that film which Scott had been unable to develop at the time.

For the crew's space suits, Scott was inspired to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>' biography about building an office out of <a href="Gorilla%20Glass">Gorilla Glass</a>. Scott said, "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something where I have 360 [vision]. Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet." The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, <a href="Janty%20Yates">Janty Yates</a>, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a <a href="neoprene">neoprene</a> suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.

Aboard the ship, Yates gave the characters their own distinct looks. Theron is dressed in an ice-silver, silk mohair suit. Yates said, "[Theron] is the ice queen. It was always our vision to make her look as sculptural as possible". Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career at the helm of a ship.

Arthur Max designed the sets such as the alien world landscape and structures, and the vehicles, including the "Prometheus" and the Engineer's ship. Digital 3D models and miniature replicas of each set were built to allow the designers to envisage the connections between them and to know where the CGI elements would be inserted. To better blend the practical and the digital, the design team took rock samples from the Iceland location so they could match the graphical textures with the real rocks. To create the "Prometheus", Max researched NASA and <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a> spacecraft designs, and extended these concepts with his own ideas of how future space vehicles might look. He said that he wanted "to do something that was state-of-the-art, which would represent a flagship spacecraft with every technology required to probe into the deepest corners of the galaxy."

The interior of the "Prometheus" was built across a two-level structure, fronted by a large, faceted, wrap around windscreen. Theron's quarters were designed to represent her high status in the crew, and were furnished with modern and futuristic items, including Swarovski chandeliers and a <a href="Fazioli">Fazioli</a> piano. The ship's garage was built on the backlot of Pinewood Studios in England. The vehicles inside were built in 11 weeks and were designed to operate on difficult terrain while having a futuristic aesthetic. Max created a large pyramid structure for the alien world, which had its main interior areas connected by a series of chambers, corridors, and tunnels; it was so large that some members of the film crew became lost inside it. The pyramid was enhanced in post-production to further increase its size. One of the key sets, the chamber where the crew find the humanoid-head statue, was designed to resemble the interior of a cathedral and convey a quasi-religious impression. Giger designed the murals that appear within the chamber.

For the scene of the "Prometheus" descent to the alien moon LV-223, visual effects art director Steven Messing referenced NASA imagery, including vortex cloud structures. He also used aerial photographs of locations in Iceland and Wadi Rum shot by VFX supervisor <a href="Richard%20Stammers">Richard Stammers</a> and his team. Messing painted over these images and combined them with 3D set extensions to create a realistic altered landscape. Scott wanted the ship's descent scenes to have a sense of grandeur to contrast the dark and shrouded descent featured in "Alien". Much of LV-223s world was based upon the world visited in "Alien", but scaled back as Scott felt some elements were too unrealistic. Other influences were the Martian mountain <a href="Olympus%20Mons">Olympus Mons</a> and several large mountain structures on Earth. NASA advisers provided concepts for the aesthetics of alien worlds which were incorporated into the design work. MPC developed a digital representation of Wadi Rum using the design material, modified it to locate the alien pyramid and a landing area for the "Prometheus", and resized the planet's natural features relative to the alien structures.

<a href="Neal%20Scanlan">Neal Scanlan</a> and <a href="Conor%20O%27Sullivan%20%28make-up%20artist%29">Conor O'Sullivan</a> developed the film's alien creatures, aiming to convey that each creature has a logical biological function and purpose. Scanlan said that much of Scott's inspiration for creature design is drawn from natural life, such as plants and sea creatures. Creature designer Carlos Huante chose to make the creature designs pale to contrast the black-toned, Giger-influenced aesthetic of "Alien". Huante designed them to be white and embryonic because the events in the film occur before Giger's influence had taken effect. Huante took influences from references Scott was using to design the pale-skinned Engineers. Huante also referenced other Giger works, national monuments, large sculptures, and the <a href="Crazy%20Horse%20Memorial">Crazy Horse Memorial</a> statue in South Dakota. Part of Huante's early design work included developing precursors to "Alien"s Facehugger, and a primitive "Alien" creature, but these were cut from the final release. When designing the Engineers, Scott and Huante referenced paintings by William Blake and <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a>, and classical sculptures. Scott wanted the Engineers to resemble <a href="Classical%20mythology">Greco-Roman</a> gods, and instructed designer <a href="Neville%20Page">Neville Page</a> to reference the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, Michelangelo's "<a href="David%20%28Michelangelo%29">David</a>", and <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. The 8-foot tall, humanoid Engineers were created by applying bulky, full-body prosthetics to the actors, whose facial features were diminished by the material, and were later digitally enhanced to preserve the "godlike" physical perfection. Scott described the Engineers as tall, elegant "dark angels".

The snake-like alien dubbed the "Hammerpede" was given life through a mixture of CGI and practical effects, and the wires controlling the practical puppet were digitally removed. For a scene in which the Hammerpede is decapitated, the VFX team digitally animated and inserted the spontaneous growth of a replacement head. During the scene in which the Hammerpede erupts from Spall's character's corpse, Scott controlled the puppet using wires. Scott did not inform Dickie about what was to occur in the scene and her screaming reaction was real. The creature's design was partially inspired by translucent sea creatures with visible arteries, veins, and organs beneath the skin's surface, and cobras. The designers gave the creature a smooth, muscular, and powerful appearance. Early designs of the "Trilobite", the tentacled offspring cut from Shaw, resembled an octopus or squid. Page redeveloped this creature as an embryo in an early state of development, with tentacles that began fused together and would gradually split, creating new tentacles, as the creature developed. The practical creature was a remotely operated <a href="Animatronics">animatronic</a> creation with a silicone skin.

The mutated Fifield effects were achieved mainly through the use of make-up and prosthetics. Due to concerns that the practical effects would be unsatisfactory, the filmmakers completed an alternative version of the sequence, in which Fifield was rendered as "a digital character with elongated limbs and an engorged, translucent head, incorporating a semblance of Harris's face". Three other variations of the mutated Fifield were modeled, but these were rejected as being too inhuman.

For its grown form, the "Adult Trilobite", Max found inspiration from an <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>-like creature from Earth's <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> period, and the alien octopus in <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Jean Giraud</a>'s illustrations for the comic strip "<a href="The%20Long%20Tomorrow%20%28comics%29">The Long Tomorrow</a>". Further inspiration came after Max found a formaldehyde-preserved giant squid, an image which met with Scott's approval. The film's last-unveiled creature, the "<a href="Proto-Xenomorph">Deacon</a>", was named by Scott for its long, pointed head that he considered resembled a bishop's mitre. Scanlan aimed to represent the creature's genetic lineage, beginning with Shaw and Holloway who produce the Trilobite which impregnates the Engineer, in its design. However, the creature was given a somewhat feminine appearance, since "it was born of a female before being born of a male." Messing drew inspiration for the Deacon's birth scene from the birth of foals, and created an iridescent appearance for its skin, based on the equine placenta. The Deacon's protruding jaw was inspired by the <a href="goblin%20shark">goblin shark</a>.

Sound effects were generated with a variety of sources including <a href="Pop%20Rocks">Pop Rocks</a>—a brand of popping candy—and a parrot. The glistening ice forming on the stone cylinders discovered in the film was created by applying the popping candy to materials such as wet metal and stone that was then sprayed with water to produce the "popping, cracking" sound. Sound designer Ann Scibelli's parrot was recorded over several weeks to document her variety of vocalizations which were then used as beeps, alarms and the cries of Shaw's alien offspring.

"Prometheus" contains approximately 1,300 digital effect shots. The main effects studio was <a href="Moving%20Picture%20Company">Moving Picture Company</a> (MPC), which produced 420 of the shots. Several other studios, including <a href="Weta%20Digital">Weta Digital</a>, Fuel VFX, <a href="Rising%20Sun%20Pictures">Rising Sun Pictures</a>, <a href="Luma%20Pictures">Luma Pictures</a>, <a href="Lola%20Visual%20Effects">Lola Visual Effects</a>, and Hammerhead Productions, also produced effects shots for the film.

The creation of life from the disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening scene was created by WETA Digital. The scene was difficult to produce because it had to convey the story of the Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring over an extended period of time.

A key scene involving a large 3D hologram star map, dubbed the <a href="Orrery">Orrery</a>, was inspired by the 1766 <a href="Joseph%20Wright%20of%20Derby">Joseph Wright</a> painting "<a href="A%20Philosopher%20Lecturing%20on%20the%20Orrery">A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery</a>", in which a scientist displays a mechanical planetarium by candlelight. While discussing the necessity of a star map with Spaihts, Scott mentioned that he envisaged a physical representation being similar to the painting, although he was unaware of its title and described it as "circles in circles with a candle lit image". Using Scott's description, Spaihts located an image of the painting. Spaihts said, "making the leap from a star map, to an Enlightenment painting, and then back into the far future. [Scott's] mind just multiplexes in that way". The Orrery was one of the most complex visual effects, contained 80–100 million polygons, and took several weeks to render as a single, complete shot.

"Prometheus" marketing campaign began on July 21, 2011 at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>, where images and footage from the film were presented by Lindelof and Theron; Scott and Rapace participated via <a href="satellite%20contribution">satellite contribution</a>. A segment of the footage showed Theron performing naked push-ups, which attracted much attention. A teaser poster was released on December 14, 2011, with the tagline, "The search for our beginning could lead to our end." A bootleg recording of an incomplete trailer was leaked online on November 27, 2011, but was quickly taken down by Fox. The trailer was released on December 22, 2011.

On March 17, 2012, Scott, in partnership with <a href="AMC%20Theatres">AMC Theatres</a>, hosted the premiere of the first full "Prometheus" trailer at the AMC Downtown Disney during <a href="WonderCon">WonderCon</a> in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a>. The event was streamed live via Facebook, Twitter, and the AMC Theatre website, and the trailer was posted on AMC's YouTube channel immediately after its debut. Reactions to the trailer from WonderCon attendees, and on Twitter, were generally positive, and it received nearly three million views in the three days following its release. On April 10, 2012, media outlets were shown a 13-minute montage of scenes in 3D from the film's opening at the <a href="Vue%20Cinemas">Vue Cinema</a> in Leicester Square, London. The screening, and in particular the 3D visuals and the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, Theron, and Elba, was well received.

On April 29, 2012, the international launch trailer debuted in the United Kingdom on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> during the first advertisement break of the TV show "<a href="Homeland%20%28TV%20series%29">Homeland</a>". Viewers were encouraged to share their opinions about the trailer on Twitter, some of which were then shared in a live broadcast during a later break. This was the first time that viewers' tweets were used in a broadcast advertisement. A competition, offering viewers a chance to win tickets to the film whenever the social platform <a href="Zeebox">Zeebox</a> detected the advertisement airing, was launched on that site. On May 8, 2012, the advertisement became the subject of an investigation by the British broadcasting regulatory body <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> for allegedly breaching broadcast rules when a voiceover encouraged viewers to book tickets during the advertisement with the logo onscreen. The broadcast potentially broke a ruling that advertising and teleshopping must be clearly distinguishable from editorial content.

Although marketers typically avoid promoting adult-oriented films to reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including <a href="Coors%20Brewing%20Company">Coors</a>, <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon</a>, and <a href="Verizon%20FiOS">Verizon FiOS</a>, which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through <a href="Fandango%20%28ticket%20service%29">Fandango</a>, and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; this was the first time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them to reporters to ask at the event. The <a href="National%20Entertainment%20Collectibles%20Association">National Entertainment Collectibles Association</a> (NECA) released a series of "Prometheus" action figures in September 2012. A book, "Prometheus: The Art of the Film", containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.

A viral marketing campaign began on February 28, 2012, with the release of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the "TED 2023" video presents a futuristic vision of a <a href="TED%20%28conference%29">TED</a> conference, an annual technology and design event held in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a>. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because "a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If you want me to give a talk, I'm giving it in <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>.

TED community director Tom Rielly helped the film's producers gain approval for the use of the TED brand, which had not previously been used for promotional purposes. Rielly was involved in designing the 2023 conference, and said that the association generated millions of unique visits to the TED website. The video's release was accompanied by a fictional TED blog about the 2023 conference and a tie-in website for the fictional Weyland Corporation. On March 6, 2012, the Weyland website was updated to allow visitors to invest in the company as part of a game, which would reveal new "Prometheus" media.

During the 2012 WonderCon, attendees at the film's panel were given Weyland Corporation business cards that directed them to a website and telephone number. After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the "David 8" android, narrated by Fassbender. An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. A full page "David 8" advertisement was placed in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>"; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character questions, was included. A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the "Prometheus" spaceship. Another video, "Quiet Eye", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page. In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the "Alien" series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life. In France, the <a href="Saint-Martin%20%28Paris%20M%C3%A9tro%29">Saint-Martin</a> <a href="ghost%20station">ghost train station</a> was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters. The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel "<a href="Thus%20Spoke%20Zarathustra">Thus Spoke Zarathustra</a>" by <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book. Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.

At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof said that the videos originated from the question of the film's status as an "Alien" prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the "Alien" films. He also said that the videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.

The premiere of "Prometheus" took place on May 31, 2012, at the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire cinema</a> in Leicester Square, London. The film was released in the United Kingdom on , 2012, and in North America on , 2012. It was simultaneously released in <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> theaters and in 3D, and it is encoded for <a href="D-Box%20Technologies">D-Box</a> motion seats that provide physical feedback to the audience during the film.

In the United Kingdom, approximately £1 million ($1.6 million) of tickets were pre-sold. 18,827 tickets pre-sold for the <a href="London%20IMAX">London IMAX</a>, the largest IMAX screen in the country, which broke the theater records for the highest grossing week of pre-sales with £293,312 ($474,687), and the highest grossing first day of pre-sales with £137,000 ($221,717). It extended this record to 30,000 tickets sold and £470,977 ($737,588) earned, and become the most pre-booked film at that theater, exceeding the performance of high-profile IMAX releases including "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Deathly%20Hallows%20%E2%80%93%20Part%202">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2</a>" and "Avatar".

In North America, audience tracking showed high interest among males, but low among females. In the week before the film's release, predictions were conflicted on whether "Prometheus" or "" (the first family-oriented film of the summer), which were released simultaneously, would reach number 1 for that weekend. On June 6, 2012, Fandango reported that with 42% of daily sales "Prometheus" was beating "Madagascar 3". The online tracking for "Prometheus" surged with each additional promotional footage. "Prometheus" was predicted to earn approximately $30 million, and "Madagascar 3" around $45 million. As the weekend approached, tracking suggested a $55 million debut for "Madagascar 3" and $50–$55 million for "Prometheus". "Prometheus" was disadvantaged by "Madagascar" opening in 264 more theaters and its adult rating.

"Prometheus" was considered a financial success overall. After a strong start in North America, the film failed to meet the studio's expectations, but it continued to perform strongly in other territories until the end of its theatrical run. "Prometheus" earned $126.4 million (31.4%) in North America and $276.9 million (68.6%) elsewhere for a worldwide total of $403.4 million, making it the 18th highest-grossing film of 2012, and at its peak it was the 155th highest-grossing film worldwide unadjusted for inflation.
"Prometheus" was released in 15 markets between May 30 and June 1, 2012—about a week before its North American release. The earlier start in these countries was timed to avoid competition with the start of the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202012">2012 UEFA European Football Championship</a> the following week. On its opening day, which varies depending on the country, it earned $3.39 million in the United Kingdom, $2.2 million in Russia, and $1.5 million in France. The film earned $34.8 million during its opening weekend from 4,695 theaters in 15 markets, and debuted at number 1 in 14 of them, with an average of $7,461 per theater. Its overall rank for the weekend was third behind "<a href="Men%20in%20Black%203">Men in Black 3</a>" and "<a href="Snow%20White%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Huntsman">Snow White & the Huntsman</a>". Its opening weekends in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($10.1 million), Russia and the CIS ($9.80 million), and France and the Maghreb region ($6.68 million) represented its largest takings. By June 8, the film had opened in a total of 50 markets, and was also successful during its opening weekends in Australia ($7.2 million) and South Korea ($4.2 million). During its late August opening in Japan, the film earned $9.6 million.
In North America, "Prometheus" earned $3.561 million in midnight showings at 1,368 theaters, including $1.03 million from 294 IMAX theaters, and went on to earn $21.4 million through its opening day. During its opening weekend, the film earned $51.05 million from 3,396 theaters—an average of $15,032 per theater—ranking second behind "Madagascar 3" ($60.4 million), which made it the second largest opening for a film directed by Scott behind his 2001 thriller "<a href="Hannibal%20%28film%29">Hannibal</a>", the third largest second-place opening, the ninth largest opening for a prequel, and the tenth largest for an R-rated film. The largest demographic of the opening weekend audience was over the age of 25 (64%) and male (57%). 3D showings accounted for 54% of ticket sales, while IMAX contributed 18%—the majority of which was accounted for in the 3D figure. The film closed on September 20, 2012 after 105 days (15 weeks) in release with a total gross of $126.4 million. The figure made it the number 43 highest-grossing film to never finish a week as the number 1 film.

The film garnered a 73% approval rating from 288 critics—an <a href="weighted%20mean">average</a> rating of 7/10 on the review-aggregation website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which said, "Ridley Scott's ambitious quasi-prequel to "Alien" may not answer all of its big questions, but it's redeemed by its haunting visual grandeur and compelling performances—particularly Michael Fassbender as a fastidious android." <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> provides a score of 65 out of 100 from 42 critics, which indicates "generally favorable" reviews. <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "B" on a scale of A+ to F, while audience members under 25 rated it the highest at A-. Reviews frequently praised both the film's visual aesthetic and design, and Fassbender's performance as the android David received almost universal acclaim. However the plot drew a mixed response from critics, who criticized plot elements that remained unresolved or were predictable, tempered by appreciation for the action and horror set-pieces.

"<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>"s <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> called the film's visuals vivid, stunning, and magnificent on a technical level, and praised the performances of Fassbender, Rapace, and Theron, but wrote that the film "caters too much to imagined audience expectations when a little more adventurous thought might have taken it to some excitingly unsuspected destinations." "<a href="Time%20Out%20London">Time Out London</a>"s Tom Huddleston wrote that "the photography is pleasingly crisp and the design is stunning", but that, "[t]he script feels flat ... the dialogue is lazy, while the plot, though crammed with striking concepts, simply fails to coalesce. After an enjoyable setup, the central act is baggy, confusing and, in places, slightly boring, while the climax has flash and fireworks but no real momentum." <a href="Emanuel%20Levy">Emanuel Levy</a> wrote that the writing was his only complaint about the film, which, he said, "is not only uneven, but promises more original ideas and thematic provocations than it can possibly deliver." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, labeling it a "seamless blend of story, special effects and pitch-perfect casting, filmed in sane, effective 3-D that doesn't distract." Ebert wrote that Rapace's performance "continues here the tradition of awesome feminine strength begun by Sigourney Weaver in "Alien"", but considered that Elba's Janek has the most interesting character evolution. Ebert thought that the plot raises questions and does not answer them, which made the film intriguing and parallel to the "classic tradition of golden age sci-fi". He later went on to name it as one of the best films of 2012.

"<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>"s Jonathan Crocker wrote that the plot successfully integrated itself with "Alien"s mythology while offering its own original ideas. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Lisa Schwarzbaum was positive towards the cast, particularly Rapace, and the cinematography. "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>"s Andrew O'Hehir wrote that the film was "somber, spectacular and ponderous", but that the "portentousness and grandiosity ... is at once the film's great strength and great weakness" and criticized the characters for lacking common sense. O'Hehir also mentioned Wolski's cinematography and Max's production design. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>"' <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> criticized the story as weak, and argued that the narrative's twists and reversals undermine its "lofty, mindblowing potential". He said the film has no revelations, just "bits of momentarily surprising information bereft of meaning or resonance", and that Rapace is a "fine heroine, vulnerable and determined".

"<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" film critic Justin Chang wrote that the film's narrative structure was unable to handle the philosophical dimension of the plot, and that "Prometheus" was lazily deferring key plot points under the presumption that a sequel would be made. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>'s" <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> wrote that "Prometheus" was "more grandiose, more elaborate—but less interesting" than "Alien", and lacked the latter's "central killer punch". Ian Nathan of "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine was unimpressed by Rapace—whom he described as an unconvincing lead—and said that with "a lack of suspense, threadbare characters, and a very poor script, the stunning visuals, gloopy madness, and sterling Fassbenderiness can't prevent "Prometheus" feeling like "Alien"s poor relation." "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s Nick Pinkerton wrote that the film is "prone to shallow ponderousness", and that Scott "can still mimic the appearance of an epic, noble, important movie—but the appearance is all." He criticized Rapace and Marshall-Green for failing to instill interest in their characters' relationship, but added: "there are a few set pieces here that will find a place of honor among aficionados of body horror and all things clammy and viscous".

James Cameron said: "I enjoyed "Prometheus". I thought it was great. I thought it was Ridley returning to science fiction with gusto, with great tactical performance, beautiful photography, great native 3D. There might have been a few things that I would have done differently, but that's not the point—you could say that about any movie."

In North America, "Prometheus" DVD and Blu-ray disc releases were listed for pre-order in partnership with Amazon on June 1, 2012, a week before the film was released in theaters. A limited number of cinema tickets for the film were offered as a pre-order incentive. In June 2012, "<a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a>" obtained the rights to the film's network television premiere. On September 7, 2012, Fox announced that "Prometheus" would be the launch title of its new digital distribution initiative "Digital HD". The film was released on September 18, 2012, three weeks prior to its DVD, Blu-ray disc and <a href="Video%20on%20demand">Video on demand</a> (VOD) release, for downloading and streaming through platforms including Amazon, iTunes, <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> and <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a> in over 50 countries. The film was released on Blu-ray disc and DVD on October 9, 2012. The Blu-ray disc edition of the film was released in a 2-disc set and a 4-disc "Collector's Edition". Both versions contain the theatrical cut of "Prometheus", commentary by Scott, Lindelof and Spaihts, a DVD and digital copy of the film, <a href="Alternate%20ending">alternate</a> and deleted scenes, and other features. Additionally, the Collector's Edition contains the 3D version of the film and approximately 7 hours of supplemental features including a documentary on the film's production. On October 8, 2012, it was reported that Fox had requested an extended version of the film for home media, but Scott refused to edit cut scenes back into the theatrical version of the film, which he considered his director's cut. During its first week of sale in the United Kingdom, "Prometheus" was the number 1 selling film on DVD and Blu-ray Disc, outselling its nearest competitor by a factor of three. An <a href="Ultra%20HD%20Blu-ray">Ultra HD Blu-ray</a> version is scheduled for release in September 2017.

Scott discussed a continuation of the series in March 2012, saying that "Prometheus" leaves many questions unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved so that they could be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that "Prometheus" could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. By August 2012, a sequel was announced to be in development for release no earlier than 2014. Lindelof chose not to work on the new film, citing other commitments. Titled "", the sequel premiered in London, England on May 4, 2017, and was released in the United States on May 19, 2017. Set eleven years after the events of "Prometheus", "Alien: Covenant"s story follows the crew of the Covenant space ship who land on an uncharted and seemingly uninhabited planet. The film stars <a href="Katherine%20Waterston">Katherine Waterston</a>, <a href="Danny%20McBride">Danny McBride</a>, <a href="Demian%20Bichir">Demian Bichir</a>, <a href="Jussie%20Smollett">Jussie Smollett</a>, <a href="Amy%20Seimetz">Amy Seimetz</a>, <a href="Carmen%20Ejogo">Carmen Ejogo</a>, <a href="Callie%20Hernandez">Callie Hernandez</a>, Alex England and <a href="Billy%20Crudup">Billy Crudup</a>. On release, "Alien: Covenant" earned a worldwide box office gross of $240.7 million (compared to "Prometheus" $403.4 million), and received generally favorable reviews. A sequel to "Alien: Covenant" is in development. In 2013, a comic book series was announced by <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> that serves as a spin-off to "Prometheus". The series, titled "<a href="Fire%20and%20Stone">Fire and Stone</a>", is an "<a href="Alien%20vs.%20Predator">Alien vs. Predator</a>" crossover featuring content exclusive to "Prometheus".

South American dreadnought race

A naval <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> among <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>—the most powerful and wealthy countries in <a href="South%20America">South America</a>—began in the early twentieth century when the Brazilian government ordered three <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s, formidable <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies.

In 1904, the Brazilian Navy found itself well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships had been ordered since the <a href="%23Brazilian%20decline%20and%20re-emergence">fall of the Brazilian monarchy</a> in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just concluded a <a href="Argentine%E2%80%93Chilean%20naval%20arms%20race">fifteen-year naval arms race</a> which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.

The Brazilian government ordered three small battleships from the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in late 1905, but the appearance of the revolutionary British warship in 1906 quickly scrapped these plans. Instead, the Brazilians ordered three dreadnoughts—warships that would be the most powerful in the world, and of a type which quickly became a measure of international prestige, similar to nuclear weapons in the mid-twentieth century. This action focused the world's attention on the newly ascendant country: newspapers and politicians in the great powers fretted that Brazil would sell the ships to a belligerent nation, while the Argentine and Chilean governments immediately canceled their naval-limiting pact and ordered two dreadnoughts each (the and es, respectively).

Meanwhile, Brazil's third dreadnought faced a good deal of political opposition after an economic downturn and a <a href="%23Brazilian%20naval%20revolt">naval revolt</a>: the crews of both of their brand-new battleships, along with several smaller warships, mutinied and threatened to fire on Rio de Janeiro if there was no end to what they called the "slavery" being practiced by the Brazilian Navy. Despite these pressures, the shipbuilder <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> successfully held the Brazilians to their contractual obligations. Construction on the new ship, preliminarily named <a href="Brazilian%20battleship%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%281913%29">"Rio de Janeiro"</a>, was halted several times due to repeated design changes. Brazil's coffee and rubber booms collapsed soon after. Concerned that their ship would be outclassed by larger <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a>s, they sold the incomplete vessel to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in December 1913.

The First World War marked the end of the naval arms race, as the South American countries found themselves unable to purchase additional warships. The Brazilian government ordered a new battleship, <a href="%23Riachuelo">"Riachuelo"</a>, in May 1914, but the conflict effectively canceled the ship. The British purchased the two Chilean battleships before they were completed; one was sold back to Chile in 1920. Argentina's two dreadnoughts, having been built in the neutral United States, escaped this fate and were commissioned in 1914–15. Although several South American called for dreadnoughts, no additional units were constructed.

Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s. This tension was heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20River%20%28Argentina%29">Santa Cruz River</a>. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty. Each government was distracted in the next few years, Argentina's with intensified <a href="Conquest%20of%20the%20Desert">military operations against the indigenous population</a> (1870–84), and Chile's with the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> ("Guerra del Pacífico", 1879–83) against Bolivia and Peru. Still, several warships were ordered by both nations: the Chileans ordered a <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>, , while the Argentines contracted for two warships, the <a href="central%20battery%20ship">central battery</a> <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad</a> and protected cruiser <a href="ARA%20Patagonia%20%281885%29">"Patagonia"</a>.

In 1887, the Chilean government added <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>3,129,500 to the budget for its fleet, at the time still centered on two aging central battery ironclads, and , from the 1870s. They ordered the battleship , two protected cruisers, and two <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s; their <a href="keel%20laying">keels were laid</a> in 1890. The Argentine government quickly responded with an order for two battleships, <a href="ARA%20Independencia%20%281891%29">"Independencia"</a> and <a href="ARA%20Libertad%20%281892%29">"Libertad"</a>, beginning a naval <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> between the two countries. It continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive <a href="Chilean%20Civil%20War%20of%201891">Chilean Civil War</a> (1891). The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895, each marking a small increase in capabilities from the ship previous. Argentina escalated the race in July 1895 by buying an <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>, , from Italy. Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser, , and six torpedo boats; the Argentine government quickly ordered another armored cruiser from the Italian engineering company <a href="Gio.%20Ansaldo%20%26amp%3B%20C.">Ansaldo</a>, and later ordered two more.

The race slowed for a few years after <a href="Puna%20de%20Atacama%20dispute">a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama</a> region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Argentina">American ambassador to Argentina</a>, <a href="William%20Paine%20Lord">William Paine Lord</a>, but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy bought two more armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two "Constitución"-class <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought</a> battleships from British shipyards. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships.

The growing dispute disturbed members of the British government, as war looked like a very real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area. Argentina and Chile both imported British-made goods, while the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain, most shipped through the River Plate, and Chilean nitrates. The British government mediated negotiations between the two countries through their <a href="Envoy%20%28title%29">envoy</a> in Chile. These <a href="Pacts%20of%20May">were successfully concluded</a> on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice. The warships under construction were sold to the United Kingdom and Japan: Chile's battleships became the former's , and Argentina's armored cruisers the latter's . It is not clear if the two planned Argentine battleships were ordered, but in any case the plans were quickly scuttled. "Capitán Prat", "Garibaldi", and "Pueyrredón" were disarmed with the exception of their main batteries, as there was no crane capable of removing the cruisers' gun turrets.

Brazil's navy fell into disrepair and obsolescence after an <a href="Decline%20and%20fall%20of%20Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil%23Republican%20coup">1889 coup d'État</a>, which deposed <a href="Politics%20of%20the%20Empire%20of%20Brazil">Emperor</a> <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a>, <a href="Revolta%20da%20Armada">two naval revolts</a> (1891 and 1893–94), the <a href="Federalist%20Riograndense%20Revolution%20%28Brazil%29">Federalist Revolution</a> (1893–95), and the <a href="War%20of%20Canudos">War of Canudos</a> (1896–97). The navy had just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel in 1896, and amid quickly improving naval technology, the only modern armored ships were two small coast-defense vessels launched in 1898. With such dilapidated defenses, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Paranhos%2C%20Baron%20of%20Rio%20Branco">José Paranhos Jr., the Baron of Rio Branco</a> and <a href="Foreign%20Minister%20of%20Brazil">Foreign Minister of Brazil</a>, stated "In such conditions, you ... understand how upset I am and all the worries I have. All that still protects [Brazil] is the moral force and old prestige still left from [the Imperial era] when there was still foresight in this land..."

Meanwhile, although the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels built in the interim, so by the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage. Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.

The late nineteenth and early twentieth century demand for coffee and rubber led to Brazil's <a href="Coffee%20production%20in%20Brazil%23History">coffee economy</a> and <a href="rubber%20boom">rubber boom</a>. At the time, it was estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Geraes</a>, and <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%28state%29">Rio de Janeiro</a>. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years. Simultaneously, there was an effort on the part of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably <a href="Pinheiro%20Machado%20%28politician%29">Pinheiro Machado</a> and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.
The <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress of Brazil</a> passed a large naval acquisition program on 14 December 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered. One, supported by the British armament company <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships. Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that "with six small battleships we would be much better. If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three [larger battleships]? With two damaged or destroyed, we would be left with one only."

At first, the smaller warships faction prevailed. After Law no. 1452 was passed on 30 December 1905, which authorized £4,214,550 for new warship construction (£1,685,820 in 1906), three small battleships, three <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s, six <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, twelve <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s, three <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s, a <a href="Collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a>, and a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> were ordered. Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral <a href="J%C3%BAlio%20C%C3%A9sar%20de%20Noronha">Júlio César de Noronha</a>, signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for the planned battleships on 23 July 1906.

The British ambassador to Brazil was opposed to the planned naval expansion, even though the orders went to a British company, for its large cost and its negative effects on relations between Brazil and Argentina. He saw it as "an embodiment of national vanity, combined with personal motives of a pecuniary character." The American ambassador to Brazil was alarmed, and sent a <a href="cablegram">cablegram</a> to his <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">Department of State</a> in September 1906, warning them of the destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as Cuba, whose <a href="1901%20Constitution%20of%20Cuba">new constitution</a> allowed the American government to intervene in Cuban affairs. The new <a href="President%20of%20Brazil">President of Brazil</a>, <a href="Afonso%20Pena">Afonso Pena</a>, supported the naval acquisitions in an address to the National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace "Aquidabã", which unexpectedly blew up that year, and the antiquated vessels composing the current navy.

After construction began on Brazil's three new small battleships, the Brazilian government reconsidered their order and chosen battleship design (something that would happen during the construction of <a href="HMS%20Agincourt%20%281913%29">"Rio de Janeiro"</a> in 1913). This was wrought by the debut of the United Kingdom's new <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> concept, which was represented by the surprisingly fast construction and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioning</a> of <a href="HMS%20Dreadnought%20%281906%29">the eponymous ship</a> in 1906. The hallmark of this new warship type was its "all-big-gun" armament, which utilized many more heavy-caliber weapons than previous battleships, and it rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.

The money authorized for naval expansion in 1905 was redirected to building three dreadnoughts (with the third to be laid down after the first was launched), three scout cruisers (later reduced to two, which became the ), fifteen destroyers (later reduced to ten, the ), three submarines (the <a href="F%201-class%20submarine">"F 1" class</a>), and two <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a>s (later reduced to one, ). This move was made with the large-scale support of Brazilian politicians, including Pinheiro Machado and a nearly unanimous vote in the Senate; the navy, now with a large-ship advocate, Rear Admiral , in the influential post of minister of the navy; and the Brazilian press. Still, these changes were made with the stipulation that the total price of the new naval program not exceed the original limit, so the increase in battleship tonnage was bought with the previous elimination of armored cruisers and decreasing the number of destroyer-type warships. The three battleships on which construction had begun were scrapped beginning on 7 January 1907, and the design for the new dreadnoughts was approved on 20 February. Newspapers began covering the Brazilian warship order in March, and Armstrong laid down the first dreadnought on 17 April. The full order—including all three dreadnoughts and the two cruisers—was reported by the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>", "<a href="Daily%20Chronicle%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Daily Chronicle</a>", and the <a href="The%20Times">"Times"</a> later that year.

The Brazilian order for what contemporary commentators called "the most powerful battleship[s] in the world" came at a time when few countries in the world had contracted for such armament. Brazil was the third country to have a dreadnought under construction, behind the United Kingdom, with and the , and the United States, with the . This meant that Brazil was in line to have a dreadnought before many of the world's perceived powers, like <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a>, the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, and the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a>. As dreadnoughts were quickly equated with international status, somewhat similar to <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s today—that is, regardless of a state's need for such equipment, simply ordering and possessing a dreadnought increased the owner's prestige—the order caused a stir in international relations.

Newspapers and journals around the world speculated that Brazil was acting as a proxy for a stronger country which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such armament. Many American, British, and German sources variously accused the Americans, British, German, or Japanese governments of secretly plotting to purchase the vessels. The <a href="The%20World%27s%20Work">"World's Work"</a> remarked:

On the other side of the Atlantic, in the midst of the <a href="Anglo%E2%80%93German%20naval%20arms%20race">Anglo–German naval arms race</a>, members of the British <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> fretted over the battleships' possible destinations, though the Admiralty consistently stated that they did not believe any sale would occur. In mid-July and September 1908, the Commons discussed purchasing the ships to bolster the Royal Navy and ensure they would not be sold to a foreign rival, which would disrupt the British naval plan set in place by the "<a href="Naval%20Defence%20Act%201889">two-power standard</a>," though in March and late July 1908, the Brazilian government officially denied any sale was planned. In March 1909, the British press and House of Commons began pushing for more dreadnoughts after the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="Reginald%20McKenna">Reginald McKenna</a>, asserted that Germany had stepped up its building schedule and would complete thirteen dreadnoughts in 1911—four more than previously estimated. Naturally, the subject of purchasing the Brazilian dreadnoughts already being built was brought up, and McKenna had to officially deny that the government was planning to tender an offer for the warships. He also stated that a sale to a foreign nation would be inconsequential, as "our present superiority in strength in 1909–10 is so great that no alarm would be created in the mind of the Board of Admiralty."

Despite the plethora of rumors, the Brazilian government was not planning to sell their ships. Dreadnoughts formed an important role in Rio Branco's goal of raising Brazil's international status:

Argentina was highly alarmed by the Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the remaining months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile. In November 1906, Argentina's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%2C%20International%20Trade%20and%20Worship">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a>, , remarked that any one of the new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets. Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets. With this in mind, the "Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers" opined that maintaining the older "Libertad" class or "Capitán Prat" (respectively) was now a waste of money.

The Argentine government's alarm continued under de Oca's successor, <a href="Estanislao%20Zeballos">Estanislao Zeballos</a>. In June 1908, Zeballos presented a plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: if they did not comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.

The Argentine government was also deeply concerned with the possible effect on the country's large export trade, as a Brazilian blockade of the entrance to the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">River Plate</a> would cripple the Argentine economy. The acquisition of dreadnoughts to maintain an equal footing with Brazil would, in the words of the Argentine admiral overseeing his countries' dreadnoughts while they were being constructed, avoid a "preponderance of power on the other side, where a sudden gust of popular feeling or injured pride might make [a blockade] a dangerous weapon against us."

Both countries faced difficulty in financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling <a href="National%20Autonomist%20Party">National Autonomist Party</a> supported the purchases, they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions. An influx of inflammatory newspaper editorials supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from <a href="La%20Prensa%20%28Buenos%20Aires%29">"La Prensa"</a>, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines were attempting to restore the <a href="Viceroyalty%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata</a>, swayed the public to support the purchases. The Argentine President, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Figueroa%20Alcorta">José Figueroa Alcorta</a>, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government replied with reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in that they believed the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for use against Argentina.

In August, a bill authorizing the Argentine Navy to acquire three dreadnoughts was passed by the <a href="Argentine%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies">Chamber of Deputies</a> seventy-two to thirteen. Three months later, it was defeated in the <a href="Argentine%20Senate">Senate</a> after they approved an arbitration treaty and the government made a last-ditch offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian dreadnoughts currently being constructed. The Brazilian government declined, so the bill was reintroduced and passed by the Senate on 17 December 1908 with forty-nine in support to thirteen opposed, over socialist objections that the country needed to be populated and the large sum of money (£14,000,000) could be better spent in other areas of the government.

After the Argentine government sent a naval delegation to Europe to solicit and evaluate armament companies' offers, they received tenders from fifteen shipyards in five countries (the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy), and conducted a <a href="Rivadavia-class%20battleship%23Bidding">drawn-out bidding process</a>. The Argentine delegation rejected all of the bids twice, each time recycling the best technical aspects of the tendered designs when crafting new bidding requirements. The reason given for the first rejection was the appearance of the first <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a>, . Still, the shipbuilders were furious, as the process of designing a major warship took large amounts of time and money, and they believed the Argentine tactic revealed their individual <a href="trade%20secret">trade secret</a>s. A British naval architect published a scathing condemnation of the Argentine tactics, albeit only after the contracts were not awarded to a British company:

The United States' <a href="Fore%20River%20Shipyard">Fore River Ship and Engine Company</a> tendered the lowest bid—in part owing to the availability of cheap steel, though they were accused of quoting an unprofitable price so the ships could act as <a href="loss%20leader">loss leader</a>s—and was awarded the contract. This aroused further suspicion in the European bidders, who had previously believed that the United States was a non-contender, though Argentina did order twelve destroyers from British, French, and German shipyards to soften the blow. These bidders, along with newspapers like the "Times" (London), turned their anger on the American government under President <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>, whose so-called "<a href="Dollar%20Diplomacy">Dollar Diplomacy</a>" policy had led his State Department to go to great lengths to obtain the contracts. Their reactions may have been justified: Taft boasted in the high-profile 1910 <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20address">State of the Union address</a> that the Argentine dreadnought order was awarded to American manufacturers "largely through the good offices of the Department of State."
The Argentine contract included an <a href="Option%20%28finance%29">option</a> for a third dreadnought in case the Brazilian government adhered to its contractual obligations to order a third dreadnought. Two newspapers, <a href="La%20Prensa%20%28Buenos%20Aires%29">"La Prensa"</a> and <a href="La%20Naci%C3%B3n">"La Argentina"</a>, heavily advocated for a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship. The American minister to Argentina, <a href="Charles%20H.%20Sherrill%20%28ambassador%29">Charles H. Sherrill</a>, cabled back to the United States that "this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds." On 31 December 1910, the Argentine government decided against constructing the ship, after <a href="Roque%20S%C3%A1enz%20Pe%C3%B1a">Roque Sáenz Peña</a>, who had been making entreaties to Brazil to end the expensive naval race, was elected to the Presidency. In addition, the intended target of the third Argentine dreadnought, the third Brazilian dreadnought, had already been canceled multiple times.

The Chilean government delayed their naval plans after a financial <a href="depression%20%28economics%29">depression</a> brought on by the <a href="1906%20Valpara%C3%ADso%20earthquake">1906 Valparaíso earthquake</a> and a drastic fall in the <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a> market in 1907, but these economic problems were not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina. While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to Peruvian military acquisitions.

Money for a naval building program was allocated in 1910. Although the Chilean government solicited bids from several armament companies, nearly all believed that a British company would win the contract; the American <a href="Military%20attach%C3%A9">naval attaché</a> opined that without anything short of a revolution the contracts were destined for the United Kingdom. The Chilean Navy had cultivated extensive ties with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy since the 1830s, when Chilean naval officers were given places on British ships to receive training and experience they could bring back to their country. This relationship had recently been cemented when a British <a href="naval%20mission">naval mission</a> was requested by Chile and sent in 1911. Still, the American and German governments attempted to swing sentiment to their side by dispatching modern naval vessels ( and , respectively) to Chilean ports. Their efforts were futile, and the design tendered by Armstrong Whitworth was chosen on 25 July 1911.

Other South American navies, having limited resources and little expertise in operating large warships, were in no state to respond. The <a href="Peruvian%20Navy">Peruvian Navy</a>, fourth largest on the continent, had been decimated during the <a href="Naval%20Campaign%20of%20the%20War%20of%20the%20Pacific">naval campaign</a> of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> against Chile (1879–83). It took the Peruvian government more than twenty years to order new warships—the (<a href="BAP%20Almirante%20Grau%20%281906%29">"Almirante Grau"</a> and <a href="BAP%20Coronel%20Bolognesi%20%281906%29">"Coronel Bolognesi"</a>), scout cruisers delivered in 1906 and 1907. They were augmented by two submarines and a destroyer ordered from France. "Almirante Grau" was only intended to be the fleet's flagship until a more powerful warship was purchased; along with "Coronel Bolognesi", they would be the "pioneers" of a modern navy. "Proceedings" reported in 1905 that this new navy would be composed of three <a href="Swiftsure-class%20battleship">"Swiftsure"</a>-like pre-dreadnoughts, three armored cruisers, six destroyers, and numerous smaller warships, all acquired as part of a nine-year, $7 million outlay.

None of these plans came to fruition. The closest major expansion came in 1912, when the Peruvian Navy had an agreement to acquire an obsolete French armored cruiser in 1912 () for three million <a href="French%20franc">francs</a>. The Peruvian government paid one of a planned three planned installments, but the purchase came under criticism at home for not being able to change any balance of power with Chile. When a potential cruiser purchase by Ecuador fell through, the Peruvians quit paying for the ship, which was later converted to a merchant ship and scrapped in 1923.

Other South American navies also added smaller vessels to their naval forces in the same time period. The <a href="National%20Navy%20of%20Uruguay">Uruguayan Navy</a> acquired a gunboat in 1910, while the <a href="Bolivarian%20Armada%20of%20Venezuela">Venezuelan Navy</a> bought an ex-Spanish <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>, <a href="USS%20Isla%20de%20Cuba%20%281886%29">"Mariscal Sucre"</a>, from the United States in 1912. The <a href="Ecuadorian%20Navy">Ecuadorian Navy</a> added a Chilean torpedo boat to its fleet in 1907, complementing its fleet of two <a href="aviso">aviso</a>s, both around , two small steamers, and one minor coast guard ship.

Brazil's , the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a>, was <a href="keel%20laying">laid down</a> by Armstrong on 17 April 1907, while its <a href="sister%20ship">sister</a> followed on 30 April at Vickers. Completion of the partial hull needed to <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launch</a> "Minas Geraes" was delayed by a five-month <a href="strike%20action">strike</a> to 10 September 1908. "São Paulo" followed on 19 April 1909. Both were <a href="ship%20christening">christened</a> in front of large crowds by the wife of <a href="Francisco%20R%C3%A9gis%20de%20Oliveira">Francisco Régis de Oliveira</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Ambassadors%20of%20Brazil%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Brazilian ambassador to the United Kingdom</a>. After <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a>, the period after a warship's launch where it is completed, "Minas Geraes" was put through multiple <a href="Sea%20trial">trials</a> of the speed, endurance, efficiency, and weaponry of the ship in September, including what was at that time the heaviest <a href="broadside">broadside</a> ever fired off a warship. "Minas Geraes" was completed and handed over to Brazil on 5 January 1910. The trials proved that the <a href="Blast%20injury">blast</a> from the class' <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> upper turrets would not injure crewmen in the lower turrets. The ship itself managed to reach on an <a href="horsepower%23Indicated%20horsepower">indicated horsepower</a> (ihp) of 27,212. "São Paulo" followed its classmate in July, after its own trials at the end of May, where the ship reached at 28,645 ihp.

Argentina's was built by the Fore River Ship and Engine Company at its shipyard in Massachusetts. As called for in the final contract, was <a href="subcontractor">subcontracted</a> out to the <a href="New%20York%20Shipbuilding">New York Shipbuilding Corporation</a> of New Jersey. The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel%20Company">Bethlehem Steel Company</a> of Pennsylvania. "Rivadavia" was laid down on 25 May 1910—one hundred years after the establishment of the first independent Argentine government, the "<a href="Primera%20Junta">Primera Junta</a>"—and launched on 26 August 1911. "Moreno" was laid down on 10 July 1910 and launched on 23 September 1911. Construction on both ships took longer than usual, and there were further delays during their sea trials when one of "Rivadavia"s turbines was damaged and one of "Moreno"s turbines failed. The two were only officially completed in December 1914 and February 1915. Even the departure of "Moreno" was marked by mishaps, as the ship sank a <a href="barge">barge</a> and ran aground twice.

Chile's was launched on 27 November 1913. After the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out in Europe, work on "Almirante Latorre" was halted in August 1914, and it was formally purchased on 9 September after the British <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> recommended it four days earlier. "Almirante Latorre" was not forcibly seized like the Ottoman <a href="Ottoman%20battleship%20Re%C5%9Fadiye">"Reşadiye"</a> and <a href="Ottoman%20battleship%20Sult%C3%A2n%20Osm%C3%A2n-%C4%B1%20Evvel">"Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel"</a> (ex-<a href="Brazilian%20battleship%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%281913%29">"Rio de Janeiro"</a>), two other ships being built for a foreign navy, as a result of Chile's "friendly neutral" status with the United Kingdom. The British needed to maintain this relationship owing to their dependence on Chilean nitrate imports, which were vital to the British armament industry. The former Chilean ship—the largest vessel built by Armstrong up to that time—was completed on 30 September 1915, commissioned into the Royal Navy on 15 October, and served in that navy in the First World War. Work on the other battleship, "Almirante Cochrane", was halted after the outbreak of war. The British purchased the incomplete hulk on 28 February 1918 for conversion to an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>, as "Almirante Cochrane" was the only large and fast hull which was immediately available and capable of being modified into a carrier without major reconstruction. Low priority and <a href="industrial%20action">quarrels with shipyard workers</a> slowed completion of the ship; it was commissioned into the Royal Navy as in 1924.

After the first Brazilian dreadnought, "Minas Geraes", was launched, the Brazilian government began an extended campaign to remove the third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the <a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Lash">Revolt of the Lash</a> coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in part to lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. "Rio de Janeiro" was laid down for the first time in March 1910.
By May, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong to stop work on the new warship and to submit new designs which took in the most recent advance in naval technology, <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a>s. <a href="Sir%20Eustace%20Tennyson%20d%27Eyncourt%2C%201st%20Baronet">Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt</a> served as Armstrong's liaison to Brazil. The <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition">1911 "Encyclopædia Britannica"</a> specifies this design as a long <a href="length%20overall">overall</a>, ship mounting twelve 14-inch guns and costing near £3,000,000. The many requests made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes delayed the contract signing until 10 October 1910, and the battleship's keel laying was delayed further by a <a href="Labor%20unrest">labor dispute</a> with the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Shipwrights">Worshipful Company of Shipwrights</a>, which led to a <a href="Lockout%20%28industry%29">lockout</a>. During these delays, a new Minister of the Navy, Admiral <a href="Marques%20Le%C3%A3o">Marques Leão</a>, was appointed to replace de Alencar—an important development, as the contract stipulated that the design could only proceed with the approval of the new Minister. Again, however, the Brazilian Navy found itself torn between two schools of thought: Leão and others in the navy favored a reversion to the 12-inch gun, but others, led by the outgoing Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the head of the Brazilian naval commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral ), were strongly in favor of obtaining the ship with the largest armament—in this case, a design drawn up by Bacellar, carrying eight 16-inch guns, six 9.4-inch guns, and fourteen 6-inch guns.

D'Eyncourt, who had departed Brazil in October immediately after the contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President <a href="Hermes%20da%20Fonseca">Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca</a> to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns in favor of a smaller ship. The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he had to deal with <a href="%23Brazilian%20naval%20revolt">the fallout</a> from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.

To make matters worse, the dreadnoughts' expense combined with loan payments and a worsening economy led to growing <a href="government%20debt">government debt</a> compounded by <a href="Government%20budget%20deficit">budget deficits</a>. By one measure of Brazil's <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP per capita</a>, income in the country rose from $718 in 1905 to a high of $836 in 1911 before declining over the next three years to a low of $780 in 1914 (both measured in 1990 <a href="Geary%E2%80%93Khamis%20dollar">international dollars</a>). It did not fully recover until after the First World War. At the same time, Brazil's external and internal debt reached $500 and $335 million (respectively, in contemporaneous dollar amounts) by 1913, partly through rising deficits, which were $22 million in 1908 and $47 million by 1912. In May, the president commented negatively on the new ship:

D'Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16-inch guns when he saw the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the "Minas Geraes" class, but a design with no less than "fourteen" 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the "Minas Geraes" class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.
After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for £2,675,000, and "Rio de Janeiro"s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again; by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that "Rio de Janeiro" would be outclassed upon completion. Making matters worse, a European depression after the end of the <a href="Second%20Balkan%20War">Second Balkan War</a> in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the <a href="Rubber%20boom%23The%20end%20of%20the%20Amazon%27s%20rubber%20monopoly">Brazilian rubber monopoly</a> to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5 percent between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6 percent, respectively. The Brazilian Navy later claimed that selling "Rio de Janeiro" was a tactical decision, so they could have two divisions of battleships: two with 12-inch guns (the "Minas Geraes" class), and two with 15-inch guns.

Armstrong studied whether replacing the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell the ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.

The Brazilian government rejected an Ottoman proposal to swap ships, with Brazil's "Rio de Janeiro" going to the Ottomans and <a href="Ottoman%20battleship%20Re%C5%9Fadiye">"Reşadiye"</a> going to Brazil, presumably with some amount of money. The Brazilian government would only accept a monetary offer. Lacking this, the Ottomans were forced to find a loan. Fortunately for them, they were able to obtain one from a French banker acting independent of his government, and the Ottoman Navy secured the "Rio de Janeiro" on 29 December 1913 for £1,200,000 as-is. As part of the purchase contract, the remainder of the ship was constructed with £2,340,000 in Ottoman money. Renamed "Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel", it was eventually taken over by the British shortly after the beginning of the First World War, serving with the Royal Navy as .

The Argentine government authorized a third dreadnought in October 1912 in case "Rio de Janeiro" was completed and delivered, but the ship was never named or built.

After selling "Rio de Janeiro", the Brazilian government asked Armstrong and Vickers to prepare designs for a new battleship, something strongly supported by the <a href="Navy%20League%20of%20Brazil">Navy League of Brazil</a> ("Liga Maritima"). Armstrong agreed to construct the ship without any further payments from Brazil. They replied with at least fourteen designs, six from Vickers (December 1913 through March 1914) and eight from Armstrong (February 1914). Vickers' designs varied between eight and ten 15-inch and eight 16-inch guns, with speeds between 22 and 25 knots (the lower-end ships having mixed firing, the higher using oil), and displacements between and . Armstrong took two basic designs, one with eight and the other with ten 15-inch guns, and varied their speed and firing.

While most secondary sources do not mention that Brazil ordered a battleship, with the ship's entry in the warship encyclopedia "Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships" even remarking that "Brazil had not selected from the four design variations," the Brazilian government chose what was labeled as Design 781, the first of the eight 15-inch designs tendered by Armstrong, which also shared characteristics with the <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth-class%20battleship">"Queen Elizabeth"</a> and <a href="Revenge-class%20battleship">"Revenge" classes</a> then being built for the United Kingdom. They placed an order for one ship of this design, to be named "Riachuelo", at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard in <a href="Elswick%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Elswick</a> on 12 May 1914. Some preliminary gathering of materials was completed for a planned <a href="keel%20laying">keel laying</a> date of 10 September, but the beginning of the First World War in August 1914 delayed plans. "Riachuelo" was officially suspended on 14 January 1915 and canceled on 13 May 1915.

In late November 1910, a large naval revolt, later named the Revolt of the Lash, broke out in Rio de Janeiro. The tension was kindled by the racial makeup of the navy's regular crewmembers, who were heavily black or <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a>, whereas their officers were mostly white. The Baron of Rio Branco commented: "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless "lumpen", without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos."

This kind of <a href="impressment">impressment</a>, combined with the heavy use of <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> for even minor offenses, meant that relations between the black crews and white officers was tepid at best. Crewmen aboard "Minas Geraes" began planning for a revolt in 1910. They chose <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20C%C3%A2ndido%20Felisberto">João Cândido Felisberto</a>, an experienced sailor, as their leader. The mutiny was delayed several times by disagreements among the participants. In a major meeting on 13 November, some of the revolutionaries expressed a desire to revolt when the president would be inaugurated (15 November), but another leader, Francisco Dias Martins, talked them out of the idea, insisting that their demands would be overshadowed by a perceived rebellion against the political system as a whole. The immediate catalyst for their revolt came on 21 November 1910, when an Afro-Brazilian sailor, <a href="Marcelino%20Rodrigues%20Menezes">Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes</a>, was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination. A Brazilian government observer, former navy captain <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Carlos%20de%20Carvalho">José Carlos de Carvalho</a>, stated that the sailor's back looked like "a mullet sliced open for salting."

The revolt began aboard "Minas Geraes" at around 10 pm on 22 November; the ship's commander and several loyal crewmen were murdered in the process. Soon after, "São Paulo", the new cruiser "Bahia", the coast-defense ship , the minelayer , the <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a> , and the torpedo boats and all revolted with relatively little violence. The first four ships represented the newest and strongest ships in the navy; "Minas Geraes", "São Paulo", and "Bahia" had been completed and commissioned only months before. "Deodoro" was twelve years old and had recently undergone a <a href="wikt%3Arefit">refit</a>. The crews of the smaller warships made up only two percent of the mutineers, and some moved to the largest ships after the revolt began.

Key warships that remained in government hands included the old cruiser , "Bahia"s sister , the eight new destroyers of the <a href="Par%C3%A1%20class%20destroyer%20%281908%29">"Pará" class</a>. Their crews were in a state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es. These could not be fired without <a href="Percussion%20cap">firing cap</a>s, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.

Felisberto and his fellow sailors demanded an end to what they called the "slavery" being practiced by the navy, most notably the continued use of whipping despite its ban in every other Western nation. Though navy officers and the president were staunchly opposed to any sort of amnesty and made plans to attack the rebel-held ships, many legislators were supportive. Over the next three days, both houses of the Brazilian National Congress, led by the influential senator <a href="Rui%20Barbosa">Ruy Barbosa</a>, passed a general bill granting amnesty to all involved and ending the use of corporal punishment.

In the aftermath of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns' <a href="breechblock">breechblock</a>s. The revolt and consequent state of the navy, which was essentially unable to operate for fear of another rebellion, caused many leading Brazilians, including the president, prominent politicians like Barbosa and the Baron of Rio Branco, and the editor of the most respected newspaper in Brazil, "<a href="Jornal%20do%20Commercio">Jornal do Commercio</a>", to question the use of the new ships and support their sale to a foreign country. The British ambassador to Brazil, W.H.D. Haggard, was ecstatic at Rio Branco's about-face, saying "This is indeed a wonderful surrender on the part of the man who was answerable for the purchase and who looked upon them as the most cherished offspring of his policy." Shortly before the vote on the amnesty bill, Ruy Barbosa emphatically outlined his opposition to the ships:

In the end, the president and cabinet decided against selling the ships because they feared it would hurt them politically. This came despite a consensus agreeing that the ships should be disposed of, possibly to fund smaller warships capable of traversing Brazil's many rivers. The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government, or what he called the "brutal militaristic regime". Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down their third dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought, and the United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, though this proved to be short-lived.

Although the "Minas Geraes" class remained in Brazilian hands, the mutiny had a clear detrimental effect on the navy's readiness: by 1912, an Armstrong agent stated that the ships were in terrible condition, with rust already forming on turrets and boilers. The agent believed it would cost the Brazilian Navy around £700,000 to address these issues. Haggard tersely commented, "These ships are absolutely useless to Brazil", a sentiment echoed by "Proceedings". Despite the government's refusal to sell the two "Minas Geraes"-class ships and subsequent support for acquiring "Rio de Janeiro", some historians credit the rebellion, combined with the Baron of Rio Branco's death in 1912, as major factors in the Brazilian government's decision (which was possibly made by January 1913, but certainly by September) to sell the ship to the Ottomans.

After "Rio de Janeiro" was purchased by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the <a href="Argentine%20National%20Congress">Argentine National Congress</a> in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of "Rio de Janeiro".
The "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>" reported in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5 million offer for "Moreno" alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12 million). The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did. Similarly, news outlets reported in late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of "Rio de Janeiro", but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.

In each of the countries involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated the sale of the dreadnoughts to redirect the substantial amounts of money involved toward what they viewed as more worthy pursuits. These costs were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the "Minas Geraes" class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial purchase cost for the original three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of <a href="Track%20%28rail%20transport%29">railroad tracks</a> or 30,300 <a href="Homestead%20%28buildings%29">homesteads</a>. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was £605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was £832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in the first five years of "Minas Geraes"s and "São Paulo"s commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial cost, only added to the already staggering sum of money. The two "Rivadavia"s were purchased for nearly a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs. Historian <a href="Robert%20K.%20Massie">Robert K. Massie</a> rounded the figure to a full quarter of each government's annual income.

In addition, the nationalistic sentiments that exacerbated the naval arms race gave way to slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead. Commenting on this, the United States' <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Chile">Minister to Chile</a>, <a href="Henry%20Prather%20Fletcher">Henry Prather Fletcher</a>, wrote to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>: "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps they are much more in need of money than of battleships."

The First World War effectively ended the dreadnought race, as all three countries suddenly found themselves unable to acquire additional warships. After the conflict, the race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were postulated by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments.

The Brazilians modernized "Minas Geraes", "São Paulo", and the two cruisers acquired under the 1904 plan, and , between 1918 and 1926. This was sorely needed, as all four ships were not ready to fight a modern war. Although the Brazilian government intended to send "São Paulo" overseas for service in the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, both it and "Minas Geraes" had not been modernized since entering service, meaning they were without essential equipment like modern <a href="fire-control%20system">fire control</a>. Maintenance on the two ships had also been neglected, which was most clearly illustrated when "São Paulo" was sent to New York for modernization: fourteen of its eighteen boilers broke down, and the ship required the assistance of the American battleship and cruiser to continue the voyage. The two cruisers were in "deplorable" condition, as they were able to steam at a top speed of only thanks to a desperate need for new <a href="Condenser%20%28heat%20transfer%29">condenser</a>s and boiler tubes. With repairs, though, both participated in the war as part of <a href="Brazilian%20cruiser%20Bahia%23First%20World%20War">Brazil's main naval contribution to the conflict</a>.

The Brazilian Navy also made plans to acquire additional ships in the 1920s and 30s, but both were sharply reduced from the original proposals. In 1924, they contemplated constructing a relatively modest number of warships, including a heavy cruiser, five destroyers, and five submarines. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral <a href="Carl%20Theodore%20Vogelgesang">Carl Theodore Vogelgesang</a>, tendered a naval expansion plan of 151,000 tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000). The United States' State Department, led by Secretary of State <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> and fresh from negotiating the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, was not keen on seeing another dreadnought race, so Hughes quickly moved to thwart the efforts of the mission. Only one Italian-built submarine, , was acquired during this time.

By the 1930s, the international community believed that the bulk of the Brazilian Navy was "obsolete" and were old enough to no longer be "considered effective". Still, "Minas Geraes" was modernized a second time at the <a href="Arsenal%20de%20Marinha%20do%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard</a> from June 1931 to April 1938. Plans to give similar treatment to "São Paulo" were dropped due to the ship's poor material condition. During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaties</a>, which placed restrictions on the sale of used warships to foreign countries. The Brazilians eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom. In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions. Three s, based on the American , were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.

In the 1920s, nearly all of the major warships of the Argentine Navy were obsolete; aside from "Rivadavia" and "Moreno", the newest major warship had been constructed at the end of the nineteenth century. The Argentine government recognized this, and as part of holding on to their naval superiority in the region, they sent "Rivadavia" and "Moreno" to the United States in 1924 and 1926 to be modernized. In addition, in 1926 the Argentine Congress allotted 75 million <a href="Argentine%20peso%23Gold%20and%20silver%20pesos%2C%201881%E2%80%931969">gold peso</a>s for a naval building program. This resulted in the acquisition of three cruisers (the Italian-built and the British-built ), twelve destroyers (the Spanish-built and the British-built / classes), and three submarines (the Italian-built ).

Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race. Chile asked for "Canada" and "Eagle", the two battleships they ordered before the war, but the cost of converting the latter back to a battleship was too high. Planned replacements included the two remaining s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships. In the end, Chile only bought "Canada" and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. "Canada", for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.

Over the next several years, the Chileans continued to acquire more ships from the British, like six destroyers (the ) and three submarines (the ). "Almirante Latorre" was modernized in the United Kingdom from 1929 to 1931 at the <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport Dockyard</a>. A recession and a <a href="Chilean%20naval%20mutiny%20of%201931">major naval revolt</a> then led to the battleship's "de facto" inactivation in the early 1930s. In the late 1930s, the Chilean government inquired into the possibility of constructing an cruiser in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, or Sweden, but this did not lead to an order. A second plan to acquire two small cruisers was dropped with the beginning of the Second World War. Soon after the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, the United States attempted to purchase "Almirante Latorre", two destroyers, and a <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a>, probably because the Chilean Navy had a reputation for keeping its ships in top-quality condition, but the offer was rejected.

During the Second World War, the three major South American navies found themselves unable to acquire major warships; they were only able to do so again after the conflict, when the United States and United Kingdom had many unnecessary or surplus warships. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the South American navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, yet they ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than s and s. They were only able to acquire them when the <a href="Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a> began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the <a href="Mutual%20Defense%20Assistance%20Act">Mutual Defense Assistance Act</a> (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951. While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be <a href="Inter-American%20Treaty%20of%20Reciprocal%20Assistance">treaty-bound</a> to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries. The warships sold unilaterally changed the naval outlook of all three nations, leading them to accept parity (as opposed to the Argentine pre-war stipulation that its fleet be equal to Brazil's and Chile's combined).

The venerable dreadnoughts of South America soldiered on for a short time after the war. The US Navy's "<a href="All%20Hands">All Hands</a>" magazine reported in a series of 1948 articles that all save "São Paulo" and "Almirante Latorre" were still in active service; the former had been decommissioned and the latter undergoing repairs. With the influx of the modern cruisers, frigates, and corvettes, however, the battleships were quickly sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a>. The Brazilian Navy was the first to dispose of its dreadnoughts, the oldest in the world by that time. "São Paulo" was sold for scrap in 1951 but sank in a storm north of the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> while under tow. "Minas Geraes" followed two years later and was broken up in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> beginning in 1954. Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, "Moreno" was towed to Japan for scrapping in 1957, and "Rivadavia" was broken up in Italy beginning in 1959. "Almirante Latorre", inactive and unrepaired after a 1951 explosion in its engine room, was decommissioned in October 1958 and followed "Moreno" to Japan in 1959.

Drymoreomys

Drymoreomys is a <a href="rodent">rodent</a> genus in the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> that lives in the <a href="Atlantic%20Forest">Atlantic Forest</a> of Brazil. The single species, D. albimaculatus, is known only from the states of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a> and <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a> and was not named until 2011. It lives in the humid forest on the eastern slopes of the <a href="Serra%20do%20Mar">Serra do Mar</a> and perhaps reproduces year-round. Although its range is relatively large and includes some <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s, it is patchy and threatened, and the discoverers recommend that the animal be considered "<a href="Near%20Threatened">Near Threatened</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. Within Oryzomyini, "Drymoreomys" appears to be most closely related to "<a href="Eremoryzomys">Eremoryzomys</a>" from the <a href="Andes">Andes</a> of Peru, a <a href="biogeography">biogeographically</a> unusual relationship, in that the two populations are widely separated and each is adapted to an arid or a moist environment.

With a body mass of , "Drymoreomys" is a medium-sized rodent with long fur that is orange to reddish-<a href="buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a> above and grayish with several white patches below. The <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> on the hindfeet are very well developed and there is brown fur on the upper sides of the feet. The tail is brown above and below. The front part of the skull is relatively long and the ridges on the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> are weak. The <a href="palate">palate</a> is short, with its back margin between the third <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>. Several traits of the genitals are not seen in any other oryzomyine rodent.

"Drymoreomys" was first recorded in 1992 by Meika Mustrangi in the state of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a>. The animal was not, however, formally described until 2011, when Alexandre Percequillo and colleagues named it as a new genus and species within the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a>: "Drymoreomys albimaculatus". The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "Drymoreomys", combines the Greek "δρυμός" ("drymos"), meaning "forest", "ὄρειος" ("oreios"), meaning "mountain-dwelling", and "μῦς" ("mys"), meaning "mouse". The name refers to the animal's occurrence in mountain forest. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "albimaculatus", derives from the Latin "albus", meaning "white", and "maculatus", meaning "spotted", a reference to the spots of white in the animal's fur. Percequillo and colleagues found little geographic variation among samples of "Drymoreomys", although a few traits differ in frequency between populations from the states of São Paulo and <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>.

According to a <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> analysis of evidence from <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphology</a>, the <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> gene <a href="RBP3">IRBP</a>, and the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> gene <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a>, "Drymoreomys albimaculatus" is most closely related to "<a href="Eremoryzomys%20polius">Eremoryzomys polius</a>", an oryzomyine from northern Peru and the only species in the genus "Eremoryzomys". Together, "Drymoreomys" and "Eremoryzomys" are part of Marcelo Weksler's <a href="Oryzomyini%23clade%20D">clade D</a>, one of four main <a href="clade">clade</a>s within Oryzomyini. Some subsequent studies did not support a relationship between the "Drymoreomys–Eremoryzomys" <a href="clade">clade</a> and the rest of clade D, but this is probably due to <a href="saturation%20%28genetic%29">saturation</a> of the phylogenetic signal in mitochondrial data. Oryzomyini includes well over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America, including nearby islands such as the <a href="Gal%C3%A1pagos%20Islands">Galápagos Islands</a> and some of the <a href="Antilles">Antilles</a>. It is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a>, which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America. Sigmodontinae is the largest subfamily of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, other members of which include <a href="vole">vole</a>s, <a href="lemming">lemming</a>s, <a href="hamster">hamster</a>s, and <a href="Peromyscus">deermice</a>, all mainly from Eurasia and North America.

"Drymoreomys albimaculatus" is a medium-sized, long-tailed, short-eared, short-footed rodent. It is quite distinct from other oryzomyines and has a number of unique traits. In 11 adults from <a href="Parque%20Natural%20Municipal%20Nascentes%20do%20Garcia">Parque Natural Municipal Nascentes do Garcia</a> in Santa Catarina, head and body length was , tail length was , hindfoot length was , ear length was , and body mass was . The fur is long and dense and consists of thin, short, woolly underfur and long, thick overfur. Overall, the fur of the upperparts is orange to reddish-<a href="buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>. In the closely related "Eremoryzomys", the upperparts are grayish. The hairs of the underfur, which are long, are grayish for most of their length and orange or brown at the tip. In the overfur, the <a href="cover%20hair">cover hair</a>s (which form the main body of the fur), are long and brown at the tip, with an orange band below the tip, and the longer, sparse <a href="guard%20hair">guard hair</a>s are red to dark brown in the half closest to the tip and are long. The sides are reddish brown. On the underparts, the hairs are grayish at the base and white at the tip, except on the throat, chest, and (in some specimens) groin, where the hairs are entirely white—a trait unique among the oryzomyines. In overall appearance, the underparts are grayish, with white spots where the hairs are completely white.

The small, rounded ears are covered with dense golden hairs on the outer and with reddish brown hairs on the inner surface. The <a href="mystacial%20vibrissae">mystacial vibrissae</a> (whiskers on the upper lip) are long, usually extending a little beyond the ears when laid back against the head, but the <a href="superciliary%20vibrissae">superciliary vibrissae</a> (whiskers above the eyes) are short and do not extend beyond the ears. The upper surface on the forefeet is covered with brown fur, and there is white or silvery fur on the <a href="digit%20%28anatomy%29">digits</a>. <a href="Ungual%20tuft">Ungual tuft</a>s (fur around the bases of the claws) are present on the second through fourth digits. On the short, fairly broad hindfeet, the upper side is covered densely with silvery to white hairs near the tips of the feet and toes, and with brown fur otherwise. No other oryzomyine has such brown fur on its hindfeet. The second through fourth digits have long silvery-white ungual tufts, but those on the first digit are short. On the sole, the <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> are very large. Among oryzomyines, only "<a href="Oecomys">Oecomys</a>" and the extinct "<a href="Megalomys">Megalomys</a>" have similarly large pads between their digits. There is a dense cover of short brown hairs on both the upper and lower sides of the tail. Unlike in "Eremoryzomys", the tail is the same color above and below. The tail ends in a tuft, an unusual feature among oryzomyines.

In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is relatively long. The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal</a> and <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ry bones extend in front of the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, forming a <a href="rostral%20tube">rostral tube</a>, which is shared among oryzomyines only with "<a href="Handleyomys">Handleyomys</a>". The <a href="zygomatic%20notch">zygomatic notch</a> (a notch formed by a projection at the front of the <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> and interorbital region are weakly developed. "Eremoryzomys" has larger crests on its interorbital region.

The <a href="incisive%20foramina">incisive foramina</a> (openings in the front part of the <a href="palate">palate</a>) are long, sometimes extending to between the first <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). "<a href="Nephelomys%20levipes">Nephelomys levipes</a>" is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of "Eremoryzomys polius" is only slightly longer. The <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pits">posterolateral palatal pits</a> (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight <a href="fossa%20%28anatomy%29">fossas</a> (depressions). In "Eremoryzomys", these fossas are deeper. The roof of the <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a>, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small <a href="sphenopalatine%20vacuities">sphenopalatine vacuities</a>. The vacuities are much larger in "Eremoryzomys". The <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a>, a piece of bone that separates two <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (openings), is present in all "Drymoreomys" specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.

The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw) is long and low. The <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process</a>, the frontmost of the three main <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a> (projections) at the back of the jawbone, is large and about as high as the <a href="condyloid%20process">condyloid process</a> behind it. The <a href="angular%20process">angular process</a>, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a> (a raising at the back of the jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).

The upper incisors are <a href="opisthodont">opisthodont</a> (with the cutting surface oriented backwards) and have orange to yellow <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>. The upper molar rows are either almost parallel or slightly convergent with each other toward the front. "<a href="Holochilus">Holochilus</a>" and "<a href="Lundomys">Lundomys</a>" are the only other oryzomyines with non-parallel molar rows. The valleys between the <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a> of the upper molars extending from the inner and outer sides overlap slightly across the midlines of the teeth. The molars are high-cusped, almost <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a>. On M1, the <a href="anterocone">anterocone</a> (the front cusp) is divided into two cuspules on the lingual (inner, towards the tongue) and labial (outer, towards the lips) sides of the teeth. The <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>, a crest near the middle of the labial side of the tooth, is long and well developed on each of the three upper molars. On the lower molars (m1 to m3), the cusps on the labial side are located slightly in front of their lingual counterparts. The <a href="anteroconid">anteroconid</a>, the front cusp on the m1, is divided in two. The m1, m2, and usually m3 have a <a href="mesolophid">mesolophid</a>, a crest corresponding to the mesoloph but located on the lingual side. Each of the lower molars has two roots.

There are 12 ribs and 19 <a href="thoracolumbar">thoracolumbar</a> (chest and abdomen), four <a href="sacral%20vertebra">sacral</a>, and 36 to 38 <a href="caudal%20vertebra">caudal</a> (tail) vertebrae. There are three digits at the tip of the penis, of which the central one is the largest. The two lateral digits are not supported by mounds of the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone). There is only one <a href="penile%20spines">spine</a> on the <a href="wikt%3Apapilla">papilla</a> (nipple-like projection) on the upper side of the penis. On the <a href="urethral%20process">urethral process</a>, located in the crater at the end of the penis, a fleshy process at the side, the lateral <a href="lobule">lobule</a>, is present. The <a href="preputial%20gland">preputial gland</a>s (glands in front of the genitals) are large. The lack of lateral bacular mounds, presence of a lateral lobule, and size of the preputial glands are all unique traits among the oryzomyines.

The <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> of "Drymoreomys albimaculatus" is 2n=62, <a href="Fundamental%20number">FN</a>=62: the animal has 62 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, and 29 pairs of <a href="autosome">autosome</a>s (non-sex chromosomes) are <a href="acrocentric">acrocentric</a> (with one arm so short as to be almost invisible) and one small pair is <a href="Centromere%23Metacentric">metacentric</a> (with two equally long arms). Both sex chromosomes are <a href="submetacentric">submetacentric</a> (with one arm noticeably longer than the other), and X is larger than Y. Blocks of <a href="heterochromatin">heterochromatin</a> are present on all autosomes and the long arm of Y. <a href="Telomere">Telomeric</a> sequences are found near the <a href="centromere">centromere</a>s of the sex chromosomes. Aspects of this karyotype—with a high number of mostly acrocentric chromosomes and the presence of heterochromatin on the Y chromosome—are consistent with the pattern seen in other oryzomyines. However, no other oryzomyine has exactly the same karyotype as "D. albimaculatus". Other species in clade D have fewer chromosomes, down to 16 in "<a href="Nectomys%20palmipes">Nectomys palmipes</a>", although the karyotype of "Eremoryzomys polius" is unknown. This suggests an evolutionary trend of decreasing chromosome number within the clade.

"Drymoreomys albimaculatus" occurs in the <a href="Atlantic%20Forest">Atlantic Forest</a> on the eastern slopes of the <a href="Serra%20do%20Mar">Serra do Mar</a> in the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Santa Catarina, at above sea level. It has not been found in the intervening state of <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a>, but is likely to occur there. The <a href="biogeography">biogeographical</a> pattern indicated by the relationship between "Drymoreomys" and the Andean "Eremoryzomys" is unusual. While there are some similar cases of relationships between Andean and Atlantic Forest animals, these involve inhabitants of humid forests in the Andes; "Eremoryzomys", by contrast, lives in an arid area.

"Drymoreomys albimaculatus" appears to be a specialist of dense, moist, <a href="montane%20forest">montane</a> and premontane forest. It has been found in disturbed and <a href="secondary%20forest">secondary forest</a>s as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in <a href="pitfall%20trap">pitfall trap</a>s on the ground.

The range of "Drymoreomys albimaculatus" is relatively large and the species occurs in several <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s, but it has only been found in seven localities and its habitat is threatened by deforestation and fragmentation. Therefore, Percequillo and colleagues suggest that the species be assessed as "<a href="Near%20Threatened">Near Threatened</a>" under the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> criteria.

Waddesdon Bequest

In 1898, Baron <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand Rothschild</a> bequeathed to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> as the Waddesdon Bequest the contents from his New Smoking Room at <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. This consisted of a wide-ranging collection of almost 300 "<a href="objets%20d%27art">objets d'art</a> et de vertu" which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and <a href="maiolica">maiolica</a>. Earlier than most objects is the outstanding <a href="Holy%20Thorn%20Reliquary">Holy Thorn Reliquary</a>, probably created in the 1390s in Paris for <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">John, Duke of Berry</a>. The collection is in the tradition of a "<a href="schatzkammer">schatzkammer</a>" or treasure house such as those formed by the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> princes of Europe; indeed, the majority of the objects are from late Renaissance Europe, although there are several important medieval pieces, and outliers from classical antiquity and medieval Syria.

Following the sequence of the museum's catalogue numbers, and giving the first number for each category, the bequest consists of: "bronzes", handles and a knocker (WB.1); arms, armour and ironwork (WB.5); enamels (WB.19); glass (WB.53); Italian maiolica (WB.60); "cups etc in gold and hard stone" (WB.66); silver plate (WB.87); jewellery (WB.147); cutlery (WB.201); "caskets, etc" (WB.217); carvings in wood and stone (WB.231–265). There is no group for paintings, and WB.174, a <a href="portrait%20miniature">portrait miniature</a> on <a href="vellum">vellum</a> in a wooden frame, is included with the jewellery, though this is because the subject is wearing a pendant in the collection.

The collection was assembled for a particular place, and to reflect a particular aesthetic; other parts of Ferdinand Rothschild's collection contain objects in very different styles, and the Bequest should not be taken to reflect the totality of his taste. Here what most appealed to Ferdinand Rothschild were intricate, superbly executed, highly decorated and rather ostentatious works of the Late Gothic, Renaissance and <a href="Mannerism">Mannerist</a> periods. Few of the objects could be said to rely on either simplicity or <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> sculptural movement for their effect, though several come from periods and places where much Baroque work was being made. A new display for the collection, which under the terms of the bequest must be kept and displayed together, opened on 11 June 2015.

The collection was started by Baron Ferdinand's father, Baron <a href="Anselm%20von%20Rothschild">Anselm von Rothschild</a> (1803–1874), and may include some objects from earlier <a href="Rothschild%20family">Rothschild</a> collections. For <a href="Mayer%20Amschel%20Rothschild">Mayer Amschel Rothschild</a> (1744–1812) of <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, who began the prominence of the family, his business dealing in coins, "antiques, medals, and objects of display" preceded and financed his banking operations, and most Rothschilds continued to collect art.
At least one of the objects now in the British Museum can be seen in a cabinet in the background of a family portrait from 1838 (left), the year before Ferdinand was born. In his "Reminiscences" Ferdinand recalled his excitement as a child when he was allowed to help wrap and unwrap his father's collection, which spent the summers in a <a href="strongroom">strongroom</a> when the family left <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> for a country villa.

The period after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> offered tremendous opportunities for collectors of the <a href="decorative%20arts">decorative arts</a> of the medieval and Renaissance periods. These categories were valued very little by the art market in general, and metalwork was routinely sold for its <a href="bullion">bullion</a> value alone. Some of the older objects in precious metal in the collection may have first been received by the family as part of banking transactions; ownership of such pieces had always been partly a way to get some use from capital. Ferdinand records several complaints that his father did not make more use of his opportunities, but in his last years Anselm began to expand his collecting range, and it was he who bought both the Holy Thorn Reliquary and the <a href="Ghisi%20Shield">Ghisi Shield</a>. This golden age for collectors had passed by the time Ferdinand inherited his part of his father's collection in 1874, which was also the year he bought the Waddesdon estate and began to build there. Ferdinand continued to expand the collection until his death in 1898, mostly using dealers, and expanding the range of objects collected. In particular Ferdinand expanded to around fifty the ten or so pieces of jewellery in his father's collection.
The New Smoking Room built to hold the collection was only planned from 1891, and the collection was moved in there in early 1896, less than three years before Ferdinand's death. Good photographs allow an appreciation of how the objects were displayed, in glassed cases and on open shelves around the walls, over doors, and over the small fireplace, which had an elaborate shelved chimneypiece in wood above. Several objects, including the Casket of Saint Valerie, were on tables away from the walls. Comfortable seating was plentiful, some upholstered with pieces from medieval vestments, and there were framed photographs and houseplants. The room is now refilled with objects from the same period though of somewhat different types, and visitors to Waddesdon Manor can see it from the doorway.
The room, with the adjoining <a href="English%20billiards">Billiards</a> Room, is the only reception room at Waddesdon Manor to follow the French Renaissance style of the exterior; the other rooms are in broadly 18th-century styles, and contain a magnificent collection of paintings and furniture centred on that century. The segregation of the collection was part of the concept of what has been called the "neo-"Kunstkammer"", adopted by some other very wealthy collectors of the period. The Renaissance Room at what is now the <a href="Wallace%20Collection">Wallace Collection</a> and the collection of Sir <a href="Julius%20Wernher">Julius Wernher</a> were other examples formed in England over the same period. The neo-"Kunstkammer" aimed to emulate the collections formed during the Renaissance itself, mostly by princely houses; of these the outstanding survivals were the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> collections in Vienna, Prague and <a href="Ambras%20Castle">Ambras</a>, as well as the treasuries of the <a href="Gr%C3%BCnes%20Gew%C3%B6lbe">Grünes Gewölbe</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, the <a href="Munich%20Residenz">Munich Residenz</a> and <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>. Unlike those collections, contemporary and recent objects were not included.

Baron Ferdinand was a restless and, by his own account, unhappy man, whose life was blighted by the death of his wife after giving birth to their only child, who was stillborn; this was in 1866. Thereafter he lived with his unmarried sister <a href="Alice%20Charlotte%20von%20Rothschild">Alice</a>. As well as filling positions in local public life, he was <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Aylesbury%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aylesbury</a> from 1885 until his death, and from 1896 a Trustee of the British Museum, probably at the instigation of Sir <a href="Augustus%20Wollaston%20Franks">Augustus Wollaston Franks</a>.

Ferdinand recognized and welcomed the drift of high quality art into public collections, which had begun in earnest during his time as a collector. While most of his assets and collections were left to his sister Alice, the collection now forming the Bequest and, separately, a group of 15 manuscripts now in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, were left to the British Museum. He had already donated some significant objects to the museum in his lifetime, which are not counted in the Bequest.

Baron Ferdinand's bequest was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void. It stated that the collection should be

Much of the collection consists of luxury objects from the 16th century. Large pieces of metalwork in silver or <a href="silver-gilt">silver-gilt</a> make an immediate impression in the display, and these were designed to dazzle and impress guests when used at table, or displayed in rows on a sideboard with shelves like a modern bookcase or <a href="Welsh%20dresser">Welsh dresser</a>. Many are very heavily decorated in virtuoso displays of <a href="goldsmith">goldsmith</a>s' technique; rather too heavily for conventional modern taste. They are certainly ostentatious objects designed to display the wealth of their owner, and in many cases were designed to be appreciated when held in the hand, rather than seen under glass.

There are a number of standing cups with a cover, many from <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> and <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>; these were used to drink a toast from to welcome a guest, and were also a common gift presented in politics and diplomacy, and by cities to distinguished visitors. Their decoration sometimes reflected the latest taste, often drawing from designs made as prints and circulated around Europe, but there was also often a very conservative continuation of late Gothic styles, which persisted until they came to be part of a "Neugotic" ("Neo-Gothic") revival in the early 17th century. The largest object in the bequest with a specifically Jewish connection is a silver-gilt standing cup made in Nuremberg about 1600, but by 1740 belonging to a Jewish <a href="burial%20society">burial society</a> in <a href="Bratislava">Bratislava</a>, as a <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew language</a> inscription records.
Apart from pieces purely in metal, a number are centred on either <a href="hardstone%20carving">hardstone carving</a>s or organic objects such as horns, seashells, ostrich eggshells, and exotic plant seeds. These "curiosities" are typical of the taste of the Renaissance "<a href="age%20of%20discovery">age of discovery</a>" and show the "schatzkammer" and the <a href="cabinet%20of%20curiosities">cabinet of curiosities</a> overlapping. A different form of novelty is represented by a table-ornament of a silver-gilt foot-high figure of a huntsman with a dog and brandishing a spear. There is a <a href="clockwork">clockwork</a> mechanism in his base which propels him along the table, and his head lifts off to show a cup, and he would have been used in <a href="drinking%20game">drinking game</a>s. There are separate figures of a <a href="boar">boar</a> and stags for him to pursue, though not making a set; these can also function as cups.

One of the most important objects in the collection is the <a href="Ghisi%20Shield">Ghisi Shield</a>, a <a href="parade%20armour">parade shield</a> never intended for use in battle, made by <a href="Giorgio%20Ghisi">Giorgio Ghisi</a>, who was both a goldsmith and an important <a href="printmaker">printmaker</a>. It is signed and dated 1554. With a sword hilt, dated 1570 and now in at the <a href="Hungarian%20National%20Museum">Hungarian National Museum</a> in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a>, this is the only surviving <a href="damascening">damascened</a> metalwork by Ghisi. The shield is made of iron hammered in relief, then damascened with gold and partly plated with silver. It has an intricate design with a scene of battling horseman in the centre, within a frame, around which are four further frames containing allegorical female figures, the frames themselves incorporating minute and crowded subjects on a much smaller scale from the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" and ancient mythology, inlaid in gold.

Other major pieces are sets of a ewer and basin, basin in this context meaning a large dish or salver, which when used were carried round by pairs of servants for guests to wash their hands without leaving the table. However the examples in the collection were probably hardly ever used for this, but were intended purely for display on sideboards; typically the basins are rather shallow for actual use. These were perhaps the grandest type of plate, with large surfaces where Mannerist inventiveness could run riot in the decoration. They were already expensive because of the weight of the precious metal, to which a huge amount of time by highly skilled silversmiths was added. The Aspremont-Lynden set in the bequest is documented in <a href="House%20of%20Lynden">that family</a> back to 1610, some 65 years after it was made in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, and weighs a little less than five kilos.

Though the Waddesdon Bequest contains two very important medieval objects with enamel, and much of the jewellery and decorated cutlery uses enamel heavily, the great majority of the items that can be called "enamels" are in the French 16th-century style that was led by painted <a href="Limoges%20enamel">Limoges enamel</a>, rather than the <a href="champlev%C3%A9">champlevé</a> enamel for which <a href="Limoges">Limoges</a> was famous in the <a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque</a> period. The new technique produced pieces painted with highly detailed figurative scenes or decorative schemes. As with Italian maiolica, the imagery tended to be drawn from classical mythology or allegory, though the bequest includes some <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> scenes, and compositions were very often drawn from German, French or Italian prints. Enamels were produced in workshops which often persisted in the same family for several generations, and are often signed in the enamel, or identifiable, at least as far as the family or workshop, by punch marks on the back of panels, as well as by style. Leading artists represented in the collection include <a href="Suzanne%20de%20Court">Suzanne de Court</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Reymond">Pierre Reymond</a>, <a href="Jean%20de%20Court">Jean de Court</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Courtois">Pierre Courtois</a> and <a href="L%C3%A9onard%20Limousin">Léonard Limousin</a>.

Enamels were made as objects such as candlesticks, dishes, vessels and mirrors, and also as flat plaques to be included in other objects such as caskets. The collection includes all these types, with both unmounted plaques and caskets fitted with plaques. The jolly grotesques illustrated at right are on the reverse of a large dish whose main face shows a brightly-coloured depiction of the "Destruction of Pharaoh's army in the Red Sea". Both designs are closely paralleled, without being exactly copied, in pieces in other collections, notably one in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> in New York. The designs are also based on prints, but adapted by the enamellers for their pieces.

The Casket of the Sybyls is an elaborate small locking casket with a framework of silver-gilt and gems, set with <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> panels with touches of gold and flesh-tints. It represents the sophisticated court taste of about 1535, and was probably intended for a lady's jewels. Most such sets of enamel inserts have lost the settings they were intended for.

The emphasis of the jewellery is very firmly on spectacular badges and pendant jewels of the late Renaissance in what is known as the "Spanish Style" that was adopted throughout Europe between about 1550 and 1630, using gems together with gold and enamel to create dazzling tiny sculptures. These were originally worn by both men and women, but as a collection the Waddesdon group was chosen for display (and in a specifically male setting) rather than for wearing, except at the occasional fancy-dress ball, <a href="1903%20Ball%20in%20the%20Winter%20Palace">a fashion</a> at the time. The group demonstrate little interest in gemstones and pearls for their own sake. Although such pieces have survived more often than styles emphasizing gem stones and massy gold, which were typically recycled for their materials when fashion changed, the demand from 19th-century collectors greatly exceeded the supply of authentic survivals, and many pieces include much work from that period (see below).

For many of the pieces though it is not easy to place the date or country of manufacture. There is no such difficulty with the most famous jewel in the collection, the Lyte Jewel, which was made in London and presented to Thomas Lyte of <a href="Lytes%20Cary">Lytes Cary</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> in 1610 by King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I of England</a>, who loved large jewels, and giving them to others. Lyte was not a regular at court, but he had drawn up a family tree tracing James's descent back to the legendary <a href="Brutus%20of%20Troy">Trojan, Brut</a>. The jewel contains a miniature portrait of the king by <a href="Nicholas%20Hilliard">Nicholas Hilliard</a>, though for conservation reasons this is now removed from the jewel. Lyte wears the jewel in a portrait of 1611, showing a drop below the main oval set with three diamonds, which had gone before 1882. The front cover has an elaborate <a href="openwork">openwork</a> design with James's monogram "IR", while the back has very finely executed enamel decoration.

One pendant, shaped like a <a href="lantern">lantern</a> with a tiny "Crucifixion" inside, was made in 16th-century Mexico, and from comparison with other pieces may originally have included <a href="Mexican%20feather%20work">Mexican feather work</a>, a Pre-Columbian art whose craftspeople the Spanish missionaries employed in workshops for export luxury objects.

The collection includes an eclectic group of objects of very high quality that predate the Renaissance. The oldest objects are a set of four <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> bronze medallions with heads projecting in very high relief, and round handles hanging below. These date to the century before Christ, and came from a tomb in modern Turkey, and were fixtures for some wooden object, perhaps a chest. The heads are identified as <a href="Ariadne">Ariadne</a>, <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>, <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a> and <a href="Pluto%20%28mythology%29">Pluto</a>. The carved agate body of WB.68 may be late Roman, and is discussed below.

The Palmer Cup is an important early <a href="Islamic%20glass">Islamic glass</a> cup, made around 1200, in Syria or perhaps Egypt, and painted in enamels. In the same century it was given a silver-gilt and <a href="rock%20crystal">rock crystal</a> stem and foot in France. Below a poetic Arabic inscription praising wine-drinking, a seated prince holding a cup or glass is flanked by five standing attendants, two playing <a href="castanets">castanets</a> and the others holding weapons. As an early enamel-painted image the cup is extremely rare in Islamic glass, although similar images in <a href="Islamic%20pottery">Islamic pottery</a> of the period are found. There are a handful of comparable early Islamic glass cups with enamel that have survived in old European collections, such as the <a href="Luck%20of%20Edenhall">Luck of Edenhall</a> in the <a href="Victoria%20and%20Albert%20Museum">Victoria and Albert Museum</a>, and others in the <a href="Gr%C3%BCnes%20Gew%C3%B6lbe">Grünes Gewölbe</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> and the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, and others are recorded in old inventories. Often these were given a new foot in metalwork in Europe, as here. There is also a large <a href="mosque%20lamp">mosque lamp</a> with enamelled decoration from the late 14th century.

<a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque art</a> is represented by an unusually large <a href="Limoges%20enamel">Limoges enamel</a> <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a> in the common <a href="Chasse%20%28casket%29">chasse</a> shape, like a <a href="gable">gable</a>d house. This was made in about 1170 to hold relics of Saint <a href="Valerie%20of%20Limoges">Valerie of Limoges</a>, a virgin-martyr of the Roman period who was the most important local saint of <a href="Limoges">Limoges</a>, a key centre for Romanesque <a href="champlev%C3%A9">champlevé</a> enamel. Her highly visual story is told in several scenes that use a wide range of colours, with the rest of the front face decorated in the "vermicular" style, with the space between the figure filled with scrolling motifs on a gold background. According to legend, St Valerie was a <a href="cephalophore">cephalophore</a> saint, who after she was beheaded carried her own head to give to her bishop, <a href="Saint%20Martial">Saint Martial</a>, who had converted her.

There are many more objects in a <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic</a> style, and as is typical for northern Europe several of these come from well into the 16th century, and should be considered as belonging to the <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>. However the most important medieval object, and arguably the most important single piece in the collection, though from the late Gothic period, has nothing strictly Gothic in its style, and represents a very advanced court taste in this respect. This is the <a href="Holy%20Thorn%20Reliquary">Holy Thorn Reliquary</a>, which was probably created in the 1390s in Paris for the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> prince <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">John, Duke of Berry</a>, to house a <a href="relic">relic</a> of the <a href="Crown%20of%20Thorns">Crown of Thorns</a>. It is one of a small number of major goldsmiths' works or "joyaux" that survive from the extravagant world of the courts of the Valois royal family around 1400. It is made of gold, lavishly decorated with jewels and pearls, and uses the technique of <a href="vitreous%20enamel">enamelling</a> "en <a href="ronde%20bosse">ronde bosse</a>", or "in the round", which had been recently developed when the reliquary was made, to create a total of 28 three-dimensional figures, mostly in white enamel.

In contrast, two highly elaborate metalwork covers for the <a href="treasure%20binding">treasure binding</a>s of the <a href="Epistle">Epistle</a> and <a href="Gospel%20Book">Gospel Book</a>s for the high altar of a large church, probably <a href="Ulm%20Minster">Ulm Minster</a>, were made around 1506 but are full of spiky Gothic architectural details, although the many figures in high relief are on the verge of Renaissance style.

There are two German statues of saints in wood, about half life-size, from the decades around 1500, and a larger number of <a href="Gothic%20boxwood%20miniature">miniature boxwood carvings</a>. These include "prayer nuts" of superb quality from around 1510 to 1530. These are small wooden "balls" which open up to reveal carvings of religious scenes that fit dozens of tiny figures into a space two or three inches across, and were a fashion among royalty and the wealthy; they were apparently made in the northern Netherlands. They seem to have often been suspended from belts, or formed part of a <a href="rosary">rosary</a>; others still have copper carrying cases. A trick of technique in making them is that the main carved scene is made on a smaller hemisphere, allowing access from behind, which was then set into the main hemisphere.

There are seven glass vessels in the collection, but a larger number of pieces in transparent rock crystal or <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, a mineral that might easily be taken for glass. This was always a much more valuable and prestigious material, qualifying as a semi-precious stone. Needing very patient <a href="Grinding%20%28abrasive%20cutting%29">grinding</a> and <a href="drilling">drilling</a>, it is much harder to work than glass (though correspondingly less easy to break once finished), and the pieces include mounts or bases in precious metal, which none of the actual glass has; nor are the rock crystal pieces painted. Read's catalogue groups these and other pieces in semi-precious stone with the objects in gold, as opposed to the "silver plate", which probably reflects how a Renaissance collector would have ranked them. There are ten pieces in crystal and nine in other stones.

Two crystal pieces are plain oval plaques engraved with figurative scenes, a different tradition going back to pieces such as the <a href="Carolingian%20art">Carolingian</a> <a href="Lothair%20Crystal">Lothair Crystal</a>, also in the British Museum. In 1902 Read's catalogue suggested that "It is to this section that in all probability most eyes will be attracted, as well for the beauty of the specimens as for their rarity and consequent cost"; if this was the case then, it is probably not so a century later. Some pieces are now regarded as 19th century, or largely so, and <a href="Reinhold%20Vasters">Reinhold Vasters</a>, the <a href="Han%20van%20Meegeren">Van Meegeren</a> of Renaissance metalwork, is now held responsible in several cases.

A wide low crystal vase with cover is engraved with the name of the Mughal Emperor <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>, and was long thought to have been German, but sent out to India as a diplomatic gift, as the metalwork mounts are clearly European in style. It is now seen as an original, and exceptionally rare, Mughal crystal carving, to which the mounts were added in the 19th century, perhaps in Paris. However the <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a> with Akbar's name does not seem to specialists correct for a contemporary court piece, and the vase in India was probably carved after his reign (1556–1605), and the name perhaps added even later.

Apart from the two pieces of Islamic glass described above, there are five Renaissance or Baroque glass vessels, all unusual and of exceptional quality. Most are <a href="Venetian%20glass">Venetian glass</a>; one is moulded opaque <a href="Bohemian%20glass">Bohemian glass</a> (WB.56) with a "Triumph of Neptune", and is now dated to the late 17th century; it is also <a href="dichroic%20glass">dichroic glass</a>, which changes colour depending on whether it is lit from the front or behind. There is a very rare goblet in opaque turquoise glass with enamels (WB.55); this was to imitate or suggest a vessel in even more expensive semi-precious stone. The late 15th-century Deblín Cup with its cover is one of a small group of vessels made in <a href="Murano">Murano</a>, Venice in a German or Central European taste, drawing on metalwork shapes used there. It carries a later inscription in <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a> urging that the health of the Lords of <a href="Debl%C3%ADn">Deblín</a>, near <a href="Brno">Brno</a>, be drunk, and was probably the "welcome cup" of the castle there.

The six pieces of painted <a href="Italian%20maiolica">Italian maiolica</a>, or painted and tin-glazed earthenware, are all larger than the average, and there are none of the dishes that are the most common maiolica shape. The earliest piece is a large statue of <a href="Fortuna">Fortuna</a> standing on a <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>, holding a sail, by <a href="Giovanni%20della%20Robbia">Giovanni della Robbia</a>, made in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> about 1500–10. This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest.

The other pieces are from later in the 16th century. The most important are a pair of large snake-handled vases, nearly 2 foot (60 cm) high, painted with mythological scenes, to which French <a href="ormolu">ormolu</a> bases and lids were added shortly before they were bought in Paris by <a href="Horace%20Walpole">Horace Walpole</a> for the "Gallery" at <a href="Strawberry%20Hill%20House">Strawberry Hill House</a> in 1765–66. Ormolu mounts were often added by 18th-century collectors to such pieces, but few have remained in place.

The collection includes a number of other objects, including a few guns, swords and military or hunting equipment. There is also a German brass "hunting calendar" with several thin leaves that unfold. These include recessed lines filled with wax, enabling the keen hunter on a large scale to record his bags of wolf, bear, deer, boar and rabbit, as well as the performance of his dogs. There is a small cabinet with 11 drawers (plus other secret ones) made as a classical facade, or perhaps a theatre stage with scenery; the decoration is mostly damascened iron, and is 16th-century Milanese work.

Apart from the older woodcarvings discussed above, the bequest includes a number of small mostly German Renaissance portraits as carvings in wood, either in <a href="relief">relief</a> or in the round. These are of very high quality and include two miniature busts by <a href="Conrad%20Meit">Conrad Meit</a> of <a href="Philibert%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Savoy">Philibert II, Duke of Savoy</a>, who died young before the bust was made, and his Habsburg wife, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Austria%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Savoy">Margaret of Austria</a>. There are also some medallion portraits in very soft stone, that allows fine detail, and one allegorical scene attributed to <a href="Peter%20Fl%C3%B6tner">Peter Flötner</a>.

Any collection formed before the 20th century (and many later ones) is likely to contain pieces that can no longer sustain their original attributions. In general the Waddesdon Bequest can be said to have held up well in this regard, and the most significant brush with forgery has been to benefit the collection. In 1959 it was confirmed that the Waddesdon Holy Thorn Reliquary had been in the Habsburg <a href="Imperial%20Treasury%2C%20Vienna">Imperial Schatzkammer</a> ("treasure chamber") in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> from 1677 onwards. It remained in Vienna until after 1860, when it appeared in an exhibition. Some time after this it was sent to be restored by Salomon Weininger, an art dealer with access to skilled craftsmen, who secretly made a number of copies. He was later convicted of other forgeries, and died in prison in 1879, but it was still not realised that he had returned one of his copies of the reliquary to the Imperial collections instead of the original, and later sold the original, which is now in the bequest. One of the copies remained in the <a href="Schatzkammer">Ecclesiastical Treasury</a> of the Imperial Habsburg Court in Vienna, where the deception remained undetected for several decades.

In the 19th century a number of types of object were especially subject to major reworking, combining some original parts with those newly-made. This was especially a feature of arms and armour, jewellery, and objects combining hardstone carvings and metal mounts. This was mostly done by dealers, but sometimes collectors also.

Another object with a complicated and somewhat uncertain history is a two-handled <a href="agate">agate</a> vase with Renaissance-style metal mounts, which was acquired, with other similar pieces, for Waddesdon from the Duke of Devonshire's collection in about 1897, not long before Baron Ferdinand's death. Sir Hugh Tait's 1991 catalogue says of the vase:

As he describes, it was Tait who overturned the attribution to Cellini in 1971.
In a collection of Renaissance metalwork <a href="Benvenuto%20Cellini">Benvenuto Cellini</a> (1500–71) represents the ultimate attribution, as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by <a href="Giorgione">Giorgione</a>. In his 1902 catalogue <a href="Charles%20Hercules%20Read">Charles Hercules Read</a> mentions that many of the pendants had been attributed to Cellini, but refrains from endorsing the attributions. A small silver hand-bell (WB.95) had belonged to Horace Walpole, who praised it extravagantly in a letter as "the "uniquest" thing in the world, a silver bell for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini. It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself; indeed so does his Perseus. Well, "my" bell is in the finest taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, lizards, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that you would take it for one of the plagues of Egypt. They are all "in altissimo", nay "in out-issimo relievo" and yet almost invisible but with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by <a href="Wenzel%20Jamnitzer">Wenzel Jamnitzer</a>, goldsmith to the <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Rudolf II</a>, to whom it is still attributed. Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door-knocker, with a figure of <a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">Neptune</a>, 40 cm high, and weighing over 11 kilos.

One category of the bequest that has seen several demotions is the 16 pieces and sets of highly decorated cutlery (WB.201–216). Read dated none of these later than the 17th century, but on the British Museum database in 2014 several were dated to the 19th century, and were recent fraudulent creations when they entered the collection, some made by Reinhold Vasters. Doubts have also been raised over a glass cup and cover bearing the date 1518 (WB.59), which might in fact be 19th-century. Eight pieces of silver plate were redated to the 19th century by Hugh Tait, and some of the jewellery.

The Bequest was on display at the British Museum from 9 April 1900, in Room 40, which today contains the later medieval displays. An illustrated catalogue by Charles Hercules Read, who had replaced Franks as Keeper of British and Medieval Antiquities, was published in 1902. Photographs in the catalogue show a typical museum display for the period, with wood and glass cases spaced around the walls and free-standing in the centre, the latter with two levels. In 1921 it was moved to the North Wing.

In 1973 the new setting in Room 45 aimed "to create an element of surprise and wonder" in a small space, where only the objects were brightly lit, and displayed in an outer <a href="octagon">octagon</a> of wall cases, and an inner one of partition walls, rising to the low ceiling and set with shallow display cases, some visible from both sides. In the centre the Holy Thorn Reliquary occupied its own pillar display.

The new ground floor room at the front of the museum, opened in June 2015, returns the Bequest to a larger space and a more open setting. It is in the oldest part of the building and some later accretions to the room have been removed as part of the new installation. The design is by the architects <a href="Stanton%20Williams">Stanton Williams</a>, and the project received funding from The Rothschild Foundation.

St Denys' Church, Sleaford

St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is a medieval <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> <a href="Church%20of%20England%20parish%20church">parish church</a> in <a href="Sleaford">Sleaford</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, England. While a church and a priest have probably been present in the settlement since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire, which date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone <a href="broach%20spire">broach spire</a> is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The <a href="Decorated%20Gothic">Decorated Gothic</a> <a href="nave">nave</a>, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>.

The church is a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>, a national designation given to "buildings of exceptional interest". It is a prime example of Decorated Gothic church architecture in England, with the architectural historians <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Sir Nikolaus Pevsner</a> and <a href="John%20Harris%20%28curator%29">John Harris</a> noting that "it is a prolonged delight to follow the mason's inventiveness". The church's tracery has attracted special praise, with <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> arguing that its Decorated windows are "works of infinite complexity". Built out of <a href="Ancaster%20stone">Ancaster stone</a> with a lead roof, St Denys' is furnished with a medieval <a href="rood%20screen">rood screen</a> and a <a href="communion%20rail">communion rail</a>, possibly by <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Sir Christopher Wren</a>, and has a peal of eight bells, dating to 1796. The church also houses several memorials, including two altar tombs commemorating members of the Carre family, Sleaford's <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20manor">lords of the manor</a> in the 17th century.

St Denys' Church is the <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> of the <a href="benefice">benefice</a> of <a href="Sleaford">Sleaford</a> (formerly called New Sleaford), which encompasses most of the market town of Sleaford in the English <a href="non-metropolitan%20county">non-metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. The benefice is a <a href="vicarage">vicarage</a> and falls within the <a href="deanery%20of%20Lafford">deanery of Lafford</a> and the archdeaconry and <a href="diocese%20of%20Lincoln">diocese of Lincoln</a>; as of 2015, the vicar is Rev. Philip Anthony Johnson, who was appointed in 2013. The church is located next to (and faces onto) the market place at the town centre. It is dedicated to St Denys; the Victorian clergyman and local historian <a href="Edward%20Trollope">Edward Trollope</a> stated that this is a medieval form of St Dionysius, but does not elaborate on which of the several saints called Dionysius this refers to. According to a pamphlet published by the parochial church council, St Denys is a medieval composite of <a href="Dionysius%20of%20Paris">Dionysius of Paris</a>, <a href="Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Dionysius the Areopagite</a> and <a href="Pseudo-Dionysius%20the%20Areopagite">Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite</a>.

As of 2015, regular church services were scheduled for Sundays and Wednesdays. <a href="Holy%20Communion">Holy Communion</a> was conducted weekly at 8:00 am on Sundays, followed by <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a> and an all-age family worship at 10:00 am. A parent and toddler group was scheduled for Wednesdays at 9:30 am.

The Sleaford area has been inhabited since the late <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>; people settled around the <a href="Ford%20%28crossing%29">ford</a> where a prehistoric track running northwards from <a href="Bourne%2C%20Lincolnshire">Bourne</a> crossed the <a href="River%20Slea">River Slea</a>. A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the <a href="Corieltauvi">Corieltauvi</a> tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romans</a>, and then by the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxons</a>. The place-name "Slioford" first appears in 852, meaning "crossing over a muddy stream", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as "Old" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as "New" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet "New". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.

A speculative reassessment of "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called "Eslaforde" (Sleaford) were recorded in the "Domesday Book", one held by <a href="Remigius%20de%20F%C3%A9camp">Remigius</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, the other by <a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey Abbey</a>. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon <a href="thegn">thegn</a>, Bardi, and held 11 <a href="carucate">carucate</a>s with 29 <a href="Serfdom">villeins</a>, 11 <a href="wikt%3Abordar">bordars</a>, 6 <a href="Soke%20%28legal%29">sokemen</a>, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, of meadow and of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a>; in "Domesday" its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of <a href="Quarrington%2C%20Lincolnshire">Quarrington</a>, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre. The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany ruled out the possibility that this referred to <a href="Cranwell">Cranwell</a>, another of the abbey's fees, and concluded that it is probably a reference to the church at Old Sleaford, which was granted by a knight of Ramsey to <a href="Haverholme%20Priory">Haverholme Priory</a> in "c". 1165. Hence, the church possessed by the bishop in the other manor must have been a second church in Sleaford, and therefore could only have been St Denys' in what would become New Sleaford.

Sleaford and its church were altered considerably in the 12th century, especially under Bishop <a href="Alexander%20of%20Lincoln">Alexander of Lincoln</a>; <a href="Sleaford%20Castle">a castle</a> was constructed to the west of the town during his episcopate and work on the earliest surviving parts of the church may date to this period. Facing onto the market place, the tower is the oldest part of the present church building and dates to the late 12th century, probably "c". 1180. Its <a href="broach%20spire">broach spire</a> has been dated to the early 13th century, possibly "c". 1220. A <a href="prebendary">prebendary</a> of Sleaford is recorded in the late 13th century whose office was probably founded by one of the post-Conquest Bishops, who were its patrons. The <a href="vicar">vicar</a>age of Sleaford was founded and endowed in 1274; the record has survived and shows Henry de Sinderby being presented to the vicarage by the Treasurer of Lincoln and Prebendary of Sleaford, Richard de Belleau; the Bishop instituted him that March. The vicar could profit from <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s and <a href="oblation">oblation</a>s, and was given a house formerly occupied by one Roger the chaplain, but he had to pay £15 to the prebendary at the feasts of the Nativity and St John the Baptist. The prebendary otherwise retained his jurisdiction over the parish.

A period of rebuilding and remodelling occurred in the late <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. A <a href="chantry">chantry</a> chapel, dedicated to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel is located on the north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the <a href="Clergy%20house">Vicarage</a>. The tower was probably accompanied by a <a href="nave">nave</a> of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century; the <a href="transept">transept</a> followed twenty or thirty years later, according to Trollope. A <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> was added in around 1430 and the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> was remodelled at this time.

A diocesan return of 1563 recorded 145 households in the parish of New Sleaford, while the "Compton Census" (1676) reveals that New Sleaford had a <a href="Conformist">Conformist</a> population of 576 people, no "<a href="Papist">Papist</a>s", and 6 <a href="Non-conformists">Non-conformists</a>. There is a widely held local tradition that St Denys' was used during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> (1642–51) as a barracks for parliamentary troops who destroyed the interior furnishings. The local historian Trollope stated that the soldiers looted the brass eagle <a href="lectern">lectern</a> (last recorded in 1622), broke the <a href="stained%20glass%20window">stained glass window</a>s and the organ, and stole valuables. Whether this damage occurred or not, repairs to the windows and roof were carried out in 1657, paid for by <a href="Subscription%20%28finance%29">public subscription</a>. Galleries were also added to the church in the 18th century: the south in 1758, west in 1772, and north in 1783–84. In 1772, Edward Evans, a ship's surgeon on <a href="HMS%20Egmont%20%281768%29">HMS "Egmont"</a>, donated £300 to replace the organ with one built by <a href="Samuel%20Green%20%28organ%20builder%29">Samuel Green</a> of London.

For most of the 19th century, the Anglican community dominated Sleaford's civic bodies, including the <a href="Board%20of%20guardians">Board of Guardians</a>, who oversaw the <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>, and the <a href="Local%20Board%20of%20Health">Local Board of Health</a>. Dr Richard Yerburgh and his son, Richard, were vicars in 1809–51 and 1851–82 respectively and had family connections with the local builders Kirk and Parry; Yerburgh and <a href="Thomas%20Parry%20%28Boston%20MP%29">Thomas Parry</a> (one half of the firm) were on the Board of Guardians and were labelled members of a "family party" by opponents during the Board's 1870 elections (they were nonetheless re-elected). They and other local clergymen were key players in the establishment of <a href="National%20school%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">National schools</a> in Sleaford and Quarrington, which Kirk and Parry built. The Anglican congregation, at an estimated 700 to 800 people in 1851 (St Denys' had enough space for 743 people), was less than half of the size of the <a href="nonconformist">nonconformist</a> community, which was probably larger than 2,000 and tended to flourish in poorer parts of the town.

The 19th century also witnessed two major <a href="Victorian%20restoration">restorations</a> to St Denys'. As the congregation expanded, the need for greater space was met with the addition of a new north aisle in 1853. This coincided with a wider restoration project carried out at the cost of £3,500 by Kirk and Parry, which included the demolition of the galleries, the addition of a <a href="strainer%20arch">strainer arch</a> and the relocation of the organ. The church was damaged by an <a href="thunderstorm">electrical storm</a> in 1884 and parts, including the stone <a href="broach%20spire">broach spire</a>—one of the oldest in England—were rebuilt by Kirk and Parry in 1885–86. The old organ was sold in 1891 and St Hugh's Chapel and the choir vestry were dedicated to the memory of a local solicitor, Henry Snow, in 1906. Electric lighting was introduced in 1951–53 and extensive restoration work was carried out in 1966, when the organ was rebuilt, and in 1988. Fifty-four solar panels were added in 2008, at the cost of £70,000, and by 2011 were able to cover the church's electricity bill.

St Denys' is constructed in <a href="Ancaster%20stone">Ancaster stone</a> across four periods: the earliest sections in a transitional style between <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Early%20English%20Gothic">Early English Gothic</a> and <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Decorated%20Gothic">Decorated Gothic</a>; the late medieval nave, aisles and chancel in Decorated Gothic; the later <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Perpendicular%20Gothic">Perpendicular Gothic</a> clerestory and chancel; and the Victorian <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">neo-Gothic</a> restorations. The earliest parts consist of the late 12th or early 13th-century tower and spire on the west side of the church, which have a combined height of . Its arched entrance exhibits features of both the Early English and Decorated Gothic styles. During the restoration, a 15th-century window was removed, placed in the <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a> and replaced by arcading and three circlets, deemed "somewhat absurd" by the architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Sir Nikolaus Pevsner</a>.

With the exception of the tower and spire, much of the church was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style during the late 14th century; Pevsner argued that Sleaford was among those Lincolnshire churches which demonstrate that "For the decorated style, Lincolnshire is the best county of all". The nave and aisles extend eastwards from the tower. Outside, parts of the aisles are highly decorated; the north doorway includes shafts, mouldings and finials, while the simpler south doorway has niches and monster carvings. The northern doorway has a gable which encroaches up into a five-light window. Pevsner remarks that St Denys' is particularly notable for its <a href="tracery">tracery</a>, adding that "it is a prolonged delight to follow the mason's inventiveness along the building". The church's entry on the <a href="Listed%20building">Statutory List of Buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest</a> also notes its "particularly good mid [14th-century] tracery and ornament". The window above the north doorway is a good example; it contains elements shared by others of the Decorated style around the church, including reticulated <a href="Ogee">ogee arches</a> of varying complexity. The north transept includes a six-light window—"one of the great flowing designs of the country", according to Pevsner, Harris and Antram. <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a>, in his 2012 "England's Thousand Best Churches", awards St Denys three stars and says of the window tracery: "This is Lincolnshire at its most curvaceous, best displayed in the north transept north window. Words can barely do justice to this work... This is a work of infinite complexity, with variations repeated throughout the church."

A Perpendicular clerestory adorns the aisles with three-light windows; it dates to the early 15th century, possibly "c". 1430. The north aisle was extended in 1853, but the architects, Kirk and Parry, reused the windows. 

Inside, the tower ceiling has a <a href="tierceron">tierceron</a> vault and is connected to the nave and aisles by arches. The nave's arcading spans four bays, the last of which on the north side acts as an entrance to the transept. The north aisle was extended in 1853 by Kirk and Parry, who added a strainer arch to support the tower and join it with the north aisle. The <a href="reredos">reredos</a> and altar were built in 1922 by L.T. Moore; the rood screen was restored by <a href="Ninian%20Comper">Ninian Comper</a> in 1918 and the Communion rail was taken from <a href="Lincoln%20Cathedral">Lincoln Cathedral</a> during a restoration; it has been attributed to <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Sir Christopher Wren</a>, but Pevsner makes no mention of this. The rood loft is also by Comper, who is described by Simon Jenkins as "inventive as ever. His wood is unusually dark and unpainted, as are the rood figures and angels. The loft blooms out over the crossing." The screen and altar rails in St Hugh's Chapel are the work of C.H. Fowler; E. Stanley Watkins completed the reredos in 1906. In the 1640s, the stained glass included the armorial bearings of <a href="William%20Hussey%20%28judge%29">Sir William Hussey</a> <a href="Impalement%20%28heraldry%29">impaling</a> his wife's Barkley arms, and the arms of Markham and <a href="John%20Russell%20%28bishop%29">John Russell, Bishop of Lincoln</a>. These have not survived, but the current stained glass includes a "very Gothic" window by <a href="Hardman%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Hardman</a> dating to "c". 1853, three by <a href="William%20Holland%20%28stained%20glass%20maker%29">Holland</a> of <a href="Warwick">Warwick</a> from the late 1880s, one of <a href="Ward%20and%20Hughes">Ward and Hughes</a> (1885) and one by <a href="Morris%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Morris & Co.</a> from 1900. In 2006 Glenn Carter completed a stained glass window dedicated to Yvonne Double which had been commissioned by her widower, Eddy Double.

The earliest peal recorded at St Denys' had six bells: three dating from 1600, one from 1707 and two undated. In 1796 a new peal of eight bells were cast by Thomas Osborn of <a href="Downham%20Market">Downham</a>, Norfolk; the tenor is in the E key and weighs . Samuel Green's organ of 1772 was rebuilt by Holdich in 1852 and replaced by the present organ in 1891, which was built by <a href="Forster%20and%20Andrews">Forster and Andrews</a> of <a href="Kingston-upon-Hull">Hull</a>; rebuilt by <a href="Harrison%20%26amp%3B%20Harrison">Harrison & Harrison</a> in 1966, it was restored by A. Carter in 1999 and has three <a href="Musical%20keyboard">manual</a>s and a <a href="pedal%20keyboard">pedalboard</a>. St Hugh's Chapel has its own organ, with one manual, installed by Cousans and Sons in 1912. The church also houses a collection of fifteen antique, <a href="Chained%20library">chained books</a> in an oak reading desk; the oldest items date to the early 17th century and include tracts on <a href="divinity">divinity</a>. Other items of furniture include two old chests and a <a href="Charity%20%28practice%29">dole cupboard</a>, while a 16th-century tapestry is in the church's possession. The octagonal <a href="baptismal%20font">font</a> is in a Decorated Gothic style, but has been altered considerably.

The <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a> around St Denys' has been expanded several times: first in 1391, when the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, <a href="John%20Bokyngham">John Bokingham</a>, was granted a piece of land to one side of the church. Land to the north was also added in 1796. The grounds were enclosed by a dwarf wall, which was replaced by a more substantial stone wall and iron fence in 1837; the railings were removed during the First World War. In a report on the town's health in 1850, William Ranger criticised the overcrowding of the churchyard; in 1855, burials in the grounds ceased and the vestry elected a burial board to produce a solution. They purchased 2 acres, 3 <a href="rood%20%28unit%29">rood</a>s and 31 <a href="pole%20%28unit%29">pole</a>s (0.92 ha) of land to the north of Eastgate at a cost of £1,500; this was converted into a cemetery and a further 2 roods and 17 poles (0.063 ha) were bought for an access road. These grounds were extended in 1862 by an acquisition of 3 acres and 39 poles (1.51 ha) of land to the west of the cemetery; they are now managed by Sleaford Town Council.

According to <a href="Edward%20Trollope">Edward Trollope</a>, the oldest tombstone in the church was from the 13th century; it was faded and illegible when he recorded it in or before 1872. A 14th-century slab, originally for a now-lost effigy, is in the church, and brass plate from the same period was discovered during the 1853 restoration. Richard Dokke, along with his wife Joanna and son John, are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s, and a plaque to William Harebeter and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century.

Although <a href="Gervase%20Holles">Gervase Holles</a> recorded many 16th-century monuments when he visited Sleaford, most have disappeared. Amongst those which remain are the tombs and plaques commemorating the first members of the Carre family to settle in Sleaford. The Carres hailed from <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, but George Carre (d. 1521), a wool merchant, established himself in the town and is commemorated in St Denys' by a brass. On the northern side of the chancel is an <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a> monument dedicated to George's eldest surviving son Robert Carre (d. 1590), his three wives and some of their children; he became lord of the manors of Old and New Sleaford. Opposite, on the southern side, is an alabaster altar tomb by <a href="Maximilian%20Colt">Maximilian Colt</a> dedicated to Robert's fourth son and eventual heir, <a href="Carr%20baronets">Sir Edward Carre, 1st Baronet</a> (d. 1618), which carries the effigies of Edward and one of his two wives, probably his second, Anne Dyer; according to Trollope, it was "said to have been mutilated during the Civil War". Further plaques commemorate Sir Edward Carre's grandson, Sir Robert Carre, 3rd Baronet (d. 1682), and his son, Sir Edward (d. 1683), who is also commemorated by a bust in the church.

There are numerous other memorials to prominent Sleafordians. Early examples are plaques to John Walpoole (d. 1591, monument dated 1631), the draper Richard Warsope (d. 1609, erected by Robert Camock), and Rev. Theophilus Brittaine (d. 1696). Later monuments include those of Richard Moore (d. 1771) and Elizabeth Cooper (d. 1792), as well as a slab for Eleanor (d. 1725), wife of John Peart. The novelist <a href="Frances%20Brooke">Frances Brooke</a> (d. 1789) is buried in the church. Clergymen include William Seller, Joseph Francis (d. 1749) and Anthony Skepper (d. 1773). A window is dedicated to a local solicitor, Henry Snow (d. 1905), and memorials on the north wall include George Jeudwine (d. 1952), another solicitor, and the local historian William Hosford (d. 1987). The monument to Ann Bankes (d. 1834) incorporates a statue of a woman sinking into the ground, which Pevsner called "remarkably tender", while the tablet to Ann Moore (d. 1830) in the transept is noted as "good Grecian".

From 1 January 2019 Lee Rooke is the new organist and choirmaster.

USS Constellation vs La Vengeance

The USS "Constellation" vs "La Vengeance", or the Action of 1 February 1800, was a <a href="single-ship%20action">single-ship action</a> fought between frigates of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>. In the battle the American <a href="frigate">frigate</a> <a href="USS%20Constellation%20%281797%29">USS "Constellation"</a> tried to take the French frigate <a href="HMS%20Vengeance%20%281800%29">"La Vengeance"</a> as a prize. Both ships were heavily damaged. Although the French frigate struck her colors twice, she managed to flee only after the main mast of her opponent had fallen.

In 1798, an <a href="undeclared%20war">undeclared war</a> had begun between the United States and France due to French seizures of American <a href="Cargo%20ship">merchantmen</a>. As part of an American effort to deter French attacks, Commodore <a href="Thomas%20Truxton">Thomas Truxton</a> led an American <a href="naval%20squadron">naval squadron</a> that was dispatched to the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. Learning that regular French naval forces were in the region, Truxton set out in his <a href="flagship">flagship</a> "Constellation" and sailed to <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> to engage them. On 1 February 1800, while nearing the French colony, "Constellation" met François Marie Pitot's frigate "La Vengeance" of the French Navy. Despite Pitot's attempts to flee, his frigate was drawn into a heavy engagement with "Constellation". Although the French frigate <a href="striking%20the%20colors">struck her colors</a> (surrendered) twice, "Constellation" was unable to take "La Vengeance" as a <a href="prize%20rules">prize</a>. Eventually Pitot was able to escape with his frigate to <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>, though only after sustaining severe casualties and damage to his vessel. Truxton's ship sustained serious damage and sailed to <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> for repairs before returning home to a hero's welcome.

In 1800, the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> between the United States and France was in full force. In order to prevent French attacks against American <a href="Merchant%20vessel">merchantmen</a> in the Caribbean, the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> maintained four <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadrons</a> of vessels in the region. One such squadron was commanded by <a href="commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Thomas%20Truxton">Thomas Truxton</a>, and tasked with patrolling the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. Taking command on 19 January 1800 after arriving at <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a> in his flagship <a href="USS%20Constellation%20%281797%29">USS "Constellation"</a>, Truxton's squadron consisted of four <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s, three <a href="schooner">schooner</a>s, and a <a href="ship%20rig">ship-rigged</a> <a href="Man-of-war">man of war</a>. Besides the numerous <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s operating in the area, the only <a href="French%20Navy">French naval</a> forces in Truxton's area of operations were the frigate <a href="HMS%20Vengeance%20%281800%29">"La Vengeance"</a> under François Marie Pitot and the corvette "La Berceau" under Louis Senes. Both vessels had arrived at <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> on 10 December 1799 escorting the new administrators of the French colony. Once at Saint Kitts Truxton dispersed his squadron, giving each ship orders to cruise independently. He then set sail for Guadeloupe on 30 January 1800 with his flagship "Constellation", intending to challenge the French frigate and corvette there. The same day, Pitot in "La Vengeance" left Guadaloupe's capital of <a href="Basse-Terre">Basse-Terre</a> for France.

By this point in the Quasi-War, the 1,265-ton "Constellation" carried 38 cannon despite officially being classified by the United States Navy as a 36-gun frigate. Previously her armament had consisted of 24-pounder guns, but these had proven inefficient during Truxton's <a href="USS%20Constellation%20vs%20L%27Insurgente">action with "L'Insurgente"</a> and as a result were removed and replaced with twenty-eight 18-pounder cannon and ten 24-pounder <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s. Truxton and his crew were hardened veterans and were well prepared for a fight. Their French counterparts were not as ready for an engagement. Pitot's frigate was carrying a large quantity of <a href="Bullion%20coin">specie</a> as well as 36 American <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> and 80 passengers, two of whom were generals. Under such circumstances Pitot intended to avoid an engagement if possible, even though "La Vengeance" was a more heavily armed vessel carrying eight 42-pounder carronades, twenty-eight 18-pounders, and sixteen 12-pounder cannon. The French also had a distinct advantage in the event of a <a href="boarding%20action">boarding action</a>, as "Constellation" had only 310 men to "La Vengeance's" complement of 380 crew.

On 1 February 1800 at 07:00, Truxton's crew spotted what appeared to be a 54-gun frigate flying British colors two leagues off the Basse-Terre <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a>. In an effort to communicate with the mysterious frigate, "Constellation" flew <a href="British%20ensign">British colors</a>. Pitot had sighted the American ship by 07:45. Thinking the vessel chasing him was a superior 55-gun warship, he sought to avoid conflict, and continued to sail with the wind rather than head north as he had originally intended. In an effort to increase her speed, the French frigate's crew put out <a href="studding%20sail">studding sail</a>s to catch more wind. The behavior of Pitot's frigate signaled to Truxton that she was really a French warship, so he ordered "Constellation" cleared for action and gave chase. By 08:00 he struck the British colors and raised the American flag. As he closed with "La Vengeance" he shouted through a <a href="speaking%20trumpet">speaking trumpet</a> for the French vessel to surrender.

At this point the action began, with Pitot's <a href="stern%20chaser">stern chaser</a>s opening fire upon "Constellation". In an effort to cut the American frigate's advantage in speed, "La Vengeance" changed course to the south-east where the wind would give her an advantage. As he maneuvered his vessel, Pitot was able to unleash a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> aimed at "Constellation"s <a href="rigging">rigging</a>. The American frigate waited to return fire until she'd gained the <a href="weather%20gage">weather gage</a>. Now having the advantage of the wind, Truxton's opening <a href="double-shotted">double-shotted</a> broadside slammed into the port side of "La Vengeance"s hull. Sailing side by side, the two frigates continued to engage each other for two and a half hours while Truxton attempted unsuccessfully to move his ship into a <a href="raking%20fire">raking fire</a> position. As the French tended to aim for the rigging, at one point "Constellation"s foresails were shot away and the frigate lost her maneuverability until they could be replaced.

"La Vengeance" prepared for a <a href="boarding%20action">boarding action</a> when the two frigates drew closer together at 22:45, but this attempt was foiled when "Constellation" fired broadsides of <a href="grapeshot">grapeshot</a> at Pitot's ship while <a href="American%20Marines">American marines</a> fired their <a href="musket">musket</a>s and hurled <a href="grenade">grenade</a>s down from the rigging. With the French ship drawing off, the two vessels began a longer range <a href="round%20shot">round shot</a> duel that lasted until 02:00 on 2 February 1800, when "La Vengeance" <a href="striking%20the%20colors">struck her colors</a> for the second time. At some point earlier in the action, Pitot had struck his flag but the Americans did not notice because of darkness. Truxton moved "Constellation" to within of his vanquished opponent aiming to take her as a prize. The American commodore's ambitions were spoiled when at 03:00 "Constellation's" mainmast fell overboard, killing several <a href="Captain%20of%20the%20Top">topmen</a> who went down with it. With the Americans unable to come alongside his vessel, Pitot took advantage of the situation and simply slipped away into the darkness.

Casualties were heavy on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor condition that each commander thought he had sunk his opponent. Most of "La Vengeance" rigging had been blown away; only the lower <a href="foremast">foremast</a>, lower <a href="mizzenmast">mizzenmast</a>, and <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao and was forced to ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. "La Vengeance" remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A <a href="Siege%20of%20Cura%C3%A7ao">French expedition to seize the island</a> brought the <a href="materiel">materiel</a> needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.

"Constellation" had suffered heavy damage with 15 of her crew slain and a further 25 wounded, of whom 11 later died. The ship sailed to <a href="Port%20Royal%2C%20Jamaica">Port Royal, Jamaica</a>, for a refit,
but Truxton could not complete the necessary repairs because of a shortage of <a href="naval%20stores">naval stores</a>. The ship left Jamaica a week after she arrived, with only her mainmast replaced. After escorting a convoy of 14 merchantmen back to the United States, Truxton sailed his battered frigate to <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> for a proper refit. Only after he returned to the United States did the American commodore finally learn that the "La Vengeance" had not been sunk. Truxton was considered a hero and received considerable praise for his actions. In response to his battle with Pitot's frigate, the American government commended Truxton with a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a> depicting the battle. <a href="James%20C.%20Jarvis">James C. Jarvis</a>, a 13-year-old Midshipman who was killed when the mainmast collapsed, became famous for his bravery during the battle.
