Mucho Macho Man

Mucho Macho Man (<a href="foal">foal</a>ed June 15, 2008) is a retired American <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> <a href="racehorse">racehorse</a> notable as the winner of the 2013 <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic">Breeders' Cup Classic</a>. He was foaled in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and named after the <a href="Village%20People">Village People</a> song "<a href="Macho%20Man%20%28song%29">Macho Man</a>". His <a href="horse%20breeding">breeders</a> were Carole and John Rio of Florida, who owned his <a href="Mare">dam</a>. His foalhood nickname was "<a href="Lazarus%20of%20Bethany">Lazarus</a>" because he appeared lifeless at birth, but spontaneously revived. He grew to be a very large horse, standing over high. Throughout most of his racing career, Mucho Macho Man was primarily owned by Dean and Patti Reeves of <a href="Reeves%20Thoroughbred%20Racing">Reeves Thoroughbred Racing</a> of <a href="Suwanee%2C%20Georgia">Suwanee, Georgia</a>. They purchased a <a href="Controlling%20interest">majority interest</a> in him after his first race in 2010, and in 2012 became his sole owners. In February 2014, <a href="Frank%20Stronach">Frank Stronach</a> purchased an undisclosed share in the horse on behalf of his <a href="Adena%20Springs%20Farms">Adena Springs Farms</a>, owner of Mucho Macho Man's sire, <a href="Macho%20Uno">Macho Uno</a>. The <a href="stallion">stallion</a> now lives at Adena Springs and began to stand <a href="stud%20farm">at stud</a> in the 2015 breeding season.

When Dean and Patti Reeves purchased the horse, they placed him with <a href="horse%20trainer">horse trainer</a> Tim Ritvo, who shortly thereafter began a job with <a href="Gulfstream%20Park">Gulfstream Park</a>. Training duties were turned over to Tim's wife and fellow trainer <a href="Katherine%20Ritvo">Kathy Ritvo</a>, who trained Mucho Macho Man from his fourth race on. His racing career was supported by a close-knit team, led by Ritvo and the Reeves as well as Reeves' racing manager Finn Green. Mucho Macho Man was ridden in races by several top <a href="jockey">jockey</a>s, including <a href="Rajiv%20Maragh">Rajiv Maragh</a>, <a href="Ramon%20Dominguez">Ramon Dominguez</a>, <a href="Mike%20E.%20Smith">Mike Smith</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Prado">Edgar Prado</a> and <a href="Gary%20Stevens%20%28jockey%29">Gary Stevens</a>.

Because Mucho Macho Man was born late in the year for a Thoroughbred foal, as a growing two- and three-year-old he had to compete against horses that were several months older and more mature. He was also very tall, and as a young racehorse sometimes got in his own way; as a three-year-old, he stepped on his front feet with his hind feet and tore off a <a href="horseshoe">horseshoe</a> in two different races. In 2011, he competed in all three <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing">Triple Crown</a> races, coming in third in the <a href="Kentucky%20Derby">Kentucky Derby</a>. Following a five-month layoff due to surgery that addressed a problem with his <a href="Respiratory%20system%20of%20the%20horse">breathing</a>, he returned to the track in November 2011 with a win, won three <a href="graded%20stakes%20race">graded stakes race</a>s in 2012, and finished a close second to <a href="Fort%20Larned%20%28horse%29">Fort Larned</a> in that year's Breeders' Cup Classic.

In 2013, after overcoming a respiratory virus early in the year, he ran two races on the east coast, finishing third both times, and then was shipped early to <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Park">Santa Anita Park</a> to prepare for that year's Breeders' Cup. He won a preparatory race, the <a href="Awesome%20Again%20Stakes">Awesome Again Stakes</a>, his seventh win overall and his first <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">Grade I</a> win. This qualified him for the <a href="2013%20Breeders%27%20Cup">2013 Breeders' Cup</a> Classic, which he won, narrowly defeating <a href="Will%20Take%20Charge">Will Take Charge</a> and <a href="Declaration%20of%20War%20%28horse%29">Declaration of War</a>. His success earned him the <a href="Secretariat%20Vox%20Populi%20Award">Secretariat Vox Populi Award</a> and the <a href="National%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20Association%20Moment%20of%20the%20Year">National Thoroughbred Racing Association Moment of the Year</a> as well as two <a href="Eclipse%20Award">Eclipse Award</a> nominations and 2013 Florida-bred Horse of the Year. Sportswriter <a href="Steve%20Haskin">Steve Haskin</a>, who followed the horse's career for "<a href="The%20Blood-Horse">The Blood-Horse</a>", stated that the saga "provided enough uplifting human interest stories to fill a book". Mucho Macho Man returned to the track in January 2014 with a decisive win in the Sunshine Millions Classic, but finished fourth in the <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Handicap">Santa Anita Handicap</a>. He remained in training, still essentially sound, but following the discovery of bruising on his <a href="fetlock">fetlock</a>s and other signs of "wear and tear", he was retired in July 2014.

Mucho Macho Man is a <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> horse with <a href="Horse%20markings">white markings</a> that include a <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star and stripe</a> on his face, a <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">sock</a> on his left hind leg, and a <a href="Horse%20markings%23Leg%20markings">coronet</a> on his front right leg. He stands over high. He was sired by Macho Uno, who won the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Juvenile">Breeders' Cup Juvenile</a> and was named <a href="American%20Champion%20Two-Year-Old%20Colt">American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt</a> in 2000. Macho Uno was a son of <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> champion <a href="Holy%20Bull">Holy Bull</a>. Mucho Macho Man's dam is the 2001 Anoakia Stakes winner Ponche de Leona. Both sire and dam were owned by Frank Stronach's Adena Springs Farms at the time of mating; the pregnant mare was subsequently purchased by John and Carole Rio of Florida, where Mucho Macho Man was <a href="foal">foal</a>ed, and thus the Rios are officially listed as his breeders. Mucho Macho Man was Ponche de Leona's second foal and was born extremely late in the foaling season on June 15, 2008; this meant that as a two- and three-year-old, not yet fully grown, he had to compete on equal terms with horses who were as much as five months older than he.

Ponche de Leona delivered Mucho Macho Man three weeks after her due date. At birth, the foal was lifeless with no heartbeat. Farm staff tried to revive him by massaging and shaking him. He was unresponsive for several minutes, then his eyes opened and he "just got up and galloped away". As a result, his foalhood nickname was "Lazarus". In addition to being a late foal, he was very big and hence slow to reach full development. Because the young horse was so tall and skinny, John Rio called him "<a href="Hugh%20Brannum">Mr. Green Jeans</a>", though no one else did. His official name is derived from the <a href="Village%20People">Village People</a> song "<a href="Macho%20Man%20%28song%29">Macho Man</a>", and owner Dean Reeves' nickname for him is "Macho".

The Rios sold the horse as a two-year-old to Jim Culver of Dream Team One Racing Stable, keeping an ownership share for themselves. After Mucho Macho Man's first race in 2010, a majority share in the <a href="Colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> was purchased by Dean and Patti Reeves, owners of Reeves Thoroughbred Racing of Suwanee, Georgia, near <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta</a>. When the Reeves purchased their controlling interest, he was sent into training with Tim Ritvo, but when Ritvo was appointed director of racing at <a href="Gulfstream%20Park">Gulfstream Park</a> in Florida, the conditioning of the colt was turned over to his wife and fellow trainer, <a href="Katherine%20Ritvo">Kathy</a>. Jonathan "Finn" Green joined the Reeves' program as racing manager in September 2011.

Mucho Macho Man overcame several health issues in 2011 and 2013. He had surgery to address a <a href="Respiratory%20system%20of%20the%20horse">breathing</a> problem in 2011, and suffered from a respiratory virus and hoof problems, including a <a href="quarter%20crack">quarter crack</a>, in 2013.

Not only did the horse survive near-death in 2008, so did Kathy Ritvo, who had a <a href="heart%20transplant">heart transplant</a> in November 2008. She was diagnosed with <a href="cardiomyopathy">cardiomyopathy</a> in 2001, limiting her horse training career. By 2008 her condition deteriorated to the point where she was hospitalized for several months, and she was near death when an organ became available. Less than six months after transplant surgery, she returned to training race horses. In a 2011 interview, she compared her own rapid recovery to the spontaneous recovery of the horse as a foal, and stated, "from the moment I opened my eyes [following surgery], I felt fantastic. He's Mucho Macho Man and I'm Macho Woman."
In 2012, Reeves Thoroughbred Racing bought out Dream Team One's 30-percent interest and became the sole owners of Mucho Macho Man. Later, Mike and Laura Sivo obtained a minority share. Also in 2012, the team added a permanent exercise rider to their roster: Ritvo's nephew, former jockey Nick Petro, Jr. Petro actually rode Mucho Macho Man more than anyone else. A strong support staff also worked consistently with the horse, including assistant trainer Marcelino Valencia, stable <a href="horse%20groom">groom</a> Valietal Tapia, and <a href="hot%20walker">hot walker</a> Karina Lopez. The horse's <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23C">connections</a> remained unchanged through 2013. In February 2014, anticipating the stallion's future retirement to a <a href="Stud%20farm">stud career</a> after the 2014 season, Adena Springs Farms purchased an interest in Mucho Macho Man, but he remained in training with the same team and raced under Reeves' <a href="Jockey%23Racing%20colors">colors</a>. Frank Stronach, noting that Adena arranged the mating between Macho Uno and Ponche de Leona, described the sale as "a homecoming of sorts".

Mucho Macho Man was given his basic <a href="horse%20training">start under saddle</a> by Carole and John Rio. Still tall and lanky, he was sent to Bill White for race training, with Carole telling the trainer, "physically this horse is late, but mentally he's way ahead." Throughout his racing career, Mucho Macho Man has been described as a generally calm horse with a good temperament, a "happy" horse who "likes his job", "businesslike" and easy to <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23R">rate</a>. However, he disliked being <a href="whip">whip</a>ped, and was notorious for his dislike of wet conditions, performing poorly when asked to run in the mud; his worst races were on sloppy tracks. Though viewed as "laid back", he was generally very fast out of the <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate</a>, which caused him problems twice in his three-year-old season when he tore off a front <a href="horseshoe">horseshoe</a> by stepping on his own front heels with his hind feet. Ritvo said "I think he's so excited to get out of the gate that he's springing before his front feet are gone." His quickness out of the gate, described by one of his jockeys as akin to that of a <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">Quarter Horse</a>, became an asset once he matured. <a href="Steve%20Haskin">Steve Haskin</a> noted that the horse was undefeated whenever he had the lead by the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23E">eighth pole</a> but had never won when he did not.

Mucho Macho Man first raced at <a href="Calder%20Race%20Course">Calder Race Course</a>. He was scratched by the track <a href="veterinarian">veterinarian</a> from the first race into which he was entered; he had been slightly injured when the horse next to him <a href="rearing%20%28horse%29">reared</a> and flipped over in the starting gate. He was entered in another race a week later, a <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> in which he finished second, losing to a colt named Gourmet Dinner. After that race, Mucho Macho Man was purchased by Reeves Thoroughbred Racing. Dean and Patti Reeves had considered purchasing Gourmet Dinner, but Dean Reeves recalled saying at the time, "Call me crazy, but I like the second horse." After the sale, Tim Ritvo took over the training of Mucho Macho Man from his original trainer, Bill White. The colt came in third at his next race, at <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga</a> in New York state; he won his first race on September 19, 2010, at <a href="Monmouth%20Park%20Racetrack">Monmouth Park</a> in New Jersey. After that race, the colt's training was turned over to Kathy Ritvo when Tim began working for Gulfstream Park. In November 2010, Mucho Macho Man moved up to <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">graded class</a> and finished second behind To Honor and Serve twice in a row at <a href="Aqueduct%20Racetrack">Aqueduct Racetrack</a> in New York City, first in the <a href="Nashua%20Stakes">Nashua Stakes</a> and then in the <a href="Remsen%20Stakes">Remsen Stakes</a>. Throughout his two-year-old year the young horse was easily distracted, so he raced with <a href="Blinders">blinkers</a> for both White and Ritvo.

Mucho Macho Man began his second year of racing by finishing fourth behind winner Dialed In in the Grade III <a href="Holy%20Bull%20Stakes">Holy Bull Stakes</a> at Gulfstream Park, and once again finished behind Gourmet Dinner, who was third. Mucho Macho Man was then sent to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> for the <a href="Risen%20Star%20Stakes">Risen Star Stakes</a> at the <a href="Fair%20Grounds%20Race%20Course">Fair Grounds Race Course</a>. Ridden by <a href="Rajiv%20Maragh">Rajiv Maragh</a>, he recorded his first graded stakes win, prevailing by one and a half lengths over Santiva. Ritvo took away the blinkers for a workout prior to the race and kept them off, stating that the colt had matured and was more at ease without them. At the Risen Star, he first came to the notice of one of his future jockeys, <a href="Gary%20Stevens%20%28jockey%29">Gary Stevens</a>, then a <a href="sports%20analyst">sports analyst</a>, who noted the colt's calm demeanor, describing him as "a chilled out customer... very relaxed". The next race was the <a href="Louisiana%20Derby">Louisiana Derby</a>, a major preparatory race for the <a href="Kentucky%20Derby">Kentucky Derby</a>. In that race, he lost his right front horseshoe at the start when he "grabbed a quarter"—tearing off the shoe and a bit of his hoof when he stepped on the heel of his front foot with one of his back feet. He finished third behind Pants on Fire and Nehro.

Before he was a full 36 calendar months old, Mucho Macho Man contested all three legs of the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%23United%20States%20Triple%20Crowns">American Triple Crown</a>. He finished third to <a href="Animal%20Kingdom%20%28horse%29">Animal Kingdom</a> and Nehro in the Kentucky Derby. He was described as having a "babyish look" prior to the Derby, and Ritvo said that he was still growing, but Stevens noted during the Derby's television broadcast, "when he fills into this frame, he's going to be a big, powerful horse." Mucho Macho Man was sixth behind <a href="Shackleford%20%28horse%29">Shackleford</a> in the <a href="2011%20Preakness%20Stakes">Preakness</a>. At the start, he again tore off a shoe, this time from his left front hoof, even though Ritvo had switched him to glued-on horseshoes. The misstep may have accounted for his low placing. Before the <a href="Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont</a>, Ritvo brought in a <a href="farrier">farrier</a> specialist, who gave the horse custom made glued-on horseshoes made of a wire-framed synthetic composite and who also squared off the toes of Mucho Macho Man's hind shoes to make it harder for him to accidentally step on his front heels. At the Belmont, <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20A.%20Dom%C3%ADnguez">Ramon Dominguez</a> took over from Maragh as the colt's jockey, and went on to ride him for a total of five races. That day, the track was sloppy and the horse ran seventh behind winner <a href="Ruler%20on%20Ice">Ruler on Ice</a>. After the Belmont, he did not race for several months because he needed surgery to fix a problem with his breathing.

In September, Finn Green, a recovering alcoholic with his own story of triumph over adversity, began working for Reeves. A knowledgeable horseman, Green insisted that as a condition of employment he had the right to advocate for what was best for a horse under his management, even if that meant expressing disagreement and imposing "tough love" on the owners. He and Ritvo saw eye to eye on Mucho Macho Man, and they began planning the colt's return to the track. After a break of almost five months, Mucho Macho Man raced in November and won an <a href="allowance%20race">allowance race</a> at Aqueduct, beginning a three-race winning streak. He had lost his "babyish" look, put on weight, and as Ritvo put it, "His shoulders [caught] up with his behind." Ritvo and Green then mapped out a 2012 workout and racing schedule for Mucho Macho Man, intending to run him every six to ten weeks with recovery time after each race.

For his four-year-old debut, Mucho Macho Man ran at Gulfstream Park, defeating <a href="Ron%20the%20Greek">Ron the Greek</a> in the <a href="Sunshine%20Millions%20Classic">Sunshine Millions Classic</a>, a race restricted to horses bred in Florida or California. He had finally grown into his tall frame. Dominguez returned as his jockey and was pleased with what he saw, saying, "You can really tell how much he's grown up since I rode him in the Belmont. Back then, he was just a big skinny horse that had a lot of maturing to do. Now he looks like he's grown up and has everything figured out." Dominguez further described him as "forward" out of the gate and said the race was an "easy" win. He raced again in March, winning the Grade II <a href="Gulfstream%20Park%20Handicap">Gulfstream Park Handicap</a> by two <a href="Horse%20length">lengths</a>. In May at <a href="Churchill%20Downs">Churchill Downs</a>, he finished third behind Successful Dan and <a href="Fort%20Larned">Fort Larned</a> in the Grade II <a href="Alysheba%20Stakes">Alysheba Stakes</a>, carrying top weight of . His next race was the Grade II <a href="Suburban%20Handicap">Suburban Handicap</a> at <a href="Belmont%20Park">Belmont Park</a> on July 7. Ridden for the first time by <a href="Mike%20Smith%20%28jockey%29">Mike Smith</a>, who was his jockey for the remainder of the year, he took the lead in the straight and won by 2.5 lengths. It was considered his most significant win of the year. In the <a href="Woodward%20Stakes">Woodward Stakes</a> at Saratoga on September 1, he finished second by a neck, having been pushed toward the outside of the track by the winner, To Honor and Serve, in the final <a href="furlong">furlong</a>. On November 3, Mucho Macho Man was one of twelve horses to contest the Breeders' Cup Classic at Santa Anita in California. Starting at <a href="Parimutuel%20betting">odds of 6–1</a>, he was always in the first two and finished second, half a length behind Fort Larned. There was a -length gap back to the other runners, who included <a href="Flat%20Out%20%28horse%29">Flat Out</a>, <a href="Game%20On%20Dude">Game On Dude</a>, To Honor and Serve, and Ron The Greek. He ended the year seventh in the nation for total race earnings, and tied for thirteenth in the <a href="World%20Thoroughbred%20Rankings">World Thoroughbred Rankings</a>.

Mucho Macho Man began his 2013 season by running again in the Sunshine Millions Classic, but the track was sloppy, and on this occasion he was pulled up in the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23H">homestretch</a> and placed last in the race. As the horse was not visibly lame, jockey Smith told Ritvo, "It's gotta be something inside." Though speculation was that he simply did not like the wet track, shortly thereafter he was diagnosed with a respiratory virus. He also developed a quarter crack in his hoof and spent the rest of the spring recuperating at <a href="Fair%20Hill%20Training%20Center">Fair Hill Training Center</a> in Maryland.

In June, he returned to the track. Ridden by <a href="Edgar%20Prado">Edgar Prado</a>, he started as the odds-on favorite for the Criminal Type Stakes at Belmont Park but finished third of the five runners. On August 3, he finished third to Cross Traffic and Successful Dan in the <a href="Whitney%20Handicap">Whitney Handicap</a> at Saratoga, with Ron The Greek fourth and Fort Larned fifth. It was at this time that his proclivity to win only when in front at the eighth pole was first commented upon in the racing press. He was once again entered in the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga on August 31, but Ritvo scratched him on the day of the race due to the wet track, described as a "sea of slop".

Ritvo then moved Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park almost two months before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he "thrived" in California. It was a major commitment for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and the best we can do for Macho." The horse's next race was the <a href="Awesome%20Again%20Stakes">Awesome Again Stakes</a> at Santa Anita on September 28. Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed <a href="Seabiscuit">Seabiscuit</a>'s jockey <a href="George%20Woolf">George Woolf</a> in the <a href="Seabiscuit%20%28movie%29">eponymous film</a>, Ritvo later joked, "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by lengths over <a href="Paynter%20%28horse%29">Paynter</a>. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. The victory was also a "win and you're in" qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.
On November 2, Mucho Macho Man contested his second Breeders' Cup Classic and was the second favorite at 4–1 in a strong field that included Game On Dude (the favorite), Paynter, <a href="Palace%20Malice">Palace Malice</a>, Fort Larned, <a href="Will%20Take%20Charge">Will Take Charge</a> and Flat Out, as well as the European challenger <a href="Declaration%20of%20War%20%28horse%29">Declaration of War</a>. The horse broke quickly from the gate and took the lead, but Stevens decided to settle him just behind the leaders before going to the outside and moving to the front on the final turn. In the closing stages, he held off two strong late challenges to win by a slim nose over second-place finisher Will Take Charge and by a head over third-place finisher, the European contender Declaration of War. After Mucho Macho Man's victory, the 50-year-old Stevens, winning the Classic for the first time after 14 previous attempts, said, "this was a tremendous experience to win this race... It's the icing on the cake of my career." Ritvo was credited with a "super" job of training the horse. In a moment of <a href="synchronicity">synchronicity</a>, actress <a href="Elizabeth%20Banks">Elizabeth Banks</a>, who co-starred with Stevens in "Seabiscuit", playing <a href="Charles%20S.%20Howard">Marcella Howard</a>, presented the Breeders' Cup Classic trophy.

In December, Mucho Macho Man was awarded the 2013 Secretariat Vox Populi Award, recognizing the struggles the horse had overcome in reaching success, also noting the accomplishments of his connections, including trainer Ritvo's success overcoming her own health issues to train him and Stevens' comeback from retirement. Dean and Patti Reeves stated, "It is a great honor to think that a horse with such humble beginnings could intertwine the lives and stories of so many people, and tug at the heartstrings of racing fans from all over the world." At the end of 2013, Mucho Macho Man was the number one-ranked horse for the year in North American purse winnings, higher than rivals Will Take Charge and Game On Dude as well as the other two top five contenders <a href="Orb%20%28horse%29">Orb</a> and <a href="Wise%20Dan">Wise Dan</a>. He was also nominated for two <a href="Eclipse%20Awards">Eclipse Awards</a>, Horse of the Year and Older Male Horse, but finished second in both categories to Wise Dan. 

He was named Florida-bred Horse of the Year for 2013, noting that he was only the third Florida-bred horse to win the Classic, after <a href="Unbridled">Unbridled</a> and <a href="Skip%20Away">Skip Away</a>. In the 2013 <a href="World%27s%20Best%20Racehorse%20Rankings">World's Best Racehorse Rankings</a>, Mucho Macho Man was given a rating of 125, the best horse in the world running solely on dirt, a five-way tie as the seventh-best racehorse in the world, and tied with Animal Kingdom as the second-best racehorse in North America, behind Wise Dan. His win in the Classic was also selected as the <a href="National%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20Association">National Thoroughbred Racing Association</a>'s "Moment of the Year". Participation in the online polling for that award, up by more than 50 percent from the previous year, was believed to be largely due to the popularity of Mucho Macho Man and the people around him.

In December 2013, Ritvo and Green confirmed that Mucho Macho Man would return to race as a six-year-old, and their goal for the horse was to "target the Breeders' Cup again". Though presumed full-grown, he still had continued to fill out from the previous year. Ritvo announced that the horse would begin his racing season for a third time with the Sunshine Millions Classic, if the track was dry. On January 18, 2014, Ritvo and the horse got a clear day and a fast track. Mucho Macho Man won the six-horse race by 14 lengths. The field included his former nemesis, Gourmet Dinner, who finished fifth. Stevens returned as his jockey and stated, "I geared him down at the end to try not to overdo it."

His connections next entered him in the Santa Anita Handicap, nicknamed the "Big 'Cap", on March 8, returning to California rather than shipping him overseas to run in the $10 million <a href="Dubai%20World%20Cup">Dubai World Cup</a> later that month, again stating that they considered it to be best for the horse. With the announcement that Will Take Charge was also coming to California, the 2014 race became the most highly anticipated running since the matchup of <a href="Alysheba">Alysheba</a> and <a href="Ferdinand%20%28horse%29">Ferdinand</a> in 1988, the only other time that the previous year's Breeders' Cup top two finishers returned to challenge one another at the Santa Anita Handicap. Additional interest came from the return of Game On Dude, who won the Big 'Cap in 2011 and 2013. Mucho Macho Man was assigned the highest <a href="%3Awikt%3Aimpost">impost</a> at . Will Take Charge was assigned and Game on Dude, . Eight horses entered, with Mucho Macho Man the <a href="morning%20line">morning line</a> favorite. Game On Dude, described as "on fire" that day, won the race and broke the stakes record in doing so, Will Take Charge was second, but Mucho Macho Man started to lose energy at the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">three-eighths pole</a> and finished fourth behind Blingo. Ritvo had no excuses for his finish, noting only that he had missed a few training days due to rain, and the extra moisture had also changed the condition of the Santa Anita track. On May 1, 2014, Georgia Governor <a href="Nathan%20Deal">Nathan Deal</a> proclaimed Mucho Macho Man Day in the state of Georgia, recognizing the accomplishments of the horse and the attention he and his owners brought to Georgia.

He returned to Florida for training after the Big 'Cap, but after performing poorly in a June workout was found to have some bruising of his <a href="fetlock">fetlock</a>s, and was given lighter duty. On July 15 it was announced that Mucho Macho Man was officially retired from racing and would stand at stud at Adena Springs beginning in the 2015 breeding year. In a further twist of synchronicity, in the same week Stevens announced he was taking a break from race riding due to the need for a total <a href="knee%20replacement">knee replacement</a>. Ritvo explained that Mucho Macho Man was sound, but "[a]fter five seasons of training and racing, he shows signs of some minor wear and tear. He is still sound and happy, but we have decided that it is in his best interests to retire him. He has nothing more to prove to any of us."

Mucho Macho Man is sired by Macho Uno, who <a href="stud%20farm">stands at stud</a> at Adena Springs Farms in Kentucky. , Macho Uno had sired 38 stakes winners. Besides Mucho Macho Man, they include: Potesta, winner of the <a href="Hollywood%20Oaks">Hollywood Oaks</a>; <a href="Macho%20Again">Macho Again</a>; and Wicked Style. Macho Uno is a son of Holy Bull, who was the 1994 <a href="American%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">American Horse of the Year</a>, and Breeders' Cup Classic winner <a href="Awesome%20Again">Awesome Again</a> is a half-brother to Macho Uno; both horses were <a href="Glossary%20of%20equestrian%20terms%23O">out of</a> the mare Primal Force. The sire line of Mucho Macho Man traces back to the 1898 Kentucky Derby winner, <a href="Plaudit">Plaudit</a>. Because Macho Uno carries no lines to stallions <a href="Northern%20Dancer">Northern Dancer</a>, <a href="Seattle%20Slew">Seattle Slew</a>, <a href="Hail%20to%20Reason">Hail to Reason</a>, or <a href="In%20Reality">In Reality</a>, who commonly appear in Thoroughbred pedigrees, he is valued as a near-total <a href="outcross">outcross</a> for most Thoroughbred <a href="mare">mare</a>s in North America.

Mucho Macho Man's dam is stakes-winning Ponche de Leona, whose pedigree is not particularly well known. Her sire, Ponche, won five stakes races and sired five stakes winners. Her dam won one race in 19 starts. Mucho Macho Man thus has very little <a href="linebreeding">linebreeding</a>; only a 4×4 cross to the sire <a href="Mr.%20Prospector">Mr. Prospector</a>, meaning that this horse appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree. Ponche de Leona was purchased at the <a href="Keeneland">Keeneland</a> sale in November 2007 by John and Carole Rio for $33,000 when <a href="Pregnant">in foal</a> with Mucho Macho Man, the relatively low price partly owing to having been bred late in the year; late foals are difficult to sell. However, by November 2011, after the success of Mucho Macho Man in his three-year-old year, and in foal to Macho Uno again, the Rios resold her at Keeneland for $300,000. Following Mucho Macho Man's Breeders' Cup win in 2013, and having also produced the stakes-placed Mucho Man's Gold, she was again sold at the Keeneland January 2014 sale, this time in foal to <a href="Distorted%20Humor">Distorted Humor</a>, bringing $775,000. In 2013, she was named Florida broodmare of the year by the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders' and Owners' Association.

Nyon Conference

The Nyon Conference was a <a href="diplomatic%20conference">diplomatic conference</a> held in <a href="Nyon">Nyon</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> in September 1937 to address attacks on international <a href="shipping">shipping</a> in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The conference was convened in part because <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Italy</a> had been carrying out <a href="unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a>, although the final conference agreement did not accuse Italy directly; instead, the attacks were referred to as "piracy" by an unidentified body. Italy was not officially at war, nor did any <a href="submarine">submarine</a> identify itself. The conference was designed to strengthen <a href="non-intervention%20in%20the%20Spanish%20Civil%20War">non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War</a>. The <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a> led the conference, which was also attended by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>.

The first agreement, signed on 14 September 1937, included plans to counterattack aggressive submarines. Naval patrols were established; the United Kingdom and France were to patrol most of the western Mediterranean and parts of the east, and the other signatories were to patrol their own waters. Italy was to be allowed to join the agreement and patrol the <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a> if it wished. A second agreement followed three days later, applying similar provisions to surface ships. Italy and <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> did not attend, although the former took up naval patrols in November. In marked contrast to the actions of the <a href="Non-Intervention%20Committee">Non-Intervention Committee</a> and the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>, this conference succeeded in preventing attacks by submarines. 

Nyon has been characterised as 'an appeasers paradise. The fiction that attacks on merchant shipping in the Mediterranean was the fault of 'pirates unknown' was fully indulged. [It] preserved the naval status quo in the Mediterranean until the end of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>: the <a href="Francoists">Francoists</a> received whatever they wanted, the Republicans got very little.'

The <a href="Non-Intervention%20Committee">Non-Intervention Committee</a>, a group of twenty-four nations set up in 1936 and based in <a href="London">London</a>, had attempted to restrict the flow of weapons to the parties of the Spanish Civil War. For the United Kingdom, it formed part of the policy of appeasement towards <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Italy</a> and aimed at preventing a <a href="proxy%20war">proxy war</a> – with Italy and Germany supporting <a href="National%20Faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Franco's Nationalist Coalition</a> on one side and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> supporting the <a href="Republican%20Faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">Republican faction</a> on the other – from escalating into a major pan-European conflict. An Anglo-Italian "Gentleman's Agreement" had been signed on 2 January 1937, with each party respecting the rights of the other in the Mediterranean and aimed at improving Anglo-Italian relations. In May 1937, <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> succeeded <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> as <a href="British%20Prime%20Minister">British Prime Minister</a>, and adopted a new policy of dealing directly with Germany and Italy. The British believed they could convince Italy to abandon Germany through appeasement.

Under a Non-Intervention Committee plan, neutral observers were posted to Spanish ports and borders. The plan also assigned zones of patrol to the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy, and patrols began in April. Following attacks on the German cruiser "<a href="German%20cruiser%20Leipzig">Leipzig</a>" on 15 and 18 June, Germany and Italy withdrew from the patrols. The United Kingdom and France offered to replace Germany and Italy in patrols of their sections, but the latter powers believed these patrols would be too partial. The <a href="British%20Admiralty">British Admiralty</a> proposed four plans in response to attacks on British shipping, favouring sending significant naval resources to the Mediterranean as the best solution; previous control measures had been widely evaded. As suspected by the other powers, Italy was behind some of these attacks. Whilst officially being at peace, the Italian leadership had ordered the commencement of <a href="unrestricted%20submarine%20warfare">unrestricted submarine warfare</a>, referred to in discussion as a campaign of <a href="piracy">piracy</a> without mention of Italy. These plans would be the basis for a Mediterranean meeting, suggested by French Foreign Minister <a href="Yvon%20Delbos">Yvon Delbos</a>. Meanwhile, on the night of 31 August to 1 September, the Italian submarine <a href="Italian%20submarine%20Iride">"Iride"</a> unsuccessfully attacked the British destroyer <a href="HMS%20Havock%20%28H43%29">"Havock"</a> with torpedoes, between the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Valencia">Gulf of Valencia</a> and the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>, strengthening <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">British Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>'s sceptical stance towards Italy. The attack led the British representative in Rome to protest to the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, but without response.

Up to 60,000 Italian volunteers were now operating in Spain, and the removal of foreign nationals was discussed by the Non-Intervention Committee. Italy had made a declaration that it would stop Italian volunteers from fighting in Spain on 7 January 1937, and put a <a href="Moratorium%20%28law%29">moratorium</a> on volunteers on 20 January, also agreeing to support limitations on the number of volunteers on the 25th. Italy continued to request that <a href="belligerent%20rights">belligerent rights</a> be given to the Nationalists and Republicans, so both would gain the <a href="Search%20and%20seizure">right to search</a> vessels for <a href="contraband">contraband</a>, thus removing the need for naval patrols. This request was opposed by the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. British recognition of Italian sovereignty over <a href="Ethiopian%20Empire">Abyssinia</a> following the <a href="Second%20Italo-Abyssinian%20War">Second Italo-Abyssinian War</a> was an important issue during Anglo-Italian discussions in August 1937. Following Eden's disagreement with Chamberlain and <a href="E.%20F.%20L.%20Wood%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Lord Halifax</a>, <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Lords">Leader of the House of Lords</a> and influential politician, over the issue, any agreement recognising Italian sovereignty was postponed until after the planned shipping conference had taken place.

On 5 or 6 September, the British arranged a conference for all parties with a Mediterranean coastline, along with Germany. The conference was to be held at Nyon, Switzerland – Geneva was avoided because Italians associated it with the actions of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> over the <a href="Abyssinian%20Crisis">Abyssinian Crisis</a>. The United Kingdom agreed to France's request to extend an invitation to the Soviet Union, but blocked France's attempt to invite a representative from <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Republican Spain</a>. Portugal expressed surprise at not being invited. <a href="Camille%20Chautemps">Camille Chautemps</a>, the new <a href="French%20Prime%20Minister">French Prime Minister</a>, opposed direct intervention on the Spanish question. The Soviet Union accepted the invitation, indicating that it would use the opportunity to blame Italy for the attacks on shipping. The Soviet government formally accused the Italians of sinking two Soviet merchant vessels, <a href="List%20of%20foreign%20ships%20wrecked%20or%20lost%20in%20the%20Spanish%20Civil%20War%23Soviet%20flag">the "Timiryazev" and the "Blagoev"</a>, an accusation the Italians described as "aggressive and offensive". This was perhaps an attempt by the Soviet Union to push Italy and Germany away from the conference. Germany rejected the invitation, stating that piracy and other issues the conference was to discuss should be handled only by normal meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee, not a conference like Nyon. The United Kingdom and France rejected this suggestion, and continued to prepare for the conference. Soon after, the Italians similarly declined. The Non-Intervention Committee, it said, also had the advantage of including other European powers, notably Poland and Portugal.

 British and French naval staffs rejected the idea of a <a href="Convoy">convoy system</a> in draft proposals. The British wanted to curb submarine activity, on the theory that focusing on covert submarine attacks would help avoid confrontation, whereas the French considered surface vessels and aircraft just as important. The French protested at a plan to create multi-nation squadrons, unhappy at the prospect of French ships coming under foreign command. On 8 September, plans were discussed in the <a href="British%20Cabinet">British Cabinet</a>, including the setting up of eight groups of three <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s for the western Mediterranean. Preliminary talks with the French were held on 9 September, and the conference began on the 10th. Proceedings took two forms: discussions between the British and French, and formal meetings of all attending parties. Many of the other nations opposed the participation of the <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> in the Mediterranean, so the United Kingdom and France agreed to handle <a href="Aegean%20sea">Aegean</a> patrols. This was, perhaps surprisingly, accepted by the Soviet Union.

The conference ended on 14 September with the signing of the "Mediterranean Agreement". Signatories were the countries of Bulgaria, Egypt, France, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the USSR and Yugoslavia. The agreement noted attacks on neutral shipping by submarines, in contravention of the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a> (signed in 1930) and the Submarine Protocol, part of the <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">Second London Naval Treaty</a> (signed in 1936).

The agreement provided that any submarine that attacked neutral shipping was to be sunk if possible, including submarines in the vicinity of a recent attack that were determined to be responsible for the attack. French and British fleets would patrol the seas west of Malta and attack any suspicious submarines, with the division of patrols between the United Kingdom and France to be decided by their governments. Both countries would patrol the <a href="high%20seas">high seas</a> and territorial waters of signatory countries in the Mediterranean. The British would provide slightly more than half the 60 <a href="destroyer%20%28ship%29">destroyer</a>s needed, with the French providing the remainder and most of the accompanying aircraft. It was agreed that Italy could participate in patrols of the <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a> if it wished to do so. In the Eastern Mediterranean, British and French ships would patrol up to the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>, but not in the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>. In this area, signatory countries would patrol their own territorial waters, and would provide any reasonable assistance to the French and British patrols. The future revision of these provisions, including the way the area had been divided into zones, was specifically allowed. Submarine activity would be banned, subject to two exemptions: travel on the surface accompanied by a <a href="surface%20ship">surface ship</a>, and activity in certain areas for training purposes. Governments would only allow foreign submarines into each of their territorial waters in extreme situations, such as immediate distress. Merchant shipping would also be advised to stick to particular <a href="shipping%20route">shipping route</a>s. The agreement repeated the suggestion that Italy join in the proposal. Delbos announced that similar proposals about surface craft would be prepared. The provisions of the agreement would come into force on 20 September. The British and French knew that the secret Italian submarine operations had already been paused, but actions to enforce the conference agreement started at midnight on 19/20 September. The delegates to the agreement were happy; "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" likened them to <a href="cricket">cricket</a>ers, "reviewing their innings, over by over".

The French and British naval staffs moved to Geneva, where a second agreement was signed on 17 September 1937. It extended the rules governing submarine warfare to surface vessels, and had the same signatories. Official versions of both agreements were published in French and English. Several proposals were not implemented: for instance, the British Admiral <a href="Ernle%20Chatfield">Ernle Chatfield</a> wanted the Spanish parties to be able to verify that the flag a ship was displaying was correct, thereby preventing attacks on British shipping if Republican ships continued to use the British flag as a means of escape. This would have benefited the Nationalists, and the French insisted that this provision be dropped. Greece and Turkey wanted ships with a clear identifying mark to be excluded, so as to avoid being forced to fire on a German or Italian warship. This was rejected, but an amendment was made allowing nations to issue their preferred orders in their own territorial waters. A suggestion to fire at any attacking aircraft was easily passed. Another suggestion on surface ships (which incorrectly stated no attack had yet been proven) was eventually toughened with the addition of a clause stating aggressors would be attacked, at the request of the French. A Soviet proposal strengthening the effect of the agreement was made.

Meanwhile, on 13 September, Italy was invited to join in the agreement. Italy unequivocally rejected it, refusing to patrol the <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a>. It demanded "absolute parity" with the United Kingdom and France, meaning the same right of patrol in the Mediterranean. Italy subsequently indicated that its refusal would be reversed if such parity was granted. Meanwhile, on the 15th, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s government sent two submarines to <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>'s <a href="National%20Faction%20%28Spanish%20Civil%20War%29">National Faction</a>. The Soviet Union refused to use routes patrolled by the Italians; the Turks, Greeks and Yugoslavs refused to let the Italians use their ports. A compromise was signed on 30 September, and Italian patrols started on 10 November. The British government, and in particular <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, desired better <a href="Italy-United%20Kingdom%20relations">relations with Italy</a> and these were achieved with the signing of the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20Agreements%20of%201938">Anglo-Italian Agreements of 1938</a>.

The patrols were a strain on the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the provisions were relaxed with French agreement, effective from January. Submarine activity soon returned and full patrols were resumed in early February. On the whole, submarine activity during this period did not amount to much; patrols were again relaxed in May, and the agreement suspended in August. The success of the conference was in marked contrast to the failure of the Non-Intervention Committee. The Nationalists and Italians switched to using air power against shipping; at least one ship was sunk off the Spanish coast by aircraft in the final months of 1937.

In the United Kingdom, Eden described the submarine attacks as savage. He also noted that attacks on submarines would be restricted to suitably extreme circumstances and that the two parties in the war would still not be able to engage neutral vessels. He was keen to avoid an "Anglo-Franco-Soviet bloc". The British press was in favour of the agreement, although "The Times" and "<a href="The%20Guardian%23Spanish%20Civil%20War">The Guardian</a>" expressed some concerns. British historians have tended to see the Nyon Conference as an important stand against aggression, with some reservations. <a href="Christopher%20Seton-Watson">Christopher Seton-Watson</a> describes it as a "diplomatic victory", but Jill Edwards points out that it failed to achieve a change in Italian policy. The agreement created further divisions between Eden as foreign minister and Neville Chamberlain as prime minister.

<a href="Maxim%20Litvinov">Maxim Litvinov</a>, the Soviet representative, was pleased with the outcome. The agreement also allowed for greater military resources to be deployed to the Mediterranean as needed. Litvinov, in particular, stressed the Soviet Union's "indisputable right" to commit naval forces to the Mediterranean (something Germany and Italy had opposed in meetings of the Non-Intervention Committee). He also said he regretted that Spanish merchant shipping had been left out – the other nations believed this would have amounted to formal intervention into the civil war. <a href="Aretas%20Akers-Douglas%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Chilston">Aretas Akers-Bouglas</a>, Viscount Chilston and <a href="List%20of%20Ambassadors%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Russia">British Ambassador to the Soviet Union</a>, reported that the Soviets considered the conference with "tempered satisfaction", and that they claimed credit for their delegation's role.

Elsewhere, French public opinion was strongly in favour of the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left that Republican ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans – on the verge of disaster – were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.

Wipeout 2048

Wipeout 2048 is a <a href="racing%20game">racing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> in which players pilot <a href="anti-gravity">anti-gravity</a> ships around futuristic race tracks. It was developed by <a href="Sony%20Studio%20Liverpool">Sony Studio Liverpool</a> and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a>. A <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a> for the <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, the game was released on 19 January 2012 in Japan and on 22 February in Europe and North America. It is the ninth installment of the <a href="Wipeout%20%28series%29">"Wipeout" series</a> and the last game to be developed by Studio Liverpool before its August 2012 closure. "Wipeout 2048" is a prequel to the first <a href="Wipeout%20%28video%20game%29">game in the series</a>, and is set in the years 2048, 2049, and 2050.

The game was designed as a testbed for the PlayStation Vita. During development, Studio Liverpool staff sent feedback to Sony regarding aspects of the game that could affect the design of the new console. Ideas including a rear touchscreen device and two separate analogue sticks, not originally conceived by Sony, eventually made it onto the console.

"Wipeout 2048" preserves some technical aspects of its predecessor "<a href="Wipeout%20HD">Wipeout HD</a>", including <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>, online multiplayer mode, and <a href="cross-platform%20play">cross-platform play</a> with <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> owners of "Wipeout HD". The game received mainly positive reviews. Critics agreed that its graphics and visuals showcased the power of the then-new PlayStation Vita, but criticised its long loading time and other technical issues.

"Wipeout 2048" is a <a href="racing%20game">racing game</a> which involves players piloting anti-gravity ships through a variety of scenarios. Set primarily in the year 2048, it is a prequel to the <a href="Wipeout%20%28video%20game%29">first instalment</a> of the <a href="Wipeout%20%28series%29">"Wipeout" series</a>; dedicated race tracks have not yet been built, and races are held on city streets. The single-player game progresses through the first three years, 2048, 2049, and 2050, of the AGRC (Anti-Gravity Racing Championships). The game has four types of ships: speed ships, agility ships, fighters and prototypes. Speed ships (lightweight, <a href="Formula%201">Formula 1</a>-like vehicles which emphasise acceleration and momentum) are primarily used for speed-oriented races, such as time trials. Agility ships, similar to <a href="rally%20car">rally car</a>s, have increased manoeuvrability and handling; fighter ships are heavily armoured craft which sacrifice speed for combat power.

Numerous weapons may be picked up during a race by flying over different-coloured weapon pads. Yellow pads equip the player with offensive weaponry to destroy other racers and green pads provide defensive weapons such as mines, shields and speed boosts. Game modes carried over from "<a href="Wipeout%20HD">Wipeout HD</a>" include one-on-one races, tournaments, <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a>s, speed laps, and Zone mode. The latter mode revolves around survival as the player's ship automatically accelerates to extreme speeds.

Online multiplayer mode has the same races and modes as single-player. The game features cross-platform online racing, allowing players of the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> version of "Wipeout HD Fury" to play the "Fury" tracks with the handheld console. The game also features <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC), with two separate DLCs offering twelve tracks and twelve ships each for cross-play.

"Wipeout 2048" was developed by <a href="Sony%20Studio%20Liverpool">Sony Studio Liverpool</a>, known as Psygnosis during the development of the early "Wipeout" games. Studio Liverpool's <a href="technical%20director">technical director</a>, Stuart Lovegrove, affirmed that the game was developed in parallel with the PlayStation Vita and was a testbed for the console. Lovegrove was aware that the next "Wipeout" game would be a <a href="launch%20title">launch title</a>, and said that it was something Studio Liverpool had done before. Chris Roberts, the game's director of graphics, tools and technologies, said that <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> involved the Liverpudlian studio early in the development of the PlayStation Vita and had a "fairly good idea" of the console's capability. Jon Eggleton, former senior artist of the "Wipeout" series, said in an interview that Studio Liverpool influenced the Vita's design. When staff were given <a href="development%20kits">development kits</a> for what was called a "next-generation portable", a group was formed to brainstorm hardware details; proposals included a touchscreen device, not yet conceived by Sony. Eggleton speculated that the console was released with two analogue sticks solely because "Studio Liverpool said it needed two sticks". During early development of "Wipeout 2048" and the PlayStation Vita, the studio provided Sony with feedback on the hardware and <a href="Glossary%20of%20computer%20software%20terms">libraries</a> and sent updated application code to Sony's firmware staff for testing their <a href="compiler">compiler</a>s. Both Lovegrove and Roberts were impressed with the simplicity of the Vita's firmware, in contrast to the architecture of the PlayStation 3.

The development team recognised the differences between creating a game for the PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 3. Lovegrove said that designing the game for the Vita's smaller screen made it easier to develop, alleviating "old problems" with designing a game targeted for an HD screen, but the studio had to ensure that the game could run at any <a href="Image%20resolution">resolution</a>. Roberts agreed, saying that "it [was] less of a headache for artists" who wanted to tweak lighting effects. Asked about major differences between the PlayStation 3's <a href="RSX%20Reality%20Synthesizer">RSX Reality Synthesizer</a> <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processing unit</a> (GPU) and the PlayStation Vita's <a href="ARM%20architecture">ARM architecture</a>, Roberts said that the "most obvious" difference was the Vita's lack of <a href="stream%20processing">stream processing units</a> (SPU). He said that most of "Wipeout HD" SPU code was directed towards GPU support, which included features such as <a href="Hidden%20surface%20determination">geometry culling</a>, lighting effects and <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendering</a>. According to Roberts, the Vita's GPU and ARM architecture were more capable and handled "Wipeout 2048" "very well". Lovegrove, who had worked with ARM architecture on the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a>, said that the team did not have to optimise anything to accomplish their goals and it was enjoyable to see the same architecture running the game.

Although "Wipeout 2048" and "Wipeout HD" have a shared <a href="shader">shader</a> program and did not require retooling for the Vita's <a href="Computer%20architecture">architecture</a>, Roberts said that a "great deal" of time and attention was spent fine-tuning the game's shader effects for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove thought that the method of working on a PlayStation 3 and its handheld counterpart was identical (a sentiment generally shared by the team), and Roberts said that the systems' similarities helped the team "get moving quickly". Roberts added that the game's lighting system was identical to that of "Wipeout HD"; both games' ships shared image-based lighting, with blended diffuse and <a href="specular%20highlight">specular highlight</a>s effects and the <a href="Vertex%20%28computer%20graphics%29">vertex</a>-based lighting system used for weaponry. According to Roberts, the main difference between the games was PlayStation Vita's utilisation of the effects via the GPU; PlayStation 3 relied on SPUs. The team decided to use <a href="Fast%20approximate%20anti-aliasing">anti-aliased</a> colour buffers for real-time shadow rendering, instead of depth buffers. This gave the game greater transparency effects, since the memory cost of anti-aliasing was 8 bits per pixel; therefore, <a href="multisample%20anti-aliasing">4x MSAA</a> (multisample anti-aliasing) buffers contained the same amount of memory as a <a href="Z-buffering">32-bit</a> depth buffer. Another feature which Roberts considered an improvement was <a href="tone%20mapping">tone mapping</a> (partly due to Vita's superior support of buffer formats), which gave "Wipeout 2048" better exposure control and bloom effects.

To accommodate the game's visual fidelity, the team compromised on frame rate. Roberts said that the decision was made early in development, since they initially expected that the PlayStation Vita could run PlayStation 3 <a href="Digital%20asset">assets</a> at 30 <a href="Hz">Hz</a>. The team used existing code from "Wipeout HD" as a "starting point" to make the development process more efficient; the art and technical teams of Studio Liverpool worked in parallel. Lovegrove agreed that 30 frames per second was always the goal for the game, since the team wanted to prioritise visual quality. In a "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" interview, Roberts said that Studio Liverpool were one of the first developers to use a dynamic <a href="framebuffer">framebuffer</a> on the PlayStation 3: an algorithm which reduces resolution when the game engine is stressed, maintaining performance and optimising frame rate. The technique, known as resolution throttling, was carried over from "Wipeout HD" to "Wipeout 2048": "If you are dead set on locking frame-rate and resolution your whole game is (graphically) restricted by the worst-case scenario".

"Wipeout 2048" was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in early 2012. In 2010 Sony Computer Entertainment restructured Studio Liverpool as part of a "project prioritisation" of Sony's global assets, and several of the studio's upcoming projects were cancelled. On 8 August 2012, Sony officially shut down Studio Liverpool as part of an effort to focus on alternative investment plans. At the time of their closure, the studio were reportedly working on a "Wipeout" title for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and a "<a href="Splinter%20Cell">Splinter Cell</a>"-style game; the unnamed "Wipeout" game had been in development for 12 to 18 months.

"Wipeout 2048" received generally positive reviews. It has an average score of 79 percent at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, based on an aggregate of 63 reviews, and was Metacritic's 20th-highest-ranked PlayStation Vita game of 2012. The game was nominated in the Best Handheld Game category at the 2012 <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a>. "Wipeout 2048" was the second best-selling PlayStation Vita game at the time of its launch in the United Kingdom, behind "".

Critics praised "Wipeout 2048" graphics and visuals, calling them a showcase for the PlayStation Vita's power. Cam Shea of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> enjoyed the game's detail and depth but questioned its visual design, saying that the game's darker environments and cluttered worlds made the tracks ambiguous and less readable. Adam Goodall of <a href="Gameplanet">Gameplanet</a> called the graphics stunning and said that the game had a pervasive artistic statement, something he considered rare in video games (particularly racing games). According to "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>"s Mark Langshaw and <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>'s Kathryn Bailey, the game's backdrops were superior to "Wipeout HD"; Langshaw said that they showcased the PlayStation Vita's graphical prowess. David Meikleham of the "<a href="PlayStation%20Official%20Magazine%20%E2%80%93%20UK">Official PlayStation Magazine</a>" wrote that "Wipeout 2048" "brilliantly shows off" the new hardware with its attractive lighting effects, solid frame rate and wide range of colours, and Dan Ryckert of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" said that its fast-paced races "do a good job" of displaying the Vita's graphical capabilities. Frédéric Goyon of <a href="Jeuxvideo.com">Jeuxvideo.com</a> liked the game's utilisation of the PlayStation Vita's <a href="OLED">OLED</a> screen, although he saw little difference between the graphical enhancements of "Wipeout 2048" and "Wipeout HD". According to Goyon, the game was "fluid in all circumstances" and was essentially "Wipeout HD" on a smaller screen. Heath Hindman of <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> said that although it "really shows off" the PlayStation Vita's graphical power (along with "Uncharted: Golden Abyss", another launch title), the game's sight distance was limited. "Wipeout 2048" track design was largely praised. Simon Parkin of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" enjoyed its "wholly contemporary" track details and visual consistency with previous instalments, and Peter Willington of "<a href="Pocket%20Gamer">Pocket Gamer</a>" called the game's track design the best in the series. According to Sebastian Haley of <a href="VentureBeat">VentureBeat</a>, "Wipeout 2048" would have benefited from a "slightly braver" track design.

Willington noted that the game's visuals experienced <a href="aliasing">aliasing</a>, and "Wipeout 2048" was "undercutting the point" of "Wipeout HD" (a PlayStation 3 title). An "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" reviewer also called its visuals less exciting than the "Wipeout" series' typical science-fiction setting, noting that Studio Liverpool "rewinds the timeline" to a less futuristic, more relatable setting. Martin Gaston of VideoGamer.com said that "Wipeout 2048" featured a different (not inferior) aesthetic design from the other games due to its "closer to home", near-future setting. According to <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Mark Walton, the game's smooth, beautiful visuals gave the player a real feeling of speed and provided breathtaking vistas but was somewhat lacking in innovation. Paul Furfari of <a href="UGO">UGO</a> enjoyed "Wipeout 2048" visual style, calling it the only showcase for the PlayStation Vita's raw power. He singled out the "<a href="Tron">Tron</a>"-like visual presentation of the Zone mode and the game's generally solid frame rate. Dale North of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> said that the series consistently showcased the system on which they were released and "Wipeout 2048" was a good launch title for the PlayStation Vita. North called it a beautiful game; "as fast and flashy as its predecessors", it "really impresses" on the PlayStation Vita's high-resolution screen and the ships and futuristic backdrops seem to "pop right off the screen". Sebastian Haley of VentureBeat wrote that the game adheres to the familiar, high visual standard set by previous "Wipeout" instalments.

Critics enjoyed the game's use of the PlayStation Vita's analogue control sticks. Jeuxvideo.com's Goyon praised the game's optimisation of the Vita's <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a> and touchpad features and the extremely effective analogue stick. According to Parkin, the game's technical impediments made it a learning curve for the developers; he thought that they did not intend to reduce the manoeuvrability of the PlayStation Vita's analogue stick, in contrast to "Wipeout HD". "Digital Spy" Mark Langshaw found the PlayStation Vita's analogue stick smooth and responsive, although he questioned its accessibility for players unfamiliar to the series. He enjoyed the game's use of the console's gyroscope and touchpad to manoeuvre and collect <a href="power-up">power-up</a>s, respectively, but said that the touchpad did not have the same level of accuracy as its physical alternative. The gameplay in general was well regarded, including its replay value and balanced difficulty. "Game Informer" Dan Ryckert considered the game's <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a> moderate; although its analogue stick did a "good job" of controlling the ships, it had a noticeable lack of traction. According to Hindman, the game would have benefited from a customisable control configuration and the three pre-made default setups were unsatisfactory. Willington cited "Wipeout 2048" as the series' best handheld game and praising its tight controls and variety of content. "Edge"s reviewer praised the multiplayer mode, saying that it "adds weight and value to the package" and gave a unique slant to the Vita's online potential. Shea and Bailey noted the game's reduced frame rate of 30 frames per second, a step down from the franchise's traditional 60 frames per second. Gerstmann thought that the frame rate occasionally affected gameplay and speed, but the game was mostly stable. Ian Dransfield of "<a href="Play%20%28UK%20magazine%29">Play</a>" praised the game's replay value and multiplayer functions: "It's the sort of game you’ll find yourself coming back to again". David Meikleham called "Wipeout 2048" balanced difficulty consistently excellent, praising its long campaign as "surprisingly hefty" and not an "on-the-go time-waster".

Although its gameplay was mainly well received, the game's long loading times were criticised. <a href="Jeff%20Gerstmann">Jeff Gerstmann</a> of <a href="Giant%20Bomb">Giant Bomb</a> noted "Wipeout 2048" technical issues, particularly its loading times. IGN's Cam Shea called the 30-second loading times frustrating "when all you want to do is race", and Gameplanet's Adam Goodall also described the long loading times as awful, though he felt they were not enough to make the game a failure and assured the overall gameplay experience "deeply satisfying". GamesRadar's Kathryn Bailey said that the game's online mode was well-executed, highly accessible and a "credit to "Wipeout"." She said that its user interface appeared clean and shiny, and called the touchscreen-based menu system "a pleasure to behold". "The Guardian" Simon Parkin criticised the game's protracted loading times; a pause at least twenty seconds too long had a negative effect in the era of "insta-fix mobile gaming on the rival platforms". Willington found the lengthy load times an issue which plagues the game, "totally at odds" with the normal pace of gameplay. Gaston said that the loading times were "simply unforgivable"; he routinely waited over 50 seconds after selecting a race to start it, which minimised the ability to comfortably play the game "on the go". Walton also found the long loading times infuriating in a handheld game, and said that having to wait more than 40 seconds to start a race was far longer than it should have been. Although Furfari found that the game had one of the longest loading times on the PlayStation Vita, it was not a "deal breaker" and "Wipeout 2048" was one of the few racing titles for the console that he recommended. Although Haley noted the game's substantial loading times, he said that was a common feature in PlayStation Vita launch titles.

Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin

Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin is a large oil and <a href="tempera">tempera</a> on oak <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a>, usually dated between 1435 and 1440, attributed to the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. Housed in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Museum of Fine Arts</a>, Boston, it shows <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">Luke the Evangelist</a>, patron saint of artists, sketching the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> as she nurses the <a href="Child%20Jesus">Child Jesus</a>. The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The <a href="Hortus%20conclusus">enclosed garden</a>, illusionistic carvings of <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve</a> on the arms of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols.

Van der Weyden was strongly influenced by <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>, and the painting is very similar to the earlier "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>", usually dated to around 1434, with significant differences. The figure's positioning and colourisation are reversed, and Luke takes centre stage; his face is accepted as van der Weyden's <a href="self-portrait">self-portrait</a>. Three near contemporary versions are in the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a>, Saint Petersburg, the <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a>, Munich, and the <a href="Groeningemuseum">Groeningemuseum</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>. The Boston panel is widely considered the original from <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a>s that are both heavily reworked and absent in other versions. It is in relatively poor condition, having suffered considerable damage, which remains despite extensive restoration and cleaning.

The painting's historical significance rests both on the skill behind the design and its merging of earthly and divine realms. By positioning himself in the same space as the Madonna, and showing a painter in the act of portrayal, Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th-century society. The panel became widely influential with near copies by the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20%28Bruges%29%20legend%20of%20St.%20Ursula">Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula</a> and <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a>.

There are no surviving contemporary archival documents for Rogier van der Weyden's "Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin", but art historians agree that it was almost certainly painted for the Brussels painters' guild, for their chapel at the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20St.%20Michael%20and%20St.%20Gudula">Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula</a>, where van der Weyden is buried. It may have been commissioned to celebrate the artist's appointment as city painter for Brussels. <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">Luke the Evangelist</a> was thought to have been a portraitist, and Northern European painters' guilds were considered to be under his protection.

In the 15th-century images of Luke painting the Virgin were more commonly found in Northern rather than Italian art. Luke was credited with painting the original of the immensely popular Italo-<a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> "<a href="Cambrai%20Madonna">Cambrai Madonna</a>", to which numerous miracles were attributed. The original of that work was taken to France from Rome in 1440, and within four years at least 15 high quality copies had been made. It was regarded as an example of St Luke's skill, and contemporary painters strove to emulate him in their depictions of Mary. Popular belief held that the essence of the Virgin was captured in Luke's portrait of her.

Van der Weyden closely follows van Eyck's c. 1435 "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>", though there are significant differences. The landscape in the van der Weyden is less detailed, and its top gives less of an illusion of openness than van Eyck's. The most obvious similarity is the two figures standing at a bridge, who may not carry specific identities; those in the van der Weyden are sometimes identified as <a href="Joachim">Joachim</a> and <a href="Saint%20Anne">Anne</a>, the Virgin's parents. In van Eyck's painting the right hand figure wears a red turban, a motif widely accepted as that artist's indicator of a <a href="self-portrait">self-portrait</a>; similar images can be found on the London "<a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Man%20%28Self%20Portrait%3F%29">Portrait of a Man</a>" and the reflection in the knight's shield in the "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20with%20Canon%20van%20der%20Paele">Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele</a>", Bruges.

In the van der Weyden, the positioning of the main figures is reversed from the van Eyck; the Virgin appears to the left, a positioning that became predominant in later Netherlandish <a href="diptych">diptych</a>s. The colours in this work are warmer than those in the van Eyck. Van der Weyden switches the colours of their costumes; Luke is dressed in red or scarlet, Mary in the more typical warm blues. The Virgin type has further been changed, here she is depicted as a "<a href="Nursing%20Madonna">Maria Lactans</a>" ("Nursing Madonna"). This is one of the standard depictions of her, different from the <a href="Hodegetria">Hodegetria</a> ("Our Lady of the Way", or "She who points the way") Virgin type most usually associated with Byzantine and Northern 15th-century depictions of St Luke. This depiction of Mary's motherhood stresses the "redemption of mankind by Christ as human ... [and] spiritual nourishing".

The panel comprises four individual pieces of oak, painted over a chalk ground bound with glue. The preparation wood is dated to around 1410, giving an estimated date for the Van der Weyden in the mid-1430s. The dominant pigments are <a href="lead%20white">lead white</a> (often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages), charcoal black, <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>, <a href="lead-tin-yellow">lead-tin-yellow</a>, <a href="verdigris">verdigris</a> and red lake. There has been some discolouration – some greens are now brown, including pigments used to depict grass in the background.

Mary sits under a <a href="brocade">brocade</a> canopy or <a href="Baldachin">cloth of honour</a>, painted in brown hues which have since discoloured to dark green. The canopy hangs down to a wooden bench attached to the wall behind her. Mary's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur. Around her neck is a light <a href="veil">veil</a>, and she is shown in the act of <a href="breastfeeding">nursing</a>. Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel, composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a> highlights. The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics, lined with greyish blues and purples.
Luke is positioned on a green cushion, between the heavenly figure and the small study behind him. He is either rising from a kneeling position or about to <a href="genuflection">genuflect</a>. His eyes fix on her attentively, and he seems near hypnotised. Jesus is similarly transfixed. Hall describes Luke's hands as floating before him, holding the tools "with the same delicacy that an angel might hold a <a href="lily">lily</a> or <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a>". Mary has turned her face so that he can depict her in near full profile, a rare honour, while Luke's kneeling position is closely analogous to that of a typical <a href="donor%20portrait">donor portrait</a> in the presence of the Virgin.

Luke is beardless and in his early 40s, close to van der Weyden's age in the mid-1430s. His face is not idealised; he is middle-aged with light stubble and greying hair. The room behind him contains his <a href="Emblem">attributes</a> including an ox and an open book representing his Gospel. He is painted with more naturalism than Mary; his eyes in particular are more realistically drawn. Christ's conform to the then idealised form, as simple crescents. Mary's are formed from curved lines typical of <a href="International%20Gothic">late Gothic</a> ideals of feminine beauty. Compared to contemporary paintings of this type, the work is unusually free of inscriptions; they appear only on items in Luke's study, dimly perceived on his right: on a book, on an ink bottle, and on a <a href="scroll">scroll</a> emanating from the mouth of <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist%23Symbol">his ox</a>, beneath the small desk.

The scene is set within a rather narrow interior space, with a <a href="barrel%20vault">barrel vault</a> ceiling, patterned floor <a href="tile">tilings</a>, and stained glass windows. The outer wall opens to the midground, with a patch of grass and plants, and has a view of a river or <a href="inlet">inlet</a>. Art historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Chipps%20Smith">Jeffrey Chipps Smith</a> notes how the transition between the grounds establishes a "complex spatial space in which [van der Weyden] achieved an almost seamless movement from the elaborate architecture of the main room to the garden and <a href="parapet">parapet</a> of the middle ground to the urban and rural landscape behind".
Two figures in the mid-ground stand at a battlement wall overlooking the water, their backs turned against the viewer, the male pointing outwards. They are framed by columns, and are looking towards the detailed city and landscape in the background. The figures seem preoccupied with "looking", which Carol Purtle believes, to van der Weyden, was a form of devotionalism; through meditating on an image, the "beholder experienced visions of transports of ecstasy". Technical analysis shows that both figures were heavily reworked both in the underdrawing and the final painting; the hood of the figure on the right was originally red, but over-painted as black, amongst many other differences.
The positioning of these figures closely resembles that of two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent a tribute to the artist's brother <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert</a> who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of <a href="Portrait%20of%20a%20Man%20%28Self%20Portrait%3F%29">self-portraiture</a> for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of <a href="repoussoir">repoussoir</a>, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of <a href="paragone">paragone</a>; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.

Examination of the underdrawing shows that the artist intended a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin, but this was omitted from the final painting. He heavily reworked the positions of the three main figures even towards the end of completion. The draperies of the mantles were at first larger. Christ's body at first faced Luke, but was later tilted in the direction of his mother. The mother and child were brought closer together. Luke's head was at first level with the Virgin's, but in the final painting is raised slightly above. The differences extend beyond those in the foreground. The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged, while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller, the river itself narrower.

Luke's face is widely considered to be a van der Weyden self-portrait. He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting. This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in <a href="silverpoint">silverpoint</a> on white paper; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration, and is normally used only for preparation. The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden, now in the Louvre, contains a female head very similar to Mary's in the Boston panel.
Van der Weyden appears intelligent and handsome, but weather-worn. He inserted a self-portrait into one other work; the lost "<a href="The%20Justice%20of%20Trajan%20and%20Herkinbald">Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald</a>", known through a tapestry copy in the <a href="Historical%20Museum%20of%20Bern">Historical Museum of Bern</a>. Later northern artists followed his lead, using self-portraits in their own depictions of Luke.

What biographical details are available place the artist as a devout Catholic, deeply influenced by mystical and devotional texts, familiar with 12th and 13th century female theologians such as <a href="Mechthild%20of%20Magdeburg">Mechthild of Magdeburg</a> and <a href="Hildegard%20of%20Bingen">Hildegard of Bingen</a>. They believed that contemplating devotional images whilst meditating might lead to a vision or a state of ecstasy. It is possible from these teachings that van der Weyden developed a set of devotional motifs such as "<a href="The%20Magdalen%20Reading">The Magdalen Reading</a>". The importance of St Luke in Christian art is underscored in "St Luke Painting the Virgin", while affirming "the role of art within the context of meditation and contemplation".

The self-portraiture achieves a number of purposes. It acts as a tribute to his own ability, as a measure of his skill against van Eyck, and as a case for the legitimacy of the craft of painting. By portraying himself as St Luke in the act of drawing rather than painting, De Vries believes van der Weyden reveals an "artistic consciousness by commenting upon artistic traditions and by doing so presents a visual argument for the role and function of the artist and his art, one at that time still predominantly religiously defined".

Smith describes the panel as an "exposition of the art of painting", observing that van der Weyden records the essential skills any successful artist should master while claiming to be an heir to St Luke. He works in silverpoint – and thus is unencumbered with the paraphernalia of painting; an <a href="easel">easel</a>, seat or other items which might clutter the composition, or more importantly place a physical barrier between the divine and earthly realms.

The painting is rich in both actual and implied <a href="iconography">iconography</a>. Van der Weyden presents Mary as the "Maria Lactans" virgin type, a symbol of "Mother Church" especially popular at times of plague or famine, the implication being that she cares for all and no one will go hungry. This notion ties in with Luke's dual roles of physician (and thus healer) and artist. Van der Weyden had earlier portrayed Mary breast-feeding in his "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20Enthroned%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Virgin and Child Enthroned</a>", which depicts equally detailed carvings carrying significance, but is reduced in size and in its cast of characters, and omits the act of beholding.
The architecture of the enclosed space suggests a church. The Virgin sits beneath a canopy, perhaps symbolic of the sacred space, and the spatial separation between the celebrant and the <a href="wikt%3Acongregation">congregation</a>, usually by a <a href="Rood%20screen">Rood screen</a>. The small room to the right could symbolize the vesting chamber. The arms of her throne are painted as carved with figures including <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam, Eve</a> and the <a href="Serpent%20%28Bible%29">serpent</a> before <a href="Fall%20of%20man">the fall</a> from Paradise. The room faces towards an <a href="hortus%20conclusus">enclosed garden</a>, another emblem of the Virgin's chastity. Though Mary is positioned by a throne and under a canopy, indicating her role as <a href="Queen%20of%20Heaven">Queen of Heaven</a>, she sits on the step, an indication of <a href="Madonna%20of%20humility">her humility</a>.

The Virgin occupies an earthly space as opposed to a sacred one, but remains aloof. This approach is emphasised by secondary midground figures who are out in the open air, while the main figures are positioned in an elevated room containing a throne, grand arches and wood carvings. Van der Weyden's setting is less artificial than van Eyck's; here Luke and Mary face each other as equals, rather than in van Eyck's painting where, as Blum describes "a divinity and a mortal" face one another. Van der Weyden omits the winged angel holding a crown hovering above the Virgin; the figure was included in the underdrawings, but eventually abandoned. The landscape is more secular than van Eyck's, which is dominated by church spires.

In the late-13th century, many of the newly emerging <a href="painter%27s%20guild">painter's guild</a>s were nominating Luke as their patron saint. The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin. Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child, as suggested by the realistic contemporary surroundings, the lack of halos, and the intimate spatial construction. Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography.

During the 19th century the painting was at times associated with <a href="Quentin%20Massys">Quentin Massys</a> and <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a>. In the early 1930s, based on <a href="Radiography">x-radiographs</a>, art historian Alan Burroughs attributed the Boston painting to <a href="Dieric%20Bouts">Dieric Bouts</a> "under the supervision" of van der Weyden. He later revised his opinion to van der Weyden, but art historians remained unsure as to which of the four panel versions was the original or <a href="prime%20version">prime version</a> and which were copies. <a href="Infrared%20reflectography">Infrared reflectography</a> has revealed <a href="underdrawing">underdrawing</a> in the Boston version which contains heavy redrafting and re-working. This is absent in the other versions, strong evidence the Boston panel is prime. The approach to the underdrawing is very similar to the paintings where attribution to van der Weyden is established, such as the "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Descent from the Cross</a>" in Madrid, and the "<a href="Miraflores%20Altarpiece">Miraflores Altarpiece</a>" in Berlin. They are built up with brush and ink, with the most attention given to the outlines of the figures and draperies. Hatching is used to indicate areas of deep shadow. In each, the underdrawing is a working sketch, subject to constant revisions, which continued even after painting had begun. The drawing of Mary is similar to the Louvre's silverpoint drawing of 1464 attributed to his circle. Both are of a type van der Weyden was preoccupied with, showing "an ongoing refinement and emphasis on [Mary's] youthfulness ... [which is] traceable throughout his work".

Art historians gradually revised their dating from 1450 to the currently accepted 1435–40, earlier in the artist's career. This estimate is based on three factors; the dating of the Rolin "Madonna", van der Weyden's opportunity of viewing that panel, and his ability to produce his own work after such a viewing. He is known to have visited Brussels – where van Eyck kept his studio – in 1432 and again 1435. <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> suggested c. 1434 as the earliest possible date, and that the Rolin panel was completed in 1433 or 1434. Julius Held was sceptical of this early dating, noting that if true we are "forced to assume that within one year of Jan's work Rogier received a commission which gave him an opportunity to adopt Jan's compositional pattern while subjecting it at the same time to a very thorough and highly personal transformation, and all this in Bruges, under Jan's very eyes".

Held, as a lone voice and writing in 1955, argues for a date between 1440 and 1443, seeing the work as more advanced than other paintings by the artist from the mid-1430s, and believes it contains "considerable differences" when compared to other early works, especially the "<a href="Annunciation%20Triptych%20%28Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden%29">Annunciation Triptych</a>" of c. 1434. He further observes that although the painting became highly influential, copies did not appear until the mid-century.

<a href="Dendrochronology">Dendrochronological</a> examination of the growth rings in the panel's wood suggests that the timber was felled around 1410. In the 15th century, wood was typically stored for around 20 years before use in panel painting, giving an earliest date in the mid to late 1430s. Analysis of the Munich version places it in the 1480s, around 20 years after van der Weyden's death. The panel in Bruges is in the best condition and of exceptional quality, but dates from c. 1491–1510.

Despite the eminence of the painting and its many copies, little is known of its provenance before the 19th century. It seems likely that it is the painting <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> mentions in his diary recollection of his visit to the Low Countries in 1520. It is probably the same work recorded in a 1574 inventory of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II</a>, kept at the <a href="El%20Escorial">Escorial</a>. The painting is recorded in 1835 in the collection of Don Infante Sebastián Gabriel Borbón y Braganza, a grandnephew of <a href="Charles%20III%20of%20Spain">Charles III of Spain</a> and himself an artist. Gabriel's inventory notes described the panel in detail, attributed it to <a href="Lucas%20van%20Leyden">Lucas van Leyden</a>, and suggested an earlier <a href="art%20restoration">restoration</a>. It was donated to the <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Boston">Museum of Fine Arts</a> in 1893 by <a href="Henry%20Lee%20Higginson">Henry Lee Higginson</a> after his purchase at a New York auction in 1889. Photographs from 1914 show it in an ornate, decorative frame which is probably the same as in Gabriel's 1835 description.

The panel is in poor condition, with substantial damage to its frame and surface, despite at least four restorations. The earliest recorded restoration was in 1893, the year it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, but there are no surviving records of the treatment. In the early 1930s, the museum's curator of paintings, Philip Henry, described the painting as an original van der Weyden, but gave the opinion that its poor condition was hindering wider acceptance of the attribution. On this basis, it was sent to Germany in 1932 to undergo conservation. The effort was led by the restorer <a href="Helmut%20Ruhemann">Helmut Ruhemann</a>, who described the panel as "structurally sound", and removed layers of discoloured <a href="varnish">varnish</a> and "crude overpainting", while filling in some areas of paint loss. Ruhemann believed he had found evidence of at least two major 19th-century restorations, one of which was probably that carried out in Boston in 1893. Ruhemann's cleaning and restoration was widely praised, and contributed to the acceptance of the panel as the original by van der Weyden.

The MFA undertook a third restoration in 1943, when some yellowing of the <a href="Glaze%20%28painting%20technique%29">glaze</a> was repaired. Most recently, the painting was cleaned in 1980 when small amounts of grime were removed, some losses were filled in, and a light coat of varnish was applied.

If the painting was in the Guild of Saint Luke's chapel in Brussels, then many near-contemporary artists would have been able to view it. Van der Weyden's interpretation was hugely influential during the mid-15th and early-16th centuries, both in free and faithful adaptations and copies, examples of which are in Brussels, <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, <a href="Valladolid">Valladolid</a> and Barcelona. This reflects its quality, and the fact that he presents an ideal image of an artist as a self-portrait, legitimising and elevating the trade. Also influential was his Madonna type, which he used again for the c. 1450 "<a href="Diptych%20of%20Jean%20de%20Gros">Diptych of Jean de Gros</a>". That painting features a 'Virgin and Child' wing directly modelled on his St Luke panel, extending the devotional aspect to include a donor who appears in the same panel with her. In combining the patron with the Virgin, the "artist has made that personal devotion an integral part of the image".
Depictions of Luke drawing the Virgin rose in popularity in the mid-to-late 15th century, with van der Weyden's panel the earliest known from the Low Countries – Campin's earlier treatment was by then lost. Most were free copies (adaptations) of van der Weyden's design. The <a href="Notname">anonymous</a> painter known as the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Legend%20of%20St.%20Ursula%20%28Bruges%29">Master of the Legend of St. Ursula</a> incorporated the "Maria Lactans" type for his "Virgin and Child", now in New York. Other artists producing works directly influenced by van der Weyden's portrait include Hugo van der Goes, Dieric Bouts, <a href="Derick%20Baegert">Derick Baegert</a> and <a href="Jan%20Gossaert">Jan Gossaert</a>. Some artists copied van der Weyden by placing their own likeness in place of St Luke, notably <a href="Simon%20Marmion">Simon Marmion</a> and <a href="Maarten%20van%20Heemskerck">Maarten van Heemskerck</a>. By representing themselves as Luke, artists implied a depiction of the Virgin based on first hand contact and thus giving her true likeness.

Van der Goes's is the earliest extant autographed version, and one of the most important. This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost, and was probably made for a guild. Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe, draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint, and wears a melancholy expression. Building on van der Weyden's theme of the role, practice and craft of an artist, van der Goes places pieces of charcoal, a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint. The similarities to the van der Weyden are many and striking, and include the painting utensils, red robes, physician's cap and blue mantle. The figure has the same middle-aged facial type and his pose, kneeling on a green cushion, although reversed compared to van der Weyden's, is the same. Van der Goes's adaption both increased van der Weyden's standing in the eyes of the later artist's followers, and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting.

A tapestry version woven in Brussels c. 1500 is now in the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>. It was probably designed using a reversed drawing of the painting.

Hands Across Hawthorne

Hands Across Hawthorne was a rally held at the <a href="Hawthorne%20Bridge">Hawthorne Bridge</a> in the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">American West Coast</a> city of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, on May 29, 2011. The demonstration was in response to an attack, one week earlier, on Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear, a gay male couple who had been <a href="holding%20hands">holding hands</a> while walking across the bridge. According to the couple and the <a href="Portland%20Police%20Bureau%20%28Oregon%29">Portland Police Bureau</a>, a group of five men followed Forkner and Rosevear along the bridge before physically assaulting them. The assault was condemned by Portland's mayor, <a href="Sam%20Adams%20%28Oregon%20politician%29">Sam Adams</a>, and its police chief, Mike Reese, and news of the attack spread throughout the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and the United States. The attack prompted volunteers from the <a href="Q%20Center">Q Center</a>, a nonprofit organization that supports the <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> community, to form street patrols as a means of monitoring <a href="Downtown%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland's downtown area</a>.

Several LGBT and human rights organizations sponsored Hands Across Hawthorne in response to the attack, with the purpose of linking hands across the entire span of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. More than 4,000 people attended the rally, which had been publicized on a single <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page 72 hours previously. Forkner, Rosevear, Mayor Adams, and other community leaders spoke at the rally. The event received attention throughout the United States. On June 5, residents of <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>, held a similar hand-holding rally called "Hands Across Monroe", crossing the <a href="Monroe%20Street%20Bridge%20%28Spokane%20River%29">Monroe Street Bridge</a> in <a href="Riverfront%20Park%20%28Spokane%2C%20Washington%29">Riverfront Park</a>.

Portland Police Bureau statistics showed a decrease in the number of "bias crime assaults", or "<a href="hate%20crime">hate crime</a>s", from 26 incidents in 2007 to 15 in 2009. In 2010, of just over 50 hate crime incidents reported in Portland, 20 involved gender or sexual orientation, far outnumbering racial hate crimes. In May 2010, a group of men in <a href="drag%20queen">drag</a> were harassed and assaulted by a group of five men. The filing of a police report resulted in a community forum at Portland's Q Center (a nonprofit organization supporting the <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> community), which was attended by Portland Police Chief Mike Reese, Mayor Sam Adams, and Deputy <a href="District%20attorney">District Attorney</a> Rod Underhill, together with more than 100 city residents. The attacks led to the formation of the Queer Patrol (or Q Patrols) in July 2010, which consisted of foot patrols specifically designed to protect the <a href="LGBT%20culture%20in%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">LGBT community in downtown Portland</a>.

<a href="Sarah%20Mirk">Sarah Mirk</a> of "<a href="The%20Portland%20Mercury">The Portland Mercury</a>" attributed the rise in the recorded number of crimes related to gender or sexual identity in 2010 to the increased number of filed police reports, this due in part to the work of the Q Patrols. Hate crimes continued in the city; in November 2010, a man perceived to be gay was severely beaten and left unconscious while walking home in southeast Portland. According to Portland Police, eight bias crimes were reported between January 1 and April 30, 2011, half the number reported during the same period in 2010.

Brad Forkner and Christopher Rosevear (aged 23 and 24, respectively) were attacked on the <a href="Eastbank%20Esplanade">Eastbank Esplanade</a> on May 22, 2011, after holding hands while walking across the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland, Oregon. Details of the attack were released by Portland Police on May 24. Forkner and Rosevear said a group of five men followed them from <a href="Tom%20McCall%20Waterfront%20Park">Tom McCall Waterfront Park</a> across the bridge, then beat them as they came down a ramp along the Esplanade.

According to the description released by Portland Police, "as [the couple] walked they knew several men were behind them talking, laughing and pointing but they were not sure it was directed at them." Three of the five men attacked the couple from behind. Forkner was pushed into a railing and punched multiple times before breaking away to call <a href="9-1-1">9-1-1</a>. The attackers reportedly continued hitting Rosevear on the head, face, back and ribs until Forkner was able to call for police help. Forkner later recalled that he did not hear specific homophobic remarks, but believed the attackers may have been yelling in a foreign language. Forkner had swelling on his face, and Rosevear required stitches in his lip. The victims said that several witnesses were nearby, but did not offer help in any form. Police investigated the case as a "bias crime", noting the lack of provocation. the five men who attacked Forkner and Rosevear remained unidentified.

The attack was reported by newspapers in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> and by gay-oriented media outlets nationwide. Sam Adams, Portland's gay mayor, and Police Chief Mike Reese both spoke out against the attack. Adams said, "We seek to be the city of the most equal opportunity, and we can only be that city if all people are safe and have a sense of safety on our streets and in our parks." The <a href="Cascade%20AIDS%20Project">Cascade AIDS Project</a>, where Forkner was the Pivot Center Coordinator at the time, launched a Facebook campaign following the attack called "Holding Hands, In Solidarity", encouraging people to post pictures of hand-holding. The Q Center also condemned the attack. The assault once again prompted Q Center volunteers to form Q Patrols as a means of monitoring the streets and reporting hate crimes to police. Plans were made to have Q Patrols available between 11 pm and 3 am until the weekend of <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a>.

Following the attack, <a href="Basic%20Rights%20Oregon">Basic Rights Oregon</a> (BRO), Cascade AIDS Project, <a href="Pride%20Northwest">Pride Northwest</a>, the Q Center, and local churches organized a rally to link hands spanning the length of the Hawthorne Bridge to show solidarity. The event was publicized by a single Facebook page, created only 72 hours previously from Cascade AIDS Project's hand-holding photo gallery. Stephen Cassell, event organizer and Q Center board member, reportedly "thought of the action plan in the middle of the night and quickly posted the idea on Facebook." The organization Progressive Oregon, which advocates for <a href="progressivism">progressivism</a> within that state, also advertised the event.

More than 4,000 people attended the event, which began at 7:30 pm. Members of the Community of Welcoming Congregations, a coalition of more than 100 congregations in Oregon that welcome members of the gay community, and the Portland chapter of the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a>, also attended the rally. As demonstrators gathered at the west side of the bridge, the rally began with speeches by Forkner and Rosevear. Forkner said that this was not the first time he had feared for his safety, nor did he expect it to be the last:

Following Forkner's speech, Basic Rights Oregon executive director Jeana Frazzini thanked the couple, spoke of the symbolism of the hand-holding rally, and encouraged supporters to volunteer for the Q Patrol. During the rally, the crowd sang <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="I%20Want%20to%20Hold%20Your%20Hand">I Want to Hold Your Hand</a>".

According to Cassell, Hands Across Hawthorne marked one of the first instances where Portland's major LGBT rights organizations worked together on an event other than the Portland <a href="pride%20parade">Pride Festival</a>. Details of the rally were reported by various publications. "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" contributor Chuck Currie, a <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Christ">United Church of Christ</a> minister from Portland, used the attack and rally to question the impact of conservative evangelical religion and other anti-gay-rights organizations. Progressive Oregon and "<a href="Just%20Out">Just Out</a>" (an LGBT newspaper in Portland) noted the failure of the city's largest newspaper, "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>", to cover the rally; the former sent a letter and petition to the paper's publisher N. Christian Anderson III, requesting "fair and balanced" coverage. Peter Bhatia, editor for "The Oregonian", responded to the criticism and petition signed by more than 1,400 people by saying the paper's lack of coverage was a "mistake" caused by "<a href="human%20error">human error</a>".

One week after the rally, Mayor Sam Adams and his staff linked hands at <a href="Portland%20City%20Hall%20%28Oregon%29">Portland City Hall</a> in solidarity. On June 5, residents of Spokane, Washington held a similar hand-holding rally in solidarity with the Portland community called "Hands Across Monroe", crossing the Monroe Street Bridge in Riverfront Park. That event was sponsored by The LGBT Center.

The Entombment (Bouts)

The Entombment is a <a href="glue-size">glue-size</a> painting on <a href="linen">linen</a> attributed to the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Dieric%20Bouts">Dieric Bouts</a>. It shows a scene from the biblical <a href="entombment%20of%20Christ">entombment of Christ</a>, and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a wing panel for a large hinged <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a> <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>. The now-lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height – two on either side – depicting scenes from the <a href="Life%20of%20Christ%20in%20art">"Life of Christ"</a>. The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts' 1464–67 "Altar of the Holy Sacrament". The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy, possibly to a <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetian</a> patron whose identity is lost. "The Entombment" was first recorded in a mid-19th century <a href="Milan">Milan</a> inventory and has been in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London since its purchase on the gallery's behalf by <a href="Charles%20Lock%20Eastlake">Charles Lock Eastlake</a> in 1861.

The painting is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief. It shows four female and three male mourners grieving over the body of Christ. They are, from left to right, <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a>, <a href="Salome%20%28disciple%29">Mary Salome</a>, <a href="Mary%20of%20Clopas">Mary of Clopas</a>, <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Mary, the mother of Jesus</a>, <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>, <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> and <a href="Joseph%20of%20Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>.

It is one of the few surviving 15th-century paintings created using glue-size, an extremely fragile medium lacking durability. "The Entombment" is in relatively poor condition compared to <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a>s of similar age. Its colours are now far duller than when it was painted; they would, however, always have appeared as than those of comparable oil or tempera paintings on panel. The painting is covered by accumulated layers of grey dirt and cannot be cleaned without damaging the surface and removing large amounts of pigment as its glue-size medium is water-soluble. A strip at the top has been less affected than the rest because it was protected by a frame.

"The Entombment" shows Christ's body, wrapped in a white linen shroud and still wearing a <a href="Crown%20of%20Thorns">crown of thorns</a>, as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb. He is attended by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing. Among the group of mourners standing at Christ's side, the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men look directly at Christ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet. The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills. Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes, even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows. The vista in "The Entombment" is regarded as one of his finest, and is typically composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky.

The <a href="Pharisees">Pharisee</a> <a href="Nicodemus">Nicodemus</a> supports Christ as he is lowered, and can be identified by his similarity to <a href="Simon%20the%20Pharisee">Simon the Pharisee</a> in another canvas attributed to Bouts, "Christ in the House of Simon". <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">The Virgin</a> wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish <a href="Mantle%20%28clothing%29">mantle</a>, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid to let go of her dead son. She is supported by <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, <a href="Salome%20%28disciple%29">Mary Salome</a> stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. <a href="Mary%20of%20Clopas">Mary of Clopas</a> is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Magdalen</a> is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green <a href="tabard">tabard</a> at the feet of Christ is probably <a href="Joseph%20of%20Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from <a href="Pontius%20Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a>.

"The Entombment" is painted on linen tightly woven with 20 to 22 vertical and between 19 and 22 horizontal threads per centimetre. The cloth is <a href="Spinning%20%28textiles%29">Z-spun</a> (tightly spun) and <a href="Plain%20weave">tabby woven</a> with <a href="flax">flax</a> perhaps combined with cotton. The cloth support is lined, unusually, with similar but more finely woven linen <a href="hanging%20scroll">mounted</a> on a wooden stretcher. Before the paint was applied, the linen was first mounted on a temporary stretcher and outlined with a brown border – now visible on the lower border – which was used as a guide to cut the picture down before framing. Glue-sizing consists of creating a <a href="Distemper%20%28paint%29">distemper</a> by mixing pigments in water and then using a glue-base derived from boiled animal skin and other tissues as a binder. The pigments were applied to a linen cloth, treated with the same glue sizing, fixed in turn to its frame by glue. The paint saturated the cloth, often leaving an image on the reverse side, which was lined with an additional cloth.

Pigments bound in glue had an optical quality that rendered them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid. Unlike oil, which makes chalk appear translucent, chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white. Similarly, more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium. The whites are <a href="chalk">chalk</a> in areas mixed with <a href="lead%20paint">lead white</a>, especially in the Magdalen's mantle and <a href="veil">veil</a>, Christ's <a href="shroud">shroud</a> and the Virgin's veil. The artist used four blue pigments, an unusual number for paintings of the period, with <a href="indigo">indigo</a> predominating. As a plant-derived pigment, indigo it has a tendency to fade over time. <a href="Azurite">Azurite</a> and lead-white line the under-paint, while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead-tin yellow. The sky and Nicodemus' collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite, while the Virgin's dress is azurite mixed with <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a> and <a href="smalt">smalt</a>, a blue ground-glass pigment. "The Entombment" is one of the earliest Western pictorial works of art in which the use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that the pigment was not invented during the sixteenth century, as had previously been believed.
The greens are mostly <a href="verdigris">verdigris</a>, although those predominant in the landscape are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is <a href="malachite">malachite</a> mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from <a href="cinnabar">cinnabar</a> and <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a> made from <a href="rubia">rubia</a> and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible to the effects of light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally <a href="bone%20char">bone black</a>s but in places from <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.

The cloth support is visible in areas where the paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes can be seen in the lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was initially covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional <a href="joiner">joiner</a>s who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.

Painting on linen cloth using glue size as a binder was at the time a relatively inexpensive alternative to oil, and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century. Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil, allowing them to show as <a href="Gloss%20%28material%20appearance%29">matt</a> and opaque, giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth. Cloth is fragile and perishes easily, and this work is one of the best preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period; the majority extant today were executed on wood using <a href="Oil%20paint">oil</a> or <a href="Tempera">egg tempera</a>. Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue-sized works.

The colours would have first appeared bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken the tone and render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by <a href="Conservation-restoration">restorers</a>, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, it is impossible to do so without removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's <a href="tabard">tabard</a>, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.
It is possible to see the degree to which the technique allowed Bouts, in the words of art historian Susan Jones, to "[achieve such] sophistication ... to create both fine linear detail and subtle tonal transitions." Jones notes that the sky would have appeared with the same clear and pale blue that is still intact in a narrow strip along the top of the work, which has been protected from light and dirt by a frame. In its current condition the muted landscape appears to echo the sorrow of the mourning figures.

X-ray analysis shows that there were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the paint was applied. This is left exposed in some areas, most noticeably in the Virgin's veil and mantle and in Christ's shroud. <a href="Infrared%20photography">Infrared photography</a> reveals little underdrawing but indicates that the canvas underwent several changes before completion; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left, the sizes of Nicodemus' arm and shoulder were reduced, and the Magdalen's face was painted over the Virgin's mantle.

The cloth on which the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, probably by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running along the top of the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.

<a href="Charles%20Eastlake">Charles Eastlake</a> saw the work in 1858 and again in 1860 during visits to Milan to purchase <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Northern Renaissance art</a> on behalf of the National Gallery. He also viewed three companion pieces but was told they were not on sale. His notes described each of these other works, which he titled: "Annunciation" (now in the <a href="J.%20Paul%20Getty%20Museum">J. Paul Getty Museum</a>), "Adoration of the Kings" (now in a private collection in Germany) and "Presentation" (or "Resurrection"; now in the <a href="Norton%20Simon%20Museum">Norton Simon Museum</a>, <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>). These works are the same size as "The Entombment", have similar colouring and pigmentation and are painted using the same glue-size technique, but are not as well preserved. It is probable that all were re-lined and stretched at the same time by the same restorer, indicating that they were kept together until shortly before "The Entombment" was acquired by the National Gallery.
Art historian Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on the similarity of provenance, material, technique, tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake. He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five-part <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a> altarpiece. Based on the format of Bouts' 1464–67 "Altar of Holy Sacrament", whose four wing panels are the same length as "The Entombment", he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side. His speculative reconstruction places "The Entombment" on the upper right-hand wing, above the "Adoration".

The large centre canvas has not been positively identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged "Crucifixion", now in the <a href="Royal%20Museums%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20of%20Belgium">Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium</a>, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181 × 153.5 cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works had fallen out of fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.

Bouts did not inscribe any of his paintings, which makes attribution and dating difficult. His developing skill with <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a> and unified <a href="vanishing%20point">vanishing point</a>s is used by art historians to date his works from the period. Although its colourisation is among the best of his work, the perspective is clumsy in areas, thus the painting can be assumed to date no later than 1460. Bouts often quoted visual passages from artists and paintings that influenced his work, so the influences are well established and datable. Along with the companion "Resurrection", British art historian <a href="Martin%20Davies%20%28museum%20director%29">Martin Davies</a> believes the work shows influences from <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>'s "<a href="The%20Descent%20from%20the%20Cross%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Descent</a>" (c. 1435) and "<a href="Miraflores%20Altarpiece">Miraflores Altarpiece</a>" (1440s), which places it after 1440. Robert Koch dates it to between 1450 and 1455.

During a period of aggressive acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of Britain's collection, it was acquired for the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> in 1860 in Milan from the Guicciardi family by Charles Lock Eastlake for just over <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>120, along with a number of other Netherlandish works. Eastlake's notes mention that the works were "originally in the possession of the Foscari family". The Foscaris were a wealthy Venetian family which included <a href="Francesco%20Foscari">Francesco Foscari</a> who was <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge of Venice</a> at the time the work was painted; the dramatic story of him and his son is told in <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Two%20Foscari%20%28Byron%29">The Two Foscari</a>", and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi's</a> opera "<a href="I%20due%20Foscari">I due Foscari</a>". There is no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that the painting came from the Foscari collection, and some art historians believe that representatives of the Guicciardis invented this provenance to impress Eastlake. <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> considers the provenance "probable", noting that a descendant, Fergio Foscari (1732–1811), an ambassador to Saint Petersburg, squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to the family. Campbell speculates that the painting was produced on commission for export to Venice, noting that unrolled linen would have been easier to transport than canvas, and that the row of holes just below the upper border could be explained if it had been stretched, mounted and framed by someone other than Bouts or a member of his workshop.

The companion pieces in the Guicciardi collection ("Annunciation", "Adoration of the Kings", and "Resurrection") were similar works in glue-size, though of lesser quality; Eastlake's notebooks mention that they were "not so good (not so well preserved)". Their style and size are similar to "The Entombment", suggesting that they were probably pieces that would have formed part of the larger polyptych. "The Entombment" was attributed to <a href="Lucas%20van%20Leyden">Lucas van Leyden</a> at the time, though Eastlake thought that, given its emotional power, it might be a van der Weyden. Bouts studied under van der Weyden, and was strongly influenced by his work. Davies proposed in 1953 that the figuration and pose in "The Entombment" may have been informed by a small <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> <a href="relief">relief</a> in the arch of the central panel of van der Weyden's "Miraflores Altarpiece".

The painting arrived in London from Milan in 1861, but was not attributed to Bouts until 1911. Two known copies exist: an unsophisticated panel sold in Munich to a private collector in 1934, and an oak panel attributed to a follower which is in <a href="Kreuzlingen">Kreuzlingen</a>, Switzerland.

The influence of Netherlandish painting spread to central Europe in the late 15th century, and many copies or designs based on the work of the Netherlandish masters were produced. The influence of Bouts' "Entombment" can be seen in the German artist <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a>'s c. 1480 engraving of the same name; it not only has compositional similarity but echoes Bouts' use of emotive gesture, posture and expression.

Keechaka Vadham

Keechaka Vadham () is an <a href="British%20Raj">Indian</a> <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> produced, directed, filmed and edited by <a href="R.%20Nataraja%20Mudaliar">R. Nataraja Mudaliar</a>. The first film to have been made in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>, it was shot in five weeks at Nataraja Mudaliar's production house, India Film Company. As the members of the cast were <a href="Tamils">Tamils</a>, "Keechaka Vadham" is considered to be the first <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil film</a>. No <a href="release%20print">print</a> of it is known to have survived, making it a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>.

The screenplay, written by C. Rangavadivelu, is based on an episode from the "<a href="Virata%20Parva">Virata Parva</a>" segment of the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="Indian%20epic%20poetry">epic</a> "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>", focusing on <a href="Kichaka">Keechaka</a>'s attempts to woo <a href="Draupadi">Draupadi</a>. The film stars Raju Mudaliar and Jeevarathnam as the central characters.

Released in the late 1910s, "Keechaka Vadham" was commercially successful and received positive critical feedback. The film's success prompted Nataraja Mudaliar to make a series of similar <a href="Historical%20period%20drama">historical films</a>, which laid the foundation for the <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian cinema</a> industry and led to his being recognised as the father of Tamil cinema. Nataraja Mudaliar's works were an inspiration to other filmmakers including Raghupathi Surya Prakasa and <a href="J.%20C.%20Daniel">J. C. Daniel</a>.

Keechaka, the commander of King <a href="Virata">Virata</a>'s forces, attempts to woo and marry Draupadi by any means necessary; he even tries to molest Draupadi, prompting her to tell <a href="Bhima">Bhima</a>, her husband and one of the <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> brothers, about it. Later, when Keechaka meets Draupadi, she requests him to rendezvous with her at a secret hiding place. He arrives there, only to find Bhima instead of Draupadi; Bhima kills him.


<a href="R.%20Nataraja%20Mudaliar">R. Nataraja Mudaliar</a>, a <a href="Car%20dealership">car dealer</a> who was based in <a href="Chennai">Madras</a>, developed an interest in motion pictures after watching <a href="Dadasaheb%20Phalke">Dadasaheb Phalke</a>'s 1913 <a href="fantasy%20film">mythological film</a>, "<a href="Raja%20Harishchandra">Raja Harishchandra</a>" at the Gaiety theatre in Madras. The former then learned the basics of photography and filmmaking from Stewart Smith, a <a href="Pune">Poona</a>-based British cinematographer who had worked on a documentary that chronicled the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">viceroyship</a> of <a href="George%20Curzon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Curzon%20of%20Kedleston">Lord Curzon</a>
(1899–1905). Nataraja Mudaliar bought a Williamson 35 mm camera and <a href="Optical%20printer">printer</a> from Mooppanar, a wealthy landowner based in <a href="Thanjavur">Thanjavur</a>, for 1,800. In 1915, he established the India Film Company, which was South India's first production company. He then set up a <a href="film%20studio">film studio</a> on Miller's Road in <a href="Purasawalkam">Purasawalkam</a> with the help of business associates who invested in his production house.

Nataraja Mudaliar sought advice from his friend, <a href="Theatre">theatrical</a> artist <a href="Pammal%20Sambandha%20Mudaliar">Pammal Sambandha Mudaliar</a>, who suggested that he depict the story of <a href="Draupadi">Draupadi</a> and <a href="Kichaka">Keechaka</a> from the "<a href="Virata%20Parva">Virata Parva</a>" segment of the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="Indian%20epic%20poetry">epic</a> "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>". Some of Nataraja Mudaliar's relatives objected, feeling that it was an inappropriate story for his debut venture, but Sambandha Mudaliar persuaded him to proceed with making the film as audiences were familiar with the story. Attorney C. Rangavadivelu, a close friend of Nataraja Mudaliar, assisted him in writing the screenplay as the latter was not a writer by profession. The paintings of <a href="Raja%20Ravi%20Varma">Raja Ravi Varma</a> provided Nataraja Mudaliar with a source of inspiration for recreating the story on celluloid. Nataraja Mudaliar cast stage actors Raju Mudaliar and Jeevarathnam as Keechaka and Draupadi, respectively.

"Keechaka Vadham" was filmed on a budget of 35,000 (about $2,700 in 1917), which was quite expensive at the time. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began in 1916–1917, and the film was shot over 35–37 days. Nataraja Mudaliar imported the <a href="film%20stock">film stock</a> London with the help of an Englishman named Carpenter, who worked for the <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a> division of the photographic technology company, <a href="Kodak">Kodak</a>. Film historian <a href="Randor%20Guy">Randor Guy</a> noted in his 1997 book "Starlight Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema" that a thin white piece of cloth was used as a ceiling for filming and <a href="sunlight">sunlight</a> was filtered through it onto the floor. Rangavadivelu was also experienced in playing female roles on stage for the <a href="Suguna%20Vilasa%20Sabha">Suguna Vilasa Sabha</a>, and coached the artists on set. The film's production, cinematography and editing were handled by Nataraja Mudaliar himself.

The film was shot with a speed of 16 frames per second, which was the standard rate for a silent film, at the India Film Company, with <a href="intertitle">intertitle</a>s in English, Tamil and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>. The Tamil and Hindi intertitles were written by Sambandha Mudaliar and <a href="Devdas%20Gandhi">Devdas Gandhi</a> respectively, while Nataraja Mudaliar wrote the English intertitles himself with the assistance of Guruswami Mudaliar and Thiruvengada Mudaliar, a professor from <a href="Pachaiyappa%27s%20College">Pachaiyappa's College</a>.

"Keechaka Vadham" was the first film made in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>; as the cast was <a href="Tamils">Tamil</a>, it is also the first Tamil film. According to Guy, Nataraja Mudaliar established a laboratory in <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> to <a href="Photographic%20processing">process</a> the <a href="Negative%20%28photography%29">film negatives</a> since there was no film laboratory in Madras. Nataraja Mudaliar believed that Bangalore's colder climate "would be kind to his exposed film stock"; he processed the film negatives there each weekend, and returned on Monday morning to resume filming. The film's final <a href="Reel%23Motion%20picture%20terminology">reel</a> length was .

According to Muthiah, "Keechaka Vadham" was first released at the Elphinstone Theatre in Madras; the film netted 50,000 (about $3,850 in 1917) after being screened in India, <a href="Myanmar">Burma</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>, the <a href="Federated%20Malay%20States">Federated Malay States</a> and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. The film yielded 15,000 (about $1,155 in 1917), which Muthiah noted to be a "tidy profit in those days." Writer Firoze Rangoonwalla notes that a reviewer for "<a href="The%20Mail%20%28newspaper%29">The Mail</a>" praised the film: "It has been prepared with great care and is drawing full houses". Guy pointed out that with the film's critical and commercial success, Nataraja Mudaliar had "created history". Since no <a href="release%20print">print</a> is known to have survived, this makes it a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>.

"Keechaka Vadham"s success inspired Nataraja Mudaliar to make a series of historical films: "Draupadi Vastrapaharanam" (1918), "Lava Kusa" (1919), "Shiva Leela" (1919), "Rukmini Satyabhama" (1922) and "Mahi Ravana" (1923). He retired from filmmaking in 1923 after a fire that killed his son and destroyed his production house. Nataraja Mudaliar is widely regarded as the father of <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil cinema</a>, and his films helped lay the foundation for the <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian cinema</a> industry; his works inspired Raghupathi Surya Prakasa, the son of <a href="Raghupathi%20Venkaiah%20Naidu">Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu</a>, and <a href="J.%20C.%20Daniel">J.

Dishonored

Dishonored is a 2012 <a href="Stealth%20game">stealth</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> video game developed by <a href="Arkane%20Studios">Arkane Studios</a> and published by <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a>. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, "Dishonored" follows the story of <a href="Corvo%20Attano">Corvo Attano</a>, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalistsa resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and <a href="The%20Outsider%20%28Dishonored%29">the Outsider</a>a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>, <a href="Brad%20Dourif">Brad Dourif</a>, <a href="Carrie%20Fisher">Carrie Fisher</a>, <a href="Michael%20Madsen">Michael Madsen</a>, <a href="John%20Slattery">John Slattery</a>, <a href="Lena%20Headey">Lena Headey</a> and <a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Grace%20Moretz">Chloë Grace Moretz</a> provided voice work for the game.

The game is played from a <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.

During its three years in production, several versions of "Dishonored" were developed. Before the creation of Dunwall—inspired by late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh—the game was set to take place in medieval Japan and seventeenth-century London. During development, test players discovered methods of exploiting the available powers and abilities to achieve unexpected outcomes; instead of restricting these techniques, the designers attempted to redesign levels to accommodate them. "Dishonored"s music score was produced by composer <a href="Daniel%20Licht">Daniel Licht</a> to represent London in the nineteenth century.

"Dishonored" received positive reviews, focusing on the missions' individual narratives and the freedom available in completing them. Criticism fell on the overarching narrative, which was considered predictable, and problems in controlling the player's character. The game won several awards, including the 2012 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game</a> award for Best Action-Adventure Game and the 2013 <a href="British%20Academy%20Video%20Games%20Awards">BAFTA</a> award for Best Game, and was repeatedly recognized as the best action-adventure game of 2012 and one of that year's best games. "Dishonored" was initially released on 9 October 2012, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, and was later supplemented with additional content focusing on the assassin Daud and his quest for redemption. <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> versions of the game were released in August 2015, and a sequel, "<a href="Dishonored%202">Dishonored 2</a>", was released in November 2016.

"Dishonored" is an <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> played from a <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> perspective with an emphasis on <a href="Stealth%20game">stealth</a> action and the use of gadgets and the environment to eliminate opposing forces. The game world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for multiple avenues of exploration in terms of in-game movement and powers. Between missions, the player is taken to a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character Corvo can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades. In-game areas include loading docks, royal estates, poverty-stricken streets, and a bathhouse. The player can <a href="Saved%20game">save</a> their progress anywhere, and the game includes a checkpoint save system. Saving is disabled during combat. The game has four difficulty levels which modify the effectiveness of <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> and mana (magic) potions, and enemies' awareness, damage delivered, and responsiveness. In the easy setting, health regeneration is possible.

"Dishonored" features <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing game</a> elements, such as the ability to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer <a href="Harvey%20Smith%20%28game%20designer%29">Harvey Smith</a> involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.

The player's actions are not judged to be good or evil, but instead are tracked by a "chaos" system that records the amounts of friendly fire, violence, and deaths the player causes. This modifies the game world, affecting the story without punishing the player or forcing them to choose one style of play over another. For example, an NPC who disapproves of violence may refuse to support the player, or may even betray them. The game reacts to the chaos caused in scripted ways, such as changing dialogue, and dynamic ways, such as increasing the presence of rats and plagued citizens and adding new scenes. This can affect the active mission and future missions. The system also influences which of the game's two endings is reached, with variations based on which characters live or die. Using violence allows missions to be completed in less time than using a stealth approach, but violence consumes more in-game resources such as health and mana potions, which are required more often in direct combat.

"Dishonored" features six active powers, four passive powers or "enhancements", and forty "bone charms" which grant the player supernatural perks, such as the ability to increase the duration of rat possession. Initially, only three bone charms can be active at any time; up to six can be active through optional upgrades. Smith and designer <a href="Rapha%C3%ABl%20Colantonio">Raphaël Colantonio</a> stated that it is impossible for a player to accrue all of the powers and abilities in a single playthrough. The player requires mana to use these abilities; mana partially regenerates after use to allow "Blink" and "Dark Vision" powers to be used, but mana potions are required to regenerate more mana, restricting the use of higher cost abilities like "Possession" and "Bend Time." Magic and ranged weapons are assigned to the player character's left hand control and a sword is assigned to the right hand control.

The main supernatural powers are unlocked and purchased using "runes"—artifacts carved from whale bone—and each can be upgraded. Powers include "Dark Vision", which allows the player to see enemies through walls, their field of view and highlights interactive objects; "Blink", a short-distance teleportation ability; "Possession", that allows the player to temporarily inhabit and possess other characters; "Devouring Swarm", which summons a swarm of deadly rats; "Bend Time", that slows or freezes time; "Wind Blast", a gust of wind that can knock down enemies; and "Shadow Kill" that turns dead enemies to ash, preventing their discovery by opposing forces. The player can use weapons including a sword, grenades, a crossbow, and pistols. Coins must be collected to upgrade weapons and gadgets.

Stealth is based on limiting the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, and as long as Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.

Guards have several states of alertness, ranging from normal to suspicious; they can become aware of the player's presence or can actively search for them. Enemy <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) will respond to sound and can be distracted using sound to lure guards away from their positions. If the player remains concealed from guards, their alertness will drop to "aware", but it will not return to normal in that mission. Enemies communicate their states of alertness to their allies, increasing the alertness level throughout the mission.

"Dishonored" takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall, where technology and otherworldly forces coexist. The city's design is modeled on <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> between the late 1800s and the early 1900s. The capital of the Empire of the Isles, Dunwall is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter. The city is a center for fishing and whaling; whale oil is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city. After a philosopher discovered that whale oil—known in the city as trans—can be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption. The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected, known as "weepers", cry blood and can become violent. The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish. Order is maintained by the Tallboys, heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts are separated by barriers known as "Walls of Light", which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized people who try to cross them. A covert group of activists, the Loyalists, plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress' daughter as the new Empress.

The main character of "Dishonored", whom the player controls, is <a href="Corvo%20Attano">Corvo Attano</a>, the former bodyguard to Dunwall's Empress Jessamine Kaldwin (<a href="April%20Stewart">April Stewart</a>). Corvo becomes an infamous assassin after he is framed for the empress' murder. He is skilled in stealth and combat, is armed with unusual gadgets, and possesses great supernatural powers. The game designers chose Corvo to <a href="Silent%20protagonist">remain silent</a> so that players could project themselves onto the character. Corvo is aided by the Loyalists, led by Admiral Havelock (<a href="John%20Slattery">John Slattery</a>), and members: Piero Joplin (<a href="Brad%20Dourif">Brad Dourif</a>)an inventor who builds Corvo's mask and supplies him with gadgets; Treavor Pendleton (Derek Phillips)a member of parliament; Samuel (<a href="Ryan%20Cutrona">Ryan Cutrona</a>)a commoner who ferries Corvo to and from his missions; Overseer Teague Martin (Joel Johnstone); and Callista Curnow (<a href="Lena%20Headey">Lena Headey</a>)the caretaker for the Empress' daughter Young Lady <a href="Emily%20Kaldwin">Emily</a> (<a href="Chlo%C3%AB%20Grace%20Moretz">Chloë Grace Moretz</a>). Other characters include Granny Rags (<a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>)a former aristocrat now blind and deranged after years of living on the streets; Daud (<a href="Michael%20Madsen">Michael Madsen</a>)leader of a group of assassins known as "the Whalers"; and Slackjaw (Al Rodrigo)a gang leader. <a href="Carrie%20Fisher">Carrie Fisher</a> and <a href="Gregg%20Berger">Gregg Berger</a> provide the voices of the loudspeakers found throughout the city relaying government propaganda.

<a href="The%20Outsider%20%28Dishonored%29">The Outsider</a> (<a href="Billy%20Lush">Billy Lush</a>) offers to help Corvo in his quest. Described as a mixture of God and the Devil, The Outsider imprints his mark on Corvo, imbuing him with magical abilities, and provides him with a mechanically altered human heart (April Stewart) that tells Corvo secrets. The Outsider also grants his mark, and special abilities, to other characters. Smith described the character as an amoral figure who grants abilities, but leaves the choice of how to use them up to the recipient.

Corvo's targets include the Lord Regent Hiram Burrows (<a href="Kristoffer%20Tabori">Kristoffer Tabori</a>)the Empress' former spymaster who masterminded her death and framed Corvo, and now controls Dunwall; Burrows' lover Lady Boyle (<a href="Anna%20Graves">Anna Graves</a>)an aristocrat funding the military; Lords Custis and Morgan known as the Pendleton Twins (Zach Hanks)members of parliament; High Overseer Campbell (<a href="Daniel%20Hagen">Daniel Hagen</a>)leader of the city's religious order; and Anton Sokolov (<a href="Roger%20L.%20Jackson">Roger Jackson</a>)a genius inventor responsible for the creation of many advanced technologies including the Wall of Light.

After returning from a foreign voyage to seek aid with the deadly plague ravaging the city, Corvo Attano travels to the tower of Dunwall and meets with the Empress. After delivering a message, they are attacked by teleporting assassins led by Daud; they magically restrain Corvo, kill the Empress and kidnap her daughter Emily. The Empress' Spymaster arrives and has Corvo imprisoned for her murder and Emily's abduction. Six months later, the Spymaster has seized control of Dunwall as Lord Regent. Interrogating Corvo, the Lord Regent confesses that he masterminded the assassination and framed Corvo. The following day, Corvo is due to be executed. In his cell, a letter from Empire Loyalists is smuggled to Corvo, and he is given the means to escape. After escaping, Samuel ferries Corvo to the Hound Pits pub to meet the Loyalists, led by Admiral Havelock.

While resting at the pub, Corvo is taken to a dream world where he meets the Outsider, who brands Corvo with his mark. Corvo is sent by the Loyalists to eliminate the conspirators behind the Lord Regent's plot, and the player is given the option to kill or otherwise neutralize Corvo's targets, the first of which is High Overseer Campbell. During the mission, Corvo meets Granny Rags and Slackjaw. Corvo removes the High Overseer and discovers that Emily is being held in a brothel called the Golden Cat under the supervision of twins Custis and Morgan Pendleton. Corvo rescues Emily and eliminates the brothers. After returning to the pub, Emily is taken into the care of Callista to prepare her for becoming Empress, while Corvo is sent to abduct the genius scientist Sokolov, who is responsible for the Lord Regent's powerful technologies. Sokolov is taken to the pub for interrogation, under which he divulges the identity of the Lord Regent's financier, Lady Boyle. Corvo infiltrates Boyle's masquerade ball, deduces which of the three sisters is the Lord Regent's mistress, and disposes of her.

After returning to the pub, Havelock confirms they have done enough damage to move on the Lord Regent. Corvo infiltrates the tower of Dunwall and removes the Lord Regent from power and, in the process, learns that the Lord Regent intentionally imported the plague to decimate the lower classes of society, though things quickly got out of hand. Corvo returns to the Hound Pits pub where the Loyalists celebrate their success. After sharing a drink, Corvo goes to his room and collapses. Upon waking he learns that his drink was poisoned by Samuel at the behest of Havelock and his Loyalist allies Treavor Pendleton and Teague Martin to prevent him interfering in their plan to install Emily as Empress and rule through her. Samuel remains loyal to Corvo and had given him a non-lethal dose of poison. Samuel sets Corvo adrift on the river and flees. When Corvo wakes, he is a prisoner of the assassin Daud and his men, who killed the Empress and intend to claim the bounty placed on Corvo's head by the now Lord Regent Havelock.

Corvo defeats Daud and his assassins before traveling through Daud's territory and into the sewers where he finds Granny Rags attempting to cook Slackjaw. Corvo can eliminate either Slackjaw or Granny Rags, who is revealed to be a witch called Vera Moray. Corvo returns to the pub to find it overrun with guards and that Havelock has killed many of the Loyalists. He discovers where Havelock has taken Emily, and can save Piero, Sokolov and Callista. Corvo signals to Samuel, who ferries him to the former Lord Regent's lighthouse. He infiltrates the lighthouse and either subdues Pendleton and Martin or finds that Havelock, to ensure the Loyalists' actions are never known, has already killed them. Once finished with Havelock, Corvo may or may not rescue Emily. Havelock's journal reveals that the Lord Regent suspects that Emily is Corvo's daughter.

The ending varies depending upon the level of chaos the player has caused throughout the game. If Corvo saves Emily, she ascends the throne as Empress with Corvo at her side. If only a small amount of chaos has been caused, a golden age dawns and the plague is finally overcome. After many decades, Corvo dies of natural causes and Empress Emily Kaldwin I the Wise buries him beside Empress Jessamine. If much chaos is caused, the city remains in turmoil and is overrun with the plague. If Corvo fails to save Emily, Dunwall crumbles and Corvo flees the city by ship.

Bethesda Softworks first announced "Dishonored" as a first-person, stealth, action-adventure game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms on 7 July 2011. "Dishonored" is the first <a href="Arkane%20Studios">Arkane Studios</a> game Bethesda published after Bethesda parent <a href="ZeniMax%20Media">ZeniMax Media</a> bought Arkane in August 2010. Arkane Studios founder Raphaël Colantonio and "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>" developer Harvey Smith were the game's creative directors, and "Deus Ex" designer Ricardo Bare was its lead technical designer. Visual design director Viktor Antonov, who designed "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>" <a href="City%2017">City 17</a>, and art director Sebastien Mitton led the art team. Smith, Colantonio, Antonov, and Mitton spent three years in pre-production. Bethesda approached Arkane and asked them to develop a new game and a new intellectual property. The team already had ideas for developing a similar game, but until Bethesda approached them, Arkane had no specific ideas. Mitton contacted Antonov in May 2009 to ask for his help to establish an artistic identity for a new intellectual property. The full Arkane teamincluding their offices in Lyon, France, and Austin, Texasworked on the game.

The game supports a different interface for Microsoft Windows users to that for the console versions, and also supports the use of Xbox 360 controllers on Windows PCs. Smith described the team's philosophy of allowing its developers who are passionate about a particular release platform to develop software for it; those passionate about PC will work on developing that interface, while Xbox 360 aficionados were allowed to develop the <a href="Achievement%20%28Xbox%20360%29%23Gamerscore">Achievements for that platform</a>. "Dishonored" was officially <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Release%20to%20manufacturing%20.28RTM.29">released to manufacturing</a> on 28 September 2012.

The development team researched unexpected ways the player could combine Corvo's special powers, such as combining a high jump with the ability to teleport in order to travel greater distances than either ability allowed independently. Instead of restricting these exploits, the team tried to design levels to accommodate them. The designers did not consider all of the powers they conceived during development, such as a power to become a shadow that could move along walls, to be suitable for the game. Some existing powers went through several revisions: a version of "Bend Time" caused the player to unfreeze enemies when touched; "Possession" allowed the player to control a victim remotely without inhabiting their body, but this offered less challenge. Balancing the effectiveness of the player's powers was considered difficult. Colantonio said, "we wanted to give [the player] very strong powers, to make [the player] really a badass, but at the same time we didn't want the game to be too easy." Each power has a duration, mana cost, and other variable properties that allowed the team to effectively scale even the most destructive of abilities by making them costly to use frequently or limiting the time they remain active.

"Dishonored"s stealth system was originally based on that of the <a href="Thief%20%28series%29">"Thief" series</a>, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, it was decided that it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.

To design the missions, the designers began with a cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed. At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players. Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients. Discussing the use of violence and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting. The team came under pressure to excise a scene from the end of the game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody – you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars – you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero... We decided that sounds psychotic. It doesn’t match our values... What we wanted was to let you express yourself in the game, but to have the world react to that, at least in some way. [Samuel], betraying you and firing off that flare, was something we had to fight for."

"Dishonored" was originally set in medieval Japan, but the idea was dropped early in the game's development because of the difficulties presented in marketing the setting, and because no member of the design team knew much about the culture. Arkane moved the setting to London in 1666, considering that the city was recognizable to Europeans and Americans. Later designs inspired by added gameplay mechanics such as floodlights, electrified barriers and 20th-century technologies that it no longer resembled London, and Arkane opted to develop a fictional city. The city of Dunwall, designed to be a "contemporary and cool" "period piece", was inspired by late-19th and early-20th-century London and Edinburgh. Describing why London had been an initial setting and remained a significant inspiration, Smith said:

Antonov described his inspiration from London as "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense ... and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans." He highlighted the importance of that familiarity to different cultures because "you want to communicate to a lot of people when you make a new piece of fiction." He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of <a href="steampunk">steampunk</a> design. Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint ... if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?" Inspiration also came from the artwork of <a href="John%20Atkinson%20Grimshaw">John Atkinson Grimshaw</a>, <a href="Canaletto">Canaletto</a>, and <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>. The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place.

In-game characters were inspired by illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as "<a href="Captain%20Blood%20%28novel%29">Captain Blood</a>" (1922), the work of <a href="Charles%20Dana%20Gibson">Charles Dana Gibson</a>, and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia. An anatomy expert helped ensure the <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of character faces represented Great Britain, while Arkane maintained a sense of realism and political incorrectness. Mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich, poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for example, have small heads, low shoulders, and big hands, with animations that blend human and monkey movements. Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the in-game art.

The designers conceived the Tallboys as <a href="town%20crier">town crier</a>s. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role was replaced with loudspeakers throughout Dunwall. The Tallboy design evolved into a <a href="lamplighter">lamplighter</a> that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow. Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city. For other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.

The Heart is a human heart modified with technology and the supernatural, that helps the player to find collectible items in the levels, and "plays a part related to informing [the player's] decisions about when to apply violence or not, making it a really interesting, more subtle part of the power fantasy." The Heart provides contextual verbal feedback to the player, offering insight into a particular location, the secrets or history of a character, and its own origins. The Heart was originally designed as a method of identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed into the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda. As a result of player-conducted testing of the game, the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required. The Heart's gameplay role continued to change, and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters, which helped to reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialogue. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.

The Hound Pits pub, which acts as a base for the player, was initially a larger structure. Filling out the interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount of climbing made navigation confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely. The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production until the end of the development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.

<a href="Daniel%20Licht">Daniel Licht</a> composed the game's score—an ambient, violin-heavy presentation designed to represent 19th-century London. Licht's score is designed to make the player feel unsettled, and not provide comfort. He described the music as an "evil fog" that fades in and out of the game without being initiated by any scripted moments or to warn of impending danger, instead creating the impression of ever-present danger. As "Dishonored" features few cinematic scenes that allowed for long interactions with any particular character, Licht found himself limited in developing specific character themes, and instead focused largely on composing ambient music. Samples of Licht's ambient themes were used in the game's few cinematic scenes, although Licht was not involved in scoring them. Licht conceived the score as a mixture of older music befitting the period setting, and 20th-century techniques such as reversed sounds. "Dishonored"s credit song, "Honor for All", was written by Licht and his nephew Jon, who also provided the track's vocals. It was written as a reward for players who had finished the game.

"Dishonored" was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 platforms in North America and France on 9 October 2012, on 11 October in Australia, and on 12 October in the rest of Europe. Celebrating the North American launch, Smith, Colantonio, and other Arkane Studios staff members from the company's office in Austin, Texas, signed copies of the game at a local <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> store. A "Game of the Year" edition, containing all released <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC), was released in October 2013. The "Definitive Edition", a remastered version of the game featuring improved graphics, and all released DLC was released on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in August 2015.

Bethesda Softworks developed a spin-off <a href="iOS">iOS</a> game, "Dishonored: Rat Assassin", which it released free of charge on 30 August 2012. The game requires players to use a knife and crossbow to kill rats while avoiding bombs. "Rat Assassin" was well received for the variety and quantity of content provided, but received some criticism for dark visuals, that made it difficult to see the rats. The game drew frequent comparisons to another mobile game, "<a href="Fruit%20Ninja">Fruit Ninja</a>".

As part of the game's promotion, Bethesda employed <a href="COPILOT%20Music%20and%20Sound">COPILOT Music and Sound</a> to develop the ominous "The Drunken Whaler", a modified version of the sea shanty "<a href="Drunken%20Sailor">Drunken Sailor</a>." Copilot decided to use ordinary children to sing the lyrics instead of a professional youth choir, aiming to achieve a dark, haunting quality to the music. However, they found it difficult to recruit children from local schools to sing about slit throats and hungry rats, and instead used child actors, adult singers who could imitate children, and the children of their friends. Instruments included violins, detuned and distorted guitars, and a "whaler stomp" created by the team, who stamped on wooden boards to create a pulsating sound. "The Drunken Whaler" appeared in the game's trailer and attracted a positive reception during its presentation at the 2012 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3). Following its debut, the trailer was watched over 850,000 times on YouTube, and it was awarded the <a href="Machinima">Machinima</a> Best Trailer award.

A set of three animated videos, titled "Tales from Dunwall", serving as a prequel to "Dishonored", were released in September 2012. The videos show the discovery of whale-oil fuel, the Outsider granting his mark to a small boy in search of revenge, and Piero creating Corvo's mask. All three videos were created by animation studio <a href="Psyop%20%28company%29">Psyop</a> and marketing firm Rokkan, narrated by Chloë Grace Moretz, and scored by Daniel Licht. Each "Tales from Dunwall" episode received a gold <a href="Clio%20Awards">Clio Award</a> for achievement in advertising. In the same month, the game was used as inspiration for prosthetic makeup effects on the television reality show "<a href="Face%20Off%20%28TV%20series%29">Face Off</a>".

A variety of pre-order incentives were announced for the game, including a "Dishonored"-themed, 72-card deck of <a href="Tarot">Tarot</a> cards, a USB whale-oil lamp, and a smartphone decal. DLC incentives offered in-game packs for the player character, including the "Arcane Assassin", "Shadow Rat", "Backstreet Butcher", and "Acrobatic Killer" packs that offer enhancements for the player character's abilities, money, and a statue of one of the game's creatures.

"Dunwall City Trials", the game's first post-release DLC, was released on 11 December 2012, and contains 10 challenge maps. The player must defeat waves of enemies, complete time-trial challenges, and perform a series of drop assassinations in which the player kills a target by dropping from a location above the target.

Two story-based campaign DLC packs were announced in October 2012 for release in 2013, and follow the assassin Daud as he seeks redemption for murdering Empress Jessamine in "Dishonored"s main story.

The first expansion, "The Knife of Dunwall" was released on 16 April 2013, on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. It features Daud (again voiced by Michael Madsen) as a playable character, with his own abilities including: "Void Gaze", which combines the functions of Corvo's "Dark Vision" with those of The Heart, guiding Daud to runes and bone charms; his own version of "Blink", which allows him to pause time; and an ability which allows Daud to summon his assassin followers. Additionally, Daud also has his own gadgets, such as stun mines, a concealed wrist-mounted bow, "Chokedust" grenade, which dazes enemies; and arc mines that disintegrate enemies. "The Knife of Dunwall"s plot runs parallel to that of "Dishonored"s, providing Daud's perspective on events, and introduces new locations, such as a whale slaughterhouse and Dunwall's affluent legal district. "The Knife of Dunwall" also features an additional difficulty level, "Master Assassin", which is made available after completing the content. "Dishonored" designer Ricardo Bare served as the content's creative director.

The second and final expansion is titled "The Brigmore Witches" and was released on 13 August 2013. "The Brigmore Witches" follows Daud's quest to stop the eponymous witches from enacting a powerful ritual that will doom him, and concludes with Daud's ultimate fate at the hands of Corvo in the core game. The DLC carries over player choices and upgrades from a "The Knife of Dunwall" saved game.

"Dishonored" was displayed for the public at the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), and received four nominations from the <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a> for Best Action/Adventure Game, Best Console Game, Best Original Game, and the overall Best of Show award. The game was also recognized at the event for: "Game of Show" by <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, and Joystiq Editor-in-Chief Ludwig Keitzmann, and was nominated by Destructoid and EGM; "Best Action Game" by GameSpy, and EGM, and nominated by Destructoid; "Best of E3 2012 Editors' Choice Award" by <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>; and "Most Original Game" by G4TV. Other recognition included: "Best of Show" by <a href="Digital%20Trends">Digital Trends</a>; "Best of E3 Selection" by Yahoo Games and <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>; "The Best Game at E3" by Cinema Blend; and "Top 10 Game of E3" by "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" magazine and "<a href="Stuff%20%28magazine%29">Stuff</a>"; <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a> listed the "Blink" ability as one of the "Top 27 Game Ideas" at the event. Jurors from the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Association">Entertainment Software Association</a> and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a> selected "Regent", a piece of artwork for the game by artist Sergey Kolesov, to be one of 16 works for the 2012 Into the Pixel art exhibition. At the 2012 <a href="Gamescom">Gamescom</a> trade fair in August 2012, the game won the award for "Best of Gamescom" and "Best Console Game" for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms. For the same event, <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> named "Dishonored" as its "Game of the Show." Attendees of the 2012 <a href="Eurogamer%20Expo">Eurogamer Expo</a> named it the number-one game of the show.

"Dishonored" received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review website <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> provides an average rating of 91% based on 14 reviews for the Microsoft Windows version, 90% based on 32 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version, and 89% based on 38 reviews for the Xbox 360 version. <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> provides a score of 91 out of 100 from 29 critics for the Microsoft Windows version, 89 out of 100 from 35 critics for the PlayStation 3 version, and 88 out of 100 from 56 critics for the Xbox 360 version.

"Dishonored"s plot received a polarized response, with many reviewers praising the standalone stories driving each mission, but criticizing the game's overarching narrative. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Cam Shea said it is "a shame that "Dishonored"'s story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts", and added, ""Dishonored" is a game you'll talk with your friends about." "Eurogamer"s Dan Whitehead, <a href="The%20Verge">The Verge</a>'s Arthur Gies, and <a href="Giant%20Bomb">Giant Bomb</a>'s Patrick Klepek criticized the end of the game for its generic missions, "late narrative missteps", and abrupt ending. Klepek also criticized the repetitive ambient dialogue in the missions. Whitehead also stated that the unique, inventive, and distinctive missions allowed for memorable gameplay that subverted the overarching story. <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>'s Alexander Sliwinski was disappointed by the abrupt ending, and that the story did not explore much of the developed world of Dunwall, but said that the overall experience left him wanting more. In contrast, <a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>'s Susan Arendt wrote that the story was well paced, and "<a href="Shacknews">Shacknews</a>"s John Keefer stated that it was emotionally immersing and is "role-playing at its story-driven finest", but added that some plot points were not properly explained or developed.

The gameplay was generally praised for giving players freedom to use differing methods to complete objectives and to explore the levels. Keefer wrote that in-game mechanics like the powers and equipment are not essential and did not detract from the story, but served as optional bonuses in levels that can be completed with creativity and cleverness. He also said that some missions offered too much freedom without guidance, leaving the player lost on how to proceed. According to Gies, the game can initially seem unstructured from a level-design perspective, but after exploring them it becomes clear about how much thought went into different actions a player can take, allowing them to experiment instead of focusing on rigid objective-driven design. GameSpot's Chris Watters enjoyed the various pathways and methods of traversing each level with "compelling abilities", particularly the "Blink" power, and the freedom of choice which he said made "Dishonored" "one of the truly remarkable games of" 2012. Arendt said that the game's flexibility was also a shortcoming, with certain playing styles favoring certain abilities that when fully upgraded, preclude the desire to explore levels for further enhancements and resources. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Joe Juba also wrote that the game punishes players for taking certain paths, particularly one of violence, which results in more difficult gameplay and a perceived less satisfying ending, encouraging stealth over alternatives. "Kotaku"s Jason Schreier contrasted "Dishonored" with other contemporary video games, and said that where other games may require a player to find a specific solution to defeat an enemy or solve a puzzle, "Dishonored" "feels like entering a designer's playpen", providing the player with an array of tools and then allowing them to experiment with how they interact with, or break, the world.

Reviewers also said that the game's variety encourages replaying. "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" Alex Dale praised the variety and replayability of the game, and said, ""Dishonored" doesn't demand you see everything it has to offer, although it is compulsive enough to ensure you will." <a href="News.com.au">News.com.au's</a> William Colvin wrote that the game's only shortcoming could be that it offered too many options, and Watters stated the game achieves a rare feat of being "compulsively replayable." Problems in the player's control of Corvo were raised; Whitehead noted the controls were unresponsive when used in contextual situations. Sliwinski said that the controls worked well.

Reviewers criticized the AI, which some found inconsistent. Whitehead criticized his experience of enemies that can see Corvo from a great distance yet sometimes remain unaware of him while in his enemies' peripheral vision. Juba criticized the inconsistent detection by enemies that lead to unpredictable and unreliable stealth mechanics that could force stealth-focused players into a combat situation, for which their character is not built. According to <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>'s Jake Gaskill, the AI worked well in combat, with enemies employing different tactics and effectively countering attacks, but when not alerted, enemies would ignore actions directly in front of them. Watters also mentioned lulls in enemy intelligence, but he said that it remained tenacious enough to keep the enemies formidable.

The game's visuals and design were generally praised; Gaskill said that the art style is unique and the game world is both vivid and fully realized, and Gies stated that the game has a "unifying vision and design that stands apart from its contemporaries as something different." Colvin described "Dishonored" as "a triumph for the medium ... that sets the benchmark for visuals, story, and character performance", and that it is "easily the best looking game you'll play this year." Juba found the "steampunk-inspired" technology designs fascinating, and stated that the visual style and art direction offer a distinct aesthetic that accompanies the "dark and disturbing" lore found in the city.

Reviewers likened "Dishonored" to well-received games from the early 2000s such as "Deus Ex" and the "Thief" video game series. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>"s Tom Hoggins said it is like the "thinking man's games [from] the turn of the century which cherished player choice and control", comparing it against contemporary "noisy, brash thrill-rides obsessed with military ooh-rah and barely interactive set pieces." Dale called "Dishonored" "one of the greatest games of this generation", and wrote that it excelled by drawing inspiration from older games and allowing players to figure out solutions without advice. Dale also called it the first true stealth game for a long time, and the closest comparison to "Thief" in the current generation of games. Schreier stated that the game blends "the do-what-you-want structure of "Deus Ex" with the masterful world design of "BioShock"."

The first installment of the story-based DLC "The Knife of Dunwall" was praised for its level design, which encouraged exploration to find hidden content and alternative routes through areas. The modifications to certain abilities, particularly Blink were similarly well received for the changes they brought to the gameplay from the main game. The story, however, was generally criticized. <a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a> noted that the deadly assassin Daud had no motive for seeking redemption, and allowing him to be played as a non-lethal character created a disconnect with the narrative. IGN considered that it felt like only half of a complete game, lacking any urgency in its story and featuring a disappointing conclusion. "The Brigmore Witches" story received a mixed response, with Destructoid saying that it offered a more gripping narrative, while Polygon stated that it lacked the same tension as "The Knife of Dunwall", and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying. However, the gameplay was generally considered an improvement, providing more intricate level design and nuanced world building that produced gameplay requiring a more thoughtful approach. PC Gamer appreciated that the levels each had a distinct theme, and adequately provided for both stealth and violent gameplay, while Polygon said that only the last level improved over the preceding DLC, introducing new mechanics that forced changes in stealth players.

In the week before its release (30 September6 October), the game was the third best-selling game on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>, based on pre-orders. During the first week of sales in the United Kingdom, "Dishonored" became the second best-selling game on all available formats behind "<a href="FIFA%2013">FIFA 13</a>" (in its third week), the number-one selling PC game, and the biggest launch of an original game in 2012, exceeding "<a href="Sleeping%20Dogs%20%28video%20game%29">Sleeping Dogs</a>".

Dermotherium

Dermotherium is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="fossil">fossil</a> mammals closely related to the living <a href="colugo">colugo</a>s, a small group of <a href="Flying%20and%20gliding%20animals%23Mammals">gliding</a> mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D. major from the <a href="Late%20Eocene">Late Eocene</a> of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, based on a single fragment of the lower jaw, and D. chimaera from the <a href="Late%20Oligocene">Late Oligocene</a> of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the <a href="Early%20Oligocene">Early Oligocene</a> of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to "D. chimaera". All sites where fossils of "Dermotherium" have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.

Some features of the teeth differentiate "Dermotherium" from both living colugo species, but other features are shared with only one of the two. The third lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>, lower <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a>, and third lower <a href="premolar">premolar</a> at least are <a href="wikt%3Apectinate">pectinate</a> or comblike, bearing longitudinal rows of <a href="wikt%3Atine">tines</a> or <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a>, an unusual feature of colugos (the first two lower incisors are unknown in "Dermotherium"). The fourth lower premolar instead resembles the lower molars. The front part of these teeth, the <a href="trigonid">trigonid</a>, is broader in "D. chimaera" than in "D. major", which is known only from the second and third lower molars. The two species also differ in the configuration of the inner back corner of the lower molars. The upper molars are triangular teeth bearing a number of distinct small cusps, particularly on the second upper molar, and with wrinkled <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>.

<a href="Colugo">Colugo</a>s are a small group of Southeast Asian <a href="gliding">gliding</a> mammals closely related to the <a href="primate">primate</a>s. Their <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> is exceptionally poor. Although <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> groups such as the <a href="Plagiomenidae">Plagiomenidae</a> are considered by some to be closely related to colugos, no fossils undoubtedly referable to the living colugo <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, Cynocephalidae, had been reported until 1992. In that year, Stéphane Ducrocq and colleagues described a jaw fragment from the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> of Thailand as a new <a href="genus">genus</a> and <a href="species">species</a> of colugo, "Dermotherium major". In 2000, however, Brian Stafford and Frederick Szalay argued that "Dermotherium" might not be a colugo, since the fossil is so poorly preserved that few traits can be unambiguously recognized and some purported dermopteran features of the fossil are in fact also seen in other <a href="placental">placental</a> groups. Mary Silcox and colleagues reaffirmed the colugo affinities of "Dermotherium" in 2005 on the basis of detailed similarities in <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> morphology.

In 2006, Laurent Marivaux and colleagues described a second species of "Dermotherium", "D. chimaera", from material from the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> of Thailand. They gave it the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "chimaera" (Latin for "chimera") because it shares characters with both the <a href="Philippine%20colugo">Philippine colugo</a> ("Cynocephalus volans") and <a href="Sunda%20colugo">Sunda colugo</a> ("Galeopterus variegatus"), the two living colugo species. In addition, they tentatively identified a fossil from the Oligocene of Pakistan as "Dermotherium chimaera" and regarded some fossils from the Eocene of Myanmar as indeterminate dermopterans. According to a <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis carried out by Marivaux and colleagues, "D. chimaera", "D. major", and the Myanmar dermopteran are successive <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a>s of the two living colugos.

Known material of "Dermotherium" includes a handful of jaw fragments and isolated teeth. "Dermotherium major" is known only from a fragment of the left lower jaw bearing the third lower molar (m3) and a poorly preserved second lower molar (m2). The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of "Dermotherium chimaera" is a lower jaw fragment in which remnants of the <a href="deciduous%20dentition">deciduous</a> third lower <a href="premolar">premolar</a> are visible. <a href="X-ray%20microtomography">X-ray microtomography</a> reveals the <a href="tooth%20eruption">unerupted</a> lower third <a href="incisor">incisor</a> (i3), <a href="canine%20%28tooth%29">canine</a> (c1), third premolar (p3), and fourth premolar (p4) still inside the jaw. In addition, this species is known from two other jaw fragments, one bearing m1 and m2 and the other bearing m2 and m3, and two isolated molars, an upper first and second molar (M1 and M2). The tentatively referred material of this species from Pakistan includes a single M2.

The two species of "Dermotherium" were about as large as the Philippine colugo and larger than the Sunda colugo and differed from both in a number of characteristics of the dentition. Not enough is known of the skeleton of "Dermotherium" to assess whether the animal already possessed the gliding adaptations of living colugos. The two species are similar in size, but again differ in details of the dentition. In two specimens of "D. chimaera", the length and width of the m2 are 5 and 4.3 mm and 5.4 and 4.8 mm respectively; this tooth is 5.4 mm long and 4.9 mm wide in the only known specimen of "Dermotherium major". The Pakistani M2 of "Dermotherium" is 4.3 mm long and 6 mm wide, compared to 4.7 and 6.6 mm in the only known M2 of "D. chimaera" from Thailand.

The lower jaw of "Dermotherium major" resembles that of living colugos in the presence of a strong <a href="angular%20process">angular process</a> (a projecting piece of bone at the lower side of the back of the jawbone) and a <a href="retromolar%20space">retromolar space</a> (a flat space behind the last molars). The <a href="coronoid%20process%20of%20the%20mandible">coronoid process</a> (a projecting piece of bone directly behind the molars) rises steeply, with its front wall virtually vertical.

The i3 of "Dermotherium chimaera" is an elongate tooth bearing six tines (narrow, high "fingers" as in a comb) arranged from front to back. The frontmost is larger, the next four are about equal in size, and the sixth is smaller. The number of tines resembles that seen in the Sunda colugo, which has four to seven; the Philippine colugo has three to five. The c1 is also an elongate, narrow tooth; at the front, it is slightly curved towards the midline of the jaw. On the buccal (outer) side of this tooth are six <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a>, of which the third (counting from the front) is the largest. The p3 is similarly elongate and rounded at the front, but it is broader at the back, forming a <a href="talonid">talonid</a> (a "heel" of cusps at the back of a <a href="tribosphenic%20tooth">tribosphenic tooth</a>). There are six cusps on the narrow anterior part of the tooth, and the fifth (identified as the <a href="protoconid">protoconid</a>) is by far the largest. On the buccal side of the talonid is a strong cusp, the <a href="hypoconid">hypoconid</a>, with a crest, the <a href="cristid%20obliqua">cristid obliqua</a>, descending from it towards the front. A second, smaller cusp, the <a href="hypoconulid">hypoconulid</a>, is present on the lingual side of the talonid, connected to the hypoconid by a <a href="postcristid">postcristid</a>. The <a href="wikt%3Apectinate">pectinate</a> (comb-like) shape of the anterior teeth is a shared characteristic of the colugos and highly unusual among mammals. "Dermotherium chimaera" resembles the Sunda colugo in that the c1 and p3 are also pectinate; in the Philippine colugo, these teeth are not pectinate.

In "Dermotherium chimaera", the p4 and m1 through m3 are similar to each other (and unlike the i3, canine, and p3) and appear to form a series of decreasing size from front to back. In "D. major", only m2 and m3 are known, but they are similar in morphology and m3 is smaller than m2. In the Sunda colugo, however, the teeth get larger from p4 to m3. The p4 and molars have a distinct <a href="trigonid">trigonid</a> (a triangular group of cusps at the front of a tribosphenic tooth) and talonid. The trigonid contains strong protoconid and <a href="metaconid">metaconid</a> cusps. The metaconid is stronger than the protoconid in the molars, but it is not clear whether this is the case in the p4. In the living colugos, the protoconid is higher than the metaconid in both p4 and m1. The trigonid is longer in the p4 than in the molars. In "D. chimaera", the trigonid is broader than in "D. major". A low crest, the <a href="paracristid">paracristid</a>, descends from the protoconid lingually and towards the front, forming the front margin of the trigonid; there is no distinct cusp (a <a href="paraconid">paraconid</a>) at the front of the trigonid on the p4, but this cusp is present in the molars.

The talonid contains a hypoconid, hypoconulid, and <a href="entoconid">entoconid</a> and is much wider than the trigonid because the hypoconid is displaced buccally. A cristid obliqua descends from the hypoconid and reaches the protoconid. Although a crest, the <a href="postmetacristid">postmetacristid</a>, descends from the back side of the metaconid, ending in a small cusp, the <a href="metastylid">metastylid</a>, it is separated from the entoconid by a notch. The living colugos lack such a strong postmetacristid. The hypoconulid is near the back lingual margin of the tooth, behind the entoconid. In "D. major", this cusp is further to the back than in both "D. chimaera" and the Sunda colugo, while the two cusps are merged in the Philippine colugo. In "D. chimaera", a low crest, the <a href="post-hypoconulid%20cristid">post-hypoconulid cristid</a>, reaches from the hypoconulid to the back lingual corner of the tooth, where a small cuspule, the <a href="distocuspid">distocuspid</a>, is located. A long crest, the postcristid, connects the distocuspid to the hypoconid along the posterior side of the tooth. The Philippine colugo is similar, but in "D. major", both the distocuspid and the post-hypoconulid cristid are absent, and the Sunda colugo has a weaker distocuspid and a postcristid that does not reach further lingually than the hypoconulid.

The upper molars of "Dermotherium chimaera" are triangular in overall shape and much broader than long, with the narrow end of the triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in "D. chimaera" is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the buccal side of the tooth, the <a href="paracone">paracone</a> and <a href="metacone">metacone</a>, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. "D. chimaera" resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone and in front of the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A <a href="cingulum%20%28tooth%29">cingulum</a> (shelf) is present on the buccal margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the <a href="paraconule">paraconule</a> and <a href="metaconule">metaconule</a>, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the <a href="protocone">protocone</a>, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in "D. chimaera". Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a buccal direction. These crests end in small cusps (<a href="protoconule">protoconule</a>s) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos.

"Dermotherium major" was found in a <a href="lignite">lignite</a> pit known as Wai Lek in <a href="Krabi%20Province">Krabi Province</a>, southwestern Thailand. It is part of the <a href="Krabi%20Basin">Krabi Basin</a> fauna, which contains at least 40 mammalian genera, mostly <a href="artiodactyl">artiodactyl</a>s but also including some primates, such as "<a href="Siamopithecus">Siamopithecus</a>", "<a href="Wailekia">Wailekia</a>", and "<a href="Muangthanhinius">Muangthanhinius</a>". This fauna has been dated to about 33 to 35 million years ago, during the <a href="Late%20Eocene">Late Eocene</a>.

Fossils of "Dermotherium chimaera" come from <a href="Phetchaburi%20Province">Phetchaburi Province</a>, further to the north in Thailand. The fossil deposits, located in the Cha Prong pit in a coal mine called <a href="Nong%20Ya%20Plong">Nong Ya Plong</a>, are dated to the <a href="Late%20Oligocene">Late Oligocene</a>. Other mammals found here include the rodent "<a href="Fallomus%20ladakhensis">Fallomus ladakhensis</a>", the rhinoceros <a href="Diceratherium">"Diceratherium" sp. cf. "D. lamilloquense"</a>, the <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>n "<a href="Chaprongictis%20phetchaburiensis">Chaprongictis phetchaburiensis</a>", the <a href="lipotyphla">lipotyphla</a>n "<a href="Siamosorex%20debonisi">Siamosorex debonisi</a>", and a <a href="pteropodid">pteropodid</a> bat.

<a href="Paali%20Nala">Paali Nala</a>, where the M2 tentatively assigned to "Dermotherium chimaera" was found, is in the <a href="Bugti%20Hills">Bugti Hills</a> of <a href="Balochistan">Balochistan</a>, western Pakistan. The fossil locality, placed <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphically</a> in the <a href="Bugti%20Member">Bugti Member</a> of the <a href="Chitarwata%20Formation">Chitarwata Formation</a>, is thought to be <a href="Early%20Oligocene">Early Oligocene</a> in age. The Paali Nala fauna also contains a diverse array of mammals, including many rodents, some primates, and rhinos.

The specializations of dermopterans are such that they are dependent on a forested habitat, and reconstructions of the paleoenvironments at Krabi, Nong Ya Plong, and Paali Nala suggest that all three fossil deposits developed in a humid, tropical forest environment. Their extinction in the Indian subcontinent may have been caused by the development of a drier climate there during the Late Oligocene.

Thaddeus McCotter 2012 presidential campaign

<a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> <a href="Thaddeus%20McCotter">Thaddeus McCotter</a> of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> unsuccessfully sought the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012</a> nomination for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. He announced his intention to run when he filed papers with the <a href="Federal%20Election%20Commission">Federal Election Commission</a> on July 1, 2011, and officially declared his candidacy the next day at a <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> festival near <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>.

McCotter, who had served in Congress since 2003, was first mentioned as a potential presidential candidate on an April 2011 episode of <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a>' "<a href="Red%20Eye%20w/%20Greg%20Gutfeld">Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld</a>". After entering the race two months later, McCotter based his campaign on "five core principles" listed on his campaign website, and used the slogan "Seize Freedom!", derived from the title of his 2011 book. During the campaign, he focused on government reform and <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a>.

Commentators noted that McCotter's lack of <a href="name%20recognition">name recognition</a> hindered his chances for nomination. When included in <a href="Nationwide%20opinion%20polling%20for%20the%20Republican%20Party%202012%20presidential%20primaries">Republican presidential preference polls</a>, he regularly received less than one percent support. Following a last-place finish in the <a href="Ames%20Straw%20Poll">Ames Straw Poll</a> and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he dropped his candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a>. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a <a href="television%20pilot">television pilot</a>, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 <a href="Thaddeus%20McCotter%232012%20Congressional%20campaign%20and%20petition%20scandal">amid a fraud investigation</a> surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.

Thaddeus McCotter began his political career upon election to the <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a> (Michigan) Commission in 1993. Five years later, he left that position after winning a seat in the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Senate">Michigan State Senate</a>. He remained there until 2002 when elected to serve <a href="Michigan%27s%2011th%20congressional%20district">Michigan's 11th congressional district</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. 

In Congress, leadership assigned McCotter to the <a href="House%20Financial%20Services%20Committee">House Financial Services Committee</a>. In addition, he joined the moderate <a href="Republican%20Main%20Street%20Partnership">Republican Main Street Partnership</a>. In 2006, he attained the chairmanship of the <a href="House%20Republican%20Policy%20Committee">House Republican Policy Committee</a>, and two years later was named head of his party's Fiscal Integrity Task Force. On the task force, he gained a reputation as a leading opponent of <a href="pork%20barrel">pork barrel</a> spending. He voted against the <a href="Emergency%20Economic%20Stabilization%20Act%20of%202008">Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008</a> and the <a href="Affordable%20Health%20Care%20for%20America%20Act">Affordable Health Care for America Act of 2010</a>, but supported the <a href="Effects%20of%20the%202008%E2%80%9310%20automotive%20industry%20crisis%20on%20the%20United%20States">bailout</a> of the automobile industry in 2009. He also supported an increase in the <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a> and advocated <a href="fair%20trade">fair trade</a> with <a href="China">China</a>. Nevertheless, the "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" described him as a "conservative's conservative" and <a href="GovTrack">GovTrack</a> labeled him a "far-right Republican".

McCotter was also known as an "oddball" in Congress, displaying a wry sense of humor. Betsy Woodruff of "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>" identified him as "the strangest Congressman." Showing a fondness for <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>, he played lead guitar in the <a href="Second%20Amendments">Second Amendments</a>, and quoted <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> lyrics on the floor of the House. President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> referred to him as "that rock and roll dude." Moreover, McCotter frequently appeared on <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a>' late night/early morning show "<a href="Red%20Eye%20w/%20Greg%20Gutfeld">Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld</a>". According to <a href="Matt%20Lewis%20%28journalist%29">Matt Lewis</a> of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Caller">The Daily Caller</a>", McCotter was "The Red Eye candidate", who represented a subculture of "creative think[ing]" <a href="libertarian">libertarian</a>-leaning Republicans, who enjoy rock music. "<a href="Bloomberg%20Businessweek">Bloomberg Businessweek</a>" described his celebrity as a "tiny cult following of insomniac conservatives."

Speculation about a presidential run began several months after the release of his February 2011 book "Seize Freedom! American Truths and Renewal in a Chaotic Age". The first instance occurred during the April 22 episode of "Red Eye", where host <a href="Greg%20Gutfeld">Greg Gutfeld</a> asked McCotter to enter the presidential race. Five days later, political commentator and fellow "Red Eye" frequenter <a href="S.%20E.%20Cupp">S. E. Cupp</a> listed McCotter as a potential candidate in her "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" column. McCotter confirmed in May that he was seriously considering a run for the presidency. He told the newspaper "<a href="Politico">Politico</a>" he felt most Republicans lacked enthusiasm for the current crop of candidates. Commentator <a href="Andrew%20Breitbart">Andrew Breitbart</a> expressed excitement at the prospect of a McCotter run. Describing him as "blunt, sarcastic, pop-culture-savvy, constitutionally sound and an authentic voice," Breitbart remarked no one I'd like to see more at a debate than McCotter."

In May 2011, speculation increased as McCotter attacked Republican frontrunner <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> as Romney visited Detroit. He connected Romney to President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, arguing that people see Romney and Obama as <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a>s rather than as rivals. Later that month, he addressed the <a href="Republican%20Leadership%20Conference">Republican Leadership Conference</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> and entered the event's <a href="straw%20poll">straw poll</a>. Out of the cast, he received two, last place among those considered. At this time, McCotter remained undecided about a run, according to his aides, though he paid $18,000 for a prime spot at the August 13 <a href="Ames%20Straw%20Poll">Ames Straw Poll</a>. During a visit to Iowa, the first <a href="Iowa%20caucuses">caucus state</a>, McCotter announced he would reveal his campaign plans prior to the straw poll. On June 30, "Politico" reported McCotter was ready to begin a campaign.

McCotter filed a presidential campaign committee statement with the <a href="Federal%20Election%20Commission">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) and opened a campaign website on July 1, 2011. The website, which warned "your American Dream is endangered" was based on his book "Seize Freedom!" and listed "five core principles". These were: 
McCotter officially announced his candidacy at the <a href="WAAM">WAAM</a>-sponsored "Freedom Festival" in <a href="Whitmore%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Whitmore Lake, Michigan</a> on July 2. He declared, "what we need in Washington is someone who understands that the wave of the future is not big government, but self-government". He played with his rock band at the event. Upon his entrance, <a href="Charlie%20Cook">Charlie Cook</a> of "<a href="The%20Cook%20Political%20Report">The Cook Political Report</a>" rated McCotter's chances of nomination as "virtually impossible". "<a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a>" and other outlets commented on McCotter's lack of name recognition and described him as a "little-known" candidate. Nevertheless, the "Free Press" noted he had about $480,000 available in his congressional account to transfer to his presidential campaign account. Political communications operative <a href="Mark%20Corallo">Mark Corallo</a> was hired along with a core group of advisers that included former Senator <a href="Bill%20Frist">Bill Frist</a>'s chief of staff Eric Uelind, and former Iowa representative <a href="Christopher%20Rants">Christopher Rants</a>.

As McCotter embarked on his first official campaign trip to the first-in-the-nation <a href="New%20Hampshire%20primary">primary state</a> of <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, he received media attention for his hometown newspaper's reaction to his run. An editorial in "<a href="The%20Oakland%20Press">The Oakland Press</a>", based out of <a href="Oakland%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oakland County, Michigan</a>, wrote that the idea of a McCotter presidency "isn't a pleasant thought and is, in fact, a bit scary". It added, "the representative comes off as cold, arrogant and egotistical". Nevertheless, McCotter continued his campaign in New Hampshire, focusing on the "fundamental restructuring of government", and signing the <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony%20List">Susan B. Anthony List</a>'s Pro-Life Leadership Pledge. Radio host Chris Buck was hired as leader of operations in New Hampshire. 

McCotter returned to Iowa in mid-July for further campaign events. Around this time, <a href="Chris%20Cillizza">Chris Cillizza</a> of the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" placed McCotter's odds of winning the Ames Straw Poll at one hundred to one, last place among the candidates listed. A <a href="Harris%20Insights%20%26amp%3B%20Analytics">Harris poll</a> conducted found that of voters were not familiar with McCotter, and less than one percent supported him when matched against his fellow presidential contenders. In a hypothetical head to head matchup with President Obama, McCotter received , compared to for the President. To build support, McCotter used <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, with which he attempted to bypass the news media and connect directly with supporters. Campaign spokesman Randall Thompson stated that McCotter was "relying on social media...[and]...developed a very loyal following".

McCotter participated in the first-ever Twitter presidential debate, on July 20, against fellow candidates former <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20Mexico">governor</a> <a href="Gary%20Johnson">Gary Johnson</a>, businessman <a href="Herman%20Cain">Herman Cain</a>, representative <a href="Michele%20Bachmann">Michele Bachmann</a>, former <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a>, and former Senator <a href="Rick%20Santorum">Rick Santorum</a>. At one point, moderator S. E. Cupp asked whether President Obama was anti-<a href="Israel">Israel</a>, McCotter answered, "Obama's motivations are not the issue, the impact of his policies, both proposed and pursued, have strained our relationship" with Israel. When asked to comment on the U.S. role in the <a href="2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">2011 military intervention in Libya</a>, McCotter referred to the Obama administration's mission as "ill-defined," and argued for "no US boots on ground." However, he added the caveat, "once committed [to the mission], we can't abruptly withdraw."

In late July, during the height of the <a href="2011%20U.S.%20debt%20ceiling%20crisis">debt ceiling crisis</a>, McCotter canceled several appearances in Iowa and returned to Washington. He supported the plan of House Speaker <a href="John%20Boehner">John Boehner</a>, and voted in favor of the <a href="Budget%20Control%20Act%20of%202011">compromise bill</a>. He was the only presidential candidate in the House of Representatives to approve the bill in Congress since both fellow members Bachmann and <a href="Ron%20Paul">Ron Paul</a> voted against it.

Ahead of the Ames Straw Poll, McCotter had not reached the one percent polling threshold necessary to participate in the event's August 11 debate on Fox News. At the time, McCotter had little support, even at home. <a href="Public%20Policy%20Polling">Public Policy Polling</a> showed him with only five percent from Michigan Republicans, a figure pollsters described as rare coming from a candidate's homestate. With news of his standing, McCotter cancelled a scheduled stop in New Hampshire, and returned to his headquarters in Michigan to coordinate a debate inclusion effort. As part of the effort, the campaign filmed a <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> video in a kitchen, featuring McCotter making puns about food, and concluding with "Thanks, dude." The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described the video as "unfortunate". Despite the effort, McCotter did not meet the polling threshold and was excluded. He was the only candidate missing from the debate that had secured a spot on the ballot.

Just before the vote the Ames, McCotter addressed voters in what "Politico" described as "a slow, abstract, exceptionally sober speech". It drew little crowd reaction other than applause at the denunciation of the "regime in Beijing" and the proclamation, "I will not cede the 21st Century to a Communist, nuclear-armed dictatorship." At his tent, McCotter spent a large amount of time playing guitar. In the straw poll, he finished last among ten candidates, receiving or . Based on the $18,000 he paid for campaign space, the result corresponded to $514 per vote. Senior adviser Christopher Rants explained that the purpose of the straw poll "was not about votes, it was about introducing our candidate to the public in our first large forum... By any measure, we did that".

Three days after the straw poll, McCotter wrote an article in "National Review" outlining some of his economic plans. He advocated spending reductions, a twenty percent <a href="reserve%20requirement">reserve requirement</a> for banks to keep available as capital, and incentives to reduce home foreclosures. He campaigned in New Hampshire on August 19, and filmed "Conversation with the Candidate" for . The next day, he attended a party with S. E. Cupp for the Young Republicans of <a href="Seacoast%20Region%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">Seacoast</a>. He returned to Iowa for his last campaign stop in the state from August 24 to August 27. At the end of the month, McCotter appeared on the "<a href="Dennis%20Miller">Dennis Miller Show</a>" and talked about his exclusion from debates. He failed to meet the requirements for both the September 7 <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> and the September 12 <a href="CNN">CNN</a> debates. For the MSNBC debate, a candidate had to show one poll with four percent support. McCotter argued that while he did not meet this, in a <a href="Quinnipiac%20University%20Polling%20Institute">Quinnipiac poll</a>, he tied with Rick Santorum and <a href="Jon%20Huntsman%20Jr.">Jon Huntsman Jr.</a>, both of whom qualified. Other candidates who did not qualify included Gary Johnson and former Louisiana governor <a href="Buddy%20Roemer">Buddy Roemer</a>, who like McCotter, did not qualify for any televised debates.

McCotter continued his efforts to be included in the debates in September. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Daily%20Caller">The Daily Caller</a>" he said the other candidates "don't understand what's wrong with the economy, let alone how to fix it", and that foreign policy was not being discussed enough. He observed that since former <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Nations">United Nations ambassador</a> <a href="John%20R.%20Bolton">John R. Bolton</a> announced he would not run for president, foreign policy discussion had ceased. McCotter hoped the next president would select Bolton as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>.

On September 9, McCotter made his last campaign trip to New Hampshire, attending events for two days. He was supposed to appear in Iowa again five days later, but had to cancel due to a vote in Congress. While in Washington, he introduced a <a href="Grover%20Norquist">Grover Norquist</a>-backed <a href="Social%20Security%20%28United%20States%29">Social Security</a> <a href="Social%20Security%20debate%20in%20the%20United%20States">reform</a> plan, which would have created private accounts for those under of age with limited guaranteed government benefits. He called on the other GOP presidential candidates to release their plans on Social Security. Shortly thereafter, McCotter participated in the California Republican Convention. In a speech there, he criticized President Obama, arguing, "No matter how many times his campaign clown car crisscrosses America, we know that the most prosperous and equitable economy in human history was created by you, the American people, not by bureaucrats in Washington." At the event's straw poll, he received less than one percent of the vote. McCotter tried to gain entry into the September 22 Fox News debate, but reported via Twitter, has kindly advised me I will be excluded from the Orlando GOP POTUS debate."

On September 22, 2011, McCotter notified "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" he would withdraw from the presidential race. He explained it "was sort of death by media" because of the exclusion from the presidential debates, and argued "if they keep you out of the debates, you are out of the conversation and you can't run." He then released a statement in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, and called on the Republican Party to unite behind Romney as the most electable candidate. In the press release, McCotter also announced that he would run for re-election in his congressional district.

In reporting on the withdrawal, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote, "What's that? You've never heard of Thaddeus McCotter? Well, that's the main reason he's now a former candidate." Pundit <a href="Bill%20Ballenger">Bill Ballenger</a> of "Inside Michigan Politics" said that McCotter "really had no business running for president. If he wants to have any political future, endorsing Mitt Romney now is the smart thing to do." McCotter's neighbor, former <a href="Michigan%20Attorney%20General">Michigan Attorney General</a> <a href="Mike%20Cox%20%28U.S.%20politician%29">Mike Cox</a>, remarked, "He tried it out, obviously it wasn't working. And he's doing the rational thing and dropping out." <a href="Steve%20Kornacki">Steve Kornacki</a> of "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" summarized the overall campaign as "a cautionary tale about what can go wrong when your average backbench member of Congress becomes a minor cable news celebrity and mistakes it for having a genuine national following."

A few days after the campaign ended, "The Detroit News" asked McCotter whether he enjoyed his presidential campaign, he replied, "No. It was the worst of my life." Fundraising totals for the three months of McCotter's run were released to the FEC in October 2011. Overall, he raised $548,606 ($468,561 of which was transferred from authorized committees), paid $541,532 on expenses, and had a debt of $105,367. As of June 2013, a debt of $105,636 remains.

In an interview with "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" ahead of the <a href="Michigan%20Republican%20primary%2C%202012">Michigan primary</a> in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had the best chance to overcome the obstacles.

Though McCotter had decided to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the majority of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it "caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection," but McCotter rejected this as an "idiotic line of thinking." He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation. The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud.

A day prior to his resignation from Congress, "The Detroit News" reported that after ending his presidential campaign, McCotter took to writing a <a href="television%20pilot">television pilot</a> he titled, "Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown". It centered on McCotter as the host of a variety show with characters based on his congressional staffers, who made fun of his presidential campaign and discussed such risqué topics as sex, race, and bodily functions. In one scene in the script, S. E. Cupp guest stars; McCotter tries to conduct a serious interview with her, but the other characters make sexually explicit comments, leading Cupp to describe the show as a "train wreck." A former staffer released the work to the media to show what McCotter did while in office. In response, McCotter denied any wrongdoing, saying it had been largely composed in his garage as a way to get over his failed presidential campaign. He said the script was unfinished and had not authorized it for release, but decided to discuss it with "The News". He cited comedian <a href="Martin%20Mull">Martin Mull</a>'s short-lived 1977 show "<a href="Fernwood%202%20Night">Fernwood 2 Night</a>" as an inspiration, and revealed that he had planned to leave Congress in 2014 and was preparing for a future career.

Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents

Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and <a href="Printmaking">printmaker</a> <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer%20the%20Elder">Albrecht Dürer the Elder</a> (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of <a href="ageing">ageing</a>. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> painter.

They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or <a href="diptych">diptych</a> wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.

Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the <a href="Germanisches%20Nationalmuseum">Germanisches Nationalmuseum</a>'s 2012 exhibition "The Early Dürer".

The three-quarter view was widely used in southern German portraiture of the late-15th century. <a href="Rosary%20beads">Rosary beads</a> were often included to indicate the piousness and modesty of the sitters, although by the 16th century religious motifs and sentiments like this were falling out of fashion. Dürer distinguishes himself from his contemporaries through his tight and detailed focus on his parents' faces, a technique that draws comparison to the work of the first generation of <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish painters</a> active 50 years earlier. Albrecht the Elder had travelled to <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> and from working with Netherlandish artists had acquired a strong appreciation for the work of both <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. That he passed on this influence to his son is evident from the early use of <a href="silverpoint">silverpoint</a>, a medium which according to <a href="Erwin%20Panofsky">Erwin Panofsky</a> requires "an exceptional degree of confidence, accuracy and sensitive feeling for its successful handling".
Dürer would have been aware of <a href="Hans%20Pleydenwurff">Hans Pleydenwurff</a>'s portrait of the ageing Count Georg von Lowenstein, through his teacher Michael Wolgemut. Pleydenwurff's portrait was in turn likely influenced by van Eyck's 1438 "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Cardinal%20Niccol%C3%B2%20Albergati">Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati</a>". Von Fircks believes the portrait of Dürer's father took from Pleydenwurff's portrait, which she describes as a "highly detailed representation of [a] white haired old man, who defies the pains of growing old with an alert mind and an inner animation".

Von Fircks notes that Dürer's 1484 self-portrait was created with the use of a mirror while his most iconic work is a self-portrait; the 1500 "<a href="Self-Portrait%20%28D%C3%BCrer%2C%20Munich%29">Self-Portrait at Twenty-Eight</a>". From these she concludes that the "accurate observation and documentary recording" of both his own and his parents' appearances over time was not just a compulsion, but that is indicative of a deeper interest in the effects of time and age on human appearance. Although Dürer was fascinated by the effects of ageing on others, he seems to have had some hesitancy at examining how it might affect him personally. The self-portraits tend to be idealised and the 1500 portrait was his last. Later self-portraits are far more understated and executed in a 'secondary' media, such as his drawings of the "" and , which depicted an emaciated body during the time of the plague.

Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with <a href="Michael%20Wolgemut">Michael Wolgemut</a>, and would soon leave for <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> to travel as a <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.

The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript <a href="lacquer">lacquer</a>-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red <a href="imprimatura">imprimatura</a> with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.

Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.

Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to be the first of the two to be executed and, if so, is the earliest extant example of his son's painting. In contrast, a number of art historians have noted that his mother's portrait contains bland passages, especially around the eyes and may be a near-contemporary copy of a lost original. <a href="Lotte%20Brand%20Philip">Lotte Brand Philip</a> believes the clumsiness in the mother panel indicated that Dürer painted it first, as a youthful attempt at portraiture, and that Albrecht the Elder might have later "commissioned" his own portrait to pair with Barbara's. Recent technical examination of the two panels confirms that Barbara's portrait was painted later than her husband's.

Barbara Holper was the daughter of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper <a href="Arranged%20marriage">gave his daughter</a> into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote "This my pious Mother ... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard ... I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it."
Barbara is shown wearing a red dress and a matte white <a href="Bonnet%20%28headgear%29">bonnet</a> which fully covers her hair, indicating her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or <a href="Train%20%28clothing%29">train</a> which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge of her nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been "comely and of erect bearing". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood. At some point the panel was cut down at the left side, shifting the compositional balance and removing a portion of her shoulder and headdress.
The panel closely resembles Dürer's 1514 drawing "<a href="Portrait%20of%20the%20artist%27s%20mother%20at%20the%20age%20of%2063">Portrait of the artist's mother at the age of 63</a>". David Price writes of the drawing's "rough depiction of her flesh emaciated by old age", and the "existential piety in the cast of Barbara Dürer's right eye, which, almost unnaturally, directs her vision heavenward". Although Barbara is some 25 years older in the later drawing and by then terminally ill, the facial resemblance and pose are unmistakable. However, there is a dramatic difference between the relatively young looking 39-year-old woman in the diptych and the aged and terminally ill widow in the 1514 drawing. A family resemblance can be detected between both works and Dürer's Vienna self-portrait; most evidently around the mouth. Kemperdick concludes that these passages are so closely modeled that it is reasonable to presume they were drawn by the same hand, but is conservative in saying definitively that the sitters were related by blood, as Dürer was very young, and though precociously talented, to some extent still reliant on facial "types".

Dürer's father wears a dark shirt, russet coat and a black hat lined with fur. His skin is slack at the mouth and chin, and he has small, intelligent eyes, which Von Fircks describes as "dark and serious". Their curves echo those of the heavy lids beneath. His eyes are lined with crow's feet and shadowed with brown <a href="Hatching">hatched</a> paint. His facial features are built from brush strokes more typical of drawing than painting—at this young age Dürer was a far more skilled draughtsman than painter. Technical analysis carried out in 2013 by Dagmar Hirschfelder revealed a detailed background which was over-painted by the artist. The abandoned interior space consisted of a corner of a room with an arched window looking out to a countryside view. This type of interior can be traced to the Netherlandish tradition, and is rare in German portraiture of the period. 

Albrecht the Elder's lips are thin and tightly pursed and his mouth is broad and down-turned, yet his features are those of a handsome man. <a href="Marcel%20Brion">Marcel Brion</a> described him as appearing "mild and thoughtful", an impression reinforced by the uncomplicated design of the painting. This view is reinforced by the relative drabness or simplicity of his clothes, which seem intended to convey a reserved, <a href="Asceticism">ascetic</a> piousness. Dürer presents his father more like a low-ranking <a href="Ecclesiology">ecclesiastic</a> than a tradesman: a calm, considerate and straightforward man dressed up in his best, albeit modest, clothes. After his father's death in 1502, Dürer wrote that Albrecht the Elder "passed his life in great toil and stern hard labour, having nothing for his support save what he earned with his hand for himself, his wife and his children ... He underwent manifold afflictions, trials and adversities. But he won just praise from all who knew him ... he was also of few words, and was a God-fearing man."

<a href="Martin%20Conway%2C%201st%20Baron%20Conway%20of%20Allington">Martin Conway</a> describes the portrayal of a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep "furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow". Conway believed the strength of the portrait is in part achieved through Dürer's ability to convey this hardship, while at the same time presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride, and possessing "a kind old face". Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the half smile of the older man, he wonders if that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder's satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent, who was now about to set out on the world for his "<a href="Journeyman%20years">wanderjahr</a>". A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession, as a jeweller, but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting. However, his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work, especially in his ability as an engraver.
Conway described the panel as indicating "an astonishing depth of psychological insight" for an artist not yet 20 years old. In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of, and is a key precursor to, Dürer's mature work. He portrayed his father again in 1497, when the older man would have been around 70. He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years: his skin is saggier, the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced. In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing, which are all too evident on his father's face. According to Brion, his eyes have lost their "distant, mystic" appearance and now seem less contented. Conway agrees, seeing traces of haggardly agitation, but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man.

Each canvas is mounted on two boards of equal width, which have been cut vertically and appear have come from the same tree. <a href="Dendrochronology">Tree-ring dating</a> of the wood suggests it was felled around 1482. Wood intended for use in panel painting was generally allowed to mature for around 10 years, giving an approximate dates of 1490–92 for the works. The panels are covered with canvas made of fine but loosely woven linen, and <a href="Underpainting">underpainted</a> in white paint. Whether Dürer prepared the panels himself or purchased them already prepared is unknown.
The father panel is signed and dated on both sides, in what may be the oldest extant instance of Dürer's signature <a href="monogram">monogram</a> of a large open "A" and small "d". However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from <a href="Woodboring%20beetle">woodboring</a>.

The reverse of Albrecht's panel contains a rendition of the allied Dürer and Holper families' coats of arms, which are shown beneath a winged <a href="Moors">Moor</a> wearing a red dress. The Dürer family are represented by a crest showing an open door, a pun on the word Dürer ("Thürer" meaning 'doormaker'). Albrecht the Elder was born in the Hungarian village of Ajtó. "Ajtos" is Hungarian for "door"—when his parents moved to Germany their name changed from "Tür" to "Düre". The Holper crest features a stag, but its significance is lost. The back of Barbara's panel contains imagery of a dragon in a lightning storm set against a rocky landscape or cliff.

After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of <a href="Willibald%20Imhoff">Willibald Imhoff</a>, a grandson of Dürer's friend <a href="Willibald%20Pirckheimer">Willibald Pirckheimer</a>. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as "among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre".
In 1977, art historian <a href="Lotte%20Brand%20Philip">Lotte Brand Philip</a> proposed that "Unknown Woman in a Coif", held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the <a href="Notname">anonymous</a> Mainz painter <a href="Master%20W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.">Master W. B.</a> Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi</a>. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing "<a href="Portrait%20of%20the%20Artist%27s%20Mother%20at%20the%20Age%20of%2063">Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63</a>". <a href="Fedja%20Anzelewsky">Fedja Anzelewsky</a> agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as "precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds".

Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Rudolph II of Austria</a>. Hans Hieronymus Imhoff's lukewarm description of Barbara's portrait—"the mother of Albrecht Dürer in oil colors on wood, [but] there are many who do not believe it to be a work of Dürer"—led Brand Philip to conclude that Albrecht's panel was likely sold individually as the more accomplished and marketable of the two. The attribution is widely accepted today. In 2013 Stephan Kemperdick noted the sophistication of the Nuremberg portrait and that its three-dimensional modeling of the head displays a level of skill beyond Wolgemut and his circle.

The two panels were reunited in 2012 during a Dürer exhibition in Nuremberg having been separated since sometime between 1588 and 1628.

Phellinus ellipsoideus

Phellinus ellipsoideus (formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea) is a species of <a href="polypore">polypore</a> fungus in the family <a href="Hymenochaetaceae">Hymenochaetaceae</a>, a specimen of which produced the largest fungal <a href="fruit%20body">fruit body</a> ever recorded. Found in China, the fruit bodies produced by the species are brown, woody <a href="basidiocarp">basidiocarp</a>s that grow on dead wood, where the fungus feeds as a <a href="saprotroph">saprotroph</a>. The basidiocarps are <a href="perennial">perennial</a>, allowing them to grow very large under favourable circumstances. They are <a href="resupinate">resupinate</a>, measuring or more in length, though typically extending less than a centimetre from the surface of the wood. "P. ellipsoideus" produces distinct <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>al <a href="basidiospore">spores</a>, after which it is named, and unusual <a href="seta">seta</a>e. These two features allow it to be readily differentiated microscopically from other, similar species. <a href="Chemical%20compound">Chemical compound</a>s isolated from the species include several <a href="steroid">steroid</a>al compounds. These may have <a href="pharmacological">pharmacological</a> applications, but further research is needed.

The species was named in 2008 by Bao-Kai Cui and Yu-Cheng Dai based on collections made in <a href="Fujian%20Province">Fujian Province</a>. It was placed in the genus "<a href="Fomitiporia">Fomitiporia</a>", but later analysis suggests that it is more closely related to "<a href="Phellinus">Phellinus</a>" species. It was revealed in 2011 that a very large fruit body, measuring up to in length, had been found on <a href="Hainan%20Island">Hainan Island</a>. The specimen, which was 20 years old, was estimated to weigh between . This was markedly larger than the previously largest recorded fungal fruit body, a specimen of "<a href="Rigidoporus%20ulmarius">Rigidoporus ulmarius</a>" found in the United Kingdom that had a circumference of . The findings were formally published in September 2011, but attracted international attention from the mainstream press prior to this.

The species was first described in 2008 by Bao-Kai Cui and Yu-Cheng Dai, both of the <a href="Beijing%20Forestry%20University">Beijing Forestry University</a>. Five specimens of the then-unknown species were collected during field work in the <a href="Wanmulin%20Nature%20Reserve">Wanmulin Nature Reserve</a> (), <a href="Jian%27ou">Jian'ou</a>, <a href="Fujian%20Province">Fujian Province</a>. The pair named the species "Fomitiporia ellipsoidea" in an article in the journal "<a href="Mycotaxon">Mycotaxon</a>". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific name</a> "ellipsoidea" is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> meaning "ellipsoid", and refers to the shape of the spores. Species of the order <a href="Hymenochaetales">Hymenochaetales</a>, to which this taxon belongs, make up 25% of the over 700 species of <a href="polypore">polypore</a> found in China.

<a href="Phylogenetic%20analysis">Phylogenetic analysis</a> of <a href="28S%20ribosomal%20RNA">large subunit</a> and <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> data, the results of which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as "F. ellipsoidea" was closely related to "<a href="Phellinus%20gabonensis">Phellinus gabonensis</a>", "<a href="Phellinus%20caribaeo-quercicolus">P. caribaeo-quercicolus</a>" and the newly described "<a href="Phellinus%20castanopsidis">P. castanopsidis</a>". The four species share <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological characteristics</a>, and form a <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a> <a href="clade">clade</a>. This clade resolved more closely with the "<a href="Phellinus">Phellinus</a>" <a href="type%20species">type species</a> "<a href="Phellinus%20igniarius">P. igniarius</a>" than it did with the "Fomitiporia" type species "<a href="Fomitiporia%20langloisii">F. langloisii</a>", and so the authors proposed a transference of "F. ellipsoidea" to "Phellinus", naming the <a href="new%20combination">new combination</a> "Phellinus ellipsoideus". While the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> database <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a> follows the 2012 study, <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a> continues to list "Fomitiporia ellipsoidea" as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider "Fomitiporia" to be a <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> of "Phellinus" anyway.

"Phellinus ellipsoideus" produces <a href="resupinate">resupinate</a> fruit bodies that are hard and woody, whether fresh or dry. The original <a href="species%20description">description</a> characterized them as measuring up to "or more" in length, in width, and extending from the wood on which they grow at their thickest point. The outermost layer is typically yellow to yellowish-brown, measuring in thickness. The shiny surface of the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, the spore-producing section of the fruit body, is covered in pores and ranges in colour from yellow-brown to rust-brown. There are between 5 and 8 pores per millimetre. The tubes are up to in depth, have the same colouration as the surface of the hymenium, and are distinctively layered. They are also hard and woody. The very thin yellow-brown layer of <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> measures less than in width. As with much of the rest of the fruit body, it is firm, solid, and reminiscent of wood. The fruit bodies lack any odour or taste.

"Phellinus ellipsoideus" produces <a href="basidiospores">basidiospores</a> that are <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>al or broadly ellipsoidal in shape. The spore shape is one of the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically, and the spores measure from 4.5 to 6.1 by 3.5 to 5 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s (μm). The average spore length is 5.25 μm, while the average width is 4.14 μm. The spores have thick <a href="cell%20walls">cell walls</a>, and are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>. They are strongly <a href="cyanophilous">cyanophilous</a>, meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb <a href="methyl%20blue">methyl blue</a> stain. In addition, they are weakly <a href="dextrinoid">dextrinoid</a>, meaning that they will <a href="staining">stain</a> slightly reddish-brown in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> or <a href="Lugol%27s%20solution">Lugol's solution</a>. The spores are borne on barrel-shaped <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, with four spores per basidium, measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7 μm. There are also <a href="basidioles">basidioles</a>, which are similar in shape to the basidia, but slightly smaller.

In addition to the spore shape, the species is readily identified with the use of a microscope because of its <a href="setae">setae</a>. Setae are a kind of unusual <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in "P. ellipsoideus", are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are <a href="ventricose">ventricose</a>, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14 μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor <a href="cystidiole">cystidiole</a>s (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of <a href="rhomboid">rhomboid</a> crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.

Most of the tissue of a fungal fruit body is made up of <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a>, which can be of three forms: generative, skeletal and binding. In "P. ellipsoideus", the tissue is dominated by skeletal hyphae, but also has generative hyphae; it lacks binding hyphae. For this reason, the hyphal structure of "P. ellipsoideus" is referred to as "dimitic". The hyphae are divided into separate cells by <a href="septae">septae</a>, and lack <a href="clamp%20connections">clamp connections</a>. The skeletal hyphae do not react with Melzer's reagent or Lugol's solution, and are not cyanophilous. While the hyphae will darken when a solution of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> is applied (the <a href="KOH%20test">KOH test</a>), they remain otherwise unchanged.

The main structure of the fruit body consists primarily of an <a href="Agglutination%20%28biology%29">agglutination</a> (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6 μm in diameter, enveloping a <a href="lumen%20%28biology%29">lumen</a> of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3 μm in diameter. The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4 μm in diameter, while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6 μm in diameter.

A cogeneric species potentially similar to "Phellinus ellipsoideus" is "<a href="Phellinus%20caribaeo-quercicola">P. caribaeo-quercicola</a>". The latter species shares the hooked hymenial setae and ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal spores. However, details of the fruit body differ, and the spores are hyaline to yellowish, and not dextrinoid. Further, the species is known only from tropical America, where it grows on the <a href="Quercus%20cubana">Cuban oak</a>. "<a href="Phellinus%20castanopsidis">P. castanopsidis</a>", newly described in 2013, is not perennial, and has a pale greyish-brown pore surface. The spores are also slightly larger than those of "P. ellipsoideus".

"Phellinus ellipsoideus" differs from species of "Fomitiporia" in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid than those of the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, according to the original description. Five species of "Fomitiporia", "<a href="Fomitiporia%20bannaensis">F. bannaensis</a>", "<a href="Fomitiporia%20pseudopunctata">F. pseudopunctata</a>", "<a href="Fomitiporia%20sonorae">F. sonorae</a>", "<a href="Fomitiporia%20sublaevigata">F. sublaevigata</a>" and "<a href="Fomitiporia%20tenuis">F. tenuis</a>", share with "P. ellipsoideus" the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but "P. ellipsoideus" have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. "<a href="Fomitiporia%20uncinata">F. uncinata</a>" (formerly "Phellinus uncinatus") has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with "P. ellipsoideus", thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat larger than those of "P. ellipsoideus", measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5 μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>.

"Phellinus ellipsoideus" has been recorded growing on the fallen wood of <a href="oak">oak</a>s of the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "<a href="Cyclobalanopsis">Cyclobalanopsis</a>", as well as the wood of other <a href="flowering%20plants">flowering plants</a>. The species favours the <a href="Trunk%20%28botany%29">trunk</a>s of trees, where it feeds as a <a href="saprotroph">saprotroph</a>, causing <a href="white%20rot">white rot</a>. "P. ellipsoideus" fruit bodies are <a href="perennial">perennial</a> growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the <a href="tropical">tropical</a> and <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> areas of China; it has been recorded in <a href="Fujian%20Province">Fujian Province</a> and <a href="Hainan%20Province">Hainan Province</a>. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.

In 2010, Cui and Dai were performing field work in tropical woodland on <a href="Hainan%20Island">Hainan Island</a>, China, studying <a href="wood-decay%20fungus">wood-rotting fungi</a>. The pair uncovered a very large "P. ellipsoideus" fruit body on a fallen "<a href="Quercus%20asymmetrica">Quercus asymmetrica</a>" log, which turned out to be the largest fungal fruit body ever documented. The fruit body was found at an altitude of , in <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a>. They were initially unable to identify the specimen as "P. ellipsoideus", because of its large size, but tests revealed its identity after samples were taken for analysis. After their initial encounter with the large fruit body, Cui and Dai returned to it on two subsequent occasions, so that they could study it further. Nicholas P. Money, executive editor of "Fungal Biology", in which the findings were published, praised the pair for not removing the fruit body, thereby allowing it "to continue its business and to marvel visitors to Hainan Island". The discovery was formally published in "<a href="Fungal%20Biology">Fungal Biology</a>" in September 2011, but gained attention in the mainstream press worldwide prior to this.

The fruit body was 20 years old, and up to long. It was between wide, and between thick. The total volume of the fruit body was somewhere between . It was estimated to weigh between , based on three samples from different areas of the fruit body. The specimen had an average of 49 pores per square millimetre, roughly equivalent to 425 million pores. Money estimated that, based on spore output from other polypore species, the fruit body would be able to release a trillion spores a day.

Prior to this discovery, the largest recorded fruit body of any fungus was a specimen of "<a href="Rigidoporus%20ulmarius">Rigidoporus ulmarius</a>", found in <a href="Kew%20Gardens">Kew Gardens</a>, United Kingdom. It measured in diameter, and had a circumference of . While the largest individual fruit bodies belong to polypores, individual organisms belonging to certain "<a href="Armillaria">Armillaria</a>" species can grow extremely large. In 2003, a large specimen of "<a href="Armillaria%20solidipes">A. solidipes</a>" (synonymous with "A. ostoyae") was recorded in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Oregon%29">Blue Mountains</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, covering an area of . At the time, the organism was estimated to be 8650 years old. Prior to this, an "<a href="Armillaria%20gallica">A. gallica</a>" (synonymous with "A. bulbosa") organism was the largest recorded, covering , weighing approximately . However, whilst these organisms cover a large area, the individual fruit bodies (the <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) are not remarkably large, typically with <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>s of up to in height and <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>s less than in diameter, weighing from each.

The fruit bodies of both "Phellinus" and "Fomitiporia" species have seen use in <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a> for <a href="gastrointestinal%20cancer">gastrointestinal cancer</a> and <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>. "P. ellipsoideus" fruit bodies are used for medicinal purposes as "sanhhuang" (a name which typically refers to "<a href="Phellinus%20linteus">P. linteus</a>") in the north of Fujian Province.

In 2011, research into the chemistry of "P. ellipsoideus" was published in the journal "Mycosystema" by Cui, along with Hai-Ying Bao and Bao-Kai Liu of the <a href="Jilin%20Agricultural%20University">Jilin Agricultural University</a>. The research discussed how several <a href="chemical%20compounds">chemical compounds</a> could be isolated from "P. ellipsoideus" with <a href="petroleum%20ether">petroleum ether</a> and (after defatting) <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>. The nine compounds isolated from these extracts included the common <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> and its <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivative</a> <a href="ergosterol%20peroxide">ergosterol peroxide</a>. Two of the compounds, ergosta-7,22,25-triene-3-one and benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b']difuran-3,5-dione-8-methyl formate, were new to science. All of these chemicals were <a href="steroidal">steroidal</a>; such compounds play important physiological roles in <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s. "P. ellipsoideus" has been used as a source of ergosterol for biochemical research.

Steroidal compounds, like those isolated from "P. ellipsoideus", can have <a href="pharmacological">pharmacological</a> applications; for instance, some can act as <a href="Anti-inflammatory">anti-inflammatories</a> (including ergosterol) or inhibit tumour growth. The 2011 study concluded that, as "P. ellipsoideus" contained a large number of diverse steroidal compounds, there may be comparatively high <a href="pharmacological%20activity">pharmacological activity</a> in the fungus; however, more research would be needed to confirm this. Later publications echoed this research, claiming that the fungus has "potential medicinal functions". Research published in 2012 named fomitiporiaester A, a natural <a href="furan">furan</a> derivative isolated from <a href="methanol">methanolic extract</a> of "P. ellipsoideus" fruit bodies. The chemical, <a href="methyl">methyl</a> 3,5-dioxo-1,3,5,7-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']difuran-4-carboxylate, displayed significant <a href="antitumour">antitumour</a> ability in a <a href="animal%20model">mouse model</a>.

"Phellinus ellipsoideus" is used to make MuSkin, or mushroom leather, a <a href="vegan">vegan</a> alternative to <a href="leather">leather</a>.

Kenneth R. Shadrick

Kenneth R. "Kenny" Shadrick (August 4, 1931July 5, 1950) was a <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> soldier who was killed at the onset of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. He was widely but incorrectly reported as the first American soldier <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> in the war.

Shadrick was born in <a href="Harlan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harlan County, Kentucky</a>, one of 10 children. After dropping out of high school in 1948, he joined the U.S. Army, and spent a year of service in Japan before being dispatched to South Korea at the onset of the Korean War in 1950 along with his unit, the <a href="34th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">34th Infantry Regiment</a>, <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Division</a>. During a patrol, Shadrick was killed by the machine gun of a <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>n <a href="T-34">T-34</a> tank, and his body was taken to an outpost where journalist <a href="Marguerite%20Higgins">Marguerite Higgins</a> was covering the war. Higgins later reported that he was the first soldier killed in the war, a claim that was repeated in media across the United States. His life was widely profiled, and his funeral drew hundreds of people.

His death is now believed to have occurred after the first American combat fatalities in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Osan">Battle of Osan</a>. Since the identities of other soldiers killed before Shadrick remain unknown, he is still often incorrectly cited as the first U.S. soldier killed in the war.

Shadrick was born on August 4, 1931, in <a href="Harlan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harlan County, Kentucky</a>. He was the third of 10 children born to Lucille Shadrick and Theodore Shadrick, a coal miner. Growing up during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, Kenneth Shadrick moved with his family to <a href="Wyoming%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wyoming, West Virginia</a>, then to an outlying town called Skin Fork, away, as his father was looking for coal mining jobs. Shadrick was described by his family as "an avid reader" throughout his childhood, who had a variety of interests, including <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Westerns</a> and magazines. He also enjoyed riding his bicycle and, occasionally, hunting.

Shadrick enrolled in <a href="Pineville%20High%20School%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Pineville High School</a> in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During his <a href="Tenth%20grade%23United%20States">sophomore</a> year in 1948, he developed an interest in <a href="American%20football">football</a> and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick so much he dropped out of school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward. One month later, he and a friend enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said he felt it indirectly caused his son's death.

On November 10, 1948, Shadrick left for <a href="basic%20training">basic combat training</a> at <a href="Fort%20Knox%2C%20Kentucky">Fort Knox, Kentucky</a>. As he was 17 years old, Shadrick had to convince his parents to sign papers allowing him to <a href="enlist">enlist</a>. Shadrick completed this training in February 1949, and sailed for Japan to join the <a href="34th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">34th Infantry Regiment</a>, <a href="24th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">24th Infantry Division</a>, for <a href="Occupation%20of%20Japan">post–World War II occupation duties</a>. Shadrick spent a year on <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> island with the division. According to his family, Shadrick enjoyed his tour in Japan at first, but by June 1950 he was growing tired of the country, and indicated in letters he was feeling depressed.

On the night of June 25, 1950, 10 divisions of the <a href="Korean%20People%27s%20Army">North Korean army</a> launched a full-scale invasion of South Korea. Advancing with 89,000 men in six columns, the North Koreans caught the disorganized, ill-equipped, and unprepared <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea%20Army">South Korean army</a> by surprise and routed them. North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance, pushing steadily down the peninsula against the opposing 38,000 front-line South Korean men. The majority of the South Korean forces retreated in the face of the invasion, and by June 28 the North Koreans had captured the southern capital, <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>, and forced the government and its shattered forces to withdraw southward.

Meanwhile, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> voted to send assistance to the collapsing country and U.S. President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> ordered ground troops to the country. U.S. forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and Shadrick's division was the closest to the warzone. Under the command of <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="William%20F.%20Dean">William F. Dean</a>, the division was understrength and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. In spite of these deficiencies the division was ordered into South Korea, tasked with taking the initial shock of the North Korean advances until the rest of the <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth United States Army</a> could arrive and establish a defense.

Dean's plan was to airlift one <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via <a href="C-54%20Skymaster">C-54 Skymaster</a> transport aircraft and to block advancing North Korean forces while the remainder of the division was transported on ships. The <a href="21st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">21st Infantry Regiment</a> was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Battle of Guadalcanal</a> during World War II. On July 5, <a href="Task%20Force%20Smith">Task Force Smith</a> engaged North Korean forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Osan">Battle of Osan</a>, delaying 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being defeated. The 540-man force suffered 60 killed, 21 wounded and 82 captured, a very heavy casualty rate. In the chaos of the retreat, most of the bodies were left behind, and the fates of many of the missing were unknown for several weeks.

During that time, the 34th Infantry Regiment set up a line between the villages of <a href="Pyongtaek">Pyongtaek</a> and <a href="Ansong">Ansong</a>, south of Osan, to fight the next delaying action against the advancing North Korean forces. The 34th Infantry Regiment was similarly unprepared for a fight, with few soldiers experienced in combat. At this time, Shadrick was part of an <a href="M9A1%20Bazooka">M9A1 Bazooka</a> team with 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry.

About 90 minutes after Task Force Smith began its withdrawal from the Battle of Osan, the 34th Infantry sent Shadrick as part of a small scouting force northward to the village of Sojong-ni, south of Osan. The small force, under the command of Lieutenant Charles E. Payne and consisting mostly of bazooka teams and infantry, halted at a graveyard in the village, where they spotted a North Korean <a href="T-34/85">T-34/85</a> tank on a road to the north. Shadrick and the other bazooka operators began firing on the tank from long-range concealed positions at around 16:00. With them was Sergeant Charles R. Turnbull, a US Army <a href="combat%20photographer">combat photographer</a>. Turnbull asked Shadrick to time a bazooka shot so its flash could be caught in Turnbull's photograph, and Shadrick complied. Shadrick made the shot and paused, then rose from his concealed position to see if he had successfully hit the tank, exposing himself. The T-34 returned fire with its machine gun, and two bullets struck Shadrick in the chest and arm. Shadrick died moments later.

Payne's patrol retreated without destroying the tank, taking Shadrick's body with them as the only casualty. The force returned to the 34th Infantry Command post in Pyongtaek to report to <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> George B. Barth and <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Harold B. Ayres, who were commanding the troops in the town. Also present was <a href="Marguerite%20Higgins">Marguerite Higgins</a>, a <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> for the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>". Higgins subsequently reported Shadrick's death, referring to him as the first American killed in the Korean War.

Shadrick's family was informed of his death by a neighbor who had heard his name on a radio broadcast, and the news from the military came via <a href="Electrical%20telegraph">telegraph</a> several days later. The family was immediately inundated by reporters and local well-wishers. Shadrick's body was returned to the United States, and on June 17, 1951, a funeral attended by hundreds of local residents was held in <a href="Beckley%2C%20West%20Virginia">Beckley, West Virginia</a>. The service was set to coincide with the anniversary of the start of the war. His flag-draped casket was escorted down the streets of the town on a horse-drawn carriage, and he was buried at the <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> cemetery in the town.

Higgins' account of Shadrick's death was widely republished. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine published a story about Shadrick's death on July 17, 1950, citing Shadrick as the first "reported" death in Korea. "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine reported Shadrick for up to a year as the first US soldier to die in the war, and the claim has often been repeated, including as recently as July 4, 2011, in the local newspaper in <a href="Huntington%2C%20West%20Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a>, "<a href="The%20Herald-Dispatch">The Herald-Dispatch</a>".

<a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> Post 133 erected a monument to Shadrick at the <a href="Wyoming%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wyoming County</a> courthouse. The monument cites Shadrick's unit, date of death, and notes him as the "first casualty of the Korean conflict" with an epitaph that reads, "He stands first in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live, grow and increase its blessings. Freedom lives and through it he lives – in a way that humbles the undertakings of most men." It is one of several memorials to local residents who served in the military.

Subsequent publications have shed doubt on the accuracy of the claims of Shadrick's distinction. Eyewitness accounts at the Battle of Osan point to the first death as a machine gunner in the <a href="21st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">21st Infantry Regiment</a>, who had been killed at around 08:30, eight hours before Shadrick's death. This soldier was killed when a different T-34 tank was disabled at the battle and one of its crew members attacked nearby troops with a <a href="PPSh-41">PPSh-41 "Burp Gun"</a>. In the confusion of the battle, many of the wounded and dead troops were left behind by retreating American troops, and a large part of the force was also captured; consequently, the identity of this first combat fatality remains a mystery.

Shadrick's awards and decorations include:

St Helen's Church, Ashby-de-la-Zouch

St Helen's Church is the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> of <a href="Ashby-de-la-Zouch">Ashby-de-la-Zouch</a>, in the <a href="deanery">deanery</a> of <a href="North%20West%20Leicestershire">North West Leicestershire</a> and the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Leicester">Diocese of Leicester</a>. There was a church in the town in the 11th century, but the core of the present building mainly dates from work started in 1474, when the church was rebuilt by <a href="William%20Hastings%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hastings">William Hastings</a> at the same time that he converted his neighbouring <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> into a <a href="Ashby%20de%20la%20Zouch%20Castle">castle</a>. The church was refurbished in about 1670 to create more space, but the large and increasing size of the congregation led to further work in 1829, and a major rebuild in 1878–80, including the widening of the <a href="nave">nave</a> by the addition of two outer <a href="aisle">aisle</a>s.

The <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> church has a tower at the west end, and its nave is wider than it is long due to the extra <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> aisles. St Helen's Church has some ancient stained glass at the east end, and the Victorian windows on the nave and towers form a coherent narrative of the life of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. Other fixtures include some important funereal monuments, and a <a href="Baptismal%20font">font</a>, pulpit and carved heads by <a href="Thomas%20Earp%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Earp</a>. The <a href="finger%20pillory">finger pillory</a> is a rare item, once seen as a humane form of punishment. The church has a long association with the Hastings family, its patrons for four centuries, and became a centre for <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>ism under <a href="Henry%20Hastings%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon</a>. The "Puritan Earl" brought a series of radical figures to the town, including <a href="Anthony%20Gilby">Anthony Gilby</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Hildersham">Arthur Hildersham</a>. St Helen's Church is a nationally important building, with a <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I listing</a> for its exceptional architectural interest.

There is little documented history of <a href="Ashby-de-la-Zouch">Ashby-de-la-Zouch</a> before the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>, although <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> coins were found in the area, and the town's name has both Saxon and Danish elements. It has an entry in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> that suggests that it had about 100 inhabitants in 1086, and subsequently grew in importance under its La Zouch and Hastings lords, notably <a href="William%20Hastings%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hastings">William Hastings</a>.

It is recorded in Domesday that a priest was resident in Ashby, and that the church dedicated to <a href="Helena%20%28empress%29">St Helen</a> consisted only of a <a href="nave">nave</a>. In about 1144, Philip Beaumais, lord of the Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the <a href="Augustinians">Augustinian</a> community of <a href="Lilleshall%20Abbey">Lilleshall Abbey</a>, which retained possession until 1538. A 2013 excavation found evidence of a two-storey vicarage dating from this period, but the building fell into disrepair following the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> and the site was cleared in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> of 1642–49.

Parts of the current nave and <a href="chancel">chancel</a> date from the 14th century, but the church was rebuilt and enlarged by William Hastings in 1474, at the same time that he erected the tower of his nearby <a href="Ashby%20de%20la%20Zouch%20Castle">castle</a>. The new, larger church included a nave with <a href="aisle">aisle</a>s and chapels adjoining the chancel. The tower, Hastings Chapel, and some <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es and windows still remain from the 15th century.

The <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> inevitably affected St Helen's Church. <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI's</a> 1547 injunction decreed that all images in churches were to be dismantled or destroyed, including <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a>, <a href="shrines">shrines</a>, <a href="rood">rood</a>s, statues and bells, and <a href="altar">altar</a>s were to be replaced by wooden tables. Damage during the Civil War was minimal; there are <a href="Pike%20%28weapon%29">pike</a> marks on the stonework. The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> stronghold.

Around 1670, the church was refurbished, a gallery was built at the western end of the nave, and the carved <a href="reredos">reredos</a> and a large wooden <a href="Royal%20Arms%20of%20England">Royal coat of arms</a>, now at the west end of the nave, were acquired at the same time. An inspection report at the end of the 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a <a href="cattle%20grid">cattle grid</a> to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the <a href="pew">pew</a>s and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by <a href="James%20Piers%20St%20Aubyn">James Piers St Aubyn</a>. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a <a href="vestry">vestry</a> and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000 (). Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 () between 1963 and 1968 to combat <a href="deathwatch%20beetle">deathwatch beetle</a>s found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.

St Helen's Church is the <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> of the English market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>. The parish is currently in the deanery of North West Leicestershire, the Diocese of Leicester and the <a href="Province%20of%20Canterbury">Province of Canterbury</a>.

St Helen's Church has a maximum length of and is aligned at 25° north of east. The majority of English churches have an alignment within a few degrees of east, so this is an exceptionally large deviation from the norm. The sandstone church has a large, mainly 15th-century west tower supported by corner buttresses and topped with <a href="battlement">battlement</a>s and <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a>s. The tower has a <a href="Window%23Technical%20terms">four-light</a> window and west doorway, and contains a spiral stairway to the bell and clock chambers and the roof. The chancel is adjoined by the former north chapel (now the vestry) on one side and the Hastings Chapel, set <a href="transept">transept-wise</a> on the other; it has three <a href="sedilia">sedilia</a> and a <a href="piscina">piscina</a> on its northern wall. The nave is significantly wider than it is long, and has four bays with medieval inner north and south aisles and 19th-century outer aisles. The Hastings Chapel, chancel and <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> are <a href="battlement">embattled</a>, and the former north chapel is <a href="English%20Gothic%20architecture%23Perpendicular%20Gothic">English Perpendicular</a>, with a window of the same style. The piers in the nave were remodelled in the 15th century, and have incised panels, as do some of the arches. This feature is of an unusual style and is also seen at <a href="Sherborne%20Abbey">Sherborne Abbey</a> in Dorset and at St Peter and St Paul, <a href="Syston">Syston</a>, Leicestershire.

The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the <a href="Lady%20Chapel">Lady Chapel</a> are at the east end of the outer north and south aisles respectively, and contain 20 of the 28 stone heads carved by <a href="Thomas%20Earp%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Earp</a> of Lambeth in 1878–1880, mostly depicting biblical characters such as <a href="Salome">Salome</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, or historical figures like St Helen and <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>. Ten are paired on opposite sides of the five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle, and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels. The <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s of the north, west and south doors bear six more heads, those by the west door depicting <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and <a href="Archibald%20Tait">Archbishop Tait</a>; and <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> and <a href="Moses">Moses</a> are higher on the corbels of the west window. The clerestory and the wooden roofs of the nave and south inner aisle are 15th century, but the rest of the lead-clad roofing dates from the Victorian rebuilding.

St Helen's Church was designated as a <a href="Listed%20building%23Categories%20of%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a> in 1950, recognising it as a building of exceptional interest. It is important not only for the medieval structures that remain, but also for its monuments and fittings. The <a href="Victorian%20restoration">Victorian restoration</a> is also noted as being of high quality and in keeping with the older parts of the church.

The church had much stained glass in 1622 that disappeared during the Reformation. The current eleven coloured glass windows on the north, west and south sides of the church were erected in 1879 by <a href="Lavers%2C%20Barraud%20and%20Westlake">Lavers, Barraud and Westlake</a>, each being named for its donor; the scenes depicted tell the <a href="Life%20of%20Christ%20in%20art">Life of Christ</a> from the <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> to the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a>. The stained glass in the chancel and the Hasting Chapel was erected in 1924, and most was once in the castle; the earliest glass is a German, Swiss and Flemish work possibly originally from <a href="Farleigh%20Hungerford">Farleigh Hungerford</a>. The chancel's east window contains arms of <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a> and <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> and the south window includes "The Magi bearing gifts" and the arms of <a href="Catherine%20Parr">Catherine Parr</a>. The Hastings Chapel south window has several panels from the 15th and 16th centuries, and one which could possibly be as old as the 13th century. The chapel's east window also has some high quality work, including "The Last Supper". The large west window in the tower is plain glass, as is the clerestory.

The rare <a href="finger%20pillory">finger pillory</a> at the west end immobilised offenders without exposing them to the public degradation associated with the <a href="stocks">stocks</a>. In the centre aisle hangs a large brass <a href="candelabrum">candelabrum</a> donated by Leonard Piddocke, High Bailiff of Leicester, in 1733. It is surmounted by a brass dove and was made by William Parsons of London. Some of the branches were stolen in 1776, but soon recovered.

The <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> wooden reredos of 1679, probably by local man Thomas Sabin, has been compared favourably with the work of <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a> and <a href="Grinling%20Gibbons">Grinling Gibbons</a>, and the metal <a href="rood%20screen">screen</a> also made by an Ashby craftsman, John Staley, is also of high quality. There is a Royal Arms from the reign of Charles II high on the west wall of the nave. The <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a> <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> and octagonal <a href="Baptismal%20font">font</a> were made by Earp in 1878–1880. The font is carved from a single block of stone and decorated on each face with Christian symbols, and rests on red granite pillars on a <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> base. The pulpit is similarly supported to match the font. A second, smaller font with a panelled stem is in the southwestern corner of the nave.

The church contains a <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> of uncertain date made by Kirkland of London at their <a href="Wakefield">Wakefield</a> branch which opened in 1893. Its most recent restorations were in 1935 and 1955. It has three manuals and a pedalboard, and is described on the National Pipe Organ Register as being of an "unusual" type.

There is a north-facing clock on the tower, and a <a href="sundial">sundial</a> on the south side which was rediscovered and repaired in 2000. The masonry shows that it was built at the same time as that part of the tower. The tower holds a ring originally of eight bells; the earliest dates back to 1571, but was recast in 1849, and all eight bells were repaired by <a href="John%20Taylor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCo">John Taylor  Co</a> in 1886. The bells were repaired and rehung again in 2006 using £42,600 of <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a> funding awarded from the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>. The tenor bell was recast, and two new trebles were made, bringing the total to ten; prior to the last recasting, the large tenor bell weighed .

The Hastings Chapel contains a number of family monuments, including a large alabaster tomb for <a href="Francis%20Hastings%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon</a>, who died in 1561, and his countess, Catherine. The monument was carved by <a href="Joseph%20Pickford">Joseph Pickford</a> to a design by <a href="William%20Kent">William Kent</a>. A memorial to <a href="Theophilus%20Hastings%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Huntingdon">Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon</a>, who died in 1746, is on the east wall and is by <a href="Michael%20Rysbrack">Michael Rysbrack</a>. His widow, <a href="Selina%20Hastings%2C%20Countess%20of%20Huntingdon">Selina</a>, founded a training college for evangelical ministers, and a sculpture of her in mourning, also by Rysbrack, is placed by her husband's memorial. The countess herself is remembered through a large brass plaque in the chancel floor. The larger of two vaults containing the coffins of the Hastings family lies beneath the chancel, and the smaller and older one is under their chapel.

The Lady Chapel contains a wall memorial to Arthur Hildersham and a painted wooden bust of Margery Wright, who died in 1623. The inscription below records that she had given £43 () to provide gowns for the old and needy of the town. The Chapel of St Michael and All Angel has a recumbent alabaster effigy known as "the Pilgrim". The subject holds a pilgrim's staff and other symbols such as a wide hat with cockle shells. A dog lies at his feet. The 15th-century figure was originally brightly painted, and depicts a person of noble birth. It is believed to represent Thomas, the third brother of William Hastings. A number of carved alabaster memorial slabs were removed when the church was re-pewed in 1829. Only one survives, a memorial to Robert Mundy, who died in 1526, and his two wives, both named Elizabeth; it now stands upright by the west wall.

The arch gateway at the western end of the churchyard bears a skull and crossbones at the top of each pillar. The memorials in the churchyard are mainly dated 1750–1850, and most are lined against the churchyard's south wall or are flush with the ground. Some show fine carving, commensurate with commercial success. They include the memorials of French-born wine merchant Jean Gaudin and the Litherland brothers, founders of <a href="Royal%20Crown%20Derby">Royal Crown Derby</a>. From 1804, French prisoners of war were quartered in Ashby, and those who died before their release, or who stayed and married local women, are also buried in the churchyard. A group of memorials are for members of a prosperous local family, the Mammatts. Edward Mammatt, church organist for 40 years and a successful scientist despite being blinded at age six, also has a monument in the church, and one of the Victorian windows is dedicated to his widow by their sons.


The <a href="advowson">advowson</a> of St Helen's Church, including the right to nominate the vicar, was owned by Lilleshall Abbey until 1508, when it passed to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Coventry">Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield</a>. The <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> led to the transfer of the patronage to Francis Hastings, the 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, and it remained with the Hastings family until 1931, passing then to John G. Shields and his descendants. The names of the vicars are known back to Roger in 1200.

Henry Hastings, the third earl, was a zealous promoter of <a href="puritan">puritan</a>ism and founded <a href="Ashby%20School">Ashby Grammar School</a> to provide education in accordance with his religious views. <a href="Anthony%20Gilby">Anthony Gilby</a> had lived in exile in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> during the reign of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary</a>, but was invited to Ashby by the earl and made the town a nationally important centre for radical Protestantism. Attempts by the church authorities to discipline him failed, and he died after 25 years spent preaching and pamphleteering. Hastings' influence meant that between 1562 and 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers. The last of these was <a href="Arthur%20Hildersham">Arthur Hildersham</a>, another influential figure who sought to internationalise radical Protestantism, but became vulnerable to the strictures of his bishop after Henry Hastings died in 1595. Hildersham was barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his incumbency, Earl Henry was interred in St Helen's after a lavish funeral befitting his status as Lord President of the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20North">Council of the North</a>.

As of 2017, the church is managed as part of the "Ashby and Breedon Team Ministry", which also includes <a href="Holy%20Trinity%2C%20Ashby-de-la-Zouch">Holy Trinity, Ashby-de-la-Zouch</a>; <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20and%20St%20Hardulph">The Priory Church of Saint Mary and Saint Hardulph, Breedon on the Hill</a>; St Mary the Virgin, <a href="Coleorton">Coleorton</a>; St John's Chapel, Coleorton; All Saints Church, <a href="Isley%20cum%20Langley">Isley Walton</a> and St Matthew's Church, <a href="Worthington%2C%20Leicestershire">Worthington</a>. The church operates "Little Fishes", a mother and toddler group, and its street pastors work in outreach and liaison with the town community.

The Ashe lectures, endowed by Francis Ashe in 1654, provided for weekly lectures in the church by a "godly, orthodox and ordained minister". This was later amended to allow for at least one lecture each year. Twentieth-century lecturers include <a href="Geoffrey%20Fisher">Geoffrey Fisher</a>, <a href="Donald%20Coggan">Donald Coggan</a>, <a href="Donald%20Soper">Donald Soper</a> and <a href="George%20Carey">George Carey</a>.

In 2014, the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> awarded £648,300 to the St Helen's Heritage Project. The grant was to finance a three-year project to build a Heritage Centre opposite the south side of the church. When completed, the Heritage Centre will have a display area, kitchen, rooms for hire and a garden. The church plans to have trained guides and visitor activities, and to offer craft courses in, for example, <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a> and stone carving.

The project's preparatory 2013 archaeological dig that discovered the vicarage ruins also unearthed the remains of a <a href="tithe%20barn">tithe barn</a>, trenches from the Civil War and parts of a causeway, along with smaller domestic items.

The Dresden Triptych (or Virgin and Child with St. Michael and St. Catherine and a Donor, or Triptych of the Virgin and Child) is a very small hinged-<a href="triptych">triptych</a> altarpiece by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. It consists of five individual panel paintings: a central inner panel, and two double-sided wings. It is signed and dated 1437, and in the permanent collection of the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%20Alte%20Meister">Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister</a>, Dresden, with the panels still in their original frames. The only extant triptych attributed to van Eyck, and the only non-portrait signed with his personal motto, "" ("I Do as I Can"). the triptych can be placed at the midpoint of his known works. It echoes a number of the motifs of his earlier works while marking an advancement in his ability in handling depth of space, and establishes iconographic elements of <a href="Marian%20art%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">Marian portraiture</a> that were to become widespread by the latter half of the 15th century. <a href="Elisabeth%20Dhanens">Elisabeth Dhanens</a> describes it as "the most charming, delicate and appealing work by Jan van Eyck that has survived".

The paintings on the two outer wings become visible when the triptych is closed. They show the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> and <a href="Gabriel">Archangel Gabriel</a> in an <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> scene painted in <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a>, which because of their near-monochrome colouring give the impression that the figures are sculpted. The three inner panels are set in an ecclesiastical interior. In the central inner panel Mary is seated and holds the <a href="Child%20Jesus">Christ Child</a> on her lap. On the left hand wing <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Archangel Michael</a> presents a kneeling <a href="Donor%20portrait">donor</a>, while on the right St. <a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">Catherine of Alexandria</a> stands reading a prayer book. The interior panels are outlined with two layers of painted bronze frames, inscribed with mostly Latin lettering. The texts are drawn from a variety of sources, in the central frames from biblical descriptions of the <a href="Assumption%20of%20Mary">assumption</a>, while the inner wings are lined with fragments of prayers dedicated to saints Michael and Catherine.

The work may have been intended for private devotion, perhaps as a portable altarpiece for a migrant cleric. That the frames are so richly decorated with Latin inscriptions indicates that the donor, whose identity is lost, was highly educated and cultured. Because of a lack of surviving documentary evidence on commissions of 15th century-Northern painting, the identities of donors are often established through evidence gathered by modern art historians. In this work, damaged <a href="coats%20of%20arms">coats of arms</a> on the borders of the interior wings have been identified with the <a href="Giustiniani">Giustiniani</a> of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> – an influential "<a href="Albergo%20%28family%29">albergo</a>" active from 1362 – who established trade links with <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> as early as the mid-14th century.

The "Dresden Triptych" was probably in the possession of the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late-15th century. It is mentioned in a May 10, 1597 record of a purchase by <a href="Vincenzo%20Gonzaga%2C%20Duke%20of%20Mantua">Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua</a>, and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I of England</a> in 1627. After Charles's fall and execution, the painting went to Paris and was owned by <a href="Eberhard%20Jabach">Eberhard Jabach</a>, the <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>-based banker and art dealer for <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> and <a href="Cardinal%20Mazarin">Cardinal Mazarin</a>. A year after Jabach's death in 1695, it passed to the <a href="Elector%20of%20Saxony">Elector of Saxony</a>, and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%20Alte%20Meister">Dresden Collection</a>, attributed to <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>, until the German historian <a href="Aloys%20Hirt">Aloys Hirt</a> in 1830 established it as a van Eyck. In the mid-19th century the Dresden catalogues first attribute it to <a href="Hubert%20van%20Eyck">Hubert van Eyck</a> (d. 1426) and a few years later to Jan.
Van Eyck signed, dated and added his motto to the central panel, a fact only discovered when the frame was removed in the course of a mid-20th century restoration, and confirmed with the 1959 discovery of the signature which is placed along with the words "" ("Jan Van Eyck Made And Completed Me In The Year 1437. As I Can"). The word "completed" ("complevit") may suggest the completion date, but as master painters of the era typically had workshops to assist on major works, the wording can be seen as aggressively socially ambitious; perhaps an arrogant master painter indicating his workshop assistants had little material involvement in the panels, and that he was primarily responsible for its design and execution. This view is reinforced by the fact that it is the only non-portrait to contain van Eyck's motto, "". Until the discovery of the signature the piece was variously dated to an early piece from the 1420s to his later period in the late 1430s. Because the panels are so definitely attributed they are often used as a touchstone to date van Eyck's other works; there are a number of evident stylistic developments, including the type of stained glass windows and mouldings around the <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a>, and his ability at handling <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>, which can be used to determine if other works at least pre-date the triptych.

The central panel has often been compared to his unsigned and undated "<a href="Lucca%20Madonna%20%28van%20Eyck%29">Lucca Madonna</a>" of c. 1436. That work echoes the central panel of the Dresden triptych in a number of aspects, including the dark green canopy, the figuration and positioning of Mary, her heavily-folded dress, the orange and brown pigments of the floor, the geometric carpet and the wooden carvings. The "Lucca Madonna" is thought to be a portrait of the artist's much younger wife, <a href="Portrait%20of%20Margaret%20van%20Eyck">Margaret</a>.

The work measures including the frames. Given this miniaturist scale, the triptych probably functioned as a portable devotional piece, or "altare portabile". Members of the upper-classes and nobility acquired these through papal dispensation, to use during travel and typically during pilgrimage. Van Eyck's patron and employer <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> owned at least one portable triptych
of which fragments survive.

The three inner panels comprise a typical "<a href="Sacred%20conversation">sacra conversazione</a>", a form established in Italy in the latter half of the 14th century with a <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> presenting the donor, usually kneeling, to an enthroned "Deity or Mother of God". John Ward believes the rich and complex <a href="iconography">iconography</a> and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed in his religious panels served to highlight the co-existence the artist saw between the spiritual and material worlds. In his earlier paintings, subtle iconographical features – referred to as disguised symbolism – are typically woven into the work, as "relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]". These elements include the apparition of the Virgin before the donor, whose panel contains carvings that seem to be reflective of events of his life. In his religious panels after 1436, van Eyck's reliance on iconographical or symbolic elements is greatly reduced. Ward speculates the reduced size of the work or the wishes of the commissioner influenced this choice, or he "decided that he had exhausted the most interesting possibilities and ... much of his carefully planned symbolism went unappreciated by patrons or by viewers." According to Jacobs, the work reflects a system of symbolism in so far as heavenly and earthly objects are juxtaposed. This is most evident in the disparity between the monochromatic exterior and vivid inner panels.

The triptych retains its original frames, which are both ornate and served to protect the piece from the effects of light and smoke during travel and when "in situ". The inner frames have recessed mouldings and are carved with gilded inscriptions, and the top corners of the two wing panels each bear a carved set of <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>. The lettering and phrases in Latin serve a dual purpose. They are decorative, similar to margins in medieval manuscripts, and set the context for the imagery; van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison. Writing about Early Netherlandish triptychs, Jacobs says the inscriptions serve to distinguish and separate between the worldly and spiritual spheres, with the panels showing earthly images while the inscriptions on the frames act as reminder of heavenly influence. The letterings reinforce the duality between the earthly and heavenly, with St. Catherine's a reminder of ascetic piety while the figure herself is depicted in sumptuous garments and jewels.

The inscriptions on the central panel are fragments from the <a href="Book%20of%20Wisdom">Book of Wisdom</a> (7:26 and 7:29), and <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> (24: 23–24). Those on the wing panels are taken from texts referring directly to the two saints.

In the central panel the Virgin and Child are enthroned in a church <a href="nave">nave</a> within a columned <a href="basilica">basilica</a> running on either side. The columns are painted using a variety of dark red, orange and grey pigments, a colour scheme which Peter Heath describes as lending to a "sense of airy silence". The throne is positioned on a <a href="dais">dais</a>, before a lavishly detailed <a href="Oriental%20carpets%20in%20Renaissance%20painting">oriental carpet</a> lying on a similarly geometrically designed tiled floor. The arms of the canopied throne and the arches to either side contain carved or sculptured figures, including tiny representations of <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a>, and <a href="David%20and%20Goliath">David and Goliath</a>, although art historian Antje Maria Neuner reads this carving as showing <a href="Jephthah">Jephthah</a> sacrificing his daughter. Mary wears a richly embroidered and as is typical for van Eyck, voluminous red robe, which effectively serves as a <a href="Baldachin">cloth of honour</a>. The robe is placed over a blue square-cut underdress edged with a jewelled border. In van Eyck's Marian paintings, he almost always clothes her in red writes Pächt, which makes her seem to dominate the space. The Christ Child is naked and holds towards the donor a <a href="banderole">banderole</a> adorned with a phrase from the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> (11:29), "" ("Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart").
Mary's presence in the church is symbolic; she and the child occupy the area where the altar would normally be situated. Like van Eyck's two other late Madonna portraits ("<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20with%20Canon%20van%20der%20Paele">Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele</a>" of 1436 and "<a href="Madonna%20in%20the%20Church">Madonna in the Church</a>" of c. 1438–40), Mary is unrealistically large and out of proportion to her surroundings. This reflects the influence of 12th- and 13th-century Italian artists such as <a href="Cimabue">Cimabue</a> and <a href="Giotto">Giotto</a>, who in turn drew on the tradition of monumental depictions of Mary from <a href="Byzantine%20art">Byzantine</a> icons. According to <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a>, Mary is presented as if about to "rise from her throne and advance into the same plane as St. Michael and St. Catherine, she would tower above them and also above the columns of the church." This idea is in keeping with van Eyck's tendency in such portraits to present Mary as if she was an apparition materialising before the donor in response to his prayer and devotion. Van Eyck's Mary is here monumental, but less overwhelmingly large than in 13th century works. She is disproportionate to the architecture in her panel, but approximately proportional to the figures in the wings. This restraint evidences the beginning of van Eyck's mature phase, most evidently seen in the composition's "greater spatial depth".

Christ's pose closely follows that of the "Paele Madonna"; his body still leans towards the donor but here his head faces the viewer more directly.

<a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">St. Catherine</a> and the <a href="Michael%20%28archangel%29">Archangel Michael</a> occupy the right and left hand panels respectively. They appear to stand in either the aisles or <a href="Ambulatory">ambulatories</a>, and a few bays to the fore compared to the central panel. Their depictions are in keeping with the artist's evolving style: the aisles convey spaciousness, especially by the implied spaces out of view, while both saints subtly lean close to Mary. The use of perspective makes the saints appear small; according to Pächt they are "less solid than the massive figures in the "Paele Madonna". It was this Gothic daintiness that led many scholars ... to place this among Jan van Eyck's early work". The two side panels are filled with light streaming through the windows that reflects off the saints' accoutrements, glinting from St. Michael's armour and St. Catherine's bejewelled steel sword.
On the right panel St. Catherine is presented as almost the essence of a gothic princess. She stands reading a book in "ravishing modesty", with unbound blonde hair, which is topped with an elaborate jewelled crown very similar to that in the "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>", combined with her rich blue gown and <a href="tabard">tabard</a> of white draped <a href="Ermine%20%28heraldry%29">ermine</a> showing her as the princess she was. A golden chain with a jewelled pendant hangs from her neck. The attributes associated with her are included in her depiction. In her right hand, she holds the sword used for her beheading and at her feet lies the <a href="breaking%20wheel">breaking wheel</a> on which she was tortured. Like the woman in van Eyck's "<a href="Arnolfini%20Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait</a>" she is "fashionably pear-shaped"; Heath describes her attire as "more dazzling than the Virgin's", mirroring St. Michael's splendid armour on the opposite panel.

St. Catherine's presence can be attributed to a number of factors. At that period her reputation and popularity were second to Mary's; she was both an educated and outspoken woman during her lifetime – characteristics that perhaps mirrored the donor's. She is absorbed in her book in a contemplative manner, which might be reflective of a donor with a similar temperament. The frame of her wing is inscribed with the words ("The prudent virgin has longed for the starry throne where she has made her place ready; leaving the world's threshing floor, she saved the grain for herself by winnowing the chaff. The young girl has been steeped in heavenly learning. Stripped of everything, with sure footsteps she followed Christ until she was delivered from earthly affairs").
A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine. Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up. The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildings and hills before snowcapped mountains.

A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael.</small> Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet, while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards <a href="Orans">as if in prayer</a>, although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger, and is dressed in a long olive-green <a href="houppelande">houppelande</a>, at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian court</a>. The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur. The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the "Arnolfini Portrait".

The <a href="Capital%20%28architecture%29">capital</a> of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes. Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck's earlier "van der Paele" and "Madonna of Chancellor Rolin", and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor's life. Those in the present work likely serve a similar role, however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer. <a href="Elisabeth%20Dhanens">Elisabeth Dhanens</a> speculates that they might depict the <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> of <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus</a> in <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael's status as military commander. Ward compares the carving to a similar one found in the Washington "<a href="Annunciation%20%28van%20Eyck%2C%20Washington%29">Annunciation</a>". Unlike in van Eyck's earlier votive portraits the donor is positioned at a remove from the Marian apparition, and at a much smaller scale to Mary on a triptych wing.

The lettering running along the edges of the panel's frame consists of a prayer fragment from the liturgy for the <a href="Michaelmas">feast of St. Michael</a>. The extract reads "" ("This is Michael the Archangel, leader of the angelic hosts, whose privilege it is to grant favours to the people, and whose prayer leads them to the Kingdom of Heaven. The Archangel Michael is God's messenger for the souls of the just. By the grace of God, that great victor has taken his place in Heaven, on the side of peace'").

When the triptych is closed, the outer wings reveal an <a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a> scene with the <a href="Archangel%20Gabriel">Archangel Gabriel</a> and Mary painted in <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a>. The figures form an <a href="Illusionism%20%28art%29">illusionistic</a> imitation of sculpture, a conceit which van Eyck extends by placing them on octagonal pedestals. The figures are illuminated by light from the left, a device van Eyck often used to imply the presence of God. A dove, representing the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, hovers above Mary. Because the dove is also in grisaille but not attached to a pedestal and apparently floating unfixed above the saints, its presence serves to highlight that the viewer is not looking at sculpture but at a painted representation of sculpture.

The annunciation dominates any other theme on the outer wings of Northern 15th-century <a href="polyptych">polyptych</a>s. The tradition originates from Byzantine art, with van Eyck largely responsible for re-popularising the practice. Along with his "<a href="Ghent%20Altarpiece">Ghent Altarpiece</a>", the "Dresden Triptych" is one of the earliest surviving examples of the technique, and on this basis he is usually credited as the innovator of a motif that became almost standard from the mid-15th century. As the annunciation marks the incarnation of Christ, its representation on the outer wings gives symmetry to the scenes of his life typically detailed on the inner panels.
The outer wings of 15th-century <a href="diptych">diptych</a>s and triptychs typically contained Annunciation scenes painted in grisaille. Molly Teasdale Smith believes the practice echoes the tradition of covering religious imagery with grey cloth during the then-46-day <a href="lent">lent</a>en period leading up to Easter. There is a symmetry with this in how polyptychs were typically kept closed except for Sundays or church holidays, when they were opened to reveal the more colourful and expansive inner panels.

According to Dhanens, the sculptural depictions on the outer panels are a "brilliant success ... in imparting a sense of life to the supposed statues." The wings continue van Eyck's innovation in placing two grisaille outer panels wings of polyptychs; the earliest extant example being the Annunciation wings of the "Ghent Altarpiece".

The depicted church is of a <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style with <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> elements. There are pointed <a href="Canopy%20%28building%29">canopies</a> above Mary, and the nave is narrow, barely wide enough to contain her. It is walled by a <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a> joined by <a href="entablature">entablature</a>s and capped with rounded arches. The columns are variously of pink, red and purple marble. Each of the capitals is decorated with faux carvings, some showing representations of the twelve <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">apostles</a> under a small <a href="baldachin">baldachin</a>. The <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulting</a> is visible in the aisles but not in the central nave. There are a number of implied spaces not visible to the viewer. The central panel contains two on either side of the pillars, others lead from the balcony above the throne, and there are unseen exits to hallways at the rear of the two wing panels. The east facing windows in the right hand wing resemble those in van Eyck's "<a href="Rolin%20Madonna">Rolin Madonna</a>".

The centre panel's spatial depth marks an advancement in van Eyck's technique, especially when compared to his similar 1436 "" or "van der Paele" panel, both of which are comparatively flat. The depth of space is accomplished through such devices as placing the Virgin at the far end of the pictorial space, making her appear both smaller and seemingly at a remove and accentuating the receding lines of the carpets by setting them against the parallels of the folds of her gown. The recessional perspective is further achieved by the sequence of columns stretching back from the throne. This is particularly noticeable with the positioning of the throne in comparison to the "Lucca Madonna" and van der Paele panels.

As with van Eyck's earlier paintings of interiors, the building is not based on a particular place, but is an imagined and idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect and representational architectural space. This is evidenced by a number of features that would be unlikely in an actual contemporary church such as the sculptures that were more secular in nature. In detailing the structure he pays close attention to contemporary models, which he possibly combined with elements from ancient buildings. The columns contain "high <a href="Prism%20%28geometry%29">prismatic</a> bases" found in early churches and on the <a href="Arch%20of%20Constantine">Arch of Constantine</a>. <a href="Craig%20Harbison">Craig Harbison</a> believes that because the interior is not based on an actual building, the viewer is not burdened by preconceptions, a device which perhaps opens up the painting's "physiological" impact. In his view, the panels capture the moment when the donor's prayer and piety is rewarded by an apparition of the Virgin and Child. The novelty and unworldliness of the situation is highlighted by the unrealistic size of the Virgin compared to her surroundings.

Light plays a central role in all panels, to an extent almost comparable to van Eyck's "Madonna in the Church". The arches and columns are bathed in daylight, echoed by the text of the inscriptions around the central frame allude to light and illumination. Van Eyck pays close attention to the saturating effects and gradations of the light, which enters from the left and spreads across the middle ranges of each panel. He often used light to indicate a divine ethereal presence. Because the implied spaces found on either side of Mary and leading into each of the wing panels are bathed in this light, they can be seen as conduits for the divine.

The triptych influenced <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>'s 1445–50 "<a href="Seven%20Sacraments%20Altarpiece">Seven Sacraments Altarpiece</a>" in a number of aspects, most obviously in its disregard of scale, especially with Mary's size relative to the other figures and surrounding architecture. Van der Weyden develops the idea further, placing a large crucifixion towering above the figures and almost spanning the height of the central panel.

The identity of the <a href="Donor%20portrait">donor</a> has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a <a href="Genoa">Genoese</a> merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to <a href="Giovanni%20Mazone">Giovanni Mazone</a>'s "Virgin and Child" altarpiece in <a href="Pontremoli">Pontremoli</a>, <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, which may place it in the Italian region of <a href="Liguria">Liguria</a> at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.

Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from <a href="Lucca">Lucca</a>, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in <a href="Wervik">Wervik</a> paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a <a href="stipend">stipend</a> funded by local tax receipts, suggesting a connection. Dhanens admits the donor's identity is lost, but she says of the piece that "it could have been a gift from the husband to the wife, a pledge of his affection during his absences; or it could have been a gift from the wife to the husband, by way of protection on his travels."
The triptych is in poor condition, having suffered damage and heavy paint loss, and has undergone a number of restorations. The outer wooden frames, originally painted in grey and yellow marbling, were later overpainted in a design of black and red in the 16th or 17th centuries when "a faux turtle-shell design, imitating the then-fashionable veneer, replaced the earlier scheme of jaspered paint". An ebony surround was added to the inner frames for protection in the 1840s. There has been extensive repair work on the paint forming Mary's dress, with large areas of her gown repaired in 1844 by painter <a href="Eduard%20Bendemann">Eduard Bendemann</a>. The badly damaged coats of arms have been retouched, while the frames have sustained impairment and are overpainted in areas. The painting was taken to Moscow after the Second World War. It was returned in 1959 after it had been cleaned, restored and underwent examination in a laboratory. This process revealed the "" inscription on the inner moulding of the central frame in front of the tiled floor when a coat of brown paint was stripped away. The surround was removed during the 1959 restoration.

Wage reform in the Soviet Union, 1956–1962

During the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281953%E2%80%9364%29">Khrushchev era</a>, especially from 1956 through 1962, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> attempted to implement major wage reforms intended to move <a href="Soviet%20working%20class">Soviet industrial workers</a> away from the mindset of overfulfilling quotas that had characterised the Soviet economy during the preceding <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281927%E2%80%931953%29">Stalinist</a> period and toward a more efficient <a href="Incentive">financial incentive</a>.

Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet workers had been paid for their work based on a <a href="Piece%20work">piece-rate</a> system. Thus their individual wages were directly tied to the amount of work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led to the growth of bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.

The wage reforms sought to remove these wage practices and offer an efficient financial incentive to Soviet workers by standardising wages and reducing the dependence on overtime or bonus payments. However, industrial managers were often unwilling to take actions that would effectively reduce workers' wages and frequently ignored the directives they were given, continuing to pay workers high overtime rates. Industrial materials were frequently in short supply, and production needed to be carried out as quickly as possible once materials were available—a practice known as "storming". The prevalence of storming meant that the ability to offer bonus payments was vital to the everyday operation of Soviet industry, and as a result the reforms ultimately failed to create a more efficient system.

During the period of <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>, the Soviet Union attempted to achieve economic growth through increased industrial production. In 1927–1928, the sum total of Soviet production of <a href="capital%20good">capital good</a>s amounted to 6 billion <a href="Soviet%20ruble">rubles</a>, but by 1932, annual production increased to 23.1 billion rubles. Factories and industrial enterprises were actively encouraged to "achieve at whatever cost", with a strong emphasis placed on overfulfilling stated targets so as to produce as much as possible. For example, the slogan for the first <a href="Five-Year%20Plans%20for%20the%20National%20Economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Five-Year Plan</a>, "The Five-Year Plan In Four Years!", called on workers to fulfill the state's objectives a year earlier than planned.

Frantically rushed production was very common in Soviet industry, and in particular a process known as "storming" (<a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>: штурмовщина, pronounced "shturmovshchina") was endemic; it involved crash programs in which factories tried to undertake all their monthly production quota in a very short space of time. This was usually the result of a lack of industrial materials that left factories without the resources to complete production until new supplies arrived at the end of the month. Workers then worked as many hours as possible to meet monthly quotas in time; this exhausted them and left them unable to work at the beginning of the next month (although lack of raw materials meant there would have been very little for them to produce at this point anyway).

To encourage individual workers to work hard and produce as much as they possibly could, most workers in Soviet industry were paid on a <a href="Piece%20work">piece-rate</a>; their wage payments depended upon how much work they personally completed. Soviet workers were given individual quotas for the amount of work they should personally deliver and would earn a basic wage ("stavka") by fulfilling 100 percent of their quota. The wage rate for work would grow as production over this level increased. If a worker produced 120 percent of his own personal quota for the month (for example, if he was supposed to produce 1,000 items, but actually produced 1,200) he would receive his basic wage for the first 100 percent, a higher rate for the first 10 percent of over production and an even higher rate for the next 10 percent. Soviet authorities hoped that this would encourage a <a href="Stakhanovite%20movement">Stakhanovite</a> spirit of overfulfillment of quotas among the Soviet workforce. In 1956, approximately 75 percent of Soviet workers were paid under such a piece-rate system, so the majority of Soviet workers could significantly boost their earnings by increasing their output.

Average wage rates in the Soviet Union were published relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. <a href="Alexander%20Nove">Alec Nove</a> wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published for the first time since the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.

The piece-rate approach to wages had been introduced in the first Five-Year Plan in 1928 and had changed very little since then. In practice the piece-rate system led to many inefficiencies in Soviet industry. One issue was the vast bureaucracy that was involved in administering wage payments. Each Soviet ministry or government department would set its own rates and wage scales for work in the factories or enterprises for which they were responsible. Within one ministry there could be great variation in pay rates for jobs requiring largely identical responsibilities and skills, based on what the factory was producing, the location of the factory and other factors that Moscow considered important. Basing payments on these central directives often led to long and costly processes in the calculation of wages. Historian Donald Filtzer wrote of one 1930s machinist who in one month completed 1,424 individual pieces of work. Amongst these had been 484 differing tasks, all of which had been assigned a basic individual payment rate of between 3 and 50 kopeks each (1 ruble was equal to 100 kopeks). To calculate this worker's wage, his employer had to process 2,885 documents which had required some 8,500 signatures on of paper, costing the factory 309 rubles, a fifth of what they would pay the worker, whose total earnings for the labour amounted to 1,389 rubles.

Time workers—workers who were paid for the time they spent working rather than by how much they individually produced—also received bonuses based on performance. Factory managers, who did not want these workers to lose out to their piece-rate colleagues, often manipulated output figures to ensure that they would (on paper) overfulfill their targets and therefore receive their bonuses. Typically, managers were loath to see their employees' wages fall too low, so they frequently kept quotas deliberately low, or offered ways for workers to manipulate their work outputs to achieve a higher bonus. They generally did this to ensure that their factory could run smoothly, rather than out of concern for the workers' personal welfare. The erratic and seemingly arbitrary way that quotas had been set across different industries led to a high level of uncompleted production in industries where it was more difficult to overfulfill production quotas. Managers therefore tried to keep quotas deliberately low to attract workers to their factories to ensure their factories were able to meet their targets.

Even without managerial manipulation, quotas were very often low and easy to overfulfill. Quotas had been lowered during the Second World War so that new workers would be able to fulfill their output expectations; in industries such as engineering, it was common for workers to double their basic pay through bonuses.

After the death of Stalin, the Soviet Union went through a process of moving away from Stalinist policies known as <a href="de-Stalinization">de-Stalinization</a>. The purpose of de-Stalinization included not only ending the use of terror and the <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a> system that had existed under Stalin, but also reforming the economic policies of the Soviet Union. In the 1950s, the Soviet economy had begun to fall behind schedule in the output of several key materials including coal, iron and cement, and worker productivity was not growing at the rate expected. In May 1955, "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" (the official newspaper of the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee</a> of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party</a>) announced that a State Committee on Labour and Wages had been formed to investigate changes to wages and a centralised system of wage adjustments. In July 1955, Soviet <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Premier</a> <a href="Nikolai%20Bulganin">Nikolai Bulganin</a> spoke of the need for Soviet industry to end outdated work quotas and reform wages, so that the Soviet Union could better incentivise workers and reduce <a href="labour%20turnover">labour turnover</a>. The subsequent <a href="Five-Year%20Plans%20for%20the%20National%20Economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%23Sixth%20Plan.2C%201956.E2.80.931960">sixth Five-Year Plan for 1956 to 1960</a> included calls for a reform of wages. The reforms had several objectives, the most important of which was to create a more consistent system of incentives for workers. It was also hoped that the reforms would help to reduce the levels of waste and misallocation of labour that were frequently found in Soviet industry.

The Sixth Five Year Plan made several key changes to Soviet workers' wages. Firstly, basic wages were increased so that there would be less pressure to overfulfill quotas, and therefore less pressure to manipulate or distort results. Wage increases were restricted to the lowest paid jobs, as <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> sought to be seen as the "friend to the underdog". It was also hoped that wage rises for lower paid jobs would encourage more women to enter industry and that freezes on higher paid jobs would deter people from leaving employment.

Secondly, quotas were raised to limit the ability of workers to overfulfill targets. In the case of time workers, this was sometimes done by keeping quotas the same but reducing hours; for example, coal miners saw their working day shortened to six hours. Some rises were very steep; in the case of engineering enterprises, quotas were raised by 65 percent.

The number of wage rates and wage scales was drastically reduced; this not only cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more eager to take on a wider range of tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.

A major change was made in the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates increased as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.

Lastly, workers whose tasks were considered too important to be paid on a piece-rate basis were moved to a time-rate method. This was largely done in consideration of safety grounds and usually applied to those conducting maintenance or the repair of equipment.

The reform's clearest effect was to reduce the proportion of Soviet industrial labour that was paid by piece-rate, and by August 1962, 60.5 percent of Soviet workers were paid by piece-rate, down from the 1956 level of 75 percent. Around half of those who remained on piece-rates would continue to receive some kind of bonus payment, but the progressive piece-rate bonuses were mostly eliminated, with only 0.5 percent of workers continuing to receive them in 1962. Workers who were taken off piece-rate payments were then paid an hourly rate or received a salary.

By 1961, workers' basic wages had risen to an average of about 73 percent of their total earnings; piece-rate workers saw an average of 71 percent and time workers 76 percent of their earnings as their basic wage. There was also a reduction in the overall level of quota overfulfillment—with quotas raised, many could not meet their own personal quota. The proportion of workers who achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota fulfillment fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.

Overall wages rose much more slowly throughout the period than planned: wages across the entire state (not only industrial wages) rose by 22.9 percent between 1959 and 1965, against a plan for growth of 26 percent. Wage rises during the reform were made up for by increases in industrial productivity. For example, in the <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">RSFSR</a> (Russia) wages rose by 7 percent between 1959 and 1962, whilst productivity increased by some 20 percent.

The wage reform was linked to a program that reduced the length of the overall working week in the Soviet Union, and in 1958, the working week was reduced from 48 hours to 41. This was to apply to all Soviet workers, and by 1961, 40 million Soviet workers (approximately two thirds of the workforce) were working a 41-hour week. It was planned to decrease this further to 40 hours in 1962, but this was eventually not carried out. Khrushchev had stated a longer-term aim of giving Soviet workers the shortest working hours in the world, aiming for a 30- to 35-hour week by 1968. He had spoken previously of the reduction of working hours as a basic goal of a <a href="communism">communist movement</a> and had hoped that communism would eventually achieve a working day of 3–4 hours.

Whilst the reform did remove some of the peculiarities of the Stalinist era, the overall impact of program created additional problems for the Soviet worker. In many areas, large variations in wages continued to exist. In engineering, for example, factory managers often ignored wage directives to try to encourage workers into roles that had lost much of their attraction after basic wages were cut to match pay throughout an area. Managers would therefore offer higher wages to new trainees. This had the effect of encouraging some to take a high-paid training position and then leave for a new training position upon qualification. In coal mining, managers had long held the ability to vary wages based on local considerations, such as geological factors or hazard levels, and after the reform they continued to vary wages through manipulation of quotas or rates to protect workers' wages. A further problem with a centrally directed bonus system was that it encouraged factories to continue producing well established, more familiar products because it was far easier to overfulfill targets on familiar products than to start work on new items.

Sometimes in areas where the new wages were applied, factories would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low pay grade to a task that was considered to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low pay grade, and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.

In other instances, managers deliberately used the reforms as an opportunity to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that they would be able to cut back on overall expenditure. In one case, a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.

Overall, the wage reform failed to create a stable and predictable incentives system. Filtzer wrote that wider issues in Soviet industry and relations between managers and workers are important in understanding the failure. Filtzer noted a myriad of issues in Soviet production that had meant a more formal bonus system was unworkable in the Soviet Union: irregular availability of supplies that were often of variable quality, an irrational <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a> and a reliance on "storming" that made it difficult to motivate workers through a more conventional payments system. In such cases, it was vital to have the ability to offer additional overtime payments and even use bribes or "palm-greasing" to incentivise workers to meet monthly quotas on time.

Filtzer also stated that because Soviet workers were unable to organise against their superiors in the same way that their counterparts in the West could (for example by forming an independent <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> or joining a political party in opposition to the ruling <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>) they had undergone a process of "hyper individualisation", a process that had been heavily influenced by the overall incentive process. This had led to a situation where workers who could not count on a Western-style meritocracy (where they might expect to find their pay and conditions improve with promotions) would instead have to rely on the decisions of managers to give bonuses and overtime payments if they wanted to increase their wages. Because managers needed to be able to give rewards and bonuses at their own discretion, sticking to a centrally directed system of wages was very difficult.

In terms of <a href="labor%20process%20theory">labour process theory</a>—the attempt to understand the relationship between management control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers over their own labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. On the shop floor, workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what "skill" they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had to find their own ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (<a href="Perestroika">Perestroika</a>), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.

Black Hours, Morgan MS 493

The Black Hours, MS M.493 (or the Morgan Black Hours) is an <a href="Illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated</a> <a href="book%20of%20hours">book of hours</a> produced in <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> between 1460 and 1475, although dates as late as 1480 have been suggested. It consists of 121 leaves, most containing blocks of Latin text written in <a href="Blackletter">Gothic minuscule</a> <a href="calligraphy">script</a>, arranged in rows of fourteen lines. The lettering is inscribed in silver and <a href="Gilding">gold</a>, and placed within borders ornamented with flowers, foliage and <a href="Grotesque">grotesques</a>, all on pages dyed a deep blueish black. It contains fourteen full-page <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniatures</a>, and opens with the months of the <a href="Liturgical_year%23Catholic_Church">liturgical calendar</a> (folios 3 <a href="Recto%20and%20verso">verso</a>–14 recto), followed by the <a href="Little%20Office%20of%20Our%20Lady">Hours of the Virgin</a> (folios 14v–98v), and ends with the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Dead">Office of the Dead</a> (folio 121v). The book follows the <a href="Roman%20Rite">Roman version</a> of the texts and has been in the collection of the <a href="Morgan%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Morgan Library & Museum</a>, New York, since 1912.

MS M.493 is one of seven surviving <a href="black%20books%20of%20hours">black books of hours</a>, all originating from Bruges and dated to the mid-to-late 15th century. They are so named from their unusual dark blueish appearance, a colourisation achieved through the expensive process of dyeing the <a href="vellum">vellum</a> with <a href="iron%20gall%20ink">iron gall ink</a>. This dye is very corrosive and the surviving examples have mostly decomposed; MS M.493 is in relatively good condition due to its very thick parchment.

The book is a masterpiece of Late Gothic manuscript illumination. No records survive of its commission, but its uniquely dark tone, expense of production, quality and rarity suggest ownership by privileged and sophisticated members of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian</a> court. The book is often attributed, on stylistic grounds, to a follower of <a href="Willem%20Vrelant">Willem Vrelant</a>, a leading and influential Flemish illuminator.

The <a href="black%20books%20of%20hours">black books of hours</a> are a grouping of four to five (some books so defined contain only a few pages in this style) extant <a href="Flemish">Flemish</a> <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s so named for their dark appearance. The effect was achieved by soaking the vellum in black dye or ink before they were lettered with gold and silver leaf. The black dye was highly corrosive and so the metals had to be of high purity, and the vellum needed to be unusually thick to survive the process. The black manuscripts date from about 1455–80 and include the "<a href="Black%20Hours%2C%20Hispanic%20Society%2C%20New%20York">Black Hours, Hispanic Society, New York</a>" (c. 1458), "<a href="Black%20Hours%20of%20Galeazzo%20Maria%20Sforza">Black Hours of Galeazzo Maria Sforza</a>" (c. 1466–67) and the "<a href="Hours%20of%20Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Hours of Mary of Burgundy</a>" (c. 1477). They can be assumed to have been produced for high-ranking members of society. MS M.493 was likely intended for high nobility: the artwork is of a sophisticated and unusual taste, and the uncommon colour of the pages supposedly carried an almost mystical aura for the owner.

The <a href="Burgundy">Burgundian</a> court were known to have had a preference for dark, sombre colours, and the black books can be assumed to have been designed specifically for their taste. Black books were more highly regarded than conventional illuminated books of hours, and today art historians assume they were commissioned by the court of <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>. Philip's proclivity for black arose from the <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20the%20Fearless">brutal assassination</a> in 1419 of his father <a href="John%20the%20Fearless">John the Fearless</a>. The funeral procession was lined with 2000 black flags with black <a href="Heraldic%20standard">standards</a>. From then on Philip only wore black clothes, as an expression of his grief. The style was adapted by other members of the court, who seem to have favoured black against gold and silver in artworks as well in formal dress, as can be seen in <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>'s contemporary "<a href="Jean%20Wauquelin%20presenting%20his%20%27Chroniques%20de%20Hainaut%27%20to%20Philip%20the%20Good">Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good</a>". <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Maximilian I</a> observed of the Burgundian rulers that "the entire holding of the court was luxurious, the home treasury, and the library full of treasures, and the court ceremonial were oriented on a godlike super-elevation of the ruler."

The book's parchment was darkened by soaking it in <a href="iron%20gall%20ink">iron gall ink</a>. This can be corrosive to both parchment and dye, and only golden pigments could withstand the corrosion. The surviving black books are generally in poor condition; MS M.493 is the best-preserved example, its thick leaves having protected the parchment. The manuscript's pages are largely intact; the other black books can only be displayed within air-tight <a href="acrylic%20resin">acrylic</a> glass panes and are quite decayed.

The manuscript does not contain any family crest to identify the donor, who, given the expense of the book and its labour-intensive production, is assumed to have been a high-ranking member of court; <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints">feast days</a> noted in the calendars, including for <a href="Donatian%20of%20Reims">Donatian of Reims</a> (14 October), indicate it was produced in Bruges, or given the inclusion of the feast of <a href="Livinus">Livinus</a> (12 November), possibly in <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>.

The artists who designed, illustrated and inscribed MS M.493 are unknown, as are the circumstances of its commission. The book is often linked to the circle of the <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> illuminator <a href="Willem%20Vrelant">Willem Vrelant</a>, who was highly regarded and successful, and was active in Bruges from the 1450s until his death in 1481. This attribution is based on the resemblance of some of the figures in the miniatures with those in works attributed to him; the angular and linear manner of the figures' clothes is also consistent with his style. The text "pro me peccatore" ("for me a sinner"), which uses a masculine form of the Latin noun, indicates that the book was produced for a man, and the inventory records of its mid-19th-century owner, Nicholas Yemeniz, records that it was produced by a workshop that had often been commissioned by the Burgundian Dukes. 

Other possible attributions include the circle of the French painter Philippe de Mazerolles (d. 1479) or the workshop of Liévin van Lathem (active 1454–93). According to the Morgan Library, van Lathem's influence can be seen in the "figures in angular drapery [who] move somewhat stiffly in shallowly defined spaces...[while] the men's flat faces are dominated by large noses". The style of the miniatures and borders are similar to those of the Galeazzo Maria Sforza in Vienna, but they are not from the same workshop.

The manuscript consists of 122 pages each measuring about 17 × 12 cm. The borders are coloured in light blue and the colour scheme of the illustrations is overwhelmingly dark, consisting of black, grey red, old rose and green pigments, with some white and flesh-tone colours. Each miniature is placed opposite a prayer inscribed in gold text against a dark background. This book's solemnity is in contrast to the bright colours found in most contemporary <a href="Book%20of%20hours">books of hours</a> and seems to reflect a rather gloomy and mournful court outlook. The blues were formed from different mixtures of ingredients, each allowing varying depths and varieties of colour. The miniature's technique and style can be dated as around 1475. The rarity of <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a> pigment, then worth more by weight than gold, meant that it was extremely costly in the 15th century, and its prevalence in this work is an indicator of the wealth and status of its owner. 

The initial letters of the texts are formed from gold leaf on green ground. The texts consist of the Hours of the Cross, the Hours of the Holy Spirit, the Mass of the Virgin, the Hours of the Virgin, the <a href="Penitential%20Psalms">Penitential Psalms</a>, and the Office of the Dead. The words are inscribed in <a href="blackletter">Gothic minuscule</a> with silver ink, with gold leaf added for the <a href="rubric">rubric</a>s. The border decorations include landscapes, jagged <a href="acanthus%20%28ornament%29">acanthus</a> <a href="scroll">scroll</a>s, birds, small animals and grotesques; the latter are similar in style to those found in the Black Hours of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, and include naked winged devils and hybrid men. They are ornamented exclusively in gold and are shaded mostly by black pigment. They are lined with yellow or gold <a href="filigree">filigree</a> and extravagant foliage, including vines. The manuscript has deteriorated over time and has flaked in some areas. 

The book was <a href="Bookbinding">rebound</a> in the 19th century for its then owner, the French bibliophile , by the bookbinder (known as Trautz-Bauzonnet), and is today encased in a wooden box, which is also modern. The binding is in tan pigskin with oxidised silver <a href="Fastener">clasps</a>. Yemenzi's monogram of two interlocking "Y"'s is stamped on the central panel of the binding and on the clasps.

The miniatures depict scenes from the lives of the Virgin and Christ and are placed to the left (<a href="Recto%20and%20verso">verso</a>) pages of the book, mostly against calendar representations of days from the liturgical year. The illuminations include biblical figures dressed in contemporary late <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> or Gothic dress. In folio 76v, <a href="David">David</a> wears the ceremonial robes of a 15th-century monarch. The border decorations around the miniatures are particularly vivid in detail. 

The "Crucifixion" (folio 14v) is the book's most acclaimed illustration. It is outlined by border illustrations of fantastical creatures and a peacock. The illumination shows <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Jesus on the cross</a> with his head inclined and bleeding from <a href="Five%20Holy%20Wounds">multiple wounds</a>. <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Mary</a>, wearing a <a href="Wimple">wimpled</a> veil, and <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">St John</a> stand to the left of the foot of the cross. Both have <a href="Halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">halos</a>. The gesturing mourners to their right are given facial expressions that convey a deep sense of sadness and loss. Behind them are two soldiers wearing helmets, one of whom may be <a href="Longinus">Longinus</a>. The hilly landscape behind the figures depicts the walls of Jerusalem set against a deep blue sky. The marginalia contain hybrid men, including one who is half fish and lifts a sword, and another with animal legs. 

Art historian Ingo Walther described folio 18v, which depicts the <a href="Pentecost">Descent of the Holy Spirit</a>, as evidencing the "unusual, exquisite and precious overall effect...generated by using the technique of fixing an illumination on a piece of black dyed parchment". <a href="Rinceau">Rinceau</a> border decorations outline a depiction of Mary at the centre of the court of the Apostles. The gilded "D" represents the opening letter of the Hours of the Holy Spirit.

The following is a complete list of the manuscript's miniatures:

MS 493's early history is obscure, and there are no surviving title or inventory records before the 19th century. The <a href="Coat%20of%20arms">arms</a> of the family of Isabelle de Bethe is stamped on one of the pages; her family married into Burgundians and were wealthy and prominent members of Flanders society. The manuscript is described in an 1867 inventory of the collection of Nicholas Yemeniz (1806–1869), a <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> silk manufacturer born in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. It was acquired by the French publisher and art collector <a href="Didot_family%23Ambroise-Firmin_Didot">Ambroise Firmin-Didot</a> in 1871. He in turn sold the book to Alphonse Labitte in 1879. 

MS M.493 was acquired by <a href="Robert%20Hoe%20III">Robert Hoe</a> in 1909 for $500 (about $ in 2019 terms). Hoe held it until 1912; following his death that year it was sold in a large scale and commercially successful sell-off of his collection of rare and antique books. It passed between two book dealers, <a href="Bernard%20Alfred%20Quaritch">Bernard Quaritch</a> and Léon Gruel, before its eventual acquisition by the Pierpont Morgan Library later that year.

The book was exhibited at the <a href="Paris%20Colonial%20Exhibition">Paris Colonial Exhibition</a>, the Maritime et d'art Flamand in Antwerp in 1930, at the Morgan's 50th anniversary exhibition in 1957, in Brussels in 1959, and in Bruges in 1981.

It was probably commissioned for <a href="Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</a>, then the wealthiest woman in Europe; Mary was the only child of <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Duke of Burgundy</a> and wife of <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a>, ruler of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Empire</a>. No records survive as to its commission. The book contains 187 folios, each measuring . It consists of the Roman <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a>, 24 calendar roundels, 20 full-page <a href="miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniatures</a> and 16 quarter-page format illustrations. Its production began , and includes miniatures by several artists, of which the foremost was the <a href="notname">unidentified</a> but influential <a href="Illuminated%20manuscript">illuminator</a> known as the <a href="Master%20of%20Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Master of Mary of Burgundy</a>, who provides the book with its most meticulously detailed illustrations and borders. Other miniatures, considered of an older tradition, were contributed by <a href="Simon%20Marmion">Simon Marmion</a>, <a href="Willem%20Vrelant">Willem Vrelant</a> and <a href="Lieven%20van%20Lathem">Lieven van Lathem</a>. The majority of the <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a> is attributed to <a href="Nicolas%20Spierinc">Nicolas Spierinc</a>, with whom the Master collaborated on other works and who may also have provided a number of illustrations. 

The two most well known illustrations contain a revolutionary technique of showing a second <a href="perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a> through an open window from the main pictorial setting. It is sometimes known as one of the <a href="black%20books%20of%20hours">black books of hours</a>, due to the dark and sombre appearance of the first 34 pages, in which the gilded letter was written on black panels. The book has been described as "undoubtedly [...] among the most important works of art made in the late middle ages...a milestone in the history of art and one of the most precious objects of the late middle ages". Given the dark colourisation and mournful tone of the opening folios, the book may originally have been intended to mark the death of Charles, who died aged 43 in 1477 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nancy">Battle of Nancy</a>. Mid-ways through its production it is thought to have been recommissioned as gift to celebrate Mary's marriage to Maximilian. Tonally the early pages change from dark, sombre colours to a later sense of optimism and unity.

The book was for centuries known as the "Vienna Hours of Charles the Bold", and thought to have been intended to mark Charles's death at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nancy">Battle of Nancy</a> on 5 January 1477, and thus as a book of mourning, intended for either his wife, <a href="Margaret%20of%20York">Margaret of York</a>, or Mary. As the only daughter of the couple, Mary became both the wealthiest heiress in Europe and the last of her hereditary line. The idea that it was originally a book of mourning is reinforced by the mournful appearance of the opening 34 pages, where the gold and silver lettering is placed on <a href="parchment">parchment</a> that has been stained black, in a technique associated with the so-called <a href="black%20books%20of%20hours">black books of hours</a>. Only seven of these <a href="Illuminated%20manuscript">Illuminated manuscript</a>s survive today, all produced in the mid to late 15th century. Given their novel visual appeal, and the use of gold and silver leaf, they were more expensive and highly prized than more conventional books of hours, and produced for high-ranking members of the court of <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a> and Charles the Bold. The <a href="Burgundy">Burgundian</a> court had a preference for dark, sombre colourisation and the extant works in this style were mostly commissioned for them. Only the wealthy nobility could have afforded such books, and the taste for mournful colours – often reflected in their dress style – was reflected in the black, gold and silver of these manuscripts.

After page 35, the parchment is predominantly left white and the images are lighter in tone. Given this change, the intention for the book may have changed from mourning to celebration: that is, its purpose changed from being a commemoration of Charles's death, to a token of honour for Mary's marriage to Maximilian. This is indicated by the items on the window sill next to her in the Virgin in the Church illustration. Traditionally, <a href="pearl">pearl</a>s represent purity, and a transparent <a href="veil">veil</a> signifies virtue, while red <a href="Dianthus%20caryophyllus">carnations</a> were often used as symbols of love. Evidence that it was commissioned for Mary include the feminine gender endings in some of the prayers and the recurring pairs of gold armorial shields throughout the book, indicating that it was prepared for an upcoming marriage. Art historian Antoine De Schryver argues that this change of purpose, and the pressure of completion for the wedding date of August 1477 explains why so many individual artists were involved.

Work on the book is thought to have begun c. 1470. The Flemish artist Nicolas Spierinc, a favourite of the Burgundian court and Charles in particular, has been identified as the chief scribe of the elegant and complex calligraphy. He may have directed assistants to carry out some of the lettering, excepting key passages. An anagram of his name appears on the borders of the miniature on folio 94v, "The Way to Calvary".

The miniatures were completed by a team of at least nine artists and illustrators, including Simon Marmion, attributed a single illustration, Willem Vrelant and Lieven van Lathem. Van Lathem is attributed with the "Christ before Pilate" miniature, which seems influenced by Hand K of the <a href="Turin-Milan%20Hours">Turin-Milan Hours</a> (c. 1420). Most attention is given to the innovative images attributed to the Master of Mary of Burgundy, known to have been active in Flanders between 1469–83, and who was greatly influenced by the innovations of contemporary northern European <a href="panel%20painting">panel painting</a>, particularly the melancholy of <a href="Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes">Hugo van der Goes</a> and the <a href="illusionism%20%28art%29">illusionism</a> of <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>. The Master is thought to have been the primary illuminator responsible for a second book commissioned by the family, the "Prayer Book of Charles the Bold", now in Berlin. 
A majority have been specifically attributed to one of these artists, though there is some debate over a number. The illustrations can be characterised by the use of everyday devotional objects, including books, rosary beads and contemporary everyday settings, to frame images of divine saints and thereby bringing the sacred into domestic, earthly spaces.

The book consists of 186 original folios of 22.5 x 16.3 cm and 3 folios that were later additions, which measure 21.2 x 15.2 cm. In total there are 20 full-page miniatures, 14 smaller miniatures, 24 calendar sheets, 14 <a href="historiated%20initial">historiated initial</a>s and 78 ornamental borders. The text is preoccupied with the <a href="litany">litany</a>, and <a href="intercession">intercessory</a> prayers. The margins on almost every page are decorated with <a href="drollerie">drollerie</a> consisting of flowers, insects, jewels and <a href="sibyl">sibyl</a>s, some of which were designed by Lieven Van Lathem. Those most praised by art historians were created by the Master of Mary of Burgundy. The marginalia and drolleries are painted in such a way as to suggest that objects are sprinkled over the foil in a three dimensional manner that suggest, according to art historian <a href="Otto%20P%C3%A4cht">Otto Pächt</a>, that they seem not so much "in the imaginary space of the picture, but in that of the real world".

The book contains 20 full-page miniatures and 16 small format illustrations. They are all of the highest quality, and can be mostly attributed to individual artists or hands. There are noticeable changes in standards and style between the miniatures attributed to the Master of Mary of Burgundy and those attributed to other hands. There is some commonality between the images; the idealised facial types are similar, and thin <a href="cumulus%20cloud">cumulus cloud</a>s appear throughout. 
The Master's work is characterised by mixed colours that whiten toward the horizon, while in others they are saturated. He achieved the modelling of figures and objects by building layers of paint in thin but visible brush strokes, rather than <a href="hatching">hatching</a>. His palette is noticeably darker than that of the other hands, mostly consisting of purples, browns and greys, with the areas around the figure's faces and hands coloured with black pigment. The art historian Thomas Kren says his miniatures in this book "constitute an art of profound emotion; subtle atmospheric effects; abundant, richly textured detail; and the most delicate draftsmanship. His miniatures convey a powerful sense of the moment".

The book's best known miniatures, the "Virgin and Child", "Christ Nailed to the Cross", and the "Crucifixion", are attributed to the Master. Folio 14v shows the <a href="Mary%2C%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Virgin Mary</a> in a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic church</a> seen through the window of a room containing Mary of Burgundy at her devotions, reading from an open book, with the Virgin appearing as if the embodiment of Mary's prayers. In Folio 43v, Christ lays on his cross, in an expansive view of <a href="Calvary">Calvary</a>, seemingly viewed through a window. In both, the background scene becomes the main focus, with the foreground image merely providing the setting for the 'main stage'. It is because of these two miniatures that the Master is seen as the main innovator in bringing about a new style of Flemish illumination in the 1470s and 1480s, earning him a great number of imitators. The colourisation is often extremely subtle, with some illustrations containing upwards of eighteen different shades.

Mary of Burgundy can be identified as the woman in the foreground of folio 14v from the facial similarity to documented contemporary drawings and paintings. She is shown as an elegant young princess, reading a book of hours. Her finger traces the text of what seem to be the words "Obsecro te Domina sancta maria" ("I Beseech Thee, Holy Mary"), a popular <a href="Indulgence">prayer of indulgence</a> in contemporary manuscript illuminations of <a href="Donor%20portrait">donors</a> venerating the Virgin and Child. Mary is positioned in an intimate and private domestic setting, probably a private chapel or <a href="oratory%20%28worship%29">oratory</a>, reading a book of hours draped in a green cloth. A small white dog, a symbol of faithfulness, rests on her lap. She wears a gold or brown velvet dress, and a long <a href="hennin">hennin</a>, from which hangs a transparent veil. The window before her is opened throw two timber boards adorned with glass. Its ledge contains a veil, rosary beads, a gold chain with a ruby and four pearls, two red carnations as symbols of <a href="betrothal">betrothal</a>, and a crystal vase containing a large flowering <a href="iris%20%28plant%29">iris</a>, a late medieval symbol of purity.

The Virgin and Child are visible through the open window as an "image within an image", as if as an <a href="apparitional%20experience">apparition</a> or the literal embodiment of the book she is reading. Thus Mary of Burgundy is placed in close physical proximity to the Virgin, without the usual intercession of the saint. The holy family are seated in a Gothic church with a high vaulted ambulatory, before the <a href="Altar%20in%20the%20Catholic%20Church">high altar</a>, in front of which is a <a href="Latticework">lattice-patterned</a> decorative carpet. Four angels sit at the corners of the carpet, each holding a gold candlestick marking the sacred space. Three court ladies, one looking outwards, are positioned to the left, kneeling with their hands clasped in prayer. One, probably Mary of Burgundy, wears a blue <a href="brocade">brocade</a> and gown, and holds a small book in her hands. The other two ladies seem to be her attendants. A male figure kneeling to the right is dressed in red and swings a <a href="censer">censer</a> of burning <a href="incense">incense</a>, while two other figures are positioned behind the high alter.

The use of an open window was influenced by van Eyck's c. 1435 oil-on-panel painting the "<a href="Madonna%20of%20Chancellor%20Rolin">Madonna of Chancellor Rolin</a>", where the pictorial space is divided into two areas; a foreground <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> interior which leads out, through <a href="Arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcades</a>, to an expansive bright lit exterior landscape. In the Vienna miniature, the artist achieves the transition from foreground to background by slowly diminishing the figures' scale and plasticity. The illustration has been compared in breadth of detail and style to van Eyck's "<a href="Madonna%20in%20the%20Church">Madonna in the Church</a>", a small panel painting, which is yet twice the size of the Master's illumination.

Folio 43v, "Christ nailed to the Cross", shows a biblical scene viewed through the elaborately carved stone window of a contemporary late 15th century setting. The foreground interior scene is empty of people, but can again be assumed to be an oratory, and contains an array of attributes and objects of devotion, including a prayer book with black <a href="chemise">chemise</a> binding, <a href="prayer%20beads">prayer beads</a>, a brocade cushion and a number of jewels. The background composition consists of a complex exploration of perspective. The artist employs a central axis and <a href="vanishing%20point">vanishing point</a> to create an aerial perspective of sophistication previously unseen in northern illumination. As art historian <a href="Susie%20Nash">Susie Nash</a> notes, "Mary [of Burgundy], looking at her prayer book, would see on this page a depiction of the accouterments of prayer she might also be currently be using in reality, set around the real prayer book in which they are depicted". 

The viewer is thus positioned, as if from the point of view of the reader of the book itself, outside of the main pictorial setting. The scene beyond the window contains a cast of characters numbering in the many hundreds, before an expansive landscape and threatening and gloomy sky. The vast panorama is achieved by the illuminator's skill in achieving depth, recession and scale. But the figure's distance from the viewer means that they are rendering in a rather vague and summary style. The figure of Christ seems modeled on a similar painting of <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">the Crucifixion</a> attributed to <a href="Gerard%20David">Gerard David</a>, now in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London. The women, particularly at the front, wear a variety of exotic and extravagant headgear, of types also seen in the "Virgin and Child", in folio 152v "The Presentation in the Temple", from his <a href="Book%20of%20Hours%20of%20Engelbert%20of%20Nassau">Book of Hours of Engelbert of Nassau</a>, and in attributed miniatures from the "Trivulzio Hours".

In the scene, two crosses have already been erected, on top of two small mounds. But there is no third, larger mound, which should be positioned between those of the thieves, and bearing Christ's cross. Because of this anomaly, Nash believes that the viewer's perspective is deliberately misleading; the viewer is not looking out towards <a href="Calvary">Golgotha</a>, but is "on" Golgotha. Nash suggests that this explains why a praying figure is absent from the room before the window - Mary is participating in the actual event. She further notes that <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a>, usually closely associated with the crucifixion, is also missing, and speculates that Mary be playing the role normally associated with the Magdalene.

The margins of the page are decorated with imaginative and somewhat whimsical flowers, insects and a jewel. The influence of van der Goes can be seen in the modelling of St John, who closely resembles the same figure in the earlier artist's "The Fall of Man and The Lamentation" of 1470-75.

The Crucifixion miniature, folio 99v, shows Christ and the two thieves raised on their crosses over a vast crowd which forms around them in a circular shape. Christ's body is twisted in pain, and painted with particular detail and skill. His chest rises heavily as he gasps for breath, while his body is rendered in delicately proportional.

The Virgin Mary, dressed in blue, and Mary Magdalene, dressed in red, kneel at the foot of his cross. According to Kren, the image achieves its immediacy through the "numerous figures in motion — writhing, gesturing, stepping, or just listening with head attentively inclined". As with the other miniatures attributed to the Master, a number of the figures look outwards, as if towards the viewer. The work shows a number of similarities to a <a href="Descent%20from%20the%20Cross">Deposition</a> in the <a href="J.%20Paul%20Getty%20Museum">J. Paul Getty Museum</a>, also thought to be by the Master's hand.

<a href="Matthias%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, acquired the book around 1580; he spent much of the period 1578-81 in the Netherlands. It disappeared after his death in 1619. It is thought to have been acquired by the <a href="Austrian%20National%20Library">Austrian National Library</a> in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> c 1721-27. The library was looted by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s troops in 1809, and the book was taken to Paris. It was returned to Vienna in 1815, following Napoleon's defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>.

Norman Cob

The Norman Cob or Cob Normand is a <a href="horse%20breed">breed</a> of light <a href="draught%20horse">draught horse</a> that originated in the <a href="regions%20of%20France">region</a> of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> in northern France. It is of medium size, with a range of heights and weights, due to <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> for a wide range of uses. Its <a href="equine%20conformation">conformation</a> is similar to a robust <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>, and it more closely resembles a Thoroughbred cross than other French draught breeds. The breed is known for its lively, long-striding <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a>. Common <a href="Equine%20coat%20color">colours</a> include <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>, <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> and <a href="seal%20brown%20%28horse%29">seal brown</a>. There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for <a href="horse%20meat">meat production</a>. It is popular for recreational and competitive <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>, representing France internationally in the latter, and is also used for several <a href="equestrianism">riding</a> disciplines.

The Normandy region of France is well known for its <a href="horse%20breeding">horse breeding</a>, having also produced the <a href="Percheron%20horse">Percheron</a> and <a href="French%20Trotter">French Trotter</a>. Small horses called "bidets" were the original horses in the area, and these, crossed with other types, eventually produced the , the immediate ancestor of the Norman Cob. Although known as one of the best <a href="heavy%20warmblood">carriage horse</a> breeds available in the early 20th century, the became extinct after the advent of the automobile, having been used to develop the French Trotter, <a href="Anglo-Norman%20horse">Anglo-Norman</a> and Norman Cob. In its homeland, the Norman Cob was used widely for agriculture, even more so than the internationally known Percheron, and in 1950, the first <a href="studbook">studbook</a> was created for the breed.

The advent of mechanisation threatened all French draught breeds, and while many draught breeders turned their production towards the meat market, Norman Cob breeders instead crossed their horses with Thoroughbreds to contribute to the fledgling <a href="Selle%20Francais">Selle Francais</a> breed, now the national saddle horse of France. This allowed the Norman Cob to remain relatively the same through the decades, while other draught breeds were growing heavier and slower due to selection for meat. Between the 1970s and 1990s, the studbook went through several changes, and in the 1980s, genetic studies were performed that showed the breed suffered from <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> and <a href="genetic%20drift">genetic drift</a>. Breed enthusiasts worked to develop new selection criteria for breeding stock, and population numbers are now relatively stable. Today, Norman Cobs are mainly found in the departments of <a href="Manche">Manche</a>, <a href="Calvados%20%28department%29">Calvados</a> and <a href="Orne">Orne</a>.

The Norman Cob is a mid-sized horse, standing between and weighing . The large variations in height and weight are explained by selection for a variety of uses within the breed. The Norman Cob is elegant and closer in type to a <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>-cross than other French draught <a href="horse%20breed">breeds</a>. Its <a href="equine%20conformation">conformation</a> is similar to a robust Thoroughbred, with a square overall profile and short back. <a href="Selective%20breeding">Selective breeding</a> has been used to develop a lively <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a>, with long strides.
The head is well-proportioned and similar to that of the <a href="Selle%20Francais">Selle Francais</a>, with wide nostrils, small ears and a straight or convex facial profile. The neck is thick, muscular and arched. The mane is sometimes <a href="Mane%20%28horse%29%23Roaching%20%28USA%29%20or%20Hogging%20%28UK%29">hogged</a>. The shoulders are broad and angled, the chest deep and the withers pronounced. The body is compact and stocky, with a short, strong back. The hindquarters are powerful, although not so much as in heavy draught breeds, and the <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a> muscular and sloping. The legs are short, muscular and strong, with thick bone, but less massive than most draught breeds. The feet are round, wide and solid.

Colours accepted for registration include <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>, <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> and <a href="seal%20brown%20%28horse%29">seal brown</a> (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with <a href="pangar%C3%A9">pangaré</a> markings). Bays with <a href="horse%20markings">white markings</a> are the most popular. The Norman Cob is a calm, willing horse with strong personality. Its Thoroughbred ancestry gives them energy and athleticism, and makes them mature faster than other draught breeds. They show great endurance when ridden, and are relatively hardy, accepting outdoor living and changes in climate. Traditionally the Norman Cob had its <a href="Tail%20%28horse%29%23Docking">tail docked</a>, a practice that continued until January 1996, when the practice became illegal in France.

There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for <a href="horse%20meat">meat production</a>. Horses may be automatically registered if at least 87.5 percent of their ancestors (seven out of eight) were registered Norman Cobs. Purebred stallions may not be bred more than 70 times per year. Foals produced through <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a> and <a href="embryo%20transfer">embryo transfer</a> may be registered, but <a href="cloning">cloned</a> horses may not. In general, breeders look to produce horses with good gaits and an aptitude for <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>, while keeping the conformation that makes the Norman Cob one of nine French draught breeds.

The Norman Cob comes from the <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> region of France, an area known for its horse breeding. Normandy is also the home of two other breeds, the <a href="Percheron">Percheron</a> and the <a href="French%20Trotter">French Trotter</a>. Both of these breeds are better-known than the Norman Cob, although the latter is popular in its home region. The name "cob" comes from the English and Welsh <a href="Cob%20%28horse%29">cobs</a> that it resembles, with the addition of "Norman" to refer to the area in which it originated. Although generally considered a member of the <a href="draught%20horse">draught horse</a> group, the Norman Cob is special among French draught breeds. It has been used almost exclusively for the production of <a href="sport%20horse">sport horse</a>s, and has not been extensively used for the production of meat, unlike many other French draught breeds. This means that its conformation has remained relatively unchanged, as opposed to being bred for heavier weights for butchering.

The original horses in Normandy and <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> were small horses called "bidets", introduced by the <a href="Celt">Celt</a>s. The Romans crossed these horses with larger <a href="mare">mare</a>s, and beginning in the 10th century, these "Norman horses" were desired throughout Europe. During the 16th century, Norman horses were known to be heavy and strong, able to pull long distances, and used to pull artillery and <a href="diligence%20%28vehicle%29">diligences</a>. <a href="Barb%20horse">Barb</a> and <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian</a> blood was added during the reign of <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a>. The Norman Cob is descended from this Norman horse, called the . It was also influenced by crossing with other breeds including the <a href="Mecklenburger">Mecklenburger</a>, the <a href="Gelderland%20horse">Gelderland horse</a> and Danish horses. By 1840, the had become more refined, due to crosses with imported British <a href="Norfolk%20Trotter">Norfolk Trotter</a>s, as well as gaining better gaits, energy, elegance, and conformation.

The (National Stud of <a href="Saint-Lo">Saint-Lo</a>) was founded in 1806 by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. This stud and the (Stud of <a href="Le%20Pin-au-Haras">Pin</a>) became the main production centres for the . The Norman horse-Thoroughbred crossbreds produced at these studs were divided into two groups. The first were lighter cavalry horses, and the second were heavier horses, called "cobs", used for draught work in the region. At this time, there was no <a href="breed%20registry">breed registry</a> or <a href="studbook">studbook</a>; instead, selective breeding was practised by the two studs, and farmers tested the capabilities of young horses to select breeding stock.

At the very beginning of the 20th century, the was considered the best carriage horses available. The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and <a href="Anglo-Norman%20horse">Anglo-Norman</a> (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob. In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters. When the original became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types, with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.
In the regions of Saint-Lo and <a href="Cotentin">Cotentin</a>, the Norman Cob was widespread in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase in the first half of the 20th century, even through the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20France%20during%20World%20War%20II">occupation during World War II</a>. Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognised as the Norman draught horse, was not as popular in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed. In 1945, Norman Cob <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s accounted for 40% of the <a href="conscription">conscripted</a> horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.

Like all French draught breeds, the Norman Cob was threatened by the advent of mechanisation in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, through the efforts of Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draught breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.

The modern Norman Cob is slightly heavier than it was in the early 20th century, due to lighter horses of the breed being absorbed into the Selle Francais breed. In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs. In the same year, the breed registry was reorganised, and the Norman Cob placed in the draught horse category. The reorganisation of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding, and to bring attention to the risk of extinction of the breed. In 1980, the and performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been <a href="inbreeding">inbred</a> and suffered <a href="genetic%20drift">genetic drift</a> from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the situation of the breed precarious.

Enthusiasts worked to reorient the breed towards driving and recreation pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganised the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook was created for the breed, with new selection criteria designed to preserve the quality of the breed, particularly its <a href="horse%20gait">gaits</a>. The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the (National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in <a href="Tessy-sur-Vire">Tessy-sur-Vire</a>. The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, <a href="Vendee">Vendee</a> and <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.

Today, Norman Cobs are mainly found in the departments of <a href="Manche">Manche</a>, <a href="Calvados%20%28department%29">Calvados</a> and <a href="Orne">Orne</a>, which form the area where the breed was originally developed. The region of Saint-Lo, which ranks first in the production of Norman Cobs, represents 35 percent of new births. The Norman Cob is also present around the Haras de la Vendee (Stud at Vendee), which represents 25 percent of births, the Haras du Pin and in central <a href="Massif">Massif</a>. In 2004, there were just over 600 French breeders of the Norman Cob, and in 2005, 914 Norman Cob mares were bred, with 65 stallions recorded as active in France. In recent years, the number of Norman Cobs has remained relatively stable. In 2011, there were 319 Norman Cob births in France, and numbers of annual births between 1992 and 2010 ranged between 385 and 585.

Members of the breed are shown annually at the <a href="Paris%20International%20Agricultural%20Show">Paris International Agricultural Show</a>. There are fairs held for the breed at <a href="Lessay">Lessay</a> and <a href="Gavray">Gavray</a>, in Manche. The National Stud at Saint-Lo remains involved in the maintenance and development of the breed, and organises the annual national competition for the breed. The stud also organises events at which to present the breed to the public, including the Normandy Horse Show. The Norman Cob is beginning to be exported to other countries, especially Belgium. In that country, some are bred pure, while others are crossed on the <a href="Ardennes%20horse">Ardennes</a> to improve its gaits. Approximately 15 horses are exported annually, travelling to Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Italy for leisure, logging and agricultural uses.

A multi-purpose breed, the Norman Cob was formerly used wherever there was a need. It was used in a variety of agricultural and other work by farmers, and was used by the army for pulling artillery. The postal service used it to pull mail carriages, which it was capable of doing at a fast trot over bad roads for long distances. Postal workers appreciated the breed for its willingness to remain calm, stationary and tethered for long periods of time. Due to the modernisation of agriculture and transport, it is now used very little in these areas.
The breed is popular for recreational and competitive driving, to which it is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified to take into account the speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of <a href="Boulonnais%20horse">Boulonnais</a> were particularly affected. Its gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third of the horses represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at international level.

The Norman Cob is also used for riding, and may be used for most equestrian disciplines. It is particularly well suited for <a href="equestrian%20vaulting">vaulting</a>. Elderly and nervous riders often appreciate its calm temperament. Lighter Cobs can be used for <a href="field%20hunter">mounted hunts</a>. Crosses between the Norman Cob and Thoroughbred continue to be made to create saddle horses, generally with 25 to 50 percent Cob blood. Some Norman Cobs are bred for the meat market. The breed is sometimes preferred by butchers because of the lighter carcass weight and increased profitability over the Thoroughbred, while at the same time retaining meat similar in flavour and appearance to that of the Thoroughbred.

Augustinian theodicy

The Augustinian theodicy, named for the 4th- and 5th-century theologian and philosopher <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, is a type of <a href="Christian%20theology">Christian</a> <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a> designed in response to the <a href="evidential%20problem%20of%20evil">evidential problem of evil</a>. As such, it attempts to explain the probability of an <a href="omnipotence">omnipotent</a> (all-powerful) and <a href="omnibenevolence">omnibenevolent</a> (all-good) <a href="God%20in%20Christianity">God</a> amid evidence of evil in the world. A number of variations of this kind of theodicy have been proposed throughout history; their similarities were first described by the 20th-century philosopher <a href="John%20Hick">John Hick</a>, who classified them as "Augustinian". They typically assert that God is perfectly (ideally) <a href="good%20and%20evil">good</a>; that he created the world <a href="Ex%20nihilo">out of nothing</a>; and that evil is the result of humanity's <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>. The entry of evil into the world is generally explained as punishment for <a href="sin">sin</a> and its continued presence due to humans' misuse of <a href="free%20will">free will</a>. God's goodness and benevolence, according to the Augustinian theodicy, remain perfect and without responsibility for evil or suffering.

Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the theodicy. He rejected the idea that evil exists in itself, instead regarding it as a corruption of goodness, caused by humanity's abuse of free will. Augustine believed in the existence of a physical <a href="Hell">Hell</a> as a punishment for sin, but argued that those who choose to accept the <a href="salvation%20%28Christianity%29">salvation</a> of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> will go to <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a>. In the 13th century, <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> – influenced by Augustine – proposed a similar theodicy based on the view that God is goodness and that there can be no evil in him. He believed that the existence of goodness allows evil to exist, through the fault of humans. Augustine also influenced <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, who supported Augustine's view that evil is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring God's <a href="grace%20%28Christianity%29">grace</a> to give moral guidance.

The theodicy was criticised by Augustine's contemporary Fortunatus, a <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaean</a> who contended that God must still be somehow implicated in evil, and 18th-century theologian <a href="Francesco%20Antonio%20Zaccaria">Francesco Antonio Zaccaria</a> criticised Augustine's concept of evil for not dealing with individual human suffering. Hick regards evil as necessary for the moral and spiritual development of humans, and <a href="process%20theology">process theologians</a> have argued that God is not omnipotent and so cannot be responsible for any evil. The logic of Augustine's approach has been adapted by <a href="Alvin%20Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a>, among others. Plantinga's adapted Augustinian theodicy, the <a href="free%20will%20defence">free will defence</a> – which he proposed in the 1980s – attempts to answer only the <a href="logical%20problem%20of%20evil">logical problem of evil</a>. Such a defence (not a "theodicy" proper) does not demonstrate the existence of God, or the probable existence of God, but attempts to prove that the existence of God and the presence of evil (or "<a href="privatio%20boni">privatio boni</a>") in the world are not logically contradictory.

The Augustinian theodicy was first distinguished as a form of <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a> by <a href="John%20Hick">John Hick</a> in "Evil and the God of Love", written in 1966, in which he classified Augustine's theodicy and its subsequent developments as "Augustinian". Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which attempts to clear God of all responsibility for evil, based on human free will, and the <a href="Irenaean%20theodicy">Irenaean theodicy</a>, which casts <a href="God">God</a> as responsible for evil but justified because of its benefits for human development.

The Augustinian theodicy is a response to the <a href="Problem%20of%20evil%23Evidential%20problem%20of%20evil">evidential problem of evil</a>, which raises the concern that if God is <a href="omnipotent">omnipotent</a> and <a href="omnibenevolent">omnibenevolent</a>, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence – he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world "<a href="ex%20nihilo">ex nihilo</a>" (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the <a href="privation">privation</a> of good – the corruption of God's good creation.

The Augustinian theodicy supports the notion of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">Genesis creation narrative</a>, including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil is believed to be a just punishment for the <a href="fall%20of%20man">fall of man</a>: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a>. The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for <a href="moral%20evil">moral evil</a>: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil. The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings, maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.

<a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> (354–430 AD) was a philosopher and theologian born in <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman Africa</a> (present-day <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>). He followed the <a href="Manichaeism">Manichaean religion</a> during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, "<a href="Confessions%20%28St.%20Augustine%29">Confessions</a>" and "<a href="City%20of%20God%20%28book%29">City of God</a>", develop key ideas regarding his response to suffering. In "Confessions", Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by <a href="materialism">materialism</a> and that reading <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s works enabled him to consider the existence of a non-physical <a href="substance%20theory">substance</a>. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective, based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> and the writings of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a>. In "City of God", Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion.

Augustine proposed that evil could not exist within God, nor be created by God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity. He rejected the notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead that it is a privation of (or falling away from) good, and a corruption of nature. He wrote that "evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'" Both moral and <a href="natural%20evil">natural evil</a> occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an evil use of free will, which could be traced back to <a href="Adam%20and%20Eve">Adam and Eve's</a> original sin. He believed that this evil will, present in the <a href="soul">human soul</a>, was a corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just punishment for the sin of humans. Because Augustine believed that all of humanity was "<a href="Preformationism">seminally present in the loins of Adam</a>", he argued that all of humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment. However, in spite of his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contained no evil, they were also not perfectly good and hence could be corrupted.

Augustine believed that a physical <a href="Hell">Hell</a> exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he believed that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved if they choose to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.

Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century <a href="scholasticism">scholastic</a> philosopher and theologian heavily influenced by Augustine, proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his "<a href="Summa%20Theologica">Summa Theologica</a>". Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God, through his <a href="Quinque%20viae">Five Ways</a>, and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist. Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, and that there is no evil in God.

Aquinas supported Augustine's view that evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The existence of this evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the <a href="moral%20agency">agent</a>. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the <a href="Book%20of%20Job">Book of Job</a>, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with <a href="heaven">heaven</a> and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.

<a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, a sixteenth-century French theologian and principal figure in the development of <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>, was influenced by Augustine's works. Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be <a href="indictment">indicted</a> for it. Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin is the result of the fall of man, and argued that the human <a href="mind">mind</a>, <a href="Will%20%28philosophy%29">will</a>, and <a href="Emotion">affections</a> are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature. Calvin proposed that humanity is <a href="predestined">predestined</a>, divided into the elect and the <a href="Reprobation">reprobate</a>: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.

Augustine's "Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean", which partly touches on the problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself considered four years earlier, in "Free Will"). Quoting the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of <a href="Habit%20%28psychology%29">habits</a>. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.

Scholars of religion Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng argued that the teachings of <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a <a href="dualistic%20cosmology">dualism</a> in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This is similar to the Manicheist account of good and evil – that the two are equal and in conflict – though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict. Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents in the form of the <a href="Serpent%20%28Bible%29">serpent's</a> temptation.

The Italian theologian <a href="Francesco%20Antonio%20Zaccaria">Francesco Antonio Zaccaria</a> criticised Augustine's concept of evil in the eighteenth century. He noted a distinction between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.

John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he developed his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported the views of the German theologian <a href="Friedrich%20Schleiermacher">Friedrich Schleiermacher</a>, which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the <a href="Irenaean%20theodicy">Irenaean theodicy</a> seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them. Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render "a Christian theodicy impossible". The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.

In "God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy", published in 1976, <a href="David%20Ray%20Griffin">David Ray Griffin</a> criticised Augustine's reliance on free will and argued that it is incompatible with divine <a href="omniscience">omniscience</a> and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contended that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.

<a href="Process%20theology">Process theology</a> argues that God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, he has the power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the pain of the world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world "ex nihilo" (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.

In the 1970s, <a href="Alvin%20Plantinga">Alvin Plantinga</a> presented a version of the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory. To do this, Plantinga believed that a "possible state of affairs" must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent. He argued that a third proposition – that evil is the result of the actions of free, rational, fallible human beings – allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent. Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent – for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable. Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.

Plantinga's version of the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his <a href="natural%20theology">natural theology</a>. Rather than attempt to show the existence of God as likely in the face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian <a href="Alister%20McGrath">Alister McGrath</a> has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.

Supposing that the evolutionary theory, the current consensus, is correct, John Hick criticised Augustine's theory for being "implausible" in light of Darwin's theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, as it would make Augustine's idea of a fall from perfection inaccurate; this is reiterated by professors <a href="Nancey%20Murphy">Nancey Murphy</a> and <a href="George%20Francis%20Rayner%20Ellis">George Francis Rayner Ellis</a>, who also contend that Augustine's idea of transmitting original sin from Adam to the rest of humanity requires biological explanation. Professor of Comparative Religion <a href="Arvind%20Sharma">Arvind Sharma</a> has argued that natural evil cannot be the result of moral evil in the way Augustine suggested: scientific consensus is that natural disasters and disease existed before humans and hence cannot be the result of human sin. 

The twentieth-century philosopher <a href="Reinhold%20Niebuhr">Reinhold Niebuhr</a> attempted to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy in the light of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without <a href="Creation%20myth">mythology</a>. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil <a href="ontology">ontological</a> existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the <a href="Pelagian%20view">Pelagian view</a> that human will could overcome sin on its own. Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.

Rakoto Frah

Philibert Rabezoza (1923 – 29 September 2001), better known by the name Rakoto Frah, was a <a href="flautist">flautist</a> and composer of <a href="Music%20of%20Madagascar">traditional music</a> of the central highlands of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. Born in 1923 near the capital city of <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a> to a poor rural family, Rakoto Frah surmounted the challenges posed by his underprivileged origins to become the most acclaimed 20th century performer of the "<a href="sodina">sodina</a>" flute, one of the oldest traditional instruments on the island. Through frequent international concerts and music festival performances, he promoted the music of the highlands of Madagascar and became one of the most famous <a href="Malagasy%20people">Malagasy</a> artists, both within Madagascar and on the world music scene.

After gaining regional recognition for his sodina skills as a youth, Rakoto Frah rose to national fame in 1958 when he was selected by Malagasy President <a href="Philibert%20Tsiranana">Philibert Tsiranana</a> to perform on the sodina for the visiting French president <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>. This event launched his career as a professional musician. He first played at traditional ceremonies around the country, then expanded his performances from 1967 to include participation in international music competitions and festivals. His popularity declined in the 1970s but underwent a revival that began in the mid-1980s and continued until his death in 2001. During this period Rakoto Frah recorded ten albums, toured extensively in Madagascar and overseas, was featured in two French documentaries, and collaborated with a variety of international and Malagasy artists. Over the course of his career he recorded over 800 original compositions. Rakoto Frah and his sodina were depicted on the 200 <a href="ariary">ariary</a> Malagasy banknote in honor of his key role in revitalizing and internationally popularizing the sodina. Despite the artist's worldwide acclaim, he lived simply and died having earned little from his lifetime of musicianship. His death was widely mourned and marked by a state funeral, and in 2011 a "<a href="famadihana">famadihana</a>" (the Malagasy highland "turning of the bones" funerary tradition) was organized to celebrate the artist's life.

Philibert Rabezoza was born in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of <a href="Antananarivo">Antananarivo</a>. His mother was born in Antananarivo and his father, a herdsman and farmer from <a href="Fianarantsoa">Fianarantsoa</a>, had previously been a singer at the <a href="Merina%20people">Merina</a> <a href="Rova%20of%20Antananarivo">royal court</a> before the <a href="French%20Madagascar">colonization of Madagascar</a> in 1897. Both of Philibert's parents were already aged at the time of his birth and they struggled to care for their new son alongside his six brothers and four sisters. As a child, Philibert assisted his family with looking after the livestock and farming their plot of land. In his early years he was given the nickname Rakoto by an older brother of the same name.

Like many residents of the rural areas in central Madagascar at that time, Rakoto's brothers played the "<a href="sodina">sodina</a>", an end-blown tube traditionally made of bamboo or reed with three or six finger holes and a thumb hole down its length. One of the oldest and most iconic musical instruments in Madagascar, it is believed to have arrived on the island with the earliest settlers from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> around 2,000 years ago and remains widespread throughout the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">central highlands</a>. Young Rakoto began playing the sodina when he was seven years old. He honed his skills by listening to village elders' sodina performances, and three years later the boy formed a small musical group called Ambohijatobe that performed locally at traditional festivities. During this period Rakoto had the opportunity to participate in a community musical competition. His competitors, who performed on accordions and guitars, threw stones at Rakoto when he stepped forward to perform on the sodina. Despite being struck in the face he completed his performance and was awarded first prize. In 1935 he was nominated by the local governor to represent his district in a national musical competition organized by the French colonial authority at <a href="Mahamasina%20Municipal%20Stadium">Mahamasina stadium</a> in Antananarivo. That same year Rakoto was orphaned at the age of 12, preventing him from further pursuing an education in the interest of earning a livelihood. A Frenchman hired the boy to work as an assistant baker until he came of age. Upon reaching adulthood, Rakoto left the bakery to become a metalworker while continuing to perform on the sodina in musical ensembles.

Rakoto's opportunity for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> to Madagascar. The visit was in conjunction with the dissolution of colonial status and naming of <a href="Philibert%20Tsiranana">Philibert Tsiranana</a> as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Madagascar">Prime Minister</a>, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18 musicians to accompany de Gaulle and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's walking tour through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Madagascar">president of Madagascar</a> two years later, was the first to refer to the artist as Rakoto "Frah", the name that the musician would use for the rest of his career.

International recognition of Rakoto Frah and his performance of traditional sodina music began with his first overseas voyage to Algeria in 1967. The artist led a troupe of 18 Malagasy musicians selected to represent the island's various ethnic groups at the <a href="International%20Festival%20of%20Algiers">International Festival of Algiers</a>. Among the 80 competitors hailing from a variety of countries, Rakoto Frah's troupe won the gold medal. This success was followed by performances in Japan, England, the United States, India, Germany, China, Norway, Finland, Australia and France, making him one of the first musicians to perform traditional Malagasy music at music festivals and concerts outside of Madagascar. At these performances, he was often accompanied by supporting musicians under the group name Orchestre Nationale. By exposing international audiences to sodina performances, Rakoto Frah promoted the instrument and the traditional musical heritage of Madagascar across the globe. The government of President Tsirananana fell into disfavor and was overturned in 1972, and Rakoto Frah's close association with the unpopular former head of state led the artist to be marginalized for the first half of the administration of his successor, <a href="Didier%20Ratsiraka">Didier Ratsiraka</a> (1975–1993).

In 1985, producers <a href="Ben%20Mandelson">Ben Mandelson</a> and Roger Armstrong visited Madagascar in search of artists to record for a planned album of Malagasy music. Rakoto Frah soon came to their attention, and they offered him a full-length album of his own. Two of Rakoto Frah's granddaughters provided vocals for this album, which was entitled "Rakoto Frah: Flute Master of Madagascar." From the mid-1980s onward, Rakoto Frah enjoyed a revival in popularity, particularly among the youth, many of whom were seeking to reconnect with the traditions of their elders. In addition to recording numerous tracks and albums of his own, the flutist often appeared as a guest artist on the albums of others. Rakoto Frah again became one of the most famous and respected musicians within Madagascar and among the most recognized Malagasy performers in the world music circuit.

Rakoto Frah released a series of albums and performed internationally throughout the 1990s. The "World Out of Time" compilation, recorded and produced by David Lindley and Henry Kaiser in 1991, featured him alongside a variety of other performers of the island's diverse musical genres and instruments; two further compilations with Lindley and Kaiser followed in 1993 and 1994. In 1994 Rakoto Frah performed with the Malagasy All Stars on their tour of Germany. The following year he experienced a further increase in national and international prominence as a founding member of the group <a href="Feo-Gasy">Feo Gasy</a>, which also featured the internationally acclaimed Malagasy guitarist and singer-songwriter <a href="Erick%20Manana">Erick Manana</a>. Together the band recorded two albums: "Ramano" in 1996 and "Tsofy Rano" in 1999. Malagasy guitarist Solo Razafindrakoto produced Rakoto Frah's "Souffles de Vie" in 1998, and Rakoto Frah's final album, "Chants et danses en Imerina", was released in October 2000.

Despite his popularity, the artist earned very little from his musical career. This was in part due to weak enforcement of copyright laws in Madagascar, which enabled the profits from illegally copied albums to go directly to pirates. Throughout his career as a professional musician he lived in the poor neighborhood of Anatihazo-Isotry in Antananarivo with 30 members of his family. There he produced instruments and provided lessons in sodina performance. In the later years of his life, Rakoto Frah had over 80 students at any given time. He was also a respected source of counsel in the neighborhood and was frequently visited by community members seeking his wisdom and advice. When based in Madagascar, the artist regularly accepted paid offers to perform on the sodina at traditional events such as "<a href="famadihana">famadihana</a>" (the Malagasy highland "turning of the bones" funerary tradition), <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> ceremonies, weddings, engagement ceremonies, and traditional festivals held to celebrate the first rice harvest of the year. These events could last up to seven days, including performances throughout the night, and often required several days of travel to arrive at the site. Rakoto Frah was an avid fan of rugby, and he and his ensemble would regularly perform flute and drum music at <a href="Madagascar%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">national team</a> matches. His final international festival performance was the Festival de Langon held in France in August 2001.

Rakoto Frah died on 29 September 2001 in the Ravoahangy Andrianavalona hospital of Antananarivo following heart problems and a lung infection. In the days following his death, the Malagasy government organized a public celebration in his honor at Mahamasina stadium. His body was laid in the family tomb in his home village of Ankadinandriana on 3 October.

Rakoto Frah performed traditional "vakindrazana" and "vazikoava" pieces for sodina, commonly heard at a variety of holidays and rites observed in the central highlands of Madagascar. The music accompanying the famadihana reburial ceremonies of the central highlands, for instance, is typically performed by an ensemble of sodina players accompanied by the "amponga" drum. These sodina performances, which express the joy of reuniting with the ancestors, are often competitive. More than one troupe may be present at the famadihana and will take turns showing off their musical skills, with the rapid flight of notes intended to inspire dancing over the course of the entire day or week of the celebration. The rural artistic tradition of the "<a href="hiragasy">hira gasy</a>" is equally joyful but more elaborate, showcasing the music, dance and oratory skills of a large troupe that includes male and female vocalists, drums, sodina, and a variety of orchestral instruments such as clarinets, trumpets and violins.

Although he learned his repertoire by listening to elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music the most important element of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800 pieces of instrumental and vocal music.

Several collaborations between Rakoto Frah and other international artists have been recorded. Rakoto Frah is featured on tracks recorded with <a href="Manu%20Dibango">Manu Dibango</a>, jazz artists <a href="David%20Lindley%20%28musician%29">David Lindley</a> and <a href="Henry%20Kaiser%20%28musician%29">Henry Keiser</a>, <a href="Kassav%27">Kassav'</a>, and <a href="Ladysmith%20Black%20Mambazo">Ladysmith Black Mambazo</a>, whom he met while performing in India. As a musician who played by ear, he would join an ongoing performance by listening carefully to determine the key of the song. The American composer and jazz saxophonist <a href="Ornette%20Coleman">Ornette Coleman</a> described Rakoto Frah as having "some of the best phrasing of any musician in the world". He was also cited as a key influence by <a href="Ian%20Anderson">Ian Anderson</a>, the flutist and leader of 1970s British rock group <a href="Jethro%20Tull%20%28band%29">Jethro Tull</a>. In the liner notes for the 1991 compilation "A World Out of Time", producers David Lindley and Henry Kaiser expressed their admiration for the artist, stating: "He is one of the most amazing master musicians and individuals that we have ever met. His mastery of the sodina is on a level that you could only compare to great, western instrumental masters like <a href="John%20Coltrane">John Coltrane</a>, Ornette Coleman, <a href="Billy%20Pigg">Billy Pigg</a> or <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>. Rakoto Frah certainly seems to know mysterious things about the phrasing of melodies that nobody else knows." Contemporary Malagasy artists performing in diverse genres ranging from heavy metal and hip hop to jazz and the traditional "mangaliba" have cited the sodina master as an inspiration and legend in the pantheon of Malagasy cultural figures.

Over the course of his life, Rakoto Frah was commemorated by fellow artists and by the government of Madagascar, which issued him numerous awards and commendations throughout his career. The design for the 1,000 <a href="Malagasy%20franc">Malagasy franc</a> (200 <a href="ariary">ariary</a>) banknote first printed by the Central Bank in 1983 depicted Rakoto Frah dressed in a traditional straw hat and "<a href="lamba%20%28garment%29">lamba</a>" and playing the sodina. He is the only artist to have been featured on a Malagasy banknote. According to a representative of the Central Bank, the artist was selected because he was the most representative of the Malagasy identity. After the Rakoto Frah banknote design was discontinued in the 1990s it became a rare collector's item valued in 2011 at over 100,000 ariary, more than 500 times its face value. The artist was also invited by international filmmakers to feature in two French films: the Madagascar documentary "L'Ile Rouge" released in 1992 by French director Jean-Michel Carré, and an eponymous documentary about the artist himself, produced by director Camille Marchand in 1997.

The legacy of Rakoto Frah remains strong over a decade after his death. In 2011, ten years after his death, a series of commemorative events were organized in Madagascar to celebrate his life and music. In May 2011 a discussion panel and debate were organized around the themes of traditional culture and heritage. In June, a Catholic mass and a half-day "<a href="Hiragasy">hira gasy</a>" performance were held in his honor and a three-day gallery exposition was organized to commemorate his life and work. Regional cabarets were organized in <a href="Mahajanga">Mahajanga</a> and <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a> by his former group Feo Gasy, his sons' group Rakoto Frah Junior and traditional musical group Telofangady. September was marked by the unveiling of an opus specially composed in his honor, and a tribute concert at Mahamasina stadium featuring artists such as Dama of <a href="Mahaleo">Mahaleo</a>, Ricky, Samoëla and Faly Ralanto, as well as Telofangady, Rakoto Frah Junior, and Feo Gasy. On 28 October 2011 the Ministry of Culture renamed a street in the capital city after him. These events culminated in a famadihana that the artist's friends and family organized for Rakoto Frah at Ambohijatobe in Ankadinandriana. The event, which was attended by a state minister and numerous artists like Rakoto Frah Junior and Haja Telofangady, included performances by Fafah of Mahaleo, Faly, Ralanto, Ra-Jean Knack, Randrianasolo Raymond Zanany, Raozy Milalao of Toamasina and Solo Ra-Jean of <a href="Moramanga">Moramanga</a>. According to custom, the remains of Rakoto Frah (affectionately called "Dadakoto" among his inner circle) were removed from the tomb to be wrapped in fresh silk shrouds. A new sodina was tucked into the cloth to replace the deteriorated one originally buried with him. The <a href="Cuisine%20of%20Madagascar">customary dish</a> of "vary be menaka" (rice cooked with oil and pork) was served and musicians performed pieces of the traditional genre which the artist had so often played at the famadihana ceremonies of others.

In November 2012, several of Rakoto Frah's adult children launched the "École Rakoto Frah Junior" ("Rakoto Frah Junior School") initiative in November 2012 to continue the artist's work as an educator of sodina performance. The informal cultural school organized lessons in sodina performance for 50 students at the community center in the artist's former neighborhood of Isotry and awarded certificates of completion to 31 graduates on 16 December with plans to continue training further cohorts of sodina players.

Australian contribution to the Battle of Normandy

The Australian contribution to the Battle of Normandy involved more than 3,000 military personnel serving under British command. The majority of these personnel were members of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), though smaller numbers of Australians serving with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> also participated in the fighting prior to and after the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Allied landings</a> on 6 June 1944. While all the RAAF units based in the United Kingdom (UK) took part in the battle, Australians made up only a small portion of the Allied force.

The Australians who supported the D-Day invasion included between 2,000 and 2,500 RAAF airmen in Australian squadrons and British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> units, and approximately 500 members of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> serving on Royal Navy vessels, as well as a small number of <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> officers and merchant seamen. The army personnel and thousands of Australian airmen also took part in the subsequent <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a> between June and August 1944, and an RAAF fighter squadron operated from airfields in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>. Throughout the campaign, Australian airmen provided direct support to the Allied ground forces by attacking German military units and their supply lines, as well as forming part of the force that defended the beachhead from air attack and manning transport aircraft. Australians also indirectly supported the campaign by attacking German <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and ships that threatened the invasion force. The 13 Australian Army officers who took part in the campaign filled a variety of roles in British units in order to gain experience that they could take back to Australia.

Australian personnel also took part in the <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">invasion of Southern France</a> in August 1944, and RAAF airmen continued to operate against German forces until the end of the war in May 1945. However, the relatively low casualties suffered by the Allied air forces during the fighting in Normandy and subsequent campaigns resulted in an over-supply of trained Australian aircrew in the UK, hundreds of whom were never assigned to a combat role. Australia's contribution to the fighting in Normandy is commemorated in memorials and cemeteries in London and Normandy.

In 1944 Australia's war effort was focused on the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, and most elements of the country's military were in Australia and the islands to its north. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of RAAF personnel, most of whom had been trained through the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS), were stationed in the United Kingdom (UK) and took part in operations against Germany. The Australian Government had very little influence over where Australian graduates of EATS were posted, and many were assigned directly to British units. As of 6 June 1944, 1,816 Australian airmen (including 584 pilots) were posted to RAF squadrons. Many of the thousands of Australian ground crew in the UK at this time were also serving with RAF units. In addition, ten RAAF flying <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a> were stationed in the UK. These included one regular RAAF unit, <a href="No.%2010%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 10 Squadron</a>, and nine temporary "<a href="Article%20XV%20squadrons">Article XV squadrons</a>," which had been formed under the agreement that underpinned EATS. While the Article XV squadrons were nominally Australian, most included a substantial proportion of personnel from Britain and other Commonwealth countries; as of 1 June 1944 they were manned by 796 Australian aircrew and 572 airmen from other countries. Owing to an over-supply of aircrew trained through the Empire Air Training Scheme, there were also hundreds of RAAF airmen in the UK who were assigned to personnel depots while they waited to be posted to a combat unit; prior to the invasion these unattached airmen were considered an asset by the Allied air forces as they could rapidly replace casualties.
The Australian air units were under the command of the RAF, which had 306 squadrons located in the UK at the time of the landings in Normandy. Two RAAF squadrons were assigned to the <a href="RAF%20Second%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Second Tactical Air Force</a> (2TAF), which was to provide direct support to the Allied armies during the campaign; <a href="No.%20453%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 453 Squadron</a> operated <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> fighters as part of <a href="No.%20125%20Wing%20RAF">No. 125 Wing</a> and <a href="No.%20464%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 464 Squadron</a> flew <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a> light bombers as part of <a href="No.%20140%20Wing%20RAF">No. 140 Wing</a>. Four Australian <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> squadrons formed part of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>; <a href="No.%20460%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 460</a>, <a href="No.%20463%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 463</a> and <a href="No.%20467%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 467 Squadrons</a> were equipped with <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Lancaster</a>s and <a href="No.%20466%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 466 Squadron</a> flew <a href="Handley%20Page%20Halifax">Halifaxes</a>. <a href="No.%20456%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 456 Squadron</a>, which was a specialist <a href="night%20fighter">night fighter</a> unit equipped with Mosquitos, formed part of <a href="RAF%20Fighter%20Command">Air Defence of Great Britain</a> and was assigned to protect the invasion force. Three other RAAF squadrons in the UK would also support operations in Normandy as part of <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">Coastal Command</a>; No. 10 and <a href="No.%20461%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 461 Squadrons</a> were equipped with <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Sunderland</a> flying boats and flew patrols of the waters around the UK and France, while <a href="No.%20455%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 455 Squadron</a> operated against German surface shipping using <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Beaufighter</a> strike aircraft.

In addition to the RAAF airmen operating as part of the RAF in the UK, hundreds of <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN) personnel were serving with the Royal Navy (RN) at the time of the Battle of Normandy. No Australian warships took part in the operation, however. Most of the Australian officers serving with the RN were members of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20Volunteer%20Reserve">Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve</a> (RANVR). Four RAN sub-lieutenants who had been sent to the UK to undergo training were also assigned to RN <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a> units to help address a shortage of officers capable of coordinating operations by these vessels.

Thirteen Australian Army officers were attached to the British Army units that fought in Normandy. These officers had been posted to the UK to gain experience in planning and conducting large-scale <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious operations</a>, which would improve the army's procedures ahead of Australian landings in the Pacific. A single officer represented each of the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Army%20Corps">Army's corps</a>, and the personnel sent to the UK included some of the most talented and experienced members of the service.

Few Australians were involved in planning the invasion. Some of those who had planning responsibilities included Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Ronald%20Ramsay%20McNicoll">Ronald McNicoll</a>, who served on the Operations Staff of the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force</a>; Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>, Senior Air Staff Officer for <a href="No.%2038%20Group%20RAF">No. 38 Group RAF</a>; Lieutenant Commander <a href="Victor%20Smith">Victor Smith</a>, Flag Officer for British Assault Area's air planning officer; and Major <a href="Douglas%20Vincent%20%28general%29">Douglas Vincent</a>, a signals officer attached to the headquarters of the British <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a>. Australian-born Air Commodore <a href="Edgar%20McCloughry">Edgar McCloughry</a>, who had served with the RAF since 1919, headed the <a href="Allied%20Expeditionary%20Air%20Force">Allied Expeditionary Air Force</a> Bombing Committee, which prepared air plans for the invasion.

During April and May the Allied air forces struck at German airfields as well as aircraft factories and repair facilities in France. No. 463 and No. 467 Squadrons participated in raids on airfields and factories near <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> on the nights of 5/6 April and 1/2 May, and bombed an airfield near <a href="Lanv%C3%A9oc">Lanvéoc</a> on the night of 8/9 May. The first of these raids involved 148 aircraft and was led by No. 467 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander <a href="John%20Balmer">John Balmer</a>. 2TAF also conducted 12 raids on German airfields during this period, of which eight involved individual Australians posted to RAF light bomber squadrons. Australians serving in the fighter squadrons of <a href="No.%2010%20Group%20RAF">No. 10 Group RAF</a> also occasionally took part in "ranger" operations over northern France in search of German aircraft. In addition, the 31 Australian pilots posted to RAF photo reconnaissance units frequently conducted <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s to monitor German dispositions along the coast of the English Channel.

The Allies also conducted a major air offensive against the <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20France">French railway network</a> and bridges over the river <a href="Seine">Seine</a> from April to June. Bomber Command made 53 raids against these targets, of which 25 involved the four Australian heavy bomber squadrons. A total of 17 Australian bombers were lost during these operations, including six that German fighters shot down during an attack on the marshalling yards at <a href="Lille">Lille</a> on the night of 10/11 May. In addition, Australians took part in 29 of the 46 raids conducted by 2TAF's light bombers against French railway infrastructure. Australian fighter pilots, including all of No. 453 Squadron on occasion, escorted some of these raids and conducted ground attack sorties targeting railway rolling stock. 2TAF's <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>s also attacked bridges over the river Seine from April as part of an effort to seal off the Normandy region, and Australian pilots posted to British squadrons were involved in a small number of these operations. No. 453 Squadron attacked bridges and viaducts near Normandy on 27 April and 2 May.

Australians participated in attacks on German defences in France in the weeks before D-Day. No. 453 Squadron made four raids on radar stations in late May and early June, and RAAF pilots serving with British fighter and fighter-bomber squadrons took part in other such attacks. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons contributed aircraft to raids on radar stations and communications facilities in the week before the landing. These units also struck German coastal batteries along the channel coast on nine occasions between 8 and 29 May; Australians serving with British light bomber units took part in a further 14 raids on German batteries. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF light and heavy bomber units also participated in raids against <a href="Wehrmacht">German Army</a> camps in France and Belgium during May. The Australian squadrons suffered heavy losses in several of these attacks, including seven aircraft lost during a raid on the <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st Panzer Division's</a> facilities at <a href="Mailly-le-Camp">Mailly-le-Camp</a> on the night of 3/4 May. In addition to these attacks on German positions, Bomber Command struck the seven largest German munitions factories and <a href="ammunition%20dump">ammunition dump</a>s in France during late April and early May; the four Australian squadrons participated in five of these operations, and no Australian aircraft were lost.

Leading up to the invasion, the RAF intensified its operations against German submarines and ships operating near France. Coastal Command aircraft destroyed six submarines within eleven days during May; Australian aircrew contributed to three of these sinkings. Bomber Command also expanded its program of laying <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s from April, and No. 460 Squadron as well as Australians posted to RAF light and heavy bomber units took part in several minelaying operations in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a>. Coastal Command's anti-shipping force, which included the RAAF's No. 455 Squadron, mainly undertook training exercises from April, but occasionally attacked German convoys in the English Channel.

Australian airmen were also involved in protecting southern England from German air attack in the lead-up to the invasion. From late April to early June No. 456 Squadron was part of a force that defended port cities in southern England from a <a href="Operation%20Steinbock">series of air raids</a>. The Australian squadron accounted for eight of the 22 bombers shot down by Air Defence of Great Britain night fighters during this period. No. 464 Squadron also conducted <a href="Intruder%20%28air%20combat%29">"intruder"</a> raids that tried to destroy German bombers as they returned to their bases in France. During this period, No. 453 Squadron and 36 Australians posted to eight RAF units took part in defensive patrols which sought to prevent German reconnaissance aircraft flying over southern England during daylight hours, but no German aircraft attempted this.

In addition to the air campaign, a small number of Australians took part in special operations ahead of the invasion. In January 1944, RANVR officer Lieutenant Ken Hudspeth, who commanded the <a href="midget%20submarine">midget submarine</a> , transported a party of specialist personnel to inspect and collect soil samples from French beaches being considered for the invasion. This operation was successful, and earned Hudspeth his second <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> (DSC). <a href="Nancy%20Wake">Nancy Wake</a>, an Australian serving with the British <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a>, was parachuted into France in April 1944 and subsequently helped to organise the <a href="French%20Resistance">French Resistance</a> in the <a href="Auvergne%20%28province%29">Auvergne</a> region.

On the night of 5/6 June Bomber Command conducted precision attacks on ten German <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> batteries near the beaches where Allied troops were to land. Each battery was targeted by approximately 100 heavy bombers, and all four Australian heavy bomber squadrons took part in the operation. No. 460 Squadron dispatched 26 aircraft, which were evenly split between attacking the batteries at Fontenay-Crisbecq and St Martin de Varreville. No. 466 Squadron provided 13 aircraft to the raid on batteries at Merville-Franceville Maisy, 14 aircraft from No. 463 Squadron struck Pointe du Hoe and No. 467 Squadron dispatched 14 against batteries at <a href="Ouistreham">Ouistreham</a>. The RAAF squadrons did not suffer any losses. Many Australian aircrew posted to British units also participated in this attack, and 14.8 percent of the 1,136 Bomber Command aircraft despatched were either part of RAAF squadrons or were flown by Australians.
Australians posted to RAF units also landed <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>s in Normandy and took part in diversionary operations. On the night of 5/6 June several Australian airmen served in heavy bombers that dropped "window" <a href="Chaff%20%28countermeasure%29">chaff</a> in patterns that, on German <a href="radar">radar</a>, <a href="D-Day%20naval%20deceptions">simulated the appearance of convoys</a> headed for the <a href="Pas%20de%20Calais">Pas de Calais</a> region of France. Other Australians served in aircraft that <a href="Operation%20Titanic">dropped dummy paratroopers</a> and jammed German radar. One Australian pilot posted to <a href="No.%20139%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 139 Squadron RAF</a> took part in "intruder" bombing raids against targets in western Germany and the Low Countries that sought to divert German aircraft away from Normandy. Australian aircrew also served aboard the transport aircraft of No. 38 Group RAF and <a href="No.%2046%20Group%20RAF">No. 46 Group RAF</a>, which flew the British <a href="6th%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">6th Airborne Division</a> from the UK to Normandy on the night of 5/6 June. About 14 percent of the transport aircraft in No. 38 Group were piloted by Australians, though the proportion of Australians in No. 46 Group was much lower. There were no completely Australian aircrews in either group.

Australian aircrew supported the fighting on 6 June. No. 453 Squadron was one of 36 Allied squadrons that provided low-altitude air defence for the invasion fleet and landing force. Many of the squadron's pilots flew several sorties during the day, though they did not encounter any German aircraft. No. 456 Squadron also formed part of the force that provided air defence for the invasion area at night. In addition, about 200 Australian pilots were spread across the dozens of RAF fighter and fighter-bomber units that supported the landings. A small number of Australian aircrew also served in RAF reconnaissance units and 2TAF's light bomber squadrons, which also saw combat over France on D-Day. The three Australian squadrons assigned to Coastal Command flew only a small number of sorties on 6 June as few German submarines or <a href="E-boat">E-boat</a>s put to sea.

About 500 RAN personnel served on board RN ships involved in the operation. While most formed part of the crew of RN warships, several Australian officers led flotillas of landing craft and others commanded individual craft. For instance, Sub-Lieutenant Dean Murray commanded a force of six RN <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Assault">Landing Craft Assault</a> that landed soldiers of the British <a href="3rd%20Mechanised%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Infantry Division</a> at <a href="Sword%20Beach">Sword Beach</a>. Hudspeth also took "X20" across the channel to mark the edge of <a href="Juno%20Beach">Juno Beach</a> during the landings there; he received his third DSC for completing this mission. Some of the warships with Australian crew members that supported the landings were (which had three RANVR officers on board), , , , , and . Australian members of the <a href="Merchant%20Navy">Merchant Navy</a> also participated in the D-Day landings, though the number of sailors involved is not known.

Few of the Australian Army officers attached to British units landed on D-Day. Major <a href="Jo%20Gullett">Jo Gullett</a>, who was the second in command of an infantry <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> in the 7th Battalion, <a href="Green%20Howards">Green Howards</a>, came ashore on <a href="Gold%20Beach">Gold Beach</a> as part of the invasion force. In his memoirs, Gullett described the landing as "easily the most impressive occasion of my life". He subsequently led a company of the <a href="Royal%20Scots">Royal Scots</a> until he was wounded by German machine gun fire on 17 July. Most of the other Australian officers served in <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">staff</a> positions; for instance Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Bill%20Robertson%20%28Australian%20intelligence%20officer%29">Bill Robertson</a> was the chief of staff of the <a href="51st%20%28Highland%29%20Infantry%20Division">51st (Highland) Infantry Division</a> when that unit arrived in Normandy and was later posted to the <a href="50th%20%28Northumbrian%29%20Infantry%20Division">50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division</a> where he served in the same role. Vincent came ashore on 7 June and served with XXX Corps, <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Armoured</a> and <a href="43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Infantry%20Division">43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division</a>s during the campaign.

Due to the lack of a nominal roll or other records listing the Australians who took part in the D-Day landings, it is not possible to determine the exact number involved. However, it has been estimated that about 3,000 Australian military personnel and merchant seamen participated in the operation. The total number of Australians killed on 6 June was 14, of whom 12 were RAAF airmen and two were members of the RAN.

The fighting in Normandy continued until August 1944, when the Allies broke out of the region and <a href="Allied%20advance%20from%20Paris%20to%20the%20Rhine">rapidly advanced to the German border</a>. This campaign dominated the activities of eight of the ten Australian squadrons in the UK, as well as most of the airmen posted to RAF units. During July and August the RAAF units operated at or near their highest level of activity in the war to that point, but morale remained high as the airmen perceived that the contribution of air power to the campaign would be decisive. Large numbers of Australian airmen who were undergoing training or awaiting a posting on D-Day were assigned to combat units during the fighting to replace casualties of the Normandy campaign.

In addition to the military personnel involved in the fighting, several Australian <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a>s reported on the Battle of Normandy. <a href="Chester%20Wilmot">Chester Wilmot</a> landed with the 6th Airborne Division on D-Day, and his coverage of the fighting for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> soon made him one of the best-known Allied war correspondents. Other Australian journalists in Normandy included <a href="John%20Hetherington%20%28journalist%29">John Hetherington</a>, <a href="Geoff%20Hutton">Geoff Hutton</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Monson">Ronald Monson</a>.

Australian airmen were involved in Allied efforts to delay German reinforcements from reaching Normandy throughout June. On the night of 6/7 June, 20 Mosquitos from No. 464 Squadron were dispatched to attack German road convoys and trains in northern France. The four Australian heavy bomber squadrons also participated in raids on French towns on this night. While No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons mainly targeted railway facilities, No. 460 Squadron formed part of an attack on <a href="Vire">Vire</a>, which sought to <a href="Bombing%20of%20Normandy">destroy the town</a> to prevent the Germans from using the roads through it. Following these initial raids, Bomber Command continued to target railway infrastructure in France in an attempt to disrupt the movement of German reinforcements to Normandy. The command operated intensively during the week after the invasion, and some Australian aircrew flew raids on consecutive nights during this period. Overall, Bomber Command made 16 raids against railway facilities in France between 13 and 30 June, of which six included at least one of the RAAF squadrons. The RAAF heavy bomber squadrons and Australians in RAF units also took part in several attacks on German supply dumps and airfields during this period. Bomber Command made fewer raids on these targets than had been planned prior to the invasion, however, as its units were frequently assigned to strike facilities associated with the <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a>s the Germans were launching against the UK. No. 464 Squadron also operated against German vehicles travelling at night and bombed railway yards, and flew 75 sorties between the nights of 7/8 and 12/13 June. Overall, the squadron conducted attacks on 19 nights during June, during which five of its aircraft were destroyed. The Australians in 2TAF's other light and medium bomber units also attacked the German lines of communication in France and occasionally provided direct support for the Allied ground forces throughout this period.

During June, Australians also contributed to the defence of the Allied beachhead against German air and naval attacks. No. 453 Squadron and the RAAF fighter pilots in RAF units continued to fly patrols over the beachhead in the week after D-Day, but only rarely encountered German aircraft. From 11 June the Australian squadron's aircraft frequently operated from airfields built at Normandy, and on the 25th of the month it and the other units of No. 125 Wing moved from the UK to Advanced Landing Ground B11 within the beachhead near <a href="Longues-sur-Mer">Longues-sur-Mer</a>. By late June, No. 453 Squadron and the other RAF Spitfire units were regularly attacking German positions in Normandy as well as providing air defence for the Allied forces in the area; during the month the squadron flew more than 700 sorties. A small number of Australians posted to RAF squadrons equipped with <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Hawker Typhoon</a> fighter-bombers also attacked German vehicles and positions in direct support of the Allied ground troops throughout the month. No. 456 Squadron, which was one of four night fighter squadrons assigned to protect the beachhead, frequently met German aircraft and shot down twelve of them in the week after the landing. Australian fighter ace Flight Lieutenant <a href="Nicky%20Barr">Nicky Barr</a>, who had escaped from German custody in Italy during 1943, also briefly served in an air support control unit in Normandy. Barr landed at <a href="Omaha%20Beach">Omaha Beach</a> on 9 June, but returned to the UK three days later as his commanding officer believed that German forces would execute Barr if they recaptured him.

German submarines and surface warships sortied to attack the Allied invasion fleet, and the Australian members of Coastal Command participated in attacks on these vessels. The two RAAF flying boat squadrons operated intensively throughout June, but did not sink any German ships or submarines. The aircrew of two of the British <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberators</a> that sank German submarines during this period included Australian personnel, however, and Australians were on board several of the other RAF aircraft flying anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols. In addition, No. 455 Squadron took part in several attacks on E-boats operating near Normandy as well as German shipping travelling through the English Channel. No. 460 Squadron and Australians in other Bomber Command units also participated in raids on E-Boat bases at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> and <a href="Boulogne">Boulogne</a> on the nights of 14/15 June and 15/16 June respectively.

By July the Allied armies were having difficulty advancing against the German forces in Normandy. In an attempt to create a breakthrough, the Allied air commanders decided to use heavy bombers to attack German positions. The first of these attacks was made on 7 July by 467 Bomber Command aircraft and targeted German forces near <a href="Caen">Caen</a>, as well as the city itself. The Australian contribution to this raid included 20 Lancasters from No. 460 Squadron and 14 Halifaxes from No. 466 Squadron as well as aircrew in RAF units. One of No. 460 Squadron's aircraft made a crash landing within the Allied beachhead after being damaged by German anti-aircraft guns, but its crew survived and were evacuated to the UK. While the attack devastated Caen, the ground troops were only able to capture the northern half of the city when they advanced on 8 July. All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in a series of attacks on German positions on 18 July as part of <a href="Operation%20Goodwood">Operation Goodwood</a>, but this offensive also failed to result in a breakthrough. On 30 July, No. 463, No. 466 and No. 467 Squadrons contributed aircraft to another major bombardment of German positions near <a href="Caumont-sur-Orne">Caumont</a> ahead of <a href="Operation%20Bluecoat">Operation Bluecoat</a>; 693 heavy bombers took part in this attack, of which 39 were from the Australian squadrons, but many did not drop their bombs as cloud obscured the aiming markers in the target area. All four Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in the next major attack, which took place on the night of 7/8 August to support <a href="Operation%20Totalize">Operation Totalize</a>, but cloud and smoke again prevented many of the bombers from attacking the target area. The four squadrons also attacked German Army positions on 14 August in support of <a href="Operation%20Tractable">Operation Tractable</a>; visibility was clear over most of the target area, and the raids were considered successful. By this time the Allied armies had successfully broken out of Normandy, and no further heavy bomber attacks were required.
Australians also continued to be involved in Allied air attacks aimed at disrupting movement of German troops and supplies to Normandy during July and August. As well as supporting the ground forces in Normandy and continuing to bomb V-1 flying bomb launch facilities in northern France, Bomber Command attacked railway facilities in France during July and August, and at least one of the Australian heavy bomber squadrons participated in 15 of the 25 raids conducted against these targets. No. 464 Squadron also flew more than 350 sorties during July and 400 in August against transport infrastructure in France and convoys of German vehicles. These operations, which were generally conducted at night, cost the unit three aircraft. The only interruption to No. 464 Squadron's attacks on transportation came on the night of 14/15 July, when four aircraft piloted by highly experienced airmen conducted a successful precision strike on the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> barracks at <a href="Bonneuil-Matours">Bonneuil-Matours</a>. Australian aircrew assigned to other 2TAF medium bomber and fighter-bomber units also participated in attacks on bridges and railways throughout July.

No. 453 Squadron operated from Normandy during July and August, and mainly patrolled behind the German front line in search of motor transport to attack. It occasionally encountered German aircraft during this period and shot down several <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Me 109</a> and <a href="Focke-Wulf%20Fw%20190">Fw 190</a> fighters. The squadron flew 727 sorties during July, but lost several of its Spitfires to German anti-aircraft guns. No. 453 Squadron continued to operate against German transport during August, and moved to an airfield near <a href="Ling%C3%A8vres">Lingèvres</a> on the 13th of the month. This airfield was attacked by a German aircraft the next day, resulting in the death of one Australian pilot and another three wounded. The squadron experienced considerable success during the Allied break-out, and claimed to have destroyed a large number of German vehicles during August. Overall, No. 453 Squadron flew more than 1,300 combat sorties during July and August. While No. 456 Squadron's night fighters conducted patrols over Normandy in early July and shot down four German bombers on the 5th of the month, the unit—in common with almost all the Mosquito-equipped night fighter squadrons stationed in the UK—was tasked with intercepting V-1 flying bombs from 6 July onwards.

The Australian flying boat squadrons assigned to Coastal Command also continued to support the invasion during July and August. On 8 July a No. 10 Squadron Sunderland sank the German submarine <a href="German%20submarine%20U-243">"U-243"</a> south-west of <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>. Overall, No. 10 Squadron flew 56 patrols during July and No. 461 Squadron conducted 67, most of which were made at night. One of No. 461 Squadron's Sunderlands damaged the submarine <a href="German%20submarine%20U-385">"U-385"</a> south of Brest on 10 August, and it was sunk the next day by . On 13 August another No. 461 Squadron Sunderland attacked and sank <a href="German%20submarine%20U-270">"U-270"</a>. No. 10 Squadron flew almost as many patrols throughout August as it had during July, but did not encounter any submarines. No. 455 Squadron took part in attacks on German shipping travelling off the Netherlands and in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> during July and August, but these operations were not directly related to supporting the invasion.

RAAF personnel also participated in the Allied invasion of southern France (<a href="Operation%20Dragoon">Operation Dragoon</a>) during August 1944. <a href="No.%20458%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 458 Squadron</a>, which was equipped with <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Wellington</a> bombers, flew anti-submarine patrols and attacked targets in northern Italy and southern France ahead of the landings, which took place on the 15th of the month. The squadron continued these duties until the end of August. The Spitfire-equipped <a href="No.%20451%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 451 Squadron</a> escorted Allied invasion convoys on 14 August and patrolled over the Allied beachhead as troops came ashore the next day. From 25 August the squadron was based at an airfield near <a href="Cuers">Cuers</a> in France and provided air defence for the region until October. Few German aircraft were encountered throughout this period, however.

The low casualties the Commonwealth air forces incurred during the Battle of Normandy led to an over-supply of trained aircrew. While the number of pilots and other airmen undergoing training through the EATS had begun to be reduced in early 1944, by 30 June there were thousands of qualified airmen—including 3,000 Australians—in the UK waiting for posts in operational units. This number greatly exceeded the requirements of the Allied air forces. Accordingly, the flow of airmen from EATS training facilities in Canada to the UK was greatly cut back, and Australia ceased sending airmen overseas for training under the scheme in August. While 1,245 Australian airmen arrived in the UK during the last six months of 1944 (a reduction from the 5,181 who had arrived in the first six months of the year), only those who were qualified as air gunners were typically ever assigned to combat units. It was not possible to find flying positions for most of the remaining unattached airmen who arrived after June 1944, and some were posted back to Australia; the remainder spent the rest of the war in training courses and various non-flying roles.

Australian military personnel in Europe remained in action until the end of the war. At the time of the German surrender in May 1945, there were 15,500 members of the RAAF in the UK and western Europe, of whom 12,300 were qualified aircrew. Most members of the small party of Australian Army officers who had been posted to the UK ahead of D-Day also remained in Europe until the end of the war.

Overall, 1,177 Australian military personnel were killed in western Europe and Britain during the lead-up to the invasion of France and the subsequent Normandy Campaign. These losses were higher than those suffered by Australian forces in the Pacific during this period. A total of 44 Australians are buried in <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries in the Normandy region. These include men killed in the region prior to the invasion and those who died during the fighting in 1944. Of the Australian graves, 17 are located at the <a href="Bayeux%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Bayeux War Cemetery</a>, six at <a href="Saint-D%C3%A9sir%20de%20Lisieux%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Saint-Désir de Lisieux</a>, five at <a href="Banneville-la-Campagne%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Banneville-la-Campagne</a>, four at the <a href="Bretteville-sur-Laize%20Canadian%20War%20Cemetery">Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery</a>, three at both <a href="Douvres%20la%20D%C3%A9livrande%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Douvres la Délivrande</a> and <a href="Hermanville-sur-Mer%20War%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Hermanville-sur-Mer</a>, two in <a href="Ranville%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Ranville</a> and one each at <a href="Ryes-Nazenville%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Ryes-Nazenville</a>, <a href="Saint-Manvieu-Norrey%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Saint-Manvieu-Norrey</a>, <a href="Bolbec%20Town%20Cemetery">Bolbec</a> and <a href="Tilly-sur-Seulles%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Tilly-sur-Seulles</a>. The Bayeux Memorial, which lists the names of Commonwealth personnel killed in Normandy with no known grave, does not include any Australians. The most recent burial of an Australian serviceman in Normandy took place in April 2011 when No. 453 Squadron pilot Flight Lieutenant Henry Lacy Smith was interred at Ranville War Cemetery. Smith drowned when his Spitfire crash-landed in the <a href="River%20Orne">River Orne</a> on 11 June 1944, but his body was not recovered until November 2010.

Australia's involvement in the Battle of Normandy has also been commemorated through memorials and official state visits. Many of the RAAF squadrons that fought in the campaign were awarded <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s after the war in recognition of their contribution. "Normandy" is also one of the 47 battle sites recorded on the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial%2C%20London">Australian War Memorial, London</a>, which was dedicated in 2003. In 2004, Australian Prime Minister <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> attended the ceremonies in France that marked the 60th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. The French Government also awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a> to ten of the surviving Australian veterans of the landings to commemorate this anniversary. In 2014, Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a> and a party of seven Australian veterans of the campaign attended ceremonies held to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. When the <a href="M%C3%A9morial%20de%20Caen">Mémorial de Caen</a> opened in 1988, the flagpoles outside the museum commemorating the countries that participated in the battle did not include an Australian flag. Former No. 453 Squadron fighter pilot <a href="Colin%20Leith">Colin Leith</a> campaigned to have an Australian flag added, and this was achieved on 1 May 1998. Despite these commemorations, there is only limited awareness among modern Australians of their country's role in the fighting in Normandy, and the campaigns fought in the Pacific have a much more prominent place in the public memory of World War II.

One Tree Hill (song)

"One Tree Hill" is a song by Irish <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="U2">U2</a> and the ninth track on their 1987 album "<a href="The%20Joshua%20Tree">The Joshua Tree</a>". In March 1988, it was released as the fourth single from the album in New Zealand and Australia, while "<a href="In%20God%27s%20Country">In God's Country</a>" was released as the fourth single in North America. The release charted at number one on the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">New Zealand Singles Chart</a>.

The track was written in memory of Greg Carroll, a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> man the band first met in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a> during <a href="the%20Unforgettable%20Fire%20Tour">the Unforgettable Fire Tour</a> in 1984. He became very close friends with lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a> and later served as a <a href="road%20crew">roadie</a> for the group. Carroll was killed in July 1986 in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. Following the <a href="Tangihanga">tangi</a> funeral in New Zealand, Bono wrote the lyrics to "One Tree Hill" in Carroll's memory. The lyrics reflect Bono's thoughts at the tangi and during his first night in New Zealand when Carroll took him up Auckland's <a href="One%20Tree%20Hill%20%28New%20Zealand%29">One Tree Hill</a>. They also pay homage to Chilean singer-songwriter and activist <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Jara">Víctor Jara</a>. Musically, the song was developed in a <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a> with producer <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>. The vocals were recorded in a single take, as Bono felt incapable of singing them a second time.

"One Tree Hill" was received favourably by critics, who variously described it as "a soft, haunting benediction", "a remarkable musical centrepiece", and a celebration of life. U2 delayed performing the song on the <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour">Joshua Tree Tour</a> in 1987 because of Bono's fears over his emotional state. After its live debut on the tour's third leg and an enthusiastic reaction from audiences, the song was played occasionally for the rest of the tour and semi-regularly during the <a href="Lovetown%20Tour">Lovetown Tour</a> of 1989–1990. It has appeared only sporadically since then, and most renditions were performed in New Zealand. Performances in November 2010 on the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour">U2 360° Tour</a> were dedicated to the miners who died in the <a href="Pike%20River%20Mine%20disaster">Pike River Mine disaster</a>. During <a href="the%20Joshua%20Tree%20Tour%202017">the Joshua Tree Tour 2017</a> to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the album, "One Tree Hill" was performed at each show.

<a href="U2">U2</a> first visited Australia and New Zealand in 1984 to open <a href="The%20Unforgettable%20Fire%20Tour">The Unforgettable Fire Tour</a>. After a 24-hour flight into <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a> was unable to adjust to the time difference between New Zealand and Europe. He left his hotel room during the night and met some people who showed him around the city. Greg Carroll was part of that group: he had met U2's production manager Steve Iredale and been offered a job helping the band for their upcoming concert on account of Greg's experience with local rock bands. They ended up taking Bono up <a href="One%20Tree%20Hill%20%28New%20Zealand%29">One Tree Hill (Maungakiekie)</a>, one of the highest – and more spiritually significant to <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori people</a> – of <a href="Auckland%20volcanic%20field">Auckland's largest volcanoes</a>. Greg worked as a stage hand gently stopping people getting on stage, and was described as "this very helpful fellah running around the place". U2's manager <a href="Paul%20McGuinness">Paul McGuinness</a> thought Carroll was so helpful that he should accompany the band for the remainder of the tour. The group helped him obtain a passport, and he subsequently joined them on the road in Australia and the United States as their assistant. He became very close friends with Bono and his wife <a href="Ali%20Hewson">Ali Hewson</a>, and following the conclusion of the tour, he worked for U2 in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>.

On 3 July 1986, just before the start of the recording sessions for "<a href="The%20Joshua%20Tree">The Joshua Tree</a>", Carroll was killed in a motorcycle accident while on a courier run. A car had pulled in front of him, and unable to stop in the rain, Carroll struck the side of the car and was killed instantly. The event shocked the entire band; drummer <a href="Larry%20Mullen%2C%20Jr.">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> said, "his death really rocked us – it was the first time anyone in our working circle had been killed." Guitarist <a href="the%20Edge">the Edge</a> said, "Greg was like a member of the family, but the fact that he had come under our wing and had travelled so far from home to be in Dublin to work with us made it all the more difficult to deal with." Bassist <a href="Adam%20Clayton">Adam Clayton</a> described it as "a very sobering moment", saying, "it inspired the awareness that there are more important things than rock 'n' roll. That your family, your friends and indeed the other members of the band – you don't know how much time you've got left with them." Bono said, "it was a devastating blow. He was doing me a favour. He was taking my bike home." He later commented, "it brought gravitas to the recording of "The Joshua Tree". We had to fill the hole in our heart with something very, very large indeed, we loved him so much." Accompanied by Bono, Ali, Mullen, and other members of the U2 organisation, Carroll's body was flown back to New Zealand and buried in the <a href="Tangihanga">traditional Māori manner</a> at Kai-iwi Marae near <a href="Whanganui">Whanganui</a>, Carroll's hometown. Bono sang "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28song%29">Let It Be</a>" and "<a href="Knockin%27%20on%20Heaven%27s%20Door">Knockin' on Heaven's Door</a>" for him at the funeral.

Shortly after returning to Dublin, Bono wrote lyrics for a song about the funeral that he titled "One Tree Hill" after the hill he remembered from his visit to Auckland in 1984. The music was developed early in the recording sessions for "The Joshua Tree". The Edge said, "We were jamming with <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian [Eno</a>]. He was playing keyboards ... we just got this groove going, and this part began to come through. It's almost <a href="highlife">highlife</a>, although it's not African at all ... the sound was for me at that time a very elaborate one. I would never have dreamt of using a sound like that before then, but it just felt right, and I went with it." Bono recorded his vocals in a single take, as he felt that he could not sing the lyrics a second time. The Edge used a <a href="Bond%20Electraglide">Bond Electraglide</a> guitar to play a solo with a "heavy <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">fuzz</a>" sound at the end of the song. Three musicians from <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>—Dick, Paul and Adele Armin—recorded string pieces for the song in Grant Avenue Studio in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>. In a six-hour phone call with the Edge, and under the supervision of producer <a href="Daniel%20Lanois">Daniel Lanois</a>, the Armins used "sophisticated 'electro-acoustic' string instrument[s]" they developed called Raads to record a piece created for the song. Dick Armin said, "[U2] were interested in using strings, but not in the conventional style of sweetening. They didn't want a 19th-century group playing behind them." Bono found the song so emotional, he was unable to listen to it after it had been recorded.

In the song, Bono included the lyric: "Jara sang, his song a weapon in the hands of love / You know his blood still cries from the ground". This refers to the Chilean political activist and folk singer <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Jara">Víctor Jara</a>, who became a symbol of the resistance against the <a href="Augusto%20Pinochet">Augusto Pinochet</a> military dictatorship after he was tortured and killed during the <a href="1973%20Chilean%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1973 Chilean coup d'état</a>. Bono learned of Jara after meeting René Castro, a Chilean mural artist, while on <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>'s <a href="A%20Conspiracy%20of%20Hope">A Conspiracy of Hope</a> tour. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the military because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led <a href="Military%20government%20of%20Chile%20%281973%E2%80%931990%29">regime</a> that had seized power in 1973 during the coup. While purchasing a <a href="screen%20printing">silkscreen</a> of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> that Castro had created, Bono noticed a print of Jara. He became more familiar with him after reading "Una Canción Truncada" (An Unfinished Song), written by Jara's widow Joan Turner.

"One Tree Hill" and "The Joshua Tree" are dedicated to Carroll's memory. The track was recorded by <a href="Flood%20%28producer%29">Flood</a> and <a href="Pat%20McCarthy%20%28record%20producer%29">Pat McCarthy</a>, mixed by Dave Meegan, and produced by Lanois and Eno.

"One Tree Hill" runs for 5 minutes, 23 seconds. It is played in <a href="Time%20signature">common time</a> at a <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 120 beats per minute. The song begins with a highlife-influenced riff by the Edge on guitar, which repeats in the background throughout the song. Percussion from drummer <a href="Larry%20Mullen%2C%20Jr.">Larry Mullen, Jr.</a> enters after two seconds. At 0:07, a second guitar enters. At 0:15, Clayton's bass and Mullen's drums enter, and at 0:31, the verse chord progression of C–F–B–F–C is introduced. The first verse begins at 0:47. At 1:32, the song moves to the chorus, switching to a C–B–F–C chord progression. The second verse then begins at 1:49, and after the second chorus, a brief musical interlude begins at 2:36, in which the Edge's guitar is replaced by the Raad strings. The third verse begins at 3:07, and the Edge's guitar resumes at 3:38 in the chorus. A guitar solo begins at 4:16 and is played until the instrumentation comes to a close at 4:36. After two seconds of silence, the Raad strings fade in and Bono proceeds to sing the coda. The final lyric and strings fade out over the final six seconds.

Clayton called it part of a trilogy of songs on the album, along with "<a href="Bullet%20the%20Blue%20Sky">Bullet the Blue Sky</a>" and "<a href="Mothers%20of%20the%20Disappeared">Mothers of the Disappeared</a>", that decry the involvement of the United States in the Chilean coup. McGuinness stated that the imagery in the song described the sense of tragedy felt by the band over Carroll's death. Colm O'Hare of "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" believed the Edge's guitar riff personified the lyric "run like a river runs to the sea". Thom Duffy of the "<a href="Orlando%20Sentinel">Orlando Sentinel</a>" felt the song reflected the seduction of a lover. Richard Harrington of the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" acknowledged the tribute to Carroll, adding that it demonstrated U2's belief that music could spur change.

Like many other U2 songs, "One Tree Hill" can be interpreted in a religious manner. "Hot Press" editor <a href="Niall%20Stokes">Niall Stokes</a> called it "a spiritual tour de force", saying "it is a hymn of praise and celebration which described the traditional Māori burial of their friend on One Tree Hill and links it poetically with themes of renewal and redemption." Beth Maynard, a Church <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> from Fairhaven, Massachusetts, felt the song "vows faith in the face of loss, combining elegiac lines about a friend ... and the martyred Chilean activist and folk singer Victor Jara, with a subtle evocation of end-time redemption and a wrenching wail to God to send the pentecostal Latter Rain." Matt Soper, Senior Minister of the West Houston Church of Christ, believed the lyrics were an attempt by Bono to understand God's place in the world. Steve Stockman, a chaplain at <a href="Queen%27s%20University%20Belfast">Queen's University Belfast</a>, felt that the song alluded to "transcendent places beyond the space and time of earth". Music journalist Bill Graham noted "the lyrics, with their reference to traditional Māori burial ceremonies on One Tree Hill, indicated that the band's faith didn't exclude an empathy with others' beliefs and rituals. Their Christianity wouldn't plaster over the universal archetypes of mourning."
"One Tree Hill" was released on "The Joshua Tree" on 9 March 1987 as the ninth song on the album. Some CD pressings incorrectly split the <a href="track%20%28CD%29">track</a>s, with the song's coda included as part of the track for the following song, "<a href="Exit%20%28U2%20song%29">Exit</a>". In New Zealand and Australia, "One Tree Hill" was released as a <a href="Gramophone%20record%23Common%20formats">7-inch</a> single in New Zealand and Australia in March 1988. The cover art (photographed by <a href="Anton%20Corbijn">Anton Corbijn</a>), sleeve (designed by <a href="Steve%20Averill">Steve Averill</a>), and B-sides ("Bullet the Blue Sky" and "<a href="Running%20to%20Stand%20Still">Running to Stand Still</a>") were identical to those used for U2's 1987 single "<a href="In%20God%27s%20Country">In God's Country</a>", released only in North America. A <a href="cassette%20single">cassette single</a>, available only in New Zealand, was also released. The song reached number one on the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Singles%20Chart">New Zealand Singles Chart</a>. "One Tree Hill" was included as a bonus track on the Japanese version of U2's 1998 compilation album, "<a href="The%20Best%20of%201980%E2%80%931990">The Best of 1980–1990</a>". The <a href="The%20Best%20of%201980%E2%80%931990%23Video">accompanying video compilation</a> included the song's <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, directed by <a href="Phil%20Joanou">Phil Joanou</a>, which features a live performance taken from a previously unreleased cut of U2's 1988 <a href="rockumentary">rockumentary</a> "<a href="Rattle%20and%20Hum">Rattle and Hum</a>". Additional live performances were released on the <a href="Digital%20distribution">digital</a> album "<a href="Live%20from%20the%20Point%20Depot">Live from the Point Depot</a>" (2004) and the U2.com member-exclusive album "<a href="U22%20%28album%29">U22</a>" (2012). Select editions of the 30th anniversary release of "The Joshua Tree" in 2017 featured a <a href="remix">remix</a> of "One Tree Hill" by St Francis Hotel and a new mix of the song's reprise by Brian Eno.

"One Tree Hill" was received favourably by critics. "Hot Press" editor Niall Stokes described it as one of U2's best tracks, calling it a "fitting tribute" to Carroll. The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" felt it was one of the best songs on the album. Steve Morse of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" compared Bono's vocals at the song's conclusion to the passion of American <a href="soul%20music">soul singer</a> <a href="Otis%20Redding">Otis Redding</a>, also noting that the coda was reminiscent of the hymn "<a href="Amazing%20Grace">Amazing Grace</a>". Steve Pond of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" called it "a soft, haunting benediction". Bill Graham of "Hot Press" said the song was "hopeful, not grim", describing the lyric "We run like a river to the sea" as "[musician Mike Scott's] metaphor recast in terms of eternal life and the Maori's own belief." He described the Edge's playing as "a loose-limbed guitar melody with both an African and a Hawaiian tinge", concluding by saying "despite its moving vocal coda, 'One Tree Hill' isn't sombre. It celebrates the life of the spirit not its extinction."

Writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", John Rockwell felt that it was an example of U2 stretching their range, saying "the inclusion of musical idioms [is] never so overtly explored before on a U2 record, especially the gospel chorus of 'One Tree Hill'". Colin Hogg of "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>" called it "a remarkable musical centrepiece", believing it to be the best song on the album. Colm O'Hare of "Hot Press" said it was "arguably the most poignant, emotionally-charged song U2 have ever recorded." He added that it was the "least instrumentally adorned song on the album, resplendent in a feeling of space and openness." McGuinness called it one of his favourite U2 songs.

The American television drama "<a href="One%20Tree%20Hill%20%28TV%20series%29">One Tree Hill</a>" was named for the song after series creator <a href="Mark%20Schwahn">Mark Schwahn</a> was listening to "The Joshua Tree" when writing the idea for the show. "One Tree Hill" was also the name of the <a href="series%20finale">series finale</a>, which featured the song in the episode's final scene.

"One Tree Hill" made its live debut on 10 September 1987 in Uniondale, New York, the opening night of the third leg of the <a href="Joshua%20Tree%20Tour">Joshua Tree Tour</a>, where it opened the encore. The song had been left out of the set up to this point because Bono feared he would be unable to overcome his emotions in the live setting. Despite his fears, the song received an enthusiastic reaction from the audience. It was performed a further six times and then dropped from the show for a period of two months. It was revived in the main set on 17 November 1987 in Los Angeles, California, and played a further nine times on the tour. "One Tree Hill" was played occasionally on the <a href="Lovetown%20Tour">Lovetown Tour</a>, appearing at 19 of 47 concerts. The penultimate performance, on 31 December 1989, was broadcast live on radio to 21 countries throughout Europe as a New Year's Eve present from the band.

"One Tree Hill" was absent during the majority of the <a href="Zoo%20TV%20Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a>, only appearing as an extended snippet at the end of "<a href="One%20%28U2%20song%29">One</a>" at both concerts in New Zealand in 1993. It did not appear again until 24 November 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, on the final leg of the <a href="Vertigo%20Tour">Vertigo Tour</a>. It was considered to close the concert, but tour designer <a href="Willie%20Williams%20%28set%20designer%29">Willie Williams</a> voiced concern as it had not been performed in full since 1990. The song was performed before "<a href="Sometimes%20You%20Can%27t%20Make%20It%20on%20Your%20Own">Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own</a>" in the main set instead. U2 performed it an additional three times on the tour. "One Tree Hill" was absent for the majority of the <a href="U2%20360%C2%B0%20Tour">U2 360° Tour</a> but was revived in November 2010 for two concerts in New Zealand, where it was dedicated to the miners who died in the <a href="Pike%20River%20Mine%20disaster">Pike River Mine disaster</a>; their names were displayed on the video screen during the song. Dedicating the song, Bono said, "we wrote it for Greg Carroll, whose family are with us tonight. But tonight it belongs to the miners of the West Coast Pike River." U2 played "One Tree Hill" on 25 March 2011, in Santiago, Chile, in a duet with <a href="Francisca%20Valenzuela">Francisca Valenzuela</a>, and they dedicated it to Victor Jara. It was also played in an unplanned addition to the encore at a show in Chicago on 5 July 2011 to mark the 25th anniversary of the death of Greg Carroll 

In 2009, when asked about the likelihood of U2 performing the song, the Edge said, "it's one we kind of keep for special occasions, like playing New Zealand." Bono added, "it's a very special song that holds inside of it a lot of strong feelings, and I don't know if we're afraid of it or something, but we should be playing it more." McGuinness said that U2 found it difficult to play live. 

"One Tree Hill" returned to live performances during <a href="the%20Joshua%20Tree%20Tour%202017">the Joshua Tree Tour 2017</a>, which featured 51 concerts from May through October 2017, each of which featured a full performance of the entire "Joshua Tree" album in running order. Each song from the album was accompanied by a film shown on the set's <a href="LED%20display">LED display</a> that served as a backdrop to the band's performance. The film played during "One Tree Hill" featured an image of large red moon along that faded into footage of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> people. It was directed by Anton Corbijn and filmed in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20California">Lancaster, California</a> over a 14-hour film shoot. Bono dedicated performances of the song to singer <a href="Chris%20Cornell">Chris Cornell</a> (who died in May 2017), to singer <a href="Chester%20Bennington">Chester Bennington</a> (who died in July 2017), to the victims of the <a href="Manchester%20Arena%20bombing">Manchester Arena bombing</a>, and to the victims of the <a href="Orlando%20nightclub%20shooting">Orlando nightclub shooting</a>.

Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan

The Old Church of St Nidan, Llanidan is a <a href="medieval%20architecture">medieval church</a> in the community of <a href="Llanidan">Llanidan</a>, in <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>, <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a>, close to the <a href="Menai%20Strait">Menai Strait</a>. The first church on the site was established in the 7th century by <a href="St%20Nidan">St Nidan</a>, the <a href="confessor">confessor</a> of the monastery at <a href="Penmon">Penmon</a>, Anglesey, but the oldest parts of the present structure, which is now closed and partly in ruins, date from the 14th century. In about 1500 the church was enlarged by the addition of a second <a href="nave">nave</a> on the north side, separated from the earlier nave by an <a href="arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a> of six arches. Between 1839 and 1843 <a href="St%20Nidan%27s%20Church%2C%20Llanidan">a new church</a> was built nearby to serve the local community, partly due to the cost of repairing the old church. Much of the building was subsequently demolished, leaving only part of the western end and the central arcade. The decision was condemned at the time by <a href="Harry%20Longueville%20Jones">Harry Longueville Jones</a>, a clergyman and antiquarian, who lamented the "melancholy fate" of what he called "one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey". Other appreciative comments have been made about the church both before and after its partial demolition.

After the new church was opened, the old church was used as a chapel for funerals for a time. It has been restored by the owners of the adjoining house, <a href="Plas%20Llanidan">Plas Llanidan</a>, and is occasionally open to the public. The remaining parts of the church are a <a href="listed%20building">Grade II* listed building</a>, a national designation given to "particularly important buildings of more than special interest", in particular because St Nidan's is regarded as "a good example of a simple medieval rural church, enriched by 15th-century additions".

In the 12th century, <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> said that the church possessed a curious stone shaped like a thigh that would always return by the next day no matter how far away it was taken. A Norman earl, he recounted, had chained it to a large rock and thrown it into the sea, only for the stone to return to the church by the following morning. A sandstone chest containing bone fragments, possibly relics of a saint, was found buried beneath the altar. The chest and the church's 13th-century font were relocated to the new church.

St Nidan's Church is in the south of <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>, Wales, near the village of <a href="Brynsiencyn">Brynsiencyn</a>. It is about a quarter of a mile (400 m) from the <a href="Menai%20Strait">Menai Strait</a>, which divides the mainland of Wales from the island of Anglesey. The authors of a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales record the tradition that a church was first established at this site in 616. <a href="Nidan">St Nidan</a>, who founded the church here, was associated with <a href="Seiriol">St Seiriol</a>'s monastery at <a href="Penmon">Penmon</a>, on the eastern tip of Anglesey, and was the monastery's <a href="confessor">confessor</a>. The area takes its name from the church: the Welsh word originally meant "enclosure" and then "church", and "‑idan" is a <a href="Colloquial%20Welsh%20morphology">modified form</a> of the saint's name.

The church and rectory are mentioned in a charter of 1360 as being owned by the priory at <a href="Beddgelert">Beddgelert</a>, Gwynedd; earlier records have been lost and therefore the date of the priory's acquisition is unknown. As a result, writes the historian Antony Carr, the reason for the "distant community" of <a href="Augustinians">Augustinians</a> in Beddgelert possessing Llanidan and three other churches in Anglesey cannot now be discovered. Carr notes that the priory also controlled two churches on the other side of the Menai Strait from Llanidan. Ownership of the church passed to <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> at the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in 1535. His successor, <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, granted the <a href="advowson">advowson</a> (the right of a patron to choose the parish priest) and the grounds surrounding St Nidan's, including the estate house called <a href="Plas%20Llanidan">Plas Llanidan</a>, to an Edward Downam and a Peter Ashton; thereafter, in the following centuries, the right and the land passed by sale, on marriage and by bequest into the hands of the <a href="Baron%20Boston">Boston family</a>.

The remaining part of the south nave, the oldest section of the present structure, dates from <a href="medieval%20architecture">medieval times</a>; the north doorway and <a href="tracery">tracery</a> (patterns of stonework in the windows) point to the 14th century. In about 1500, the church was enlarged by the addition of a south porch and a second nave to the north. An <a href="arcade%20%28architecture%29">arcade</a> (row of arches) was constructed between the two naves. Enlargement by adding a second nave was not as common in Anglesey as elsewhere in Wales. Llanidan is one of three examples on the island; the others are <a href="St%20Beuno%27s%20Church%2C%20Aberffraw">St Beuno's, Aberffraw</a> and <a href="St%20Cwyfan%27s%20Church%2C%20Llangwyfan">St Cwyfan's, Llangwyfan</a>). It is uncertain whether St Nidan's was enlarged because of a growth in the numbers attending the church or because of the generosity of a benefactor.

<a href="St%20Nidan%27s%20Church%2C%20Llanidan">A new church</a>, also dedicated to St Nidan, was built to replace the old one between 1839 and 1843. This was because the old church required considerable repair and the growing population in Brynsiencyn needed a church closer to their village. Much of the structure of the old church was demolished in 1844, leaving only the western end (enclosed by a new wall at the east) and the arcade. Some walling was constructed at the east end of the arcade to help support the arches, but it sank because it was apparently built over a grave. In 1913, the tops of the external arches were covered with asphalt and turf in an attempt to make them more weather-proof. One of the <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s in the eastern-most arch was replaced at the same time due to its poor condition.
Parish worship transferred to the new church, along with some of the fittings. The old church was thereafter used as a <a href="mortuary">mortuary</a> chapel for a time. The churchyard continued to be used for burials until 1902. In modern times, the owners of Plas Llanidan have restored the church, and it is used by them as a private chapel. The churchyard is kept locked, but the church and the gardens of Plas Llanidan are occasionally opened to the public.

The 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian <a href="Harry%20Longueville%20Jones">Harry Longueville Jones</a> disputed the need to replace the old church and condemned its "melancholy fate", describing the reasons for its demise as "pretexts". In his view the only part of the church that needed repair was the "ruinous" western end (which had been "badly constructed in the first instance"), yet this part was saved while the "good portions of the building" were destroyed. Furthermore, the cost of the new church was more than double the cost of repairs to the medieval church, which could have "endure[d] for ages to come". He added that it might have been thought to be safe, as it was so close to <a href="Baron%20Boston">Lord Boston</a>'s house and thus "under the shadow of the lord of the domain", and he condemned the "evil hour" in which "the ruthless hand of the destroyer was allowed to be lifted against it by those whose first duty it was to see that it took no harm". He stated that "when buildings, dedicated to God's service by the piety of former ages, are allowed to be treated in this manner by the constituted authorities of the land ... the institutions to which they are attached cannot be expected to find greater favour at the hands of the fickle and ignorant multitude." He also noted that the new church was only a little larger than its predecessor.

The cleric and antiquarian <a href="Henry%20Rowlands">Henry Rowlands</a>, who wrote a history of Anglesey entitled "Mona Antiqua Restaurata", was the vicar of St Nidan's from 1696 until his death in 1723. <a href="Thomas%20Williams%20of%20Llanidan">Thomas Williams</a>, a politician and businessman who became wealthy through copper mining in Anglesey, was buried in the churchyard in 1802, but was reburied at <a href="St%20Tegfan%27s%20Church%2C%20Llandegfan">St Tegfan's, Llandegfan</a>, in the 1830s. <a href="Isaac%20Jones%20%28clergyman%29">Isaac Jones</a>, a cleric and translator of theological texts, was a curate of Llanidan and other churches in the vicinity from 1840 until his death in 1850. He is buried in the churchyard of St Nidan's. The sculptor <a href="John%20Gibson%20%28sculptor%29">John Gibson</a> (1790–1866) was the son of William Gibson, the fourth of his family to serve as the parish clerk at St Nidan's. The Gibson family was associated with the church from the early 18th century onwards; the baptism of Grace, daughter of George Gibson, is recorded in the registers in 1708.

St Nidan's has two naves or aisles divided by a central arcade, and a porch in the south-west corner. It is wide, the northern nave being about wider than the other. Before the church's partial demolition, the church was long and had a chapel, , on the south side. The walls, about thick, are built from local <a href="rubble%20masonry">rubble masonry</a> with a covering of sandstone. The present wall at the east end was added after the rest of the church was demolished. The western wall has been rebuilt and <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es added to the south side and north-west corner to help support the structure; Jones thought that they dated from the 16th century. The roof above the remaining western section is made from slates. At the top of the west end of the roof above the south aisle, there is a stone <a href="bellcote">bellcote</a> with two bells.

The south porch contains a water <a href="holy%20water%20font">stoup</a> that was said miraculously never to dry up; the water was traditionally regarded as having healing powers. There is a second entrance on the north side through a 15th-century arched doorway decorated with carved human heads. Two verses from <a href="Psalm%2084">Psalm 84</a> (in Welsh) are written on the wall above the doorway: "For one day in thy Courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness." These are the only surviving portions of the Biblical texts that once decorated the internal walls.

The north wall has a window with two lights (sections of window separated by <a href="mullion">mullion</a>s) topped with <a href="trefoil">trefoil</a>s (a pattern of three overlapping circles). The two arched east windows, one in each aisle, are decorated with tracery; the southern window reuses some tracery from the 15th century. The demolished southern chapel had a two-light window similar to that at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Newborough">St Peter's, Newborough</a>, which Jones considered to be of "very rude workmanship", and three-light square-headed windows in the east and west walls. Jones also noted the loss of the original window at the end of the northern aisle, which was from the 14th century in his view, and some windows in the north wall "of excellent workmanship". The southern aisle, he said, had had "a small circular headed window, filled up from a pointed one" at the eastern end; the east window "was of a design more remarkable for its singularity than its beauty."
Two of the six arches in the arcade are inside the church; the other four project beyond the east wall, which has been built around one of the octagonal piers that support the arches. The roof dates from the 15th century, although the visible beams are not original; the roof's exposed wooden trusses rest on sandstone <a href="corbel">corbel</a>s. A 1937 survey by the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Ancient%20and%20Historical%20Monuments%20in%20Wales%20and%20Monmouthshire">Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire</a> noted 20 memorials from the 17th and 18th centuries. It also recorded the presence of a sundial on a pedestal, dated 1768, and some stone shields that were not attached to the building, bearing dates of 1561 and 1563. Most of the fittings now in St Nidan's are not original, and come from other churches in north-west Wales; the granite altar is modern.

The 19th-century antiquarian <a href="Angharad%20Llwyd">Angharad Llwyd</a>, who wrote a history of Anglesey in 1833, recorded the story noted by <a href="Gerald%20of%20Wales">Gerald of Wales</a> in the late 12th century that the church once possessed a stone "resembling a human thigh" which would return "of its own accord" however far away it was carried. It was sometimes known as the "homing stone". Gerald said that <a href="Hugh%20d%27Avranches%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester</a> (who died in 1101) had tested this story by throwing the stone into the sea, chained to a large rock, only to discover that the stone had returned by the next morning. As a result, the Norman earl issued an order that no-one was to attempt to move it. It was popularly believed that if a couple had sexual intercourse near the stone (something that Gerald said happened "frequently"), it would "sweat large drops of water" and the woman would not become pregnant. Henry Rowlands wrote that the stone had been stolen from the wall of the churchyard (into which it had been set) during his time at St Nidan's.

When Rowlands was vicar of St Nidan's, a small chest was found buried about under the altar, containing some bone pieces. His view was that it contained the relics of a saint from St Nidan's or another church in the region (<a href="St%20Beuno%27s%20Church%2C%20Clynnog%20Fawr">St Beuno's Church, Clynnog Fawr</a> or <a href="St%20Dwynwen%27s%20Church%2C%20Llanddwyn">St Dwynwen's Church, Llanddwyn</a>), and that the chest had placed in St Nidan's during the time of <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> for safe keeping. The sandstone <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a> is now kept at the new church, where local tradition maintains that it holds the remains of St Nidan. Jones said that it was "unique, as far as Wales is concerned." The 13th-century font, which Jones described as "a singularly beautiful specimen", was moved to the new church in about 1860.

St Nidan's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it is a Grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating "particularly important buildings of more than special interest". It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as "a good example of a simple medieval rural church, enriched by 15th-century additions." <a href="Cadw">Cadw</a>, the <a href="Welsh%20Government">Welsh Government</a> body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists, also notes that although it was partly demolished in the middle of the 19th century, "what remains can be considered a well preserved and important survival of a double-naved church, retaining many 15th-century features such as the central arcade."

The wall around the churchyard is also a listed building, at Grade II – the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them". According to Cadw, the wall probably dates from the 15th century, from around the time that the church was extended.

In 1802 the clergyman and antiquarian <a href="John%20Skinner%20%28archaeologist%29">John Skinner</a> visited Anglesey to see the island's Celtic remains, beginning his tour by rowing across the Menai Strait to land at Llanidan. His view was that the church "seems superior to the generality of Welsh buildings of the kind", with its double roof and two bells, but he also said that "the interior of the building has little to attract notice". Angharad Llwyd described it in 1833 as "a spacious structure, containing several good monuments".

Commenting in 1846 on the church as it had been before demolition started, Harry Longueville Jones said that St Nidan's was "one of the largest and most important [churches] in the island of Anglesey" for its varied architecture, fittings and traditions. He noted the "rather curious" position of the church, in a "nearly circular enclosure" with tall trees around it, and said that "the effect of the western end with the porch, overgrown by an enormous quantity of ivy, was picturesque in the extreme".

The Welsh politician and church historian <a href="Sir%20Stephen%20Glynne%2C%209th%20Baronet">Sir Stephen Glynne</a> visited the church in 1850. He said that St Nidan's, which he described as "now abandoned and in great measure ruinated", was "a larger and better structure than most of the Anglesey churches." At the time he saw it, the walls were still largely in place but the only roofed section was the western end; he commented that most of the church was "open to the skies."

The historian and clergyman <a href="Edmund%20Tyrrell%20Green">Edmund Tyrrell Green</a>, writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, described the arcade as "good" and some of the tracery in the windows as "very good". His view was that the "excellence of the work" at St Nidan's was because of its link with Beddgelert Priory.

The authors of a 1990 book about the lost churches of Wales said that St Nidan's was "now an evocative shell decorously mantled with ivy and enclosed by an overgrown graveyard". They described it as "a dark, dusty and empty place", but said that the "elegant" arcade "rises from the graveyard like an abstract sculpture." The quality of the stone carving of the doors and windows, they said, was evidence of "the vanished splendour of Llanidan."

A 2002 book about Welsh churchyards comments that "a pilgrimage undertaken to this churchyard is rewarding", since there is "little to distract and much to suggest the quiet years of Nidan's ministry in this secluded spot." Noting how the site can be reached from the Menai Strait yet hidden from it, the author added that "some stillness still remains in secret places like Llanidan." A 2005 guide to Wales said that "the romantic yew-encircled ruin" of St Nidan's "should not be missed."

Birth control movement in the United States

The birth control movement in the United States was a <a href="social%20reform">social reform</a> campaign beginning in 1914 that aimed to increase the availability of <a href="contraception">contraception</a> in the U.S. through education and legalization. The movement began in 1914 when a group of <a href="Political%20radicalism">political radical</a>s in New York City, led by <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, <a href="Mary%20Dennett">Mary Dennett</a>, and <a href="Margaret%20Sanger">Margaret Sanger</a>, became concerned about the hardships that childbirth and self-induced <a href="abortion">abortion</a>s brought to low-income women. Sanger, in particular, simultaneously sought to connect birth control to the organized <a href="eugenics%20movement">eugenics movement</a>, regularly appealing to the authority of eugenic scientists <a href="Karl%20Pearson">Karl Pearson</a>, <a href="Charles%20Davenport">Charles Davenport</a>, and others in her "<a href="Birth%20Control%20Review">Birth Control Review</a>" from the early 1920s. Such figures sought to prevent population segments they deemed genetically 'undesirable' from reproducing. While seeking legitimacy for the birth control movement partly through the approval of organized eugenics, Sanger and other activists also worked on the political front. Since contraception was considered to be obscene at the time, the activists targeted the <a href="Comstock%20laws">Comstock laws</a>, which prohibited distribution of any "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" materials through the mail. Hoping to provoke a favorable legal decision, Sanger deliberately broke the law by distributing "<a href="The%20Woman%20Rebel">The Woman Rebel</a>", a newsletter containing a discussion of contraception. In 1916, Sanger opened the first <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> <a href="clinic">clinic</a> in the United States, but the clinic was immediately shut down by police, and Sanger was sentenced to 30 days in jail.

A major turning point for the movement came during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when many U.S. servicemen were diagnosed with <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a>s. The government's response included an anti-venereal disease campaign that framed <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> and contraception as issues of public health and legitimate topics of scientific research. This was the first time a U.S. government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters; as a consequence, contraception transformed from an issue of morals to an issue of public health.

Encouraged by the public's changing attitudes towards birth control, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic in 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. Throughout the 1920s, public discussion of contraception became more commonplace, and the term "birth control" became firmly established in the nation's vernacular. The widespread availability of contraception signaled a transition from the stricter <a href="Sexual%20ethics">sexual mores</a> of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> to a more sexually permissive society.

Legal victories in the 1930s continued to weaken anti-contraception laws. The court victories motivated the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> in 1937 to adopt contraception as a core component of medical school curricula, but the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources. In 1942, the <a href="Planned%20Parenthood%20Federation%20of%20America">Planned Parenthood Federation of America</a> was formed, creating a nationwide network of birth control clinics. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion, as birth control was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the remaining anti-contraception laws were no longer enforced.

The practice of <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the <a href="rhythm%20method">rhythm method</a>, <a href="Coitus%20interruptus">withdrawal</a>, <a href="Diaphragm%20%28contraceptive%29">diaphragms</a>, <a href="contraceptive%20sponge">contraceptive sponge</a>s, <a href="condom">condom</a>s, <a href="Lactational%20amenorrhea%20method">prolonged breastfeeding</a>, and <a href="spermicides">spermicides</a>. Use of <a href="contraceptive">contraceptive</a>s increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the <a href="Total%20fertility%20rate">fertility rate</a> in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted during the nineteenth century of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by <a href="Clelia%20Mosher">Clelia Mosher</a> from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and <a href="pessaries">pessaries</a>) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.

Although contraceptives were relatively common in middle-class and upper-class society, the topic was rarely discussed in public. The first book published in the United States which ventured to discuss contraception was "Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question", published by <a href="Robert%20Dale%20Owen">Robert Dale Owen</a> in 1831. The book suggested that <a href="family%20planning">family planning</a> was a laudable effort, and that sexual gratification – without the goal of reproduction – was not immoral. Owen recommended withdrawal, but he also discussed sponges and condoms. That book was followed by "Fruits of Philosophy: The Private Companion of Young Married People", written in 1832 by <a href="Charles%20Knowlton">Charles Knowlton</a>, which recommended <a href="douching">douching</a>. Knowlton was prosecuted in Massachusetts on <a href="obscenity">obscenity</a> charges, and served three months in prison.

Birth control practices were generally adopted earlier in Europe than in the United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by <a href="Charles%20Bradlaugh">Charles Bradlaugh</a> and <a href="Annie%20Besant">Annie Besant</a>, with the goal of challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the <a href="Malthusian%20League">Malthusian League</a> – the world's first birth control advocacy group – which sought to limit population growth to avoid <a href="Thomas%20Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a>'s dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, <a href="Aletta%20Jacobs">Aletta Jacobs</a>. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by <a href="Marie%20Stopes">Marie Stopes</a>, in London.
Contraception was legal in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a <a href="social%20purity%20movement">social purity movement</a> grew in strength, aimed at outlawing <a href="vice">vice</a> in general, and <a href="prostitution">prostitution</a> and obscenity in particular. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the <a href="Victorian-era">Victorian-era</a> campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an <a href="Victorian%20morality">immoral</a> practice that promoted prostitution and <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a>. <a href="Anthony%20Comstock">Anthony Comstock</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Inspection%20Service">postal inspector</a> and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 <a href="Comstock%20Act">Comstock Act</a>, a federal law prohibiting mailing of "any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of <a href="abortion">abortion</a>" as well as any form of contraceptive information. Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the "<a href="Comstock%20laws">Comstock laws</a>"), sometimes extending the federal law by outlawing the "use" of contraceptives, as well as their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.

Comstock and his allies also took aim at the <a href="Libertarianism%23Early%20individualist%20anarchism">libertarians</a> and utopians who comprised the <a href="free%20love%20movement">free love movement</a> – an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, setting the stage for the birth control movement.

The efforts of the free love movement were not successful and, at the beginning of the 20th century, <a href="Federal%20government">federal</a> and <a href="state%20government">state government</a>s began to enforce the Comstock laws more rigorously. In response, contraception went underground, but it was not extinguished. The number of publications on the topic dwindled, and advertisements, if they were found at all, used euphemisms such as "marital aids" or "hygienic devices". Drug stores continued to sell condoms as "rubber goods" and <a href="cervical%20cap">cervical cap</a>s as "womb supporters".

At the turn of the century, an energetic movement arose, centered in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, that sought to overturn bans on <a href="free%20speech">free speech</a>. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as <a href="Ezra%20Heywood">Ezra Heywood</a>, <a href="Moses%20Harman">Moses Harman</a>, <a href="D.%20M.%20Bennett">D. M. Bennett</a>, and <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.

Goldman's circle of radicals, socialists, and bohemians was joined in 1912 by a nurse, <a href="Margaret%20Sanger">Margaret Sanger</a>, whose mother had been through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 50 of tuberculosis and cervical cancer. In 1913, Sanger worked in New York's <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a>, often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and <a href="self-induced%20abortion">self-induced abortion</a>s. After one particularly tragic medical case, Sanger wrote: "I threw my nursing bag in the corner and announced  ... that I would never take another case until I had made it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth." Sanger visited public libraries, searching for information on contraception, but nothing was available. She became outraged that working-class women could not obtain contraception, yet upper-class women who had access to private physicians could.
Under the influence of Goldman and the <a href="Free%20Speech%20League">Free Speech League</a>, Sanger became determined to challenge the Comstock laws that outlawed the dissemination of contraceptive information. With that goal in mind, in 1914 she launched "The Woman Rebel", an eight-page monthly newsletter which promoted contraception using the slogan "No Gods, No Masters", and proclaimed that each woman should be "the absolute mistress of her own body." Sanger coined the term "birth control", which first appeared in the pages of "Rebel", as a more candid alternative to euphemisms such as "family limitation."

Sanger's goal of challenging the law was fulfilled when she was indicted in August 1914, but the prosecutors focused their attention on articles Sanger had written on assassination and marriage, rather than contraception. Afraid that she might be sent to prison without an opportunity to argue for birth control in court, she fled to England to escape arrest.

While Sanger was in Europe, her husband continued her work, which led to his arrest after he distributed a copy of a birth control pamphlet to an <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Inspection%20Service">undercover postal worker</a>. The arrest and his 30-day jail sentence prompted several mainstream publications, including "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" and the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>", to publish articles about the birth control controversy. Emma Goldman and <a href="Ben%20Reitman">Ben Reitman</a> toured the country, speaking in support of the Sangers, and distributing copies of Sanger's pamphlet "Family Limitation". Sanger's exile and her husband's arrest propelled the birth control movement into the forefront of American news.
In the spring of 1915 supporters of the Sangers – led by <a href="Mary%20Dennett">Mary Dennett</a> – formed the <a href="National%20Birth%20Control%20League">National Birth Control League</a> (NBCL), which was the first American birth control organization. Throughout 1915, smaller regional organizations were formed in San Francisco, Portland, Oregon, Seattle, and Los Angeles.

Sanger returned to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her. Noted attorney <a href="Clarence%20Darrow">Clarence Darrow</a> offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into the leadership of the U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as <a href="William%20J.%20Robinson">William J. Robinson</a> and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the background, or turned their attention to other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist <a href="Van%20Kleeck%20Allison">Van Kleeck Allison</a>.

During Sanger's 1916 speaking tour, she promoted birth control clinics based on the Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe. Although she inspired many local communities to create birth control leagues, no clinics were established. Sanger therefore resolved to create a birth control clinic in New York that would provide free contraceptive services to women. New York state law prohibited the distribution of contraceptives or even contraceptive information, but Sanger hoped to exploit a provision in the law which permitted doctors to prescribe contraceptives for the prevention of disease. On October 16, 1916, she, partnering with <a href="Fania%20Mindell">Fania Mindell</a> and <a href="Ethel%20Byrne">Ethel Byrne</a>, opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn. The clinic was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day. A few days after opening, an undercover policewoman purchased a <a href="cervical%20cap">cervical cap</a> at the clinic, and Sanger was arrested. Refusing to walk, Sanger and a co-worker were dragged out of the clinic by police officers. The clinic was shut down, and it was not until 1923 that another birth control clinic was opened in the United States.

Sanger's trial began in January 1917. She was supported by a large number of wealthy and influential women who came together to form the Committee of One Hundred, which was devoted to raising funds for Sanger and the NBCL. The committee also started publishing the monthly journal "Birth Control Review", and established a network of connections to powerful politicians, activists, and press figures. Despite the strong support, Sanger was convicted; the judge offered a lenient sentence if she promised not to break the law again, but Sanger replied "I cannot respect the law as it exists today." She served a sentence of 30 days in jail.

In protest to her arrest as well, Byrne was sentenced to 30 days in jail at Blackwell's Island Prison and responded to her situation with a hunger strike protest. With no signs of ending her demonstration anytime soon, Byrne was force fed by prison guards. Weakened and ill, Byrne refused to end her hunger strike at the cost of securing early release from prison. However, Sanger accepted the plea bargain on her sister's behalf, agreeing that Byrne would be released early from prison if she ended her birth control activism. Horrified, Byrne's relationship quickly eroded with her sister and, both forcefully and willingly, she left the birth control movement. Due to the drama of Byrne's demonstration, the birth control movement became a headline news story in which the organization's purpose was distributed across the country.

Other activists were also pushing for progress. Emma Goldman was arrested in 1916 for circulating birth control information, and <a href="Abraham%20Jacobi">Abraham Jacobi</a> unsuccessfully tried to persuade the New York medical community to push for a change in law to permit physicians to dispense contraceptive information.

The publicity from Sanger's trial and Byrne's hunger strike generated immense enthusiasm for the cause, and by the end of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States. Sanger was always astute about public relations, and she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes. After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader. Other leaders, such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and <a href="Blanche%20Ames%20Ames">Blanche Ames Ames</a>, could not match Sanger's charisma, charm and fervor.

The movement was evolving from radical, working-class roots into a campaign backed by society women and liberal professionals. Sanger and her fellow advocates began to tone down their radical rhetoric and instead emphasized the socioeconomic benefits of birth control, a policy which led to increasing acceptance by mainstream Americans. Media coverage increased, and several <a href="Silent%20movie">silent motion pictures</a> produced in the 1910s featured birth control as a theme (including "<a href="Birth%20Control%20%28film%29">Birth Control</a>", produced by Sanger and starring herself).

Opposition to birth control remained strong: state legislatures refused to legalize contraception or the distribution of contraceptive information; religious leaders spoke out, attacking women who would choose "ease and fashion" over motherhood; and <a href="eugenicist">eugenicist</a>s were worried that birth control would exacerbate the birth rate differential between "old stock" white Americans and "coloreds" or immigrants.

Sanger formed the New York Woman's Publishing Company (NYWPC) in 1918 and, under its auspices, became the publisher for the "Birth Control Review". British <a href="suffragette">suffragette</a> activist <a href="Kitty%20Marion">Kitty Marion</a>, standing on New York street corners, sold the "Review" at 20 cents per copy, enduring death threats, heckling, spitting, physical abuse, and police harassment. Over the course of the following ten years, Marion was arrested nine times for her birth control advocacy.

Sanger appealed her 1917 conviction and won a mixed victory in 1918 in a unanimous decision by the <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a> written by Judge <a href="Frederick%20E.%20Crane">Frederick E. Crane</a>. The court's opinion upheld her conviction, but indicated that the courts would be willing to permit contraception if prescribed by doctors. This decision was only applicable within New York, where it opened the door for birth control clinics, under physician supervision, to be established. Sanger herself did not immediately take advantage of the opportunity, wrongly expecting that the medical profession would lead the way; instead she focused on writing and lecturing.

The birth control movement received an unexpected boost during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, as a result of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> or <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and when they returned to America, they continued to use condoms as their preferred method of birth control.

The military's <a href="safe%20sex">anti-venereal disease campaign</a> marked a major turning point for the movement: it was the first time a government institution had engaged in a sustained, public discussion of sexual matters. The government's public discourse changed sex from a secret topic into a legitimate topic of scientific research, and it transformed contraception from an issue of morals to an issue of <a href="public%20health">public health</a>.

In 1917, advocate Emma Goldman was arrested for protesting World War 1 and American military conscription. Goldman's commitment to free speech on topics such as socialism, anarchism, birth control, labor/union rights, and free love eventually cost her American citizenship and the right to live in the United States. Due to her commitment to socialist welfare and anti-capitalism, Goldman was associated with communism which led to her expulsion from the country during the <a href="First%20Red%20Scare">First Red Scare</a>. While World War 1 led to a breakthrough on American acceptance of birth control relating to public health, anti-communist WW1 <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> sacrificed one of the birth control movement's most dedicated members.

While an important birth control activist and leader, Mary Dennett advocated for a wide variety of organizations. Starting as a field secretary for the Massachusetts Women's Suffrage Association, she worked her way up to win an elected seat as a corresponding secretary for the National American Women's Suffrage Association. Dennett headed the literary department, undertaking assignments such as distributing pamphlets and leaflets. Following disillusionment with the NAWSA's organizational structure, Dennett, as described above, helped found the National Birth Control League. The NBCL took a strong stance against militant protest strategies and instead focused attention on legislation changes at both the state and federal level. During World War I, Mary Dennett focused her efforts on the peace movement, but she returned to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, "The Sex Side of Life", which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the <a href="Voluntary%20Parenthood%20League">Voluntary Parenthood League</a> (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical <a href="quackery">quackery</a>. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy was the only thing that kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.

Although Sanger was busy publishing the "Birth Control Review" during the years 1919–1920, she was not formally affiliated with either of the major birth control organizations (NBCL or VPL) during that time. In 1921 she became convinced that she needed to associate with a formal body to earn the support of professional societies and the scientific community. Rather than join an existing organization, she considered creating a new one. As a first step, she organized the First American Birth Control Conference, held in November 1921 in New York City. On the final night of the conference, as Sanger prepared to give a speech in the crowded <a href="The%20Town%20Hall">Town Hall theater</a>, police raided the meeting and arrested her for disorderly conduct. From the stage she shouted: "we have a right to hold [this meeting] under the Constitution  ... let them club us if they want to." She was soon released. The following day it was revealed that <a href="Patrick%20Joseph%20Hayes">Patrick Joseph Hayes</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20New%20York">Archbishop of New York</a>, had pressured the police to shut down the meeting. The Town Hall raid was a turning point for the movement: opposition from the government and medical community faded, and the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States">Catholic Church</a> emerged as its most vocal opponent. After the conference, Sanger and her supporters established the <a href="American%20Birth%20Control%20League">American Birth Control League</a> (ABCL).
Four years after the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for physicians to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the <a href="Clinical%20Research%20Bureau">Clinical Research Bureau</a> (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced to the public in December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years of struggle, birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.

Following the successful opening of the CRB in 1923, public discussion of contraception became more commonplace, and the term "birth control" became firmly established in the nation's vernacular. Of the hundreds of references to birth control in magazines and newspapers of the 1920s, more than two-thirds were favorable. The availability of contraception signaled the end of the stricter morality of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, and ushered in the emergence of a more sexually permissive society. Other factors that contributed to the new sexual norms included increased mobility brought by the automobile, anonymous urban lifestyles, and post-war euphoria. Sociologists who <a href="Middletown%20studies">surveyed women in Muncie, Indiana</a> in 1925 found that all the <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a> women approved of birth control, and more than 80 percent of the <a href="working%20class">working class</a> women approved. The <a href="Demographic%20history%20of%20the%20United%20States">birth rate in America</a> declined 20 percent between 1920 and 1930, primarily due to increased use of birth control.

Although clinics became more common in the late 1920s, the movement still faced significant challenges: Large sectors of the medical community were still resistant to birth control; birth control advocates were <a href="blacklist">blacklist</a>ed by the <a href="radio%20industry">radio industry</a>; and state and federal laws – though generally not enforced – still outlawed contraception.

The most significant opponent to birth control was the Catholic Church, which mobilized opposition in many venues during the 1920s. Catholics persuaded the <a href="Syracuse%2C%20New%20York">Syracuse</a> city council to ban Sanger from giving a speech in 1924; the <a href="National%20Catholic%20Welfare%20Conference">National Catholic Welfare Conference</a> lobbied against birth control; the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; the Catholic mayor of Boston, <a href="James%20Michael%20Curley">James Curley</a>, blocked Sanger from speaking in public; and several <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a> companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related to birth control. The ABCL turned some of the boycotted speaking events to their advantage by inviting the press, and the resultant news coverage often generated public sympathy for their cause. However, Catholic lobbying was particularly effective in the legislative arena, where their arguments – that contraception was unnatural, harmful, and indecent – impeded several initiatives, including an attempt in 1924 by Mary Dennett to overturn federal anti-contraception laws.

Dozens of birth control clinics opened across the United States during the 1920s, but not without incident. In 1929, New York police raided a clinic in New York and arrested two doctors and three nurses for distributing contraceptive information that was unrelated to the prevention of disease. The ABCL achieved a major victory in the trial, when the judge ruled that use of contraceptives to space births farther apart was a legitimate medical treatment that benefited the health of the mother. The trial, in which many important physicians served as witnesses for the defense, helped to unite the physicians with the birth control advocates. 

Before the advent of the birth control movement, <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> had become very popular in Europe and the U.S., and the subject was widely discussed in articles, movies, and lectures. Eugenicists had mixed feelings about birth control: they worried that it would exacerbate the birth rate differential between "superior" and "inferior" <a href="Race%20%28classification%20of%20humans%29">races</a>, but they also recognized its value as a tool to "racial betterment". Leaders of the birth control movement never considered eugenics to be their primary goal, focusing instead on free speech and women's rights, but around 1920 they started to make common cause with eugenicists, hoping to broaden the support base of the birth control movement. Eugenics buttressed the birth control movement's aims by correlating excessive births with increased poverty, crime and disease. Sanger published two books in the early 1920s that endorsed eugenics: "Woman and the New Race" and "The Pivot of Civilization". Sanger and other advocates endorsed "negative eugenics" (discouraging procreation of "inferior" persons), but did not advocate euthanasia or "positive eugenics" (encouraging procreation of "superior" persons). However, many eugenicists refused to support the birth control movement because of Sanger's insistence that a woman's primary duty was to herself, not to the state.

Like many white Americans in the U.S. in the 1930s, some leaders of the birth control movement believed that lighter-skinned races were superior to darker-skinned races. They assumed that <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s were intellectually backward, would be relatively incompetent in managing their own health, and would require special supervision from whites. The dominance of whites in the movement's leadership and medical staff resulted in accusations of racism from blacks and suspicions that "race suicide" would be a consequence of large scale adoption of birth control. These suspicions were misinterpreted by some of the white birth control advocates as lack of interest in contraception.
In spite of these suspicions, many African-American leaders supported efforts to <a href="African%20Americans%20and%20birth%20control">supply birth control to the African-American community</a>. In 1929, <a href="James%20H.%20Hubert">James H. Hubert</a>, a black social worker and leader of New York's <a href="Urban%20League">Urban League</a>, asked Sanger to open a clinic in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. Sanger secured funding from the <a href="Julius%20Rosenwald%20Fund">Julius Rosenwald Fund</a> and opened the clinic, staffed with African-American doctors, in 1930. The clinic was guided by a 15-member advisory board consisting of African-American doctors, nurses, clergy, journalists, and social workers. It was publicized in the African-American press and African-American churches, and received the approval of <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a>, co-founder of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP). In the early 1940s, the <a href="Birth%20Control%20Federation%20of%20America">Birth Control Federation of America</a> (BCFA) initiated a program called the Negro Project, managed by its Division of Negro Service (DNS). As with the Harlem clinic, the primary aim of the DNS and its programs was to improve maternal and infant health. Based on her work at the Harlem clinic, Sanger suggested to the DNS that African Americans were more likely to take advice from a doctor of their own race, but other leaders prevailed and insisted that whites be employed in the outreach efforts. The discriminatory actions and statements by the movement's leaders during the 1920s and 1930s have led to continuing allegations that the movement was racist.

Two important legal decisions in the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued each other in the "Youngs Rubber" case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20One%20Package%20of%20Japanese%20Pessaries">One Package</a>" legal ruling by Judge <a href="Augustus%20Noble%20Hand">Augustus Hand</a>. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives. This court victory motivated the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of <a href="medical%20school">medical school</a> <a href="curricula">curricula</a>. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.

By 1938, over 400 contraceptive manufacturers were in business, over 600 brands of female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250 million per year. Condoms were sold in <a href="vending%20machine">vending machine</a>s in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving. Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the <a href="birth%20control%20pill">birth control pill</a> decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the <a href="Holland%E2%80%93Rantos">Holland–Rantos</a> company to manufacture contraceptives – primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with <a href="Spermicide">spermicidal jelly</a> had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.

The 1936 "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20One%20Package%20of%20Japanese%20Pessaries">One Package</a>" court battle brought together two birth control organizations – the ABCL and the <a href="Birth%20Control%20Clinical%20Research%20Bureau">Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau</a> (formerly the CRB) – who had joined forces to craft the successful defense effort. Leaders of both groups viewed this as an auspicious time to merge the two organizations, so, in 1937, the <a href="Birth%20Control%20Council%20of%20America">Birth Control Council of America</a>, under the leadership of Sanger, was formed to effect a consolidation. The effort eventually led to the merger of the two organizations in 1939 as the <a href="Birth%20Control%20Federation%20of%20America">Birth Control Federation of America</a> (BCFA). Although Sanger continued in the role of president, she no longer wielded the same power as she had in the early years of the movement, and, in 1942, more conservative forces within the organization changed the name to <a href="Planned%20Parenthood%20Federation%20of%20America">Planned Parenthood Federation of America</a>, a name Sanger objected to because she considered it too euphemistic. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the leadership of Planned Parenthood de-emphasized <a href="radical%20feminism">radical feminism</a> and shifted focus to more moderate themes such as family planning and population policy.

The movement to legalize birth control came to a gradual conclusion around the time Planned Parenthood was formed. In 1942, there were over 400 birth control organizations in America, contraception was fully embraced by the medical profession, and the anti-contraception Comstock laws (which still remained on the books) were rarely enforced.

After World War II advocacy for reproductive rights transitioned into a new era which focused on abortion, public funding, and insurance coverage.

Birth control advocacy also took on a global aspect as organizations around the world began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the <a href="International%20Planned%20Parenthood%20Federation">International Planned Parenthood Federation</a> and soon became the world's largest <a href="NGO">non-governmental</a> international family planning organization. In 1952, <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller%203rd">John D. Rockefeller III</a> founded the influential <a href="Population%20Council">Population Council</a>. Fear of global <a href="Human%20overpopulation">overpopulation</a> became a major issue in the 1960s, generating concerns about <a href="pollution">pollution</a>, <a href="Economic%20shortage">food shortage</a>s, and <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a>, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world. The 1994 <a href="International%20Conference%20on%20Population%20and%20Development">International Conference on Population and Development</a> and the 1995 <a href="Fourth%20World%20Conference%20on%20Women">Fourth World Conference on Women</a> addressed birth control and influenced <a href="human%20right">human right</a>s declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.

In the early 1950s in the United States, philanthropist <a href="Katharine%20McCormick">Katharine McCormick</a> provided funding for biologist <a href="Gregory%20Goodwin%20Pincus">Gregory Pincus</a> to develop the <a href="birth%20control%20pill">birth control pill</a>, which was approved by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) in 1960. The pill became very popular and had a major impact on society and culture. It contributed to a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women. New forms of <a href="intrauterine%20device">intrauterine device</a>s were introduced in the 1960s, increasing popularity of long acting reversible contraceptives.

In 1965, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruled in "<a href="Griswold%20v.%20Connecticut">Griswold v. Connecticut</a>" that it was unconstitutional for the government to prohibit married couples from using birth control.

In 1967 activist <a href="Bill%20Baird%20%28activist%29">Bill Baird</a> was arrested for distributing a contraceptive foam and a condom to a student during a lecture on birth control and abortion at Boston University. Baird's appeal of his conviction resulted in the United States Supreme Court case "<a href="Eisenstadt%20v.%20Baird">Eisenstadt v. Baird</a>" (1972), which extended the Griswold holding to unmarried couples, and thereby legalized birth control for all Americans.

In 1970, Congress finally removed references to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws; and in 1973, the "<a href="Roe%20v.%20Wade">Roe v. Wade</a>" decision legalized abortion during the first <a href="Trimester%20%28pregnancy%29%23Physiology">trimester of pregnancy</a>.
Also in 1970, <a href="Title%20X">Title X</a> of the <a href="Public%20Health%20Service%20Act">Public Health Service Act</a> was enacted as part of the <a href="war%20on%20poverty">war on poverty</a>, to make family planning and preventive health services available to low-income and the uninsured. Without publicly funded family planning services, according to the <a href="Guttmacher%20Institute">Guttmacher Institute</a>, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher; the number of <a href="unintended%20pregnancy">unintended pregnancies</a> among poor women would nearly double. According to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">United States Department of Health and Human Services</a>, publicly funded family planning saves nearly $4 in <a href="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> expenses for every $1 spent on services.

In 1982, European drug manufacturers developed <a href="mifepristone">mifepristone</a>, which was initially utilized as a contraceptive, but is now generally prescribed with a <a href="prostoglandin">prostoglandin</a> to induce abortion in pregnancies up to the fourth month of gestation. To avoid consumer boycotts organized by <a href="opposition%20to%20the%20legalization%20of%20abortion">anti-abortion</a> organizations, the manufacturer donated the U.S. manufacturing rights to <a href="Danco%20Laboratories">Danco Laboratories</a>, a company formed by pro-choice advocates, with the sole purpose of distributing mifepristone in the U.S, and thus immune to the effects of boycotts.

In 1997, the FDA approved a prescription <a href="emergency%20contraception">emergency contraception</a> pill (known as the morning-after pill), which became available <a href="over%20the%20counter">over the counter</a> in 2006. In 2010, <a href="ulipristal%20acetate">ulipristal acetate</a>, a more effective emergency contraceptive was approved for use up to five days after unprotected <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>. Fifty to sixty percent of abortion patients became pregnant in circumstances in which emergency contraceptives could have been used. These emergency contraceptives, including <a href="Plan%20B%20%28drug%29">Plan B</a> and <a href="EllaOne">EllaOne</a>, proved to be <a href="Beginning%20of%20pregnancy%20controversy">another battleground</a> in the war over reproductive rights. Opponents of emergency contraception consider it a form of abortion, because it may interfere with the ability of a fertilized <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">embryo</a> to <a href="Implantation%20%28human%20embryo%29">implant</a> in the <a href="uterus">uterus</a>; while proponents contend that it is not abortion, because the absence of implantation means that <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> never commenced.

In 2000, the <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> ruled that companies that provided insurance for prescription drugs to their employees but excluded birth control were violating the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>.

<a href="Barack%20Obama">President Obama</a> signed the <a href="Patient%20Protection%20and%20Affordable%20Care%20Act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female contraception was added to a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The <a href="contraceptive%20mandate">federal mandate</a> applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The <a href="Guttmacher%20Institute">Guttmacher Institute</a> noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.

"<a href="Burwell%20v.%20Hobby%20Lobby">Burwell v. Hobby Lobby</a>", , is a <a href="List%20of%20landmark%20court%20decisions%20in%20the%20United%20States">landmark decision</a> by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> allowing <a href="closely%20held%20corporation%23Closely%20held%20corporations%20and%20publicly%20traded%20corporations">closely held</a> for-profit <a href="corporations">corporations</a> to be exempt from a law its owners religiously object to if there is a less restrictive means of furthering the law's interest. It is the first time that the court has recognized a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief, but it is limited to "closely held" corporations. The decision is an interpretation of the <a href="Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a> (RFRA) and does not address whether such corporations are protected by the <a href="free%20exercise%20clause">free-exercise of religion clause</a> of the First Amendment of the Constitution. For such companies, the Court's majority directly struck down the <a href="contraceptive%20mandate">contraceptive mandate</a> under the <a href="Affordable%20Care%20Act">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA) by a 5–4 vote. The court said that the mandate was not the least restrictive way to ensure access to contraceptive care, noting that a less restrictive alternative was being provided for religious non-profits, until the Court issued an injunction 3 days later, effectively ending said alternative, replacing it with a government-sponsored alternative for any female employees of closely held corporations that do not wish to provide <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a>.

"<a href="Zubik%20v.%20Burwell">Zubik v. Burwell</a>" was a case before the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> on whether <a href="religious%20institutions">religious institutions</a> other than churches should be exempt from the <a href="contraceptive%20mandate">contraceptive mandate</a>. Churches were already exempt. On May 16, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a <a href="per%20curiam">per curiam</a> ruling in "<a href="Zubik%20v.%20Burwell">Zubik v. Burwell</a>" that vacated the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and remanded the case "to the respective United States Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits" for reconsideration in light of the "positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs". Because the Petitioners agreed that "their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'", the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to "resolve any outstanding issues". The Supreme Court expressed "no view on the merits of the cases." In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomeyer, joined by Justice Ginsburg noted that in earlier cases "some lower courts have ignored those instructions" and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case.

In 2017, the Trump administration issued a ruling letting insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their "religious beliefs" or "moral convictions". However, later that same year federal judge <a href="Wendy%20Beetlestone">Wendy Beetlestone</a> issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of the Trump administration ruling.

Melville Island (Nova Scotia)

Melville Island is a small <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a> in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, Canada, located in the <a href="Northwest%20Arm">Northwest Arm</a> of <a href="Halifax%20Harbour">Halifax Harbour</a>, west of <a href="Deadman%27s%20Island%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29">Deadman's Island</a>. It is part of the <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax Regional Municipality</a>. The land is rocky, with thin, acidic soil, but supports a limited woodland habitat.

The site was discovered by Europeans in the 17th century, though it was likely earlier explored by <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">aboriginals</a>. It was initially used for storehouses before being purchased by the British, who built a prisoner-of-war camp to hold captives from the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> and later the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. The burial ground for prisoners was on the adjacent Deadman's Island.

Later, Melville Island was used as a receiving depot for <a href="Black%20Refugee%20%28War%20of%201812%29">black refugees</a> escaping slavery in the United States, then as a <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> hospital for immigrants arriving from Europe (particularly Ireland). It briefly served as a recruitment centre for the British Foreign Legion during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, and was then sold to the British for use as a military prison. In 1907 the land was granted to the Canadian government, which used it to detain German and Austro-Hungarian nationals during the First World War. During the Second World War, prisoners were sent to <a href="McNabs%20Island">McNabs Island</a> instead, and ammunition depots were kept on Melville Island.

The peninsula now houses the clubhouse and marina of the <a href="Armdale%20Yacht%20Club">Armdale Yacht Club</a>. Melville Island has been the subject of a number of cultural works, most of which concern its use as a prison.

Melville Island is part of the <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax Regional Municipality</a>, on the southeast coast of Nova Scotia. The peninsula lies on the eastern boundary of <a href="Melville%20Cove%2C%20Halifax">Melville Cove</a> in the Northwest Arm, an inlet between the <a href="Halifax%20Peninsula">Halifax Peninsula</a> and <a href="Mainland%20Halifax">Mainland Halifax</a>. It has a total area of approximately . Melville Island is west of <a href="Deadman%27s%20Island%20%28Nova%20Scotia%29">Deadman's Island</a>, and southeast of Regatta Point. The peninsula lies on a <a href="fracture%20zone">fracture zone</a> trending northwest–southeast, and is located at the border between the Halifax Slate Formation and a granite-based formation. There is evidence of <a href="glacier">glacial</a> <a href="abrasion%20%28geology%29">scouring</a> in the area. The surrounding seabed ranges from gravel to muddy gravel, and the shore is rocky.

The water surrounding Melville Island is salty and ranges from in summer to partially or completely frozen in winter. The water is polluted by sewage discharges from Halifax and is considered heavily contaminated. Water colour ranges from olive brown to greenish black, with little current. The water depth around Melville Island is .

The peninsula features thin and <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soil</a>, and hosts plants like <a href="witherod">witherod</a>, <a href="Amelanchier%20canadensis">Indian pear</a>, <a href="Labrador%20tea">Labrador tea</a>, <a href="wintergreen">wintergreen</a>, and <a href="blueberry">blueberry</a> shrubs. It is a woodland area, with <a href="birch">birch</a>, <a href="tamarack">tamarack</a>, <a href="maple">maple</a>, <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="beech">beech</a>, and <a href="Eastern%20White%20Pine">white pine</a> trees. Given the development of the land by the Armdale Yacht Club, plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits; most of the peninsula was paved in 1971. Fish caught from Melville Island include cod and mackerel. Local birds include <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, <a href="loon">loon</a>s, and <a href="alcid">alcid</a>s.

There is no <a href="Weather%20station">weather monitoring station</a> on Melville Island (the closest is the Halifax dockyards); however, as with most of the surrounding area, Melville has a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> heavily influenced by the water temperature in Halifax Harbour. Average air temperatures range from in January to in August. It receives about of precipitation per year, and may receive snow from October through April. Though the area is fairly sheltered, it is subject to damage from <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>s and other storms, notably <a href="Hurricane%20Juan">Hurricane Juan</a> in 2003.

Though the Halifax area was settled by <a href="aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">aboriginals</a>, particularly the <a href="Mi%27kmaq%20people">Mi'kmaq people</a>, as early as 7000 BC, there is no archaeological evidence of native habitation on Melville Island prior to the arrival of the Europeans. The first Europeans to reach the land were likely <a href="French%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">French</a> traders and missionaries in the 17th century. Halifax was founded by the British in 1749. The first documented use of Melville Island was by Robert Cowie and John Aubony, who obtained a <a href="Royal%20charter">Crown grant</a> in 1752 to allow them to build a storehouse. After Cowie's death in 1781, John Butler Kelly purchased what was then known as Cowie's Island and quickly resold it in 1784 to James Kavanagh, the head of a prosperous family fishery, for <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>65. Kavanagh used the land, known as Kavanagh's Island according to the then-prevalent tradition of place naming, to dry and store fish that he would then sell from his Halifax store.

After the 1793 beheading of <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> sparked a war between Britain and France (see the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>), Nova Scotia Governor <a href="John%20Wentworth%20%28governor%29">John Wentworth</a> rented Kavanagh's Island to house 600 French prisoners that had been captured on <a href="St.%20Pierre%20and%20Miquelon">St. Pierre and Miquelon</a>. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General <a href="James%20Ogilvie%20%28colonial%20administrator%29">James Ogilvie</a>, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able to escape from the makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a> in June 1794.

In August 1794, a French ship captured in <a href="Saint-Domingue">St. Domingo</a> arrived in Halifax. A plan to house these prisoners in Halifax met with opposition from the citizenry because of a fear of "fever"; indeed, surgeon John Halliburton suggested that if the plan was carried out, "the popular would burn down [the housing] with the sick prisoners inside". Halliburton rented Kavanagh's Island, likely on the suggestion of <a href="John%20Wentworth%20%28governor%29">Governor John Wentworth</a>, and by June 1795 had sent 70 sick and wounded prisoners to its makeshift prison hospital. The other prisoners were kept on the prison ship "La Felix". Sixteen soldiers of the <a href="Royal%20Nova%20Scotia%20Regiment">Royal Nova Scotia Regiment</a> acted as guards for the hospital beginning in 1796. Because of overcrowding aboard "La Felix", some of its prisoners were allowed to live in Halifax, where some created such a disturbance that they were sent to Kavanagh's Island to be imprisoned. In 1801, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amiens">Treaty of Amiens</a> resulted in most of the prisoners being returned to France, and the site was abandoned.

The site was formally leased for prisoner housing in 1803 after fifteen French fishermen, three surgeons, and 188 seamen were brought to Halifax as prisoners during the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Though many of these prisoners were later sent to England or Bermuda, one of the surgeons (Antoine Noel) was hired to care for the prisoners, while at least sixteen other prisoners were able to escape. Melville was purchased for £1000 in 1804 (£68,634 as of 2010) by Robert Murray, appointed by the <a href="Admiralty">British Admiralty</a> as prison agent; he was replaced shortly thereafter by John MacKellar. At the time, the facility had a maximum capacity of 200 prisoners. The makeshift prison was noted for discipline problems.

The land was officially renamed Melville Island in late 1804 or early 1805 in honour of <a href="Henry%20Dundas%2C%20Viscount%20Melville">Henry Dundas, Viscount Melville</a> (who at the time had just been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty). A wooden barracks-style military prison was constructed to house common prisoners, the cornerstone of which was laid in 1808 and is today preserved as a monument, while a multi-storey building was designed to hold officers. As no exchange system was established with the French, the prison quickly became overcrowded. Some Spanish prisoners were also housed in the prison at this time.

Upon their arrival on Melville, prisoners had their name and other details recorded in an entry book. Inmates were given yellow clothing that clearly identified them as prisoners of war, and were supplied with provisions of beef, bread, potatoes and salt from a local contractor "reputed to own most of the livestock in the region". Some officers were allowed to send trade goods to Halifax, or even work in the city as domestic servants or handymen. There were also prisoner-run shops and a "small town fair" on Melville Island, frequented by British officers and residents of Halifax. Other prisoner pursuits included prison lotteries, model shipbuilding, beer-brewing, fishing, and making molasses candy. Some prisoners were known to have pets or keep chickens.

In late 1805, a group of officers broke parole and escaped; this led the garrison captain to restrict the purchase of prisoner-made goods as a means of punishment and enforcing discipline. More serious punishments included flogging or being confined to a barred hole in the prison cellar, known as the "Black Hole", with only bread and water. One of the prisoners, Pierre Poulin, stabbed another to death in April 1805, and was tried and hanged for murder in Halifax. The prisoners also maintained their own Grand Council ("Grand Conseil") with which to impose discipline, though with a different focus than the British: anyone who disclosed a planned escape attempt to the guards was subject to being stoned to death (though historian Brian Cuthbertson disputes the likelihood of this claim). Escapes and attempts were frequent, and attempted escapees were regarded "with high esteem" by the other prisoners. Before 1812, approximately 130 prisoners, including 25 officers, escaped, of whom only 11 were recaptured despite advertised rewards in local newspapers. Many others were either sent to prisons in England or the West Indies, or were released after pledging allegiance to the British Crown. Approximately 1535 French prisoners were incarcerated at Melville between 1803 and 1813, and an unknown number were held during Napoleon's <a href="Hundred%20Days">Hundred Days</a>. Sixty-six Frenchmen are known to have died in the prison, ten of whom were prisoners from the Hundred Days. Nine Spanish prisoners also died during this period.

The <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> brought an influx of American prisoners to Melville Island; up to 1800 at a time were housed in its barracks or on a nearby 350-person prison ship "Magnet". Most of the French prisoners were released or paroled to make room for the Americans, who were seen as more of a risk. David Stickney was the first recorded American prisoner, arriving on 4 July 1812. Early in the war, many Americans were exchanged for British prisoners in Boston or <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>, in an arrangement known as a "cartel"; 1981 of the captives taken before October 1812 were thus exchanged, while another seventeen, accused of killing a Canadian farmer and raping his wife, were sent to England and imprisoned. African-American captives were never considered for exchange, and were instead commonly released under the <a href="Slave%20Trade%20Act%201807">1807 Abolition Act</a>.

By the end of 1812, maps of the peninsula showed a marked increase in buildings: a two-story common prison, a small hospital, officers' quarters, a gunner's house, a turnkey store, fuel sheds, the agent's office and guard house, a bell house, nine sentry boxes, and four oceanside outhouses. Despite this, the facility was severely overcrowded, a problem compounded by attempts at segregating the remaining French prisoners and the few African-Americans from the majority white American population. 2078 prisoners were recorded by the end of 1812, including 1412 privateers and 572 merchant seamen. More than 3000 arrived over the next two years, including nearly 1000 soldiers captured in the <a href="Niagara%20Peninsula">Niagara</a> area.

Accounts of prison life vary: Cuthbertson says that the prisoners were "reportedly well treated" but prisoner complaints suggested they were "wretched indeed". Because of the crowded conditions, "the authorities did everything they could to keep the prisoners quiet," including lying to them. Captured <a href="privateers">privateers</a> were sent to England in large numbers "to harass and distress that description of prisoners". All letters sent to and by prisoners were read. Residents of the Melville prison barracks were lice-infested and slept in tier-hung hammocks (first three, and later four tiers), and their activities were more restricted than those of earlier French prisoners. A strict cleaning regimen was observed in an attempt to promote sanitary conditions, and prisoners could be sent to solitary confinement for uncleanliness. Rations were considered "robust": prisoners were given each of bread and beef and a <a href="gill%20%28unit%29">gill</a> (0.1421 litres) of peas daily.

In October 1812, John Mitchell was appointed as an "American agent" to oversee the treatment of the American prisoners at Melville and to arrange prisoner exchanges. He gave the Americans coffee, sugar, potatoes, tobacco, newspapers, and soap, and also provided money for other purchases. Mitchell was responsible for buying clothing, but lacked the funds to meet demand: in late 1813, almost 1000 of the prisoners were shoeless, and many more had no jackets. Staff at the prison hospital attributed a tuberculosis outbreak to "want of comfortable clothing". Though Mitchell visited Melville Island regularly, he was primarily concerned with speaking to the officers, not the common prisoners. Mitchell was removed in October 1814 in retaliation for the treatment of the British prisoner agent, Thomas Barclay, by the United States government.

Despite the conditions in the prison, the Americans continued the French tradition of establishing shops within the prison. Goods sold included cigars and smuggled rum. Gambling was a popular pastime, particularly <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> and other dice games, as well as dancing, singing, and storytelling. One prisoner was able to counterfeit Spanish coins, which found their way into the Halifax economy. On Sundays, church services were conducted and visitors were allowed, though many visiting Haligonians were <a href="United%20Empire%20Loyalists">United Empire Loyalists</a> who came "to gratify their eyes ... with sight of what they called 'rebels' ".

The 320 American survivors of the <a href="Capture%20of%20USS%20Chesapeake">capture of USS "Chesapeake"</a> in 1813 were interned on Melville Island and their ship, renamed <a href="USS%20Chesapeake%20%281799%29">HMS "Chesapeake"</a>, was used to ferry prisoners from Melville to England's <a href="Dartmoor%20%28HM%20Prison%29">Dartmoor Prison</a>. Many officers were paroled to Halifax, but some began a riot at a performance of a patriotic song about "Chesapeake"s defeat. Parole restrictions were tightened: beginning in 1814, paroled officers were required to attend a monthly muster on Melville Island, and those who violated their parole were confined to the prison. After foiled escape plots in 1813 and 1814, fears of a mass escape led to increased security and a 600-prisoner transport to England. Around this time, Lieutenant William Miller, who had been in charge of the prisoners, was replaced by Captain J. Crochet; Miller had been noted for his rudeness, including one occasion when he told the prisoners to "die and be damned, as there is one hundred and fifty acres of land to bury you in, God damn you." He had also been accused of cruelty by American newspapers, though some prisoners defended him and the veracity of the media claims is questionable.

By the decommissioning, over 10,000 French, Spanish and American prisoners had been held at the prison. The majority were Americans: there were 8,148 recorded US prisoners, 3,542 of whom were privateers from the 92 such ships brought to Halifax.

Of the American prisoners held on Melville Island during the war, 195 died, mostly from fevers and pneumonia – a death rate of two per cent. Prisoners at Melville Island had a lower death rate than most British soldiers serving at frontier posts in North American and the prison's conditions were better than many those endured by British prisoners in POW camps in the United States. Most of the French and American dead were buried on nearby Deadman's Island. James Brooke suggests a burial rate of one per week. The war ended in December 1814, but news of this did not reach Melville until March 1815, during which time about fifty prisoners died. The prisoners were released to "quit Halifax at their own expense", though some were able to find berths on trade ships. All but 120 had left by mid-April; most of those remaining were hospital patients, who were sent to the Naval Hospital in Halifax in early May. Melville Island was decommissioned in May 1815, and its goods, including 1,170 hammocks, were sold at auction in Halifax.

After the decommissioning of the military prison, Melville Island was used as a receiving depot for some of the <a href="Black%20Refugee%20%28War%20of%201812%29">black refugees</a>, the estimated 1600–2000 escaped slaves who arrived in Halifax between 1815 and 1818. In April 1815, seventy-six refugees were moved to Melville from the Halifax Poor House, many ill with smallpox. The refugees were given blankets, "colourful" clothing (often the uniforms of captured or demobilized soldiers), and children's shoes. Rations included pork or beef, potatoes, rice, cornmeal, molasses, <a href="spruce%20beer">spruce beer</a> (to prevent <a href="scurvy">scurvy</a>), and sometimes coffee. To discourage men from leaving their families at the depot as they worked in Halifax, rations were only given to heads of families. Thomas Jeffery was granted a salary of £1500 (£86,655 as of 2010) for administering the depot. Eighty-two refugees died during the smallpox outbreak, and 500 were vaccinated to prevent the further spread of the disease. An increasing number passed through Melville Island on their way to Canadian settlements: between 727 and 798 are recorded from April to July 1815. Most of these found work in Halifax or moved to land grants, but some returned the following winter "when in distress". At least 107 of these refugees died on Melville Island. The province's lieutenant-governor ordered that the refugees be moved to Preston or Halifax in May 1816, and put the land up for lease to "a person of unexceptionable character", but no lease is recorded during this period. The hospital was officially closed in June 1816.

Beginning in 1818, Melville Island was used as a quarantine hospital for ill immigrants arriving in Nova Scotia. The hospital was operational for short periods in 1818, 1831, and 1846. By 1829, ten buildings were left on Melville Island, all "in a state of neglect and decay". In 1831, three doctors (<a href="Matthias%20Hoffman">Matthias Hoffman</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Head">Samuel Head</a> and John Stirling) were paid £30 each (£2125 as of 2010) to care for patients at the quarantine hospital; a nurse later arrived as Matron, bringing with her two teenaged children. In 1847, over 1200 Irish immigrants fleeing the <a href="Irish%20Potato%20Famine">Irish Potato Famine</a> were ordered quarantined on Melville Island by the Board of Health; of these, 203 were held in the "fever hospital", and 30 died. Typhus victims were also held at Melville, during which time the medical staff were not allowed to leave for fear of spreading the infection.

Diseases encountered among the immigrants included smallpox, typhus, and <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>. There were 37 recorded deaths.

In 1855, Nova Scotia politician <a href="Joseph%20Howe">Joseph Howe</a> developed a plan to use Melville Island as a recruitment and training centre for American soldiers to fight for the British in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. US neutrality laws prevented Americans from participating in overseas wars, so recruiters sent to the US advertised for men to work on the Nova Scotia Railway, and faced arrest if their true purpose was discovered. Upon arrival in Halifax, the men were sent to Melville Island for enlistment and basic training. The first group of 66 men arrived on 6 April 1855, but all refused to join the British Foreign Legion. However, by the end of May there were 71 newly recruited soldiers on the peninsula, and up to 158 total had enlisted. American discontent with the project forced its abandonment in June; the Melville Island depot closed, and the recruits were sent first to Halifax and then to England. Overall the recruitment project enlisted between 500 and 700 men, mostly German and Irish nationals.

After the recruitment project ended, the Admiralty sold the land to the British army for £2800 (£204,081 as of 2010) for use as a military prison. The first 70 prisoners arrived in 1856. At this time, flogging was gradually being phased out as a punishment for military members, who were instead imprisoned under the <a href="Mutiny%20Act%20of%201844">Mutiny Act of 1844</a>; the purchase of Melville Island allowed these prisoners to be removed from the overcrowded Halifax Citadel. A 22-man military guard supervised the prisoners, who were subjected to hard labour: the chief warder imported of granite from Purcell's Cove for them to break. Punishments included solitary confinement or "shot drill", where an inmate was made to carry cannonballs from one end of the yard to the other. A new 34-cell prison building was constructed in 1884 to alleviate overcrowding. There were some escape attempts during this period, the most violent of which involved the stone hammers used to break stone being repurposed as projectiles and weapons.

British officers from the Halifax garrison conducted inspections of the prison four times per year, and maintenance was carried out either by the prisoners themselves or by soldiers from the Halifax garrison. The prison also housed a schoolroom and chapel, both staffed by army personnel. A new stone prison was built before 1905 next to the older wooden barracks, as well as housing for warders and their families. The new building alleviated reported problems with lack of lighting and ventilation in the previous structure. In December of that year, the Canadian Permanent Force took over wardenship of the prison, at which time there were three remaining prisoners. The land was granted to the Canadian Government as the British left Nova Scotia in 1907. The name was changed in 1909 from "military prison" to "detention barracks", reflecting a shift in attitude towards incarcerated military personnel: inmates were known as detainees, not prisoners, and after their discharge from the military they maintained no permanent criminal record.

When the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> began in 1914, Canadian police were given the ability to detain German and Austro-Hungarian nationals, and incarcerate any who refused to agree not to support their homelands in the war. In September, the Spanish ship "Monserrat" carrying a large number (about 80) of men en route to Germany to report for military service was intercepted by , which brought the ship to Halifax Harbour. Once there, the Germans aboard were taken to Melville Island with a garrison guard, interrogated, and imprisoned under the supervision of the detention barracks staff. Over the next several months, more German nationals were brought to Melville, detained either by British ships or by Canadian police forces. Escape attempts began in October, and a procedure to count prisoners twice daily was instituted in an attempt to prevent them. The anglophone guards often could not communicate with the prisoners or even pronounce their names, resorting to nicknames and complicating efforts in prisoner management. Repairs were made to the prison buildings after several inmates escaped by sawing a hole through the floor of the wooden barracks.

Initially there was no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; censorship arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk and the number of inmates per institution. After the 1917 <a href="Halifax%20Explosion">Halifax Explosion</a>, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man <a href="Amherst%20Internment%20Camp">Amherst Internment Camp</a> at <a href="Amherst%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Amherst, Nova Scotia</a>. One of the prisoners transferred may have been <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>, although this is disputed.

On 10 April 1935, a fire completely destroyed the old wooden prison barracks, so when the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> began in 1939, the remaining prisoners and guards were sent to <a href="McNab%27s%20Island">McNab's Island</a>. Melville Island was used first to confine deserters from the army, then from 1941 as a temporary storage facility for Canadian Army ammunition depots. When <a href="VE%20Day">VE Day</a> caused <a href="Halifax%20Riot">riots in downtown Halifax</a>, there were rumours of a plan to break into the depots and deploy hand grenades; a trooper squad was sent to guard against this possibility, but no "invasion" occurred.

After the end of the Second World War, military activities on Melville ended; the land was initially awarded to the Naval Sailors Association, a decision that prompted some disagreement among members of Parliament. Haligonians pushed for the area to be repurposed for recreation, partially due to anxieties about its use as a storage facility for potentially toxic chemicals. In 1947, the Canadian Army leased Melville Island to the <a href="Armdale%20Yacht%20Club">Armdale Yacht Club</a> for <a href="C%24">C$</a>1 per year. The club demolished some of the buildings, renovated and expanded others, widened the road, and filled in a new embankment for boating. Further renovations were done in 1952 and the 1960s, adding verandahs to the two clubhouses (one of which dates to 1808 and was used as a warden's house) and remodelling their interiors. Though the club's lease was initially year-to-year, in 1956 it began a 99-year lease from the <a href="Department%20of%20National%20Defence%20%28Canada%29">Department of National Defence</a>. The club dredged Melville Cove, added a "<a href="marine%20railway">marine railway</a>", and created a large marina, at which dozens of boats are now docked.

During certain periods, Melville Island was a social destination for Halifax residents. Haligonians visited the "town fair" run by French inmates during the Napoleonic period. The peninsula was called a "great resort of the ladies of Halifax" by an 1855 newspaper. However, from the beginning of the First World War to 1947, visitors to Melville were restricted. Though it was re-opened with the arrival of the Armdale Yacht Club, the area's history was largely forgotten until the 2000 establishment of <a href="Deadman%27s%20Island%20Park">Deadman's Island Park</a> on the adjacent peninsula. Since then, the site has become a tourist attraction, though its historicity is limited by the land's current use as a marina. A model made from beef and pork bones by French prisoners and a cell key to Melville Island are preserved at the <a href="Maritime%20Museum%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Maritime Museum of the Atlantic</a> in Halifax.

The peninsula has also been the subject of artistic and literary treatments. A number of writings by Melville prisoners have been preserved, including a diary by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Lambert%20Bourneuf">François-Lambert Bourneuf</a> and an account credited to <a href="Benjamin%20Waterhouse">Benjamin Waterhouse</a> (though historians are unsure of its true authorship). Politician Joseph Howe wrote a poem describing its use as a military prison (<a href="http%3A//www.canadianpoetry.ca/longpoems/howe_poems_and_essays/melville_island.htm">See Poem</a>). The site's history has been the subject of a book by Brian Cuthbertson, and another by Iris Shea and Heather Watts. The prison is the subject of a painting held by the UK <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> and a Nova Scotian folk song, among other cultural works.

Janardhan Maharshi and <a href="Crazy%20Mohan">Crazy Mohan</a> wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively.

The narrative of "Eega" is in the form of a <a href="bedtime%20story">bedtime story</a> told by a father to his daughter. Its protagonist is Nani, who is in love with his neighbour Bindu. Nani is murdered by a wealthy businessman named Sudeep, who is attracted to Bindu and considers Nani a rival. Nani <a href="reincarnation">reincarnates</a> as a <a href="housefly">housefly</a> and tries to protect Bindu while avenging his death.

The idea for the film originated in the 1990s from a conversation in which Prasad joked with Rajamouli about the idea of a fly seeking revenge against a human. Rajamouli reconsidered the idea after finishing "<a href="Maryada%20Ramanna">Maryada Ramanna</a>" (2010), and Prasad developed it into a script. The film's production began on 7 December 2010 at <a href="Ramanaidu%20Studios">Ramanaidu Studios</a> in <a href="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>. <a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began on 22 February 2011 and continued until late February 2012. <a href="Makuta%20VFX">Makuta VFX</a> and <a href="Annapurna%20Studios">Annapurna Studios</a> oversaw "Eega" visual effects and <a href="digital%20intermediate">digital intermediate</a> process, respectively.

The two versions of the film, alongside a <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a>-dubbed version titled Eecha, were released on 6 July 2012 in approximately 1,100 screens globally. The performances of the principal cast, Rajamouli's direction, and visual effects received critical acclaim upon release. "Eega" was one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of the year, earning more than 1.25 billion (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> million). Its <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>-dubbed version, Makkhi, which was released on 12 October 2012, had not achieved equivalent commercial success as of June 2015. "Eega" won two <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Awards</a> (<a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Telugu">Best Feature Film in Telugu</a> and <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Effects">Best Special Effects</a>), five <a href="Filmfare%20Awards%20South">South Filmfare Awards</a> including <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20%E2%80%93%20Telugu">Best Telugu Film</a>, <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director%20%E2%80%93%20Telugu">Best Telugu Director</a>, <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Telugu">Best Telugu Actress</a> (Samantha) and <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Telugu">Best Telugu Supporting Actor</a> (Sudeep) and three <a href="South%20Indian%20International%20Movie%20Awards">South Indian International Movie Awards</a>. It was screened at the <a href="Toronto%20After%20Dark%20Film%20Festival%232013">Toronto After Dark Film Festival</a>, the <a href="2013%20Shanghai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Shanghai International Film Festival</a>, and the Madrid International Film Festival.

A young girl who is unable to sleep asks her father to tell her a bedtime story. Although reluctant at first, he tells her a story of a fly named Nani.

Nani is a young man who specialises in preparing fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a <a href="miniature%20art">micro artist</a> who runs Project 511, a <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organisation</a> (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is the last thing Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.

The fly's memory is triggered when it encounters Sudeep and Bindu. Sudeep asks the heartbroken Bindu to accompany him to <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> to meet the education minister; if she can impress the minister with a presentation about the NGO, he might help it gain national recognition. The fly causes Sudeep to have an accident on his way to the airport and writes "I will kill you" on the windshield; this makes Sudeep <a href="paranoia">paranoid</a>. The fly, who sees Bindu mourning Nani's death in her bedroom, reveals itself to be Nani by writing on the desk with her tears. It conveys the circumstances of Nani's death to Bindu, and they join forces against Sudeep. The latter's obsession with the fly affects his professional and personal life. In a chain of events, his money is burnt to ashes, leaving him almost penniless.

Sudeep learns from a sorcerer that Nani is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge. Sudeep arranges to kill Nani but the fly escapes and causes a <a href="short%20circuit">short circuit</a>, killing the sorcerer and leaving Sudeep unconscious. Nani and Bindu assume Sudeep is dead but he is saved by his business partner. Sudeep is enraged when he learns that Bindu is helping the fly. Sudeep kills his partner to collect a 7 billion (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> million) insurance policy.

Sudeep takes Bindu to his home and Nani follows them. Nani seriously injures Sudeep with a needle. The latter clips Nani's wing and fatally stabs him with the same needle. Nani jumps through the flame of a burning match then into a loaded cannon, which fires. The projectile passes through Sudeep and hits an oxygen cylinder, which explodes and kills him. Bindu takes the fly's wing and makes an <a href="amulet">amulet</a> with it. One day when travelling to work, an <a href="Eve%20teasing">eve teaser</a> bothers her; Nani, again reborn as a fly, attacks him with a needle before announcing his return.

The young girl is impressed with the story of the fly her father narrates.


The idea for "Eega" originated in the late 1990s in screenwriter <a href="K.%20V.%20Vijayendra%20Prasad">K. V. Vijayendra Prasad</a> mind. At that time, he was joking about a housefly seeking revenge on a human in a conversation with his son <a href="S.%20S.%20Rajamouli">S. S. Rajamouli</a>. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an <a href="African%20Americans">African-American</a> boy dies in an attempt to free his family from <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing "<a href="Maryada%20Ramanna">Maryada Ramanna</a>" (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct from any other. He decided to make "Eega" a bilingual film in <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> – each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled "Naan Ee", was Rajamouli's directorial debut in <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil cinema</a>. The film was presented by <a href="Daggubati%20Suresh%20Babu">Daggubati Suresh Babu</a> of <a href="Suresh%20Productions">Suresh Productions</a>.

For the first time in his career, Rajamouli began casting after the script was completed because he felt the story required actors who were suitable for the roles. <a href="Nani%20%28actor%29">Nani</a>, the protagonist, was the first of the three of the main cast members to be chosen; he completed filming his scenes in 25 days. <a href="Samantha%20Akkineni">Samantha Ruth Prabhu</a>, the second actor cast, was signed as the female lead. Rajamouli chose <a href="Sudeep">Sudeep</a> to play the fly's human adversary after being impressed with the actor's performance in "<a href="Rann%20%28film%29">Rann</a>" (2010), and cast rapper <a href="Noel%20Sean">Noel Sean</a> as Nani's friend in the film. Sudeep drew inspiration for his role as the villain from the 1983 Kannada film "<a href="Bhakta%20Prahlada%20%281983%20film%29">Bhakta Prahlada</a>"; he was portraying a character he considered to be a "bad guy" with "grey shades" rather than an antagonist.

The script was <a href="script%20doctor">doctored</a> by Rajamouli's brother, S. S. Kanchi, while Janardhan Maharshi and <a href="Crazy%20Mohan">Crazy Mohan</a> wrote the dialogue for the Telugu and Tamil versions respectively, marking their first collaboration with Rajamouli. James Fowlds was initially chosen as the film's director of photography, but was replaced by <a href="K.%20K.%20Senthil%20Kumar">K. K. Senthil Kumar</a> due to creative differences and scheduling conflicts. <a href="M.%20M.%20Keeravani">M. M. Keeravani</a> composed the film's soundtrack and score, <a href="Kotagiri%20Venkateswara%20Rao">Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao</a> edited the film, Ravinder Reddy was its art director, and Rajamouli's wife Rama worked on the costume design.

Production of the film began with a formal launch ceremony on 7 December 2010 in <a href="Hyderabad">Hyderabad</a>. The original version was filmed over a six-month period and cost nearly 110 million; Rajamouli felt the quality of the material was poor and started again. The film's final budget was estimated at between 260 and 400 million.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began on 22 February 2011 in Hyderabad; ninety percent of the film was shot at <a href="Ramanaidu%20Studios">Ramanaidu Studios</a> in the city. A sequence was filmed at Sri Sita Ramachandra Swamy Temple in Ammapally near <a href="Shamshabad">Shamshabad</a>, in early March 2011. Scenes with Nani, Samantha, and Sudeep were filmed during the first shooting schedule, which was completed on 16 March. Shooting was disrupted in April by an ongoing labour dispute between film workers and producers. Rajamouli considered moving "Eega" out of Hyderabad if the strike continued. Filming continued in <a href="Kokapet">Kokapet</a> in early September 2011, and principal photography was completed in late February 2012 as <a href="post-production">post-production</a> began.

According to Rajamouli, the film unit consulted a 3D video of the <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> before shooting a scene each day. After the filming of each scene was completed, the editing and re-recording procedures were done with simple <a href="greyscale">greyscale</a> animation. An <a href="Arri%20Alexa">Arri Alexa</a> camera, a <a href="prime%20lens">prime lens</a>, and Scorpio and Strada cranes were used for the principal photography, while a probe lens and high-intensity lighting were used for the <a href="macro%20photography">macro photography</a>. Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used <a href="GoPro">GoPro</a> cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. <a href="Phantom%20Cam">Phantom Cam</a> was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.

<a href="Digital%20intermediate">Digital intermediate</a> (DI) was conducted at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad. A high-end DI system was imported and the process took six months to complete. Singer <a href="Chinmayi">Chinmayi</a>, who dubbed for Samantha in "Eega", found the process difficult because the footage did not contain the animated fly. Rajamouli approached <a href="Anuj%20Gurwara">Anuj Gurwara</a> to write the dialogue for the Hindi-dubbed version titled "Makkhi". The Hindi dubbing began in Hyderabad, and Gurwara dubbed for Nani in the film. <a href="Ajay%20Devgan">Ajay Devgan</a> and his wife <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a>, acting as parents telling the film's story to their child at bedtime, provided voiceovers during the opening credits of "Makkhi". The visuals accompanying the closing credits were altered to show the fly mimicking the antics of Devgan, <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a>, and <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>.

R. C. Kamalakannan and Pete Draper of <a href="Makuta%20VFX">Makuta VFX</a> oversaw "Eega" visual effects, and Rahul Venugopal was the film's set supervisor and <a href="matte%20painting">matte painter</a>. <a href="V.%20Srinivas%20Mohan">V. Srinivas Mohan</a>, who later collaborated with Rajamouli on "", worked on a short sequence for the film. Rajamouli planned to complete work on the fly imagery in four months, but it took fourteen.

Ninety percent of the animation-related work was done in Hyderabad; the remaining ten percent was completed in the United States. In an <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo-Asian News Service</a> interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design the fly. Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he used the 1986 <a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> American short film "<a href="Luxo%20Jr.">Luxo Jr.</a>" for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face to make it look appealing onscreen. A new team including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three riggers and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. The fly was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and the fly much more difficult to execute because the latter had to express emotions only though its slender arms rather than its face.

Some of the special effects could not be designed in India, so Makuta VFX engaged animation consultants in Armenia, China, Iran, Israel, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The company's 30-member team underwent a training programme on acting theory and insect formats. "Eega" is the first Indian film to use <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> for nearly 90 minutes of its length; the film had 2,234 <a href="Live-action%20animated%20film">live-action animation</a> shots. By mid-June 2012 Rajamouli had approved 1,970 shots; the final version was shown to the film unit after the approval of 226 pending shots. The visual effects cost an estimated 70 million.

The film's main theme is revenge; the soul of a murdered man is reincarnated as a fly and seeks revenge against his killer. Rajamouli identified some similarities to <a href="David%20Cronenberg">David Cronenberg</a> "<a href="The%20Fly%20%281986%20film%29">The Fly</a>" (1986), in which a scientist becomes a fly when his experiment malfunctions, and thought of "Eega" as a "<a href="fantasy%20film">socio-fantasy</a>" rather than a <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a>. At a meeting with students at the Annapurna International School of Film and Media Campus (AIFSM), he compared the battle between the fly and Sudeep, which the underdog fly wins, to <a href="David">David</a> triumph over <a href="Goliath">Goliath</a> and India's victory in the <a href="1983%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">1983 Cricket World Cup</a>. Crazy Mohan compared the film with "<a href="Apoorva%20Sagodharargal%20%281989%20film%29">Apoorva Sagodharargal</a>" (1989), a revenge drama whose protagonist Appu (<a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>) is a <a href="dwarfism">dwarf</a>.

Mohan told Malathi Rangarajan of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" that although the film's script may resemble those of "<a href="Stuart%20Little%20%28film%29">Stuart Little</a>" (1999) and "<a href="Shrek">Shrek</a>" (2001), the use of the plight of someone tormented by a housefly was an original idea. According to Tamil film historian and actor <a href="Mohan%20Raman">Mohan Raman</a>, "Naan Ee"unlike the animal-centred films "<a href="Nalla%20Neram">Nalla Neram</a>" (1972) and "<a href="Neeya%3F">Neeya?</a>" (1979)lacks a human protagonist. Film critic <a href="Baradwaj%20Rangan">Baradwaj Rangan</a> found "Eega" protagonist realistic, contrary to the ones in the animated films by <a href="the%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">the Walt Disney Company</a>, except when it displays a few <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> traits. "<a href="Mid%20Day">Mid Day</a>" compared "Eega" to "Cockroach" (2010), an Australian short film about a man who is reincarnated as a cockroach after he is accidentally killed on his wedding day.

The film's secondary theme is the survival of love beyond death. Rangan has likened "Eega" to a ghost film because a dead protagonist returns to his loved ones as a troubled soul. Malini Mannath of "<a href="The%20New%20Indian%20Express">The New Indian Express</a>" found the scene where the fly foils Sudeep's attempt to get close to Bindu reminiscent of one in the film "<a href="Ghost%20%281990%20film%29">Ghost</a>" (1990). <a href="Mayank%20Shekhar">Mayank Shekhar</a> criticised the relationship between the lead pair, which he said advocates stalking as an accepted form of romance. Malathi Rangarajan said the antagonist took the "extreme step" of murdering the hero early in the film, in contrast with the stereotypical antagonist whose lust for the female lead has just begun and threatens the hero.

Commenting on the usage of <a href="Tantra">Tantrism</a>, "The New Indian Express" Kruthi Grover found the death of the <a href="Magician%20%28paranormal%29">sorcerer</a> similar to the story of <a href="Bhasmasur">Bhasmasur</a>, a demon in Indian mythology to whom <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> gives the power to reduce a person to ashes by touching her or his head. When Bhasmasur tries to touch Shiva's head, <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> assumes the form of <a href="Mohini">Mohini</a> and makes Bhasmasur touch his own head, killing him. According to Malathi Rangarajan, the film's themes of Tantrism and black magic are reminiscent of the use of the occult as a plot device in films directed by <a href="B.%20Vittalacharya">B. Vittalacharya</a>.

The soundtracks of "Eega" and "Naan Ee", each consisting of five songsone of which is a remixed version of the film's title song—were composed by M. M. Keeravani. Keeravani said because the film's theme of revenge and the protagonist (a housefly) are universal concepts, his "only challenge" was ensuring the music did not have a "distinct ethnic or regional flavour" and "appeal". He incorporated the buzzing sound made by flies into the score and exaggerated or reduced it according to a scene's emotional nature. Rajamouli approached <a href="Madhan%20Karky">Madhan Karky</a> to write the lyrics for "Naan Ee" soundtrack after the release of "<a href="Enthiran">Enthiran</a>" (2010), explaining the importance of each song in the film's narrative. As well as providing detailed profiles of the characters, Rajamouli enacted a few scenes, which helped Karky write the lyrics.

"Eega" soundtrack was released on 30 March 2012 at a promotional event at Shanti Sarovar, <a href="Brahma%20Kumaris">Brahma Kumaris</a>' academy in <a href="Gachibowli">Gachibowli</a>, a suburb of Hyderabad. The soundtrack for "Naan Ee" was released on 1 April at another promotional event at <a href="SPI%20Cinemas">Sathyam Cinema</a> in Chennai. "Eega" soundtrack release on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> was delayed until 3 April to avoid piracy and illegal downloads.

Writing for "The Hindu", Sangeetha Devi Dundoo called the soundtrack "melodious ... sharply contrasted by the background score, which seamlessly moves from sober to playful to pulsating". Another critic for "The Hindu", S. R. Ashok Kumar praised <a href="Vijay%20Prakash">Vijay Prakash</a> rendition of "Konjam Konjam". Kumar appreciated the use of violins in "Eedaa Eedaa" and called "Lava Lava" "a good number". Karthik Pasupulate of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" wrote that Keeravani "just seems to reserve his best for [Rajamouli]", calling the soundtrack "one of his finest".

"Eega", with "Naan Ee" and "Eecha", was released on 6 July 2012 on approximately 1,100 screens. The <a href="Government%20of%20Tamil%20Nadu">Government of Tamil Nadu</a> levied <a href="entertainment%20tax">entertainment tax</a> on "Naan Ee" at the rate of 30%. "Eega" Hindi-dubbed version, titled "Makkhi", was released on 12 October 2012. The film was further dubbed into <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a> and <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a> as "Kungfu Housefly" and "Inzi", respectively; the latter was released with the slogan "Kisasi Cha Mwisho" ("Fly: the ultimate revenge"). "Inzi" was released in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and Republic of the Congo, making "Eega" the first Telugu film to be released in Africa.

Global distribution rights for the Telugu version were sold for 340 million, and <a href="PVP%20Cinema">PVP Cinema</a> acquired "Naan Ee" distribution rights for 50 million. Outside India, <a href="14%20Reels%20Entertainment">14 Reels Entertainment</a> distributed "Eega" and "Naan Ee" in association with Ficus, Inc. <a href="Reliance%20Entertainment">Reliance Entertainment</a> acquired "Makkhi" distribution rights.

Weeks after "Eega" release, its pirated version was released; it was illegally filmed in a theatre in <a href="Varadaiahpalem">Varadaiahpalem</a>, <a href="Chittoor%20district">Chittoor district</a>. A forensic <a href="watermark">watermark</a>ing investigation on the pirated copies determined that a camcorder was used in the process. The digital watermarking also helped investigators locate the source of the piracy of "Naan Ee" to a theatre in <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>.

According to Rajamouli, "Eega" was illegally downloaded 655,000 times within a week of the pirated version being leaked on the Internet. Rajamouli added that a database of IP addresses of non-resident Indians who frequently download content was shared with immigration authorities which could affect their potential <a href="Permanent%20residence%20%28United%20States%29">US residence permit</a> applications. The anti-piracy cell delinked more than 2,000 links to the pirated versions of "Naan Ee" on the Internet.

"Naan Ee" satellite television rights were sold to <a href="Sun%20TV%20%28India%29">Sun TV</a> for 33.5 million—a record price for a Telugu director's film, exceeding Rajamouli's initial expectations. "Makkhi" television-broadcast rights were sold to <a href="STAR%20Gold">STAR Gold</a> for 80 million. According to STAR Gold general manager Hemal Jhaveri, "Makkhi" television premiere had a <a href="target%20rating%20point">target rating point</a> rating of 3.5; trade analyst Sreedhar Pillai called its performance "phenomenal".

In November 2012, <a href="Aditya%20Music">Aditya Music</a> released "Eega" on <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> with English subtitles and <a href="DTS-HD%20Master%20Audio">DTS-HD MA 5.1</a> surround sound. The release also contained a two-hour DVD about the <a href="Making-of">making of</a> the film. J. Hurtado of <a href="Screen%20Anarchy">Twitch Film</a> reviewed the Blu-ray version, writing, "The most egregious mangling of the film comes in the form of a severely fucked contrast scale, which leads to absurdly crushed black levels rendering nearly all shadow detail completely obliterated". Hurtado called the audio a "thing of beauty, giving good separation and a booming low end that puts you in the middle of the "Eega" action in a way that even my theatrical experience couldn't do".

According to trade analyst <a href="Komal%20Nahta">Komal Nahta</a>, "Eega" netted 170 million in South India on its first day of release. On its opening weekend, it grossed US$538,996 from 31 screens in the United States—a per-screen average of $17,387. In ten days, "Naan Ee" grossed 130 million from 208 screens in Tamil Nadu. On its second weekend, "Eega" grossed $253,334 from 42 screens in the US, bringing its ten-day total in that country to $913,046. By then, "Naan Ee" had grossed a total of $14,259 in the United States. "Naan Ee" earned 180 million in three weeks at the Tamil Nadu box office—a record for a bilingual, Telugu-Tamil film. By early August 2012, the combined distributor share for the Telugu and Tamil versions was 570 million.

According to "<a href="Bangalore%20Mirror">Bangalore Mirror</a>", the film grossed 1.15 billion globally as of August 2012. Its final global gross is estimated at 1.25 to 1.3 billion. "Eega" grossed nearly $1.08 million in the United States; it was one of the country's highest-grossing Telugu films. It was declared the highest-grossing bilingual film in Tamil Nadu after it earned 246.6 million, with a distributor share of 85 million, in 50 days. The film broke the record held by "<a href="Arundhati%20%282009%20film%29">Arundhati</a>" (2009), whose Tamil-dubbed version earned a distributor share of 65 million.

Indo-Asian News Service stated that "Eega" was the highest-grossing Telugu film of 2012, but "Bangalore Mirror" said it was the second-highest (after "<a href="Gabbar%20Singh%20%28film%29">Gabbar Singh</a>") in box-office revenue. According to "<a href="Deccan%20Herald">Deccan Herald</a>", "Eega" and "<a href="Julai">Julai</a>" were the only 2012 big-budget Telugu films to break even and have a positive audience response. "Makkhi" opened poorly, despite positive word-of-mouth, eventually ending up as an average grosser. Regarding the performance of "Makkhi", Rajamouli felt the film was poorly presented and did not reach its theatrical audience even though it was better received on television, and so later on collaborated with filmmaker <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a> – whom he considered the "one missing link" – on the presentation of the Hindi-dubbed version of his later film, "Baahubali: The Beginning".

Baradwaj Rangan, writing for "The Hindu", said without a human protagonist, only a villain and a heroine, the audience is "led through a story that's funny, sentimental, action-packed, romantic—there's even a bit of the occult thrown in". Also for "The Hindu", Malathi Rangarajan wrote, "Let's celebrate the figment of [Rajamouli's] imagination that has made the housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Calcutta%29">The Telegraph</a>" called the film "a winner from the first frame to the last" and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called "Eega" the "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave "Eega" four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from <a href="Sify">Sify</a> called "Eega" an "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" that "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".

Radhika Rajamani of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> awarded "Eega" four stars out of five; she praised its visual effects, performances and cinematography and said Sudeep "is such a delight to watch on screen". Karthik Pasupulate and M. Suganth of "The Times of India" both gave "Eega" four stars out of five; Pasupulate said it offers a "mind-bending thrill-a-second ride of the season, probably the decade". Suganth called it a "bravura piece of commercial filmmaking that is an unqualified triumph in every aspect". <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> of <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a> gave the film four stars out of five and praised its concept, and said Sudeep played his role with a "true comic book flair" and a "cartoonish tinge". Writing for <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a>, <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> praised "Eega's" "sharp clenched narrative", which overshadowed the "shaky plot". He further wrote, "Gutsy sly and original, this is the entertainer of the season". <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> gave the film four stars out of five in a review for "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" and called it a "mad roller coaster ride that's worth taking" and the "most outlandish film [she has] seen in years". Shabana Ansari rated "Eega" three stars out of five in a "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" review and called the animated fly a "new-age Indian hero" with "lofty ideas".

Kruthi Grover of "The New Indian Express" wrote that "Eega" lacks a proper structure despite having effective visual effects and editing. She added that the film turns into a "silly animated movie for kids" after the fly's birth. Reviewing "Makkhi" for "<a href="Dainik%20Bhaskar">Dainik Bhaskar</a>", Mayank Shekhar said the film's premise is stretched beyond its potential and that as a result it "just goes on and on and on" in its "original, tacky, raw form".

"Eega" received the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Telugu">Best Feature Film in Telugu</a> and <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Effects">Best Special Effects</a> awards at the <a href="60th%20National%20Film%20Awards">60th National Film Awards</a>.

M. Keeravani respectively.

The film's Telugu version was shown at film festivals worldwide. In December 2012, it was shown at the annual <a href="Chennai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Chennai International Film Festival</a>. After showings at the L'Étrange and <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance</a> film festivals, it was the only Telugu film screened in the <a href="March%C3%A9%20du%20Film">Marché du Film</a> section of the <a href="2013%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2013 Cannes Film Festival</a> and the panorama section of the <a href="2013%20Shanghai%20International%20Film%20Festival">2013 Shanghai International Film Festival</a>.

"Eega" is the only Telugu film to receive six nominations at the Madrid International Film Festival, and is the first Indian Best Film nominee. Nominations at the 2013 edition of the film festival included Best Film, Best Supporting Actor (Sudeep), and Best Cinematographer (Senthil Kumar). The film was invited to the 2013 <a href="Bucheon%20International%20Fantastic%20Film%20Festival">Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival</a> in South Korea, and was the fifth foreign-language film shown at the <a href="18th%20Busan%20International%20Film%20Festival">18th Busan International Film Festival</a> in October 2013.

Sudeep received national recognition for his performance in "Eega"; <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> told him, "I thought I was the best villain to date. But you beat me to it". His performance was appreciated by other celebrities such as <a href="Akkineni%20Nagarjuna">Akkineni Nagarjuna</a>, <a href="Mahesh%20Babu">Mahesh Babu</a>, and <a href="Ram%20Gopal%20Varma">Ram Gopal Varma</a>; Varma said he recognised Sudeep's potential after watching "Eega", adding, "Many take his acting in that film for granted, with respect to his expressions when interacting with the fly, but as a director, I know how difficult it is to act when you are imagining the fly to be there". Sudeep's performance in "Naan Ee" impressed filmmaker <a href="Chimbu%20Deven">Chimbu Deven</a>, who cast him as the antagonist in "<a href="Puli%20%282015%20film%29">Puli</a>" (2015).

Speaking about the centenary of Indian cinema at the CII Media & Entertainment Summit 2012, filmmaker <a href="Shekhar%20Kapur">Shekhar Kapur</a> said regional cinema is surpassing Hindi cinema in content and story, and cited "Eega" as an example. Kapur said he was impressed with its story and use of technology, and called it "no less than a Hollywood superhero film". <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> called "Eega" an "awesomely original" film and a "must watch" with children. <a href="Lavanya%20Tripathi">Lavanya Tripathi</a> cited Nani's performance in "Eega" as one of the reasons she worked with him in "<a href="Bhale%20Bhale%20Magadivoy">Bhale Bhale Magadivoy</a>" (2015).

"Eega" was parodied twice in <a href="Bhimaneni%20Srinivasa%20Rao">Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao</a> comedy film "<a href="Sudigadu">Sudigadu</a>" (2012); when a young girl asks her father to tell her a bedtime story in the opening credits, and in a scene in which the protagonist threatens to kill a female crime boss with weapons designed by Rajamouli, including the fly's needle. In December 2012, "Eega" and Sudeep topped Radhika Rajamani's Rediff.com "Top Five Telugu Films Of 2012" and "Best Telugu Actors of 2012" lists; according to her, Sudeep left an "indelible" mark on the film and gave an "exceptionally good account" of himself as the antagonist. Shobha Warrier of Reddif placed Sudeep on her list of "Top Tamil Actors of 2012", writing that his performance was "so superlative and far superior to any other actor's in Tamil" that it "has to be termed as the best performance of the year". Radhika Rajamani ranked Rajamouli first on her "Top Telugu Directors of 2012" list, which was published in January 2013.

In August 2015, Pooja Darade of "The Times of India" included "Eega" in her list of "Telugu movies one must watch before dying"; she said it "has set a high standard of how creativity can be used effectively". In an April 2016 interview with "The Hindu", Tamil actor <a href="Suriya">Suriya</a> said films like "<a href="Sagara%20Sangamam">Sagara Sangamam</a>" (1983), "Eega", "Baahubali: The Beginning", and "<a href="Manam%20%28film%29">Manam</a>" (2014) are remembered much longer than more conventional films.

Battle of Radzymin (1920)

The Battle of Radzymin () took place during the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a> (1919–21). The battle occurred near the town of <a href="Radzymin">Radzymin</a>, some north-east of <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, between August 13 and 16, 1920. Along with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Oss%C3%B3w">Battle of Ossów</a> and the Polish counteroffensive from the <a href="Wieprz%20River">Wieprz River</a> area, this engagement was a key part of what later became known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Warsaw%20%281920%29">Battle of Warsaw</a>. It also proved to be one of the bloodiest and most intense battles of the <a href="Polish-Soviet%20War">Polish-Soviet War</a>.

The first phase of the battle began on August 13 with a frontal assault by the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> on the <a href="Praga">Praga</a> bridgehead. The Soviet forces captured Radzymin on August 14 and breached the lines of the <a href="First%20Polish%20Army%20%281920%29">1st Polish Army</a>, which was defending Warsaw from the east. Radzymin changed hands several times in heavy combat. Foreign <a href="diplomat">diplomat</a>s, with the exception of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="Holy%20See">Vatican</a> ambassadors, hastily left Warsaw.

The plan for the battle was straightforward for both sides. The Russians wanted to break through the Polish defences to Warsaw, while the Polish aim was to defend the area long enough for a two-pronged counteroffensive from the south, led by <a href="genera%C5%82">General</a> <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Pi%C5%82sudski">Józef Piłsudski</a>, and north, led by General <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Sikorski">Władysław Sikorski</a>, to outflank the attacking forces.

After three days of intense fighting, the <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized 1st Polish Army under General <a href="Franciszek%20Latinik">Franciszek Latinik</a> managed to repel a direct assault by six Red Army rifle <a href="infantry%20division">division</a>s at Radzymin and Ossów. The struggle for control of Radzymin forced General <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Haller">Józef Haller</a>, commander of the <a href="Polish%20Northern%20Front%20%281920%29">Polish Northern Front</a>, to start the 5th Army's counterattack earlier than planned. Radzymin was recaptured on August 15, and this victory proved to be one of the turning points of the battle of Warsaw. The strategic counteroffensive was successful, pushing Soviet forces away from Radzymin and Warsaw and eventually crippling four Soviet armies.

Following the failure of the <a href="Kiev%20Offensive">Kiev Offensive</a>, the Polish armies retreated westwards from central Belarus and Ukraine. Although the Bolshevik forces failed to surround or destroy the bulk of the <a href="Polish%20Army">Polish Army</a>, most Polish units were in dire need of fresh reinforcements. The Polish command hoped to halt the advancing Russian forces in front of Warsaw, the capital of Poland. At the same time General (later <a href="Marshal%20of%20Poland">Marshal of Poland</a>) Józef Piłsudski was to lead a flanking manoeuvre from the area of the <a href="Wieprz">Wieprz</a> River, while General Władysław Sikorski's 5th Army was to leave the <a href="Modlin%20Fortress">Modlin Fortress</a> and head north-east, to cut off the Soviet forces heading westwards, to the north of the bend of the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a> and <a href="Bugonarew">Bugonarew</a> and on towards <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>. However, for this plan to succeed, it was vital that Polish forces hold Warsaw.

The defence of Warsaw was organised by the 1st Polish Army under General Franciszek Latinik and by a part of the Northern Front under General <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Haller%20de%20Hallenburg">Józef Haller</a>. The army consisted of four understrength infantry divisions: the <a href="8th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29">8th</a>, <a href="11th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29">11th</a>, and <a href="15th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29">15th</a>, with the <a href="1st%20Lithuanian-Belarusian%20Division">1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division</a> in reserve. In addition, it had at its disposal the battle-weary <a href="10th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29">10th Infantry Division</a>, two Air Groups (four <a href="escadrille">escadrille</a>s in total), 293 pieces of artillery and three <a href="armoured%20train">armoured train</a>s.
The city was to be surrounded by four lines of defence. The outermost ran some to the east of Warsaw: to the east of <a href="Zegrze%20Fortress">Zegrze Fortress</a>, then along the river <a href="Rz%C4%85dza">Rządza</a> to <a href="Stary%20Dyb%C3%B3w">Dybów</a> and south through Helenów, Nowa Czarna and the Białe Błota <a href="marshes">marshes</a> east of <a href="Wo%C5%82omin">Wołomin</a>. From there it ran through <a href="Le%C5%9Bniakowizna">Leśniakowizna</a>, dense forests occupied by artillery training grounds, and then along the <a href="Okuniew">Okuniew</a>–<a href="Wi%C4%85zowna">Wiązowna</a>–Vistula line.

The second line ran a mile closer to Warsaw, along the lines of partially preserved <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>-era trenches built by German and Russian armies in 1915, separated by a <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>. It ran from the banks of the river Bugonarew at <a href="Fort%20Beniamin%C3%B3w">Fort Beniaminów</a>, along the <a href="Struga">Struga</a>–<a href="Zielonka">Zielonka</a>–<a href="Rembert%C3%B3w">Rembertów</a>-<a href="Zakr%C4%99t%2C%20Otwock%20County">Zakręt</a>–<a href="Falenica">Falenica</a> line. The two most prominent pivots of this line were the towns of Radzymin and Wołomin. The third line of defence ran in the immediate vicinity of the right-bank borough of Praga, while the Vistula River <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a>s formed the final fourth line.

The <a href="11th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Poland%29">11th Polish Infantry Division</a> was dispatched to Radzymin on August 8 in order to prepare the city's defences for the expected arrival of Bolshevik forces. While the unit's core was formed around veterans of the 2nd Polish Rifle Division of the French-equipped and trained <a href="Blue%20Army%20%28Poland%29">Blue Army</a>, it had been recently reinforced with fresh, but raw, recruits. The Poles set up defences in front of the town, utilising some earlier German and Russian First World War trenches and digging new positions. The Polish line ran some in front of the town, from the unfinished 1909 Fort Beniaminów at the banks of the river Bugonarew through <a href="Mokre%2C%20Masovian%20Voivodeship">Mokre</a> to Dybów. The following day the <a href="6th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Russia%29">6th Russian Rifle Division</a> captured <a href="Wyszk%C3%B3w">Wyszków</a> some to the north-east. On August 12 the Polish <a href="1st%20Lithuanian%E2%80%93Belarusian%20Division">1st Lithuanian–Belarusian Division</a> abandoned the first line of defence and withdrew through Radzymin towards Warsaw. Radzymin now found itself at the front line; by nightfall the first Russian forces appeared in front of <a href="Ruda%2C%20Wo%C5%82omin%20County">Ruda</a> and <a href="Zawady%2C%20Wo%C5%82omin%20County">Zawady</a>, two villages manned by the Polish 48th Infantry Regiment, and Russian artillery shelled Radzymin for the first time.

From the north, Warsaw, which spans the Vistula, was effectively shielded by the Vistula, <a href="Bug%20River">Bug</a> and <a href="Narew">Narew</a> rivers. The Red Army's lack of modern engineering equipment for the river crossings inhibited a flanking attack of Warsaw from the west, which had been Russia's historical path of attack, towards <a href="P%C5%82ock">Płock</a>, <a href="W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek">Włocławek</a> and <a href="Toru%C5%84">Toruń</a>, where their forces could cross the Vistula and strike Warsaw from the west and north-west over permanent bridges there. While a ring of 19th- and early 20th-century Russian-built forts, part of the <a href="Warsaw%20Fortress">Warsaw Fortress</a>, ran mostly along the western side of the Vistula, these fortifications lay in ruins; Russian forces began demolition in 1909 and had destroyed most by the time of <a href="Great%20Retreat%20%28Russian%29">their withdrawal from Warsaw</a> in 1915, during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

The most expedient approach for a large-scale assault on Warsaw was from the east. Terrain was mostly flat; numerous roads converged radially along an arc from the <a href="Modlin%20Fortress">Modlin Fortress</a> to the north (where the Narew flows into the Vistula), to <a href="Legionowo">Legionowo</a>, Radzymin, and <a href="Mi%C5%84sk%20Mazowiecki">Mińsk Mazowiecki</a> directly to the east. Meanwhile, the only permanent defences in the area of Radzymin were the incomplete Fort Beniaminów and a line of First World War trenches west of Radzymin, neglected since their construction by Russians and Germans in 1915.

The first and second lines of Polish defences were manned by regular forces. These included three Polish infantry divisions: the 11th (from the Bug River to <a href="Le%C5%9Bniakowizna">Leśniakowizna</a>), the 8th (Leśniakowizna to Okuniew) and the 15th (Okuniew to the Vistula River). The 1st Army also held the newly arrived 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division in reserve (<a href="Marki">Marki</a>–<a href="Koby%C5%82ka">Kobyłka</a>), while the Northern Front's headquarters reserves consisted of the 10th Infantry Division and some smaller units. The third line was manned by units of mobilised <a href="Policja">State Police</a> and a variety of volunteer units of low combat value. Out of those units, initially only the 11th Division under Colonel Bolesław Jaźwiński took part in the fight. Its 48th "Kresy Rifles" Regiment (Colonel Łukowski) manned the Bugonarew-Mokre line, the 46th "Kaniów Rifles" Regiment (Colonel Krzywobłocki) manned the Mokre-Czarna perimeter, and the 47th "Kresy Rifles" Regiment (<a href="podpu%C5%82kownik">Lt. Colonel</a> Szczepan) manned the <a href="Czarna%2C%20Lublin%20Voivodeship">Czarna</a>–<a href="Le%C5%9Bniakowizna">Leśniakowizna</a> line. To the south of the 11th Division were positions around Wołomin manned by the 8th Infantry Division, consisting of the 36th, 21st and 33rd Infantry Regiments, as well as the 13th Infantry Regiment held in reserve, which later took part in the Battle of Ossów.

The combat value of Polish units is difficult to assess as they included fresh recruits of the so-called Volunteer Army, veterans of First World War, battle-hardened soldiers who fought in earlier stages of the Polish-Bolshevik War, and civilians with virtually no combat training. Prior to the battle the 46th Regiment received 700 reinforcements: mostly <a href="deserter">deserter</a>s from various formations, a battalion of volunteer <a href="sentry%20guard">sentry guard</a>s and <a href="march%20battalion">march companies</a> of <a href="sapper">sapper</a>s. The 11th Infantry Division, nominally 9000 men strong, in practice had only 1500 soldiers in first-line units. The situation for the Polish Army was so dire that some of the soldiers sent as reinforcements had reportedly "never seen a rifle in their lives". In addition, most units to make a stand at Radzymin were exhausted after surviving a retreat from Belarus. However, the Polish side had superior intelligence and <a href="Air%20supremacy">aerial superiority</a>.

The two Russian divisions assaulting Radzymin were battle-hardened Siberian divisions led by experienced front-line commanders. Both divisions were as exhausted as their opponents, whom they had chased all the way from Belarus. However, prior to the battle both divisions received reinforcements from other units, instead of fresh recruits, and were much superior in manpower to other Russian units on the Polish front. Later, in his monograph on the war, Marshal of Poland Józef Piłsudski remarked that the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division had achieved what was unheard of in the Polish Army despite numerous attempts: putting rear echelons and stragglers of his division into front-line service. This was indeed a problem for both armies, as the number of "bayonets and sabres", or soldiers fighting in the first line, was at all times smaller than the number of second echelon troops. On August 15 Polish intelligence reported the strength of the Russian forces as "three to four standard Russian divisions". Even post-war memoirs by General Żeligowski mention "[t]hree Russian infantry divisions, that is 27 battalions, though admittedly understrength, against one of our own", though in fact the Russian forces only had two divisions.

Both Polish and Russian planners expected an attack on Warsaw—and Radzymin in particular—from the east. Yet the first fights started to the north-east of the Polish capital. Warsaw was to be assaulted from the east by the <a href="16th%20Army%20%28RSFSR%29">16th Red Army</a>. At the same time the 14th Red Army (under <a href="Ieronim%20Uborevich">Ieronim Uborevich</a>) captured Wyszków and started a fast march westwards, towards <a href="Toru%C5%84">Toruń</a>. It was then to cross the lower Vistula and assault Warsaw from the north-west. However, its 21st Rifle Division remained on the south side of the Bug River and headed for Warsaw directly, under orders from Russia's <a href="Commissar">Commissar of War</a> <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. Aided by the Russian 27th Rifle Division, it came into contact with the Polish forces at Radzymin on August 12, and prepared for an assault the following morning.

The Soviet probing attack began at 07:00 hours, but the 21st Rifle Division achieved no breakthrough. After the Soviets had been repelled, the defending 11th Infantry Division received some artillery reinforcements. The artillery commanders wanted to use the church tower of Radzymin as an observation post and to move the batteries forward, closer to the front line. However, before the relocation of the artillery was complete, a new Soviet attack began at around 17:00, this time carried out by four brigades of the 21st and 27th Rifle Divisions, reinforced with 59 artillery pieces. The Russians achieved a 3:1 superiority in firepower. Deprived of artillery support, the inexperienced and overstretched 1/<a href="46th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Poland%29">46th Infantry Regiment</a>, defending the village of Kraszew, broke, and the Soviets gained entry to Radzymin. The Polish unit withdrew in panic, and soldiers left their arms and backpacks behind. One of the artillery officers noted that the Russians achieved complete tactical surprise: "I ordered my dinner prepared when my aide came shouting 'Lieutenant Sir, the Reds are in the city.

The retreat was made even more serious by the fact that the <a href="Military%20Police">gendarmes</a>, tasked with stabilising the front and catching deserters, also fled in panic. The town itself was badly damaged, and the commanding officer of the 46th Regiment, Colonel <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Krzywob%C5%82ocki">Bronisław Krzywobłocki</a>, was forced to order the retreat of the remainder of his forces south-west from the town. The rest of the division had no option but to fall back to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.

Although the Polish division was defeated, the Russian forces did not pursue. This allowed the Poles to mount a night counterattack. A single <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> battalion attacked a position behind Radzymin. While ultimately unsuccessful, the battalion forced the Russian troops to remain stationary overnight, giving the Poles badly needed time to regroup and receive reinforcements, which came in the form of a single regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division. Instead of retreating to the third line of defences, the Poles remained outside the town, hoping to retake it the following day.
News of the defeat at Radzymin reached Warsaw the same day, causing panic among both the government and ordinary people. The following day the battlefield was visited by, among others, Prime Minister <a href="Wincenty%20Witos">Wincenty Witos</a>, papal <a href="nuncio">nuncio</a> <a href="Achille%20Ratti">Achille Ratti</a> (the future <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XI">Pope Pius XI</a>), <a href="Maciej%20Rataj">Maciej Rataj</a> and General Józef Haller, the commanding officer of the Northern Front. General Haller's dispatch of 01:00 hours the same night called the Polish defeat at Radzymin "ignominious", and ordered the commanding officers of the 46th Infantry Regiment and divisional artillery to be immediately <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led. The commanding officer of the 46th Regiment was immediately relieved of command and replaced with <a href="Major">Major</a> Józef Liwacz.

The gravity of the situation was well understood by the Polish Commander-in-Chief Józef Piłsudski, who remarked that all the battle plans for his counteroffensive were based on the assumption that Warsaw would hold, and suggested to General <a href="Tadeusz%20Rozwadowski">Tadeusz Rozwadowski</a> that he reinforce the Radzymin area with any forces available, including an "en masse tank attack". Despite this suggestion, out of 49 tanks of the 1st Tank Regiment available in Warsaw at that time, only about six took part in the battle. The loss of Radzymin also forced General Władysław Sikorski's 5th Army, fighting north of the Bug River and along the Vistula, to start a counteroffensive from the Modlin Fortress earlier than planned. Rozwadowski and General <a href="Maxime%20Weygand">Maxime Weygand</a>, a member of the <a href="French%20Military%20Mission%20to%20Poland">French Military Mission to Poland</a>, even suggested that Piłsudski also hasten his preparations for a counteroffensive, but he refused and decided to follow the original plans.

The Russians considered the capture of Radzymin a crucial accomplishment. The Polish intelligence intercepted and decrypted a euphoric, but completely untrue, report by the Revolutionary Military Committee of the 3rd Army dispatched to Moscow, informing the Russian government that "the brave units of the 3rd Army have captured the town of Radzymin on August 13th, at 23:00 hours. In pursuit of the enemy, they are not further than 15 <a href="verst">verst</a>s from Praga. (...) The workers of Warsaw can already sense that their liberation is near. The revolution in Warsaw is ripe. Workers demand that the city be handed over to the Red Army without a fight, threatening to prevent armed soldiers from leaving the city [for the front]. The <a href="White%20movement">White Poland</a> is dying". The commanding officer of the Russian 3rd Army, Vladimir Lazarevich, informed <a href="Mikhail%20Tukhachevsky">Tukhachevsky</a> that "Poland is now on fire. Only one more push is needed and the Polish fracas will be over".

To counter the threat of a Russian breakthrough, General Latinik ordered General <a href="Jan%20Rz%C4%85dkowski">Jan Rządkowski</a> to assault the town the following day with all available forces. To strengthen the assault, the 11th Infantry Division (under Colonel Bolesław Jaźwiński) was drawn from the reserves and dispatched to join the assault which was scheduled for 05:00 hours the following morning. However, the Polish forces were far from sufficient for the task. Rządkowski argued that he had been promised substantial reinforcements which did not arrive. The battle-hardened <a href="5th%20Rifle%20Division%20%28Poland%29">Siberian Brigade</a> was at that time tied down in the Modlin Fortress, although the promised cavalry units did arrive—but without their ammunition trains.

The plans for the Polish assault had to be changed due to unexpected Russian actions. The Polish forces expected heavy opposition from at least two Russian divisions. However, in the morning the Russian 21st Division resumed its advance along the <a href="Bia%C5%82ystok">Białystok</a>–Warsaw road towards Marki and Warsaw, while the 27th started its march towards <a href="Jab%C5%82onna%2C%20Legionowo%20County">Jabłonna</a>. The 21st Division achieved some early successes when its 5th and 6th Rifle Brigades pushed the Poles back from the Czarna River some to the west. However, at the same time it was advancing right in front of Polish forces which were preparing to assault Radzymin. At 10:15 hours the Polish 81st and 85th Infantry Regiments from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division assaulted the left flank of the unsuspecting Russians, continued along the Warsaw–Białystok road, and broke through to the town. The attack was led by Lieutenant Colonel Kazimierz Rybicki, who had personally witnessed the defeat of the 46th Regiment the previous day, on his day off. This time spirits were high and the Polish infantry advanced in order, with officers in the first line and the soldiers singing <a href="D%C4%85browski%27s%20Mazurka">Dąbrowski's Mazurka</a>. By noon the town was liberated.

The success did not last long, as the Russian 27th Rifle Division turned around and arrived at Radzymin just in time for its 81st Brigade to push the exhausted Polish forces back towards the village of Słupno. Threatened by further attacks from Słupno and Wieliszew, the 85th Regiment retreated after suffering heavy casualties, including the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, Captain Ryszard Downar-Zapolski. This time the Soviet 81st Rifle Brigade (27th Rifle Division) pursued the Poles and managed to pierce Polish defences near <a href="W%C3%B3lka%20Radzymi%C5%84ska">Wólka Radzymińska</a> and <a href="D%C4%85bkowizna">Dąbkowizna</a>, breaking through the second line of defences, which were the last before the city limits. The Polish headquarters at Warsaw was "petrified to hear of the complete destruction of the 19th [Lithuanian-Belarusian] Division", a report that fortunately for the Poles proved to be false. The threat to the northern flank was halted, with heavy casualties on both sides, thanks to the intervention of the division's commanding officer Jan Rządkowski, as well as Front commanding officer Józef Haller, who arrived on the battlefield to personally organise an ad-hoc line of defence west of Wólka Radzymińska, with Polish artillery units shelling the advancing Russians with direct fire. The Soviet advance was halted, and this time chaos in the Polish ranks was avoided, but again lack of reinforcements behind the main line of defences proved a serious problem.
In the evening Generals <a href="Lucjan%20%C5%BBeligowski">Lucjan Żeligowski</a>, Józef Haller, Jan Rządkowski and Franciszek Latinik met in Jabłonna and again in Struga to prepare a plan for retaking Radzymin once again. It was decided that, since the Soviet 27th Division was bogged down around Radzymin and had not resumed its march towards Jabłonna, the Polish 10th Infantry Division was no longer needed in that sector, and instead could be used to achieve a breakthrough at Radzymin. The division was relocated to <a href="Niepor%C4%99t">Nieporęt</a>, where General Rządkowski discovered the artillery units that were believed to have been destroyed by the Russians the previous day. A single battalion from the 28th "Kaniów Rifles" Regiment from the 10th Division, led by <a href="porucznik">1st Lieutenant</a> <a href="Stefan%20Pogonowski">Stefan Pogonowski</a>, was ordered to entrench in a forest near Wólka Radzymińska and organise an ambush. The rest of the Polish forces were to start an all-out assault at 05:00 hours the following morning, with General Żeligowski in command over the ad-hoc corps. The forces amassed for the assault had a nominal strength of 17,000 infantry, 109 artillery pieces, and 220 machine guns.

In the evening the 5th Army, operating north of the Bug and Narew rivers with its base of operations in the Modlin Fortress, started a limited counteroffensive with the aim of lessening the pressure on the Polish forces at Radzymin. Grossly outnumbered, the 5th Army could not break through the Russian lines, and got bogged down in intense fights along the <a href="Wkra">Wkra</a> river. However, although initially unsuccessful, the Polish attack prevented the Soviet 5th, 15th and 16th Armies from reinforcing the two divisions already committed to Radzymin. Only the 4th Red Army, the furthest from the battlefield, operating in the north along the <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>n border and moving towards Toruń, kept advancing almost unopposed. This however did not pose an immediate threat to the defenders of Warsaw, as its advance was finally halted at the outskirts of <a href="W%C5%82oc%C5%82awek">Włocławek</a>, and it was forced to start a hasty retreat eastwards.

In the early hours of August 15 the Russian forces resumed their attacks on the Polish lines, intending to break through the second line of defences to the area of Nieporęt and Jabłonna. However, as they bypassed a small forest outside Wólka Radzymińska, they were assaulted from the rear by the 1st Battalion of the 28th Infantry Regiment, which had been concealed there earlier. Simultaneously, the remainder of the 28th Regiment began a badly coordinated and half-hearted attack from Nieporęt. Both Polish assaults were bloodily repelled, with the casualties including Lieutenant Pogonowski who was posthumously awarded the <a href="Virtuti%20Militari">Virtuti Militari</a> medal for his bravery leading the charge, but they did force the Russians to retreat to their initial positions.

When the front-line stabilised, the Polish headquarters threw all its reserves into a counterattack. Beniaminów was reinforced with the 29th Infantry Regiment. The Polish attack began around 05:30, after a 20-minute <a href="artillery%20barrage">artillery barrage</a>. Soon the entire 10th Infantry Division started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew river in order to outflank the Russian forces from the north, while the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division pushed directly towards the town. Although the Russian side had superior artillery and brought several <a href="Austin%20Armoured%20Car">Austin-Putilov armoured cars</a>, this time the Polish assault was supported by five <a href="Renault%20FT">Renault FT</a> tanks and numerous aircraft. Despite suffering from mechanical failures, the tanks successfully broke through the Russian lines, and the infantry of the 85th "Wilno Rifles" Regiment from the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Division followed them into the town. After a short struggle the Polish forces once again controlled the town. However, as soon as it was taken, General Żeligowski decided to reorganise his division and could not support the 85th Regiment with fresh forces. Yet another successful counterattack by the Russian 61st and 62nd Infantry Brigades forced the Polish 1st Division to retreat back to its initial positions.
At the same time, on the northern flank, the 10th Division was much more successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Wiktor%20Thomm%C3%A9e">Wiktor Thommée</a>, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th "Kaniów Rifles" Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on a small hill overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, directly behind the Russian lines. The Russians tried to push the Poles back from that position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with the remainder of the 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.

With the northern flank safely in Polish hands, General Lucjan Żeligowski ordered his Lithuanian-Belarusian Division to complete the encirclement of Radzymin. The division reached a position a few hundred metres from Radzymin by way of the village of Ciemne to the south of the town. Fearing envelopment, the Soviets abandoned the town and withdrew east. A single company from the 30th "Kaniów Rifles" Regiment entered Radzymin unopposed. The town was completely empty; both the civilians and the Russian soldiers had fled, and one officer remarked that "not a stray dog was left behind in the ruined city".

Although the battle was over and Radzymin was secure, the Soviet forces continued to threaten the Polish northern flank. In the early hours of August 16 the Russians mounted yet another assault on Radzymin, reinforced by several armoured cars and led personally by the commanding officer of the 27th Rifle Division, Vitovt Putna. However, by this time the morale of the 27th Division was already broken, and the assault was easily thwarted by the Polish infantry and the three remaining operational FT tanks. The armoured cars withdrew as soon as the Polish tanks opened fire, and the Russian infantry followed.

Other Russian forces were more successful to the north of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a bayonet charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon and the Russians fled.
The entire 13th Red Army stalled because of its defeat at Radzymin. After that success the Poles slowly but steadily pushed the Soviets back beyond the first line of defences that had been overrun several days before. By the end of 16 August, the 28th and 30th Infantry Regiments manned most of the trench line along the Rządza River, near the village of Dybów. Although initially the Russian command wanted to use the outskirts of Radzymin as a pivot for a tactical withdrawal to the Radzymin–<a href="Brze%C5%9B%C4%87">Brześć</a> line, the following day the Soviet commander ordered a full retreat towards Wyszków and later <a href="Grodno">Grodno</a>. Meanwhile, Piłsudski's 4th Army outflanked the surprised Russians and went as far north as the left wing of <a href="Nikolai%20Sollogub">Nikolai Sollogub</a>'s 16th Red Army, which at that time was constantly pressured from the front by the 10th and 15th divisions. This made existing Russian plans obsolete, and Polish forces started a pursuit that ended with the victorious <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Niemen%20River">Battle of the Niemen River</a> in September. On the day of Polish victory the Soviets issued a <a href="Soviet%20propaganda">propaganda</a> poster in Moscow proclaiming: "Warsaw has fallen. With it the Poland of yesterday became history. It is nothing but a legend now while the truth of today is the red reality. Long live the Soviets! Long live the invincible Red Army!"

The battle was a success for the Poles at both the tactical level (the battle of Radzymin itself) and the strategic level (its role in the battle of Warsaw). After several days of constant fighting for the town of Radzymin and its immediate vicinity, the Russian attack was repelled and the Poles were able to mount a successful counteroffensive, forcing the Russian armies out of Poland and in the end destroying them completely.
However, the conduct of the Polish forces and their commanders at Radzymin in the early part of the battle has been criticised by historians since the 1920s. It was noted by General Lucjan Żeligowski that the importance of the northern approach to Warsaw was poorly understood by the Polish commanders prior to the battle, and that the untested and relatively weak 10th Division was chosen for the task of defending Radzymin "out of sheer incompetence". In his memoirs he also heavily criticised the commanding officers of the division, whose "military prowess and punctuality in carrying out orders was little more than irony". Other post-war authors argued that on August 13, when the first Russian forces appeared in front of Radzymin, the 1st Army had more than enough time to reinforce the weak Polish forces there. Instead, it took several days to recapture what could have been held from the start.

Despite the lack of strategic flair in the Polish defence of Radzymin, it was one of the cornerstones of the overall success in the Battle of Warsaw. Although it was Piłsudski's Assault Group that defeated the Russians, the forces at Radzymin and Sikorski's 5th Army were responsible for stopping them at the gates of Warsaw. Żeligowski noted in his memoirs that "Warsaw was saved thanks to Polish successes at Mokra, Wólka Radzymińska and Radzymin".

As one of the crucial battles of the war of 1920, the battle for Radzymin has been featured in novels, memoirs and historical monographs. It was also portrayed in the 2011 film "<a href="Battle%20of%20Warsaw%201920">Battle of Warsaw 1920</a>", although the battle of Radzymin sequence was shot mostly in <a href="Piotrk%C3%B3w%20Trybunalski">Piotrków Trybunalski</a>. Since 1998 a <a href="Historical%20reenactment">re-enactment</a> of the battle has been held annually on August 15 in Ossów and Radzymin, organised by various re-enactment groups and a local <a href="powiat">powiat</a> administration.

15 October 2011 global protests

The 15 October 2011 global protests were part of a series of protests inspired by the <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a>, the <a href="2009%20Icelandic%20financial%20crisis%20protests">Icelandic protests</a>, the <a href="2011%20Portuguese%20protests">Portuguese "Geração à Rasca"</a>, the <a href="2011%E2%80%93present%20Spanish%20protests">Spanish "Indignants"</a>, the <a href="2010%E2%80%932011%20Greek%20protests">Greek protests</a>, and the <a href="Occupy%20movement">Occupy movement</a>. The protests were launched under the slogan "United for #GlobalChange", to which the slogan "United for Global Democracy" was added by many people's assemblies. The protest was first called for by the Spanish "<a href="Plataforma%20%C2%A1Democracia%20Real%20YA%21">Plataforma ¡Democracia Real YA!</a>" in May 2011 and endorsed by people's assemblies across the world. Reasons were varied but mainly targeted growing economic inequality, corporate influence over government and international institutions, and the lack of truly democratic institutions allowing direct public participation at all levels, local to global. Global demonstrations were held on 15 October in more than 950 cities in 82 countries. The date was chosen to coincide with the 5-month anniversary of <a href="2011%E2%80%93present%20Spanish%20protests%23May%2015">the first protest in Spain</a>. General assemblies, the social network n-1, <a href="mailing%20list">mailing list</a>s, Mumble voice chat, open pads such as Pirate Pad and Titan Pad, and Facebook were used to coordinate the events. Some protests were only a few hundred in number, whereas others numbered in the hundreds of thousands, with the largest in Madrid numbering half a million and the second largest city Barcelona with 400,000.

As a continuation of the <a href="2011%20Spanish%20Protests">2011 Spanish Protests</a>, the largest protests took place in Spain, where more than a million people took the streets on 15 October, including 500,000 in Madrid, 400,000 in Barcelona, and 150,000 in Zaragoza. In Madrid, protesters reoccupied the Puerta del Sol square where the Indignados had camped five months earlier on <a href="2011%20Spanish%20Protests">15 May</a>. As in protests elsewhere, slogans on signs included "We are the 99%", "United for Global Change" and "Human Rights for Everybody".

At least 300,000 under the banner of "People of Europe: Rise Up!" gathered in the centre of Rome, according to the organizers. During the peaceful march against <a href="criticism%20of%20capitalism">corporate greed</a> and austerity measures, a group of people broke away from the main demonstration and threw rocks, bottles and incendiary devices at banks and riot police. Riot police charged and clashed with the protesters repeatedly, firing water cannons and tear gas. At least 135 people were injured, including 105 police officers. 12 people were arrested.

10,000 people gathered at the Neptune Fountain in <a href="Alexanderplatz">Alexanderplatz</a> between 13:00 and 14:00. At 14:00 the march set off towards the <a href="Brandenburg%20Gate">Brandenburg Gate</a> (Brandenburger Tor), arriving to a police barrier at the <a href="Pariser%20Platz">Pariser Platz</a> square at about 15:00. The march thus made a detour around Brandenburger Tor and marched towards the Kanzleramt, the seat of the federal government of Germany. In front of the Kanzleramt, an open microphone was put in place where anybody could come up and give their thoughts. The sound system was not loud enough for such a big gathering and so it was proposed to use the <a href="human%20microphone">human microphone</a> (das menschliche Megaphone in German) technique of Occupy Wall Street. The plan had been for everyone to go to Mariannenplatz in the evening where stages, music and food had been prepared. However the people spontaneously decided to assemble in front of the <a href="Reichstag%20%28building%29">Reichstag</a> and held an assembly there. Tents were put out, and the food was brought from Mariannenplatz. The police came and told the people to disperse. The people refused to disperse and continued their assembly using the human mic. The police then proceeded to destroy the tents which had been put up. After all the tents had been destroyed or confiscated by the police, the police made rounds around the assembly and stole the blankets and mats of the people. At around midnight the police made a final call to disperse and threatened serious consequences for those who stayed. The people decided to stay. The police then proceeded to violently and forcibly remove the peaceful gathering of people in the park in front of the parliamentarian. The police then told the dislodged people on the streets around Platz der Republik to go to Brandenburgertor. More than 100 people then regrouped at Pariserplatz near Brandenburgertor to make a new assembly. In that assembly it was decided to come back the next day at 13:00 at Pariserplatz to continue the movement. As soon had this decision been made that the police made renewed threats to the people. The people then decided to leave for the moment and come back the next day. People from the protest reported that the police blocked sms and Twitter communication containing certain key words such as "occupyreichtag" or "occupywallst" during periods of the day. The protest became ongoing and continues as <a href="Occupy%20Berlin">Occupy Berlin</a>.

Frankfurt in Germany, where 8000 people gathered in front of the <a href="European%20Central%20Bank">European Central Bank</a>
Frankfurt headquarters on the first day of a worldwide protest against income disparity and corporate greed. Organizers declared they would occupy and blockade the square in front of the ECB "for an undefined period of time." Demonstrators set up a protest camp like those in Madrid and New York with 109 tents and 9 pavilions, soup kitchen and bread line, facility's, generators, W-Lan and live stream and a media team with its own podcast called "Klargestellt" (German for "clarified").

Around 5000 people supported the global protest at the "schlossplatz"

Between 2,000 and 5,000 people joined the rally on 15 October. Since then, a protest camp with currently around 15 tents (as of 22 Oct) is located in front of the <a href="HSH%20Nordbank">HSH Nordbank</a> headquarter.

A small number of Greek and Turkish Cypriot activists gathered in <a href="Eleftheria%20Square">Eleftheria Square</a> in Nicosia as a response to the global call for a protest. Through discussion, they decided to move their protest to the buffer zone located in the Ledra/Lokmacı street. This started the <a href="Occupy%20Buffer%20Zone">Occupy Buffer Zone</a> movement in Cyprus. The movement had a strong focus on the <a href="Cyprus%20Dispute">Cyprus Dispute</a> and its relation to the economic status quo.

A group of protesters organized an occupation of the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> to bring attention to what they see as unethical behavior on the part of banks. By 2:30 pm, police had contained the crowd near the St. Paul's Cathedral, where Wikileaks founder <a href="Julian%20Assange">Julian Assange</a> held a speech, stating that Wikileaks would support the protests through a campaign against financial institutions. A similar protest group inspired by Occupy Wall Street has formed in the UK under the name <a href="OccupyLSX">OccupyLSX</a>. Prostestors also marched through the Scottish Capital, <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and formed a tented encampment on <a href="St%20Andrew%20Square%2C%20Edinburgh">St Andrew's Square</a> to kick off <a href="Occupy%20Edinburgh">Occupy Edinburgh</a>.

In Ireland protests were held throughout the country, including in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>. Now the demonstrations are spreading to Galway as described by "The Irish Times". In the same article this newspaper describes the movement in the following terms: "The group has no hierarchical structure, has set up a Facebook page and Twitter account – with the social media links attracting a very mixed, and sometimes critical, reaction." The protest in Dublin was organized by the <a href="Real%20Democracy%20Now%21%20Ireland">Real Democracy Now! Ireland</a>, Causes United (Ireland) & <a href="Occupy%20Dame%20Street">Occupy Dame Street</a> protest, set up outside the <a href="Central%20Bank%20of%20Ireland">Central Bank of Ireland</a> in solidarity with the <a href="Occupy%20Wall%20Street">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in New York, also continued throughout the day.

In Slovenia protesters gathered in <a href="Koper">Koper</a>, <a href="Maribor">Maribor</a> and the capital, <a href="Ljubljana">Ljubljana</a>, with the latter being the most prominent one. In Koper around 300 people gathered to protest against corruption, capitalism and also against <a href="Port%20of%20Koper">Port of Koper</a>, which is accused of violation of workers' rights. in the capital, people gathered on <a href="Congress%20Square">Congress Square</a> to protest against greed, corruption and capitalism in general. They later moved to <a href="Ljubljana%20Stock%20Exchange">Ljubljana Stock Exchange</a> where an assembly was called. The participants decided to continue the protest by means of symbolic occupation. In the following days, the camp size has risen to some 30 tents with continuing assemblies averaging between 150–200 participants, before ceasing in early 2012.

In Finland there were gatherings at 13 locations. The largest meeting was held at the Narinkkatori square in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> where about 1000 people attended during the day, according to the organizers. Several hundred people gathered also in <a href="Turku">Turku</a>, <a href="Tampere">Tampere</a> and <a href="Jyv%C3%A4skyl%C3%A4">Jyväskylä</a>.

In Hungary there were demonstrations at two cities. A gathering with an assembly and marching was held in the capitol <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> where about 1500 people attended during the day, according to the police and organizers. Several dozen people gathered also in <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pécs</a>.

15 October was the day that many local Occupies started, mainly in the smaller cities. Most of the big cities already had Occupies that people from the smaller cities and towns came to.

In New York City, after police prepared to evict protesters from <a href="Zuccotti%20Park">Zuccotti Park</a> near Wall Street, the protesters marched into the heart of the city where they gathered 10,000 supporters. 76 were arrested, 45 in Times square and 24 at a branch of Citibank. Protests also took place in hundreds of major cities across the US like Washington, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and Dallas and smaller communities like <a href="Champaign%E2%80%93Urbana%20metropolitan%20area">Champaign–Urbana</a>, <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a> <a href="Oklahoma%20City">Oklahoma City</a>, <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>, and <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale</a>.

100 were arrested in Boston, 76 in New York, 175 in Chicago, 50 in Phoenix, 19 in Sacramento, 20 in Raleigh., and 24 in Denver.

12 were arrested in Rome after a part of the protest turned violent.

Abdul Karim (the Munshi)

Mohammed Abdul Karim (1863 – April 1909), known as "the Munshi", was an <a href="British%20Raj">Indian</a> attendant of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. He served her during the final fourteen years of her reign, gaining her maternal affection over that time.

Karim was born the son of a hospital assistant near <a href="Jhansi">Jhansi</a> in <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. In 1887, the year of <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Victoria's Golden Jubilee</a>, Karim was one of two Indians selected to become servants to the Queen. Victoria came to like him a great deal and gave him the title of "<a href="Munshi">Munshi</a>" ("clerk" or "teacher"). Victoria appointed him to be her Indian Secretary, showered him with honours, and obtained a land grant for him in India.

The close platonic relationship between Karim and the Queen led to friction within the <a href="Royal%20Households%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Royal Household</a>, the other members of which felt themselves to be superior to him. The Queen insisted on taking Karim with her on her travels, which caused arguments between her and her other attendants. Following Victoria's death in 1901, her successor, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, returned Karim to India and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the Munshi's correspondence with Victoria. Karim subsequently lived quietly near <a href="Agra">Agra</a>, on the estate that Victoria had arranged for him, until his death at the age of 46.

Mohammed Abdul Karim was born into a Muslim family at Lalitpur near <a href="Jhansi">Jhansi</a> in 1863. His father, Haji Mohammed Waziruddin, was a hospital assistant stationed with the <a href="Central%20India%20Horse">Central India Horse</a>, a British cavalry regiment. Karim had one older brother, Abdul Aziz, and four younger sisters. He was taught Persian and Urdu privately and, as a teenager, travelled across North India and into Afghanistan. Karim's father participated in the conclusive <a href="Battle%20of%20Kandahar">march to Kandahar</a>, which ended the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a>, in August 1880. After the war, Karim's father transferred from the Central India Horse to a civilian position at the Central Jail in <a href="Agra">Agra</a>, while Karim worked as a "vakil" ("agent" or "representative") for the Nawab of <a href="Jaora%20State">Jaora</a> in the Agency of <a href="Agar%2C%20Madhya%20Pradesh">Agar</a>. After three years in Agar, Karim resigned and moved to Agra, to become a <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> clerk at the jail. His father <a href="Arranged%20marriage">arranged a marriage</a> between Karim and the sister of a fellow worker.

Prisoners in the Agra jail were trained and kept employed as carpet weavers as part of their rehabilitation. In 1886, 34 convicts travelled to London to demonstrate carpet weaving at the <a href="Colonial%20and%20Indian%20Exhibition">Colonial and Indian Exhibition</a> in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>. Karim did not accompany the prisoners, but assisted Jail Superintendent John Tyler in organising the trip, and helped to select the carpets and weavers. When <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> visited the exhibition, Tyler gave her a gift of two gold bracelets, again chosen with the assistance of Karim. The Queen had a longstanding interest in her Indian territories and wished to employ some Indian servants for her <a href="Golden%20Jubilee%20of%20Queen%20Victoria">Golden Jubilee</a>. She asked Tyler to recruit two attendants who would be employed for a year. Karim was hastily coached in British manners and in the English language and sent to England, along with Mohammed Buksh. Major-General <a href="Thomas%20Dennehy">Thomas Dennehy</a>, who was about to be appointed to the <a href="Royal%20Household">Royal Household</a>, had previously employed Buksh as a servant. It was planned that the two Indian men would initially wait at table, and learn to do other tasks.

After a journey by rail from Agra to Bombay and by mail steamer to Britain, Karim and Buksh arrived at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> in June 1887. They were put under the charge of Major-General Dennehy and first served the Queen at breakfast in <a href="Frogmore%20House">Frogmore House</a> at Windsor on 23 June 1887. The Queen described Karim in her diary for that day: "The other, much younger, is much lighter <nowiki>[than Buksh]</nowiki>, tall, and with a fine serious countenance. His father is a native doctor at Agra. They both kissed my feet."

Five days later, the Queen noted that "The Indians always wait now and do so, so well and quietly." On 3 August, she wrote: "I am learning a few words of <a href="Hindustani%20language">Hindustani</a> to speak to my servants. It is a great interest to me for both the language and the people, I have naturally never come into real contact with before." On 20 August she had some "excellent <a href="curry">curry</a>" made by one of the servants. By 30 August Karim was teaching her <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, which she used during an audience in December to greet the <a href="Maharani%20Chimnabai">Maharani Chimnabai</a> of <a href="Baroda">Baroda</a>.

Victoria took a great liking to Karim and ordered that he was to be given additional instruction in the English language. By February 1888 he had "learnt English wonderfully" according to Victoria. After he complained to the Queen that he had been a clerk in India and thus menial work as a waiter was beneath him, he was promoted to the position of "<a href="Munshi">Munshi</a>" in August 1888. In her journal, the Queen writes that she made this change so that he would stay: "I particularly wish to retain his services as he helps me in studying Hindustani, which interests me very much, & he is very intelligent & useful." Photographs of him waiting at table were destroyed and he became the first Indian personal clerk to the Queen. Buksh remained in the Queen's service, but only as a "khidmatgar" or table servant, until his death at Windsor in 1899.

According to Karim biographer Sushila Anand, the Queen's own letters testify that "her discussions with the Munshi were wide-ranging—philosophical, political and practical. Both head and heart were engaged. There is no doubt that the Queen found in Abdul Karim a connection with a world that was fascinatingly alien, and a confidant who would not feed her the official line." Karim was placed in charge of the other Indian servants and made responsible for their accounts. Victoria praised him in her letters and journal. "I am so very fond of him" she wrote, "He is so good & gentle & understanding all I want & is a real comfort to me." She admired "her personal Indian clerk & Munshi, who is an excellent, clever, truly p[i]ous & very refined gentle man, who says, 'God ordered it' ... "God's Orders" is what they implicitly obey! Such faith as theirs & such conscientiousness set us a g[rea]t. example." At <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral Castle</a>, the Queen's Scottish estate, Karim was allocated the room previously occupied by <a href="John%20Brown%20%28servant%29">John Brown</a>, a favourite servant of the Queen's who had died in 1883. Despite the serious and dignified manner that Karim presented to the outside world, the Queen wrote that "he is very friendly and cheerful with the Queen's maids and laughs and even jokes now—and invited them to come and see all his fine things offering them fruit cake to eat".

In November 1888, Karim was given four months' leave to return to India, during which time he visited his father. Karim wrote to Victoria that his father, who was due to retire, had hopes of a pension and that his former employer, John Tyler, was angling for promotion. As a result, throughout the first six months of 1889, Victoria wrote to the <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a>, <a href="Henry%20Petty-Fitzmaurice%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Lansdowne">Lord Lansdowne</a>, demanding action on Waziruddin's pension and Tyler's promotion. The Viceroy was reluctant to pursue the issues because Waziruddin had told the local governor, Sir <a href="Auckland%20Colvin">Auckland Colvin</a>, that he desired only gratitude and also because Tyler had a reputation for tactless behaviour and bad-tempered remarks.

Karim's swift rise began to create jealousy and discontent among the members of the <a href="Royal%20Household">Royal Household</a>, who would normally never mingle socially with Indians below the rank of prince. The Queen expected them to welcome Karim, an Indian of ordinary origin, into their midst, but they were not willing to do so. Karim, for his part, expected to be treated as an equal. When <a href="Edward%20VII">Albert Edward, Prince of Wales</a> (later Edward VII), hosted an entertainment for the Queen at his home in <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham</a> on 26 April 1889, Karim found he had been allocated a seat with the servants. Feeling insulted, he retired to his room. The Queen took his part, stating that he should have been seated among the Household. When the Queen attended the <a href="Braemar%23Braemar%20Gathering">Braemar Games</a> in 1890, her son <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn</a>, approached the Queen's private secretary Sir <a href="Henry%20Ponsonby">Henry Ponsonby</a> in outrage after he saw the Munshi among the gentry. Ponsonby suggested that as it was "by the Queen's order", the Duke should approach the Queen about it. "This entirely shut him up", noted Ponsonby.

Victoria biographer <a href="Carolly%20Erickson">Carolly Erickson</a> described the situation:
The rapid advancement and personal arrogance of the Munshi would inevitably have led to his unpopularity, but the fact of his race made all emotions run hotter against him. Racialism was a scourge of the age; it went hand in hand with belief in the appropriateness of Britain's global dominion. For a dark-skinned Indian to be put very nearly on a level with the queen's white servants was all but intolerable, for him to eat at the same table as them, to share in their daily lives was viewed as an outrage. Yet the queen was determined to impose harmony on her household. Race hatred was intolerable to her, and the "dear good Munshi" deserving of nothing but respect.

When complaints were brought to her, Victoria refused to believe any negative comments about Karim. She dismissed concerns about his behaviour, deemed high-handed by Household and staff, as "very wrong". In June 1889, Karim's brother-in-law, Hourmet Ali, sold one of Victoria's brooches to a jeweller in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>. She accepted Karim's explanation that Ali had found the brooch and that it was customary in India to keep anything that one found, whereas the rest of the Household thought Ali had stolen it. In July, Karim was assigned the room previously occupied by Dr (later Sir) <a href="Sir%20James%20Reid%2C%201st%20Baronet">James Reid</a>, Victoria's physician, and given the use of a private sitting room.
The Queen, influenced by the Munshi, continued to write to Lord Lansdowne on the issue of Tyler's promotion and the administration of India. She expressed reservations on the <a href="Indian%20Councils%20Act%201892">introduction of elected councils</a> on the basis that Muslims would not win many seats because they were in the minority, and urged that Hindu feasts be re-scheduled so as not to conflict with Muslim ones. Lansdowne dismissed the latter suggestion as potentially divisive, but appointed Tyler Acting Inspector General of Prisons in September 1889.

To the Household's surprise and concern, during Victoria's stay at Balmoral in September 1889, she and Karim stayed for one night at a remote house on the estate, <a href="Glas-allt-Shiel">Glas-allt-Shiel</a> at <a href="Loch%20Muick">Loch Muick</a>. Victoria had often been there with Brown and after his death had sworn never to stay there again. In early 1890, Karim fell ill with an inflamed <a href="boil">boil</a> on his neck and Victoria instructed Reid, her physician, to attend to Karim. She wrote to Reid expressing her anxiety and explaining that she felt responsible for the welfare of her Indian servants because they were so far from their own land. Reid performed an operation to open and drain the swelling, after which Karim recovered. Reid wrote on 1 March 1890 that the Queen was "visiting Abdul twice daily, in his room taking Hindustani lessons, <a href="Red%20box%20%28government%29%23Royal%20red%20boxes">signing her boxes</a>, examining his neck, smoothing his pillows, etc."

In 1890, the Queen had Karim's portrait painted by <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Angeli">Heinrich von Angeli</a>. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim as he had never painted an Indian before and "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a>, <a href="R.%20A.%20Cross%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cross">Lord Cross</a>, for "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household to look after the Munshi after she was gone, and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as <a href="Maud%20Petty-Fitzmaurice%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Lansdowne">Lady Lansdowne</a>. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to let her know that a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged. Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen:

Lansdowne visited Agra in November 1890. He and the Munshi met, and Lansdowne arranged for Karim to be seated with the viceregal staff during a <a href="Durbar%20%28court%29">durbar</a>. Lansdowne met both the Munshi and Waziruddin privately, and Lady Lansdowne met his wife and mother-in-law, who were smuggled into the Viceroy's camp in secrecy to comply with rules of <a href="Purdah%23India">purdah</a>.

In 1891, after Karim's return to Britain, he asked Reid to send his father a large quantity of medicinal compounds, which included <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a>, <a href="chloral%20hydrate">chloral hydrate</a>, <a href="morphine">morphine</a>, and many other poisons. Reid calculated that the amount requested was "amply sufficient to kill 12,000 to 15,000 full grown men or an enormously large number of children" and consequently refused. Instead, Reid persuaded the Queen that the chemicals should be obtained at her expense by the appropriate authorities in India. In June 1892, Waziruddin visited Britain and stayed at both Balmoral and Windsor Castles. He retired in 1893 and in the <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> 1894 he was rewarded, to Victoria's satisfaction, with the title of "<a href="Khan%20Bahadur%20%28title%29">Khan Bahadur</a>", which Lansdowne noted was "one which under ordinary circumstances the Doctor [could] not have ventured to expect".

In May 1892, the Munshi returned to India on six months' leave; on his return, his wife and mother-in-law accompanied him. Both women were shrouded from head to foot and travelled in railway compartments with drawn curtains. Victoria wrote, "the two Indian ladies ... who are, I believe, the first Mohammedan purdah ladies who ever came over ... keep their custom of complete seclusion and of being entirely covered when they go out, except for the holes for their eyes." As a woman, Victoria saw them without veils. The Munshi and his family were housed in cottages at Windsor, Balmoral and <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne</a>, the Queen's retreat on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. Victoria visited regularly, usually bringing her female guests, including the <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Empress of Russia</a> and the <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Princess of Wales</a>, to meet the Munshi's female relatives. One visitor, Marie Mallet, the Queen's maid-in-waiting and wife of civil servant <a href="Bernard%20Mallet">Bernard Mallet</a>, recorded:

Dr Reid never saw Mrs Karim unveiled, though he claimed that whenever he was called to examine her, a different tongue was protruded from behind the veil for his inspection.

In 1892, the Munshi's name began to appear in the <a href="Court%20Circular">Court Circular</a> among the names of officials accompanying the Queen on her annual March trip to the <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>. As usual, Victoria spent Christmas 1892 at Osborne House, where the Munshi, as he had in previous years, participated in <a href="tableaux%20vivants">tableaux vivants</a> arranged as entertainment. The following year, during Victoria's annual holiday in continental Europe, he was presented to King <a href="Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy">Umberto I of Italy</a>. In the words of a contemporary newspaper account, "The King did not understand why this magnificent and imposing Hindoo should have been formally presented to him. The popular idea in Italy is that the Munshi is a captive Indian prince, who is taken about by the Queen as an outward and visible sign of Her Majesty's supremacy in the East."

By 1893, Victoria was sending notes to Karim signed in Urdu. She often signed off her letters to Karim as "your affectionate mother, VRI" or "your truly devoted and fond loving mother, VRI".

The Munshi was perceived to have taken advantage of his position as the Queen's favourite, and to have risen above his status as a menial clerk, causing resentment in the court. On a journey through Italy, he published an advertisement in the "Florence Gazette" stating that "<nowiki>[h]</nowiki>e is belonging to a good and highly respectful famiely". Karim refused to travel with the other Indians and appropriated the maid's bathroom for his exclusive use. On a visit to <a href="Coburg">Coburg</a>, he refused to attend the marriage of Victoria's granddaughter <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20Melita%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, because her father, Victoria's son <a href="Alfred%2C%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Coburg%20and%20Gotha">Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, assigned him a seat in the gallery with the servants. Confronted by the opposition of her family and retainers, the Queen defended her favourite. She wrote to her private secretary Sir <a href="Henry%20Ponsonby">Henry Ponsonby</a>: "to make out that the poor good Munshi is so "low" is really outrageous & in a country like England quite out of place ... She has known 2 Archbishops who were sons respectively of a Butcher & a Grocer ... Abdul's father saw good & honourable service as a Dr & he [Karim] feels cut to the heart at being thus spoken of."

Lord Lansdowne's term of office ended in 1894, and he was replaced by <a href="Victor%20Bruce%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin">Lord Elgin</a>. Ponsonby's son <a href="Frederick%20Ponsonby%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sysonby">Frederick</a> was Elgin's <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> in India for a short time before being appointed an <a href="equerry">equerry</a> to Victoria. Victoria asked Frederick to visit Waziruddin, the "surgeon-general" at Agra. On his return to Britain, Frederick told Victoria that Waziruddin "was not the surgeon-general but only the apothecary at the jail", which Victoria "stoutly denied" saying Frederick "must have seen the wrong man". To "mark her displeasure", Victoria did not invite Frederick to dinner for a year.

At Christmas 1894, the Munshi sent Lord Elgin a sentimental greeting card, which to Victoria's dismay went unacknowledged. Through Frederick Ponsonby, she complained to Elgin, who replied that he did "not imagine that any acknowledgement was necessary, or that the Queen would expect him to send one", pointing out "how impossible it would be for an Indian Viceroy to enter into correspondence of this kind".

Frederick wrote to Elgin in January 1895 that Karim was deeply unpopular in the Household, and that he occupied "very much the same position as John Brown used to". Princesses <a href="Princess%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Argyll">Louise</a> and <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Beatrice</a>, <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Battenberg">Prince Henry of Battenberg</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Rosebery</a>, and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a> <a href="Henry%20Fowler%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wolverhampton">Henry Fowler</a> had all raised concerns about Karim with the Queen, who "refused to listen to what they had to say but was very angry, so as you see the Munshi is a sort of pet, like a dog or cat which the Queen will not willingly give up". Elgin was warned by both Ponsonby and the <a href="India%20Office">India Office</a> that the Queen gave his letters to the Munshi to read, and that consequently his correspondence to her should not be of a confidential nature. Victoria's advisors feared Karim's association with <a href="Rafiuddin%20Ahmed">Rafiuddin Ahmed</a>, an Indian political activist resident in London who was connected to the Muslim Patriotic League. They suspected that Ahmed extracted confidential information from Karim to pass onto the Amir of Afghanistan, <a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman Khan</a>. There is no indication that these fears were well-founded, or that the Munshi was ever indiscreet.

During the Queen's annual holiday in the French Riviera, in March 1895, the local newspapers ran articles on "Le Munchy", "secrétaire indien" and "le professor de la Reine", which according to Frederick Ponsonby were instigated by Karim. In the Queen's <a href="1895%20Birthday%20Honours">1895 Birthday Honours</a> that May, Karim was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Indian%20Empire">Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire</a> (CIE), despite the opposition of both Rosebery and Fowler. Tyler was astonished by Karim's elevation when he visited England the following month.

After the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201895">United Kingdom general election, 1895</a>, Rosebery and Fowler were replaced by <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a> and <a href="Lord%20George%20Hamilton">Lord George Hamilton</a> respectively. Hamilton thought Karim was not as dangerous as some supposed but that he was "a stupid man, and on that account he may become a tool in the hands of other men." In early 1896, Karim returned to India on six months' leave, and Hamilton and Elgin placed him under "unobtrusive" surveillance. They dared not be too obvious lest the Munshi notice and complain to the Queen. Despite fears that Karim might meet with hostile agents, his visit home appears to have been uneventful.

He left Bombay for Britain in August 1896, bringing with him his young nephew, Mohammed Abdul Rashid. Karim had no children of his own. Victoria had arranged for a <a href="Women%20in%20medicine">female doctor</a> to examine the Munshi's wife in December 1893, as the couple had been trying to conceive without success. By 1897, according to Reid, Karim had <a href="gonorrhea">gonorrhea</a>.

In March 1897 as members of the Household prepared to depart for <a href="Cimiez">Cimiez</a> for the Queen's annual visit, they insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party, and decided to resign if he did so. When <a href="Harriet%20Phipps">Harriet Phipps</a>, one of the Queen's <a href="Maid%20of%20honour">maids of honour</a>, informed her of the collective decision, the Queen swept the contents of her desk onto the floor in a fury. The Household backed down, but the holiday was marred by increased resentment and rows between the Household and Victoria. She thought their distrust and dislike of Karim was motivated by "race prejudice" and jealousy. When Rafiuddin Ahmed joined Karim in Cimiez, the Household forced him to leave, which Victoria thought "disgraceful", and she asked the prime minister to issue an apology to Ahmed, explaining he was only excluded because he had written articles in newspapers and pressmen were not permitted. Ponsonby wrote in late April, "[the Munshi] happens to be a thoroughly stupid and uneducated man, and his one idea in life seems to be to do nothing and to eat as much as he can." Reid warned the Queen that her attachment to Karim had led to questions about her sanity, and Hamilton telegraphed to Elgin requesting information on the Munshi and his family in an effort to discredit him. On receiving Elgin's reply that they were "Respectable and trustworthy ... but position of family humble", Hamilton concluded "the Munshi has done nothing to my knowledge which is reprehensible or deserving of official stricture ... enquiries w[oul]d not be right, unless they were in connection with some definite statement or accusation." He did, however, authorise further investigation of the "Mohamedan intriguer named Rafiuddin". Nothing was ever proven against Ahmed, who later became a <a href="Bombay%20Presidency">Bombay government</a> official and was knighted in 1932. The effect of the row, in Hamilton's words, was "to put him [the Munshi] more into his humble place, and his influence will not be the same in the future".

After the distress of 1897, Victoria sought to reassure the Munshi. "I have in my Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," she wrote to him, "and have constantly thought of you well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is "entirely" and solely "my own idea, not a human being will ever" know of it or what you answer me. If you can't read it I will help you and then burn it "at once"." She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were "the only form of excitement she can have".

Reid seems to have joined with the other Household members in complaining about the Munshi, for the Queen wrote to him, "I thought you stood between me and them, but now I feel that you chime in with the rest." In 1899, members of the Household again insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party when the Queen took her annual holiday at Cimiez. The Queen duly had Karim remain at Windsor, then when the party had settled into the Excelsior Regina hotel, wired Karim to come and join them.

In late 1898 Karim's purchase of a parcel of land adjacent to his earlier grant was finalised; he had become a wealthy man. Reid claimed in his diary that he had challenged Karim over his financial dealings: "You have told the Queen that in India no receipts are given for money, and therefore you ought not to give any to Sir <a href="Fleetwood%20Edwards">F Edwards</a> <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Keeper%20of%20the%20Privy%20Purse">Keeper of the Privy Purse</a><nowiki>]</nowiki>. This is a lie and means that you wish to "cheat" the Queen." The Munshi told the Queen he would provide receipts in answer to the allegations, and Victoria wrote to Reid dismissing the accusations, calling them "shameful".

Karim asked Victoria for the title of "<a href="Nawab">Nawab</a>", the Indian equivalent of a <a href="Peerage">peer</a>, and to appoint him a Knight Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Indian%20Empire">Order of the Indian Empire</a> (KCIE), which would make him "Sir Abdul Karim". A horrified Elgin suggested instead that she make Karim a Member of the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Royal Victorian Order</a> (MVO), which was in her personal gift, bestowed no title, and would have little political implication in India. Privy Purse Sir Fleetwood Edwards and Prime Minister Lord Salisbury advised against even the lower honour. Nevertheless in 1899, on the occasion of her 80th birthday, Victoria appointed Karim a commander of the order (CVO), a rank intermediate between member and knight.

The Munshi returned to India in November 1899 for a year. Waziruddin, described as "a courtly old gentleman" by <a href="George%20Curzon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Curzon%20of%20Kedleston">Lord Curzon</a>, Elgin's replacement as Viceroy, died in June 1900. By the time Karim returned to Britain in November 1900 Victoria had visibly aged, and her health was failing. Within three months she was dead.

After Victoria's death, her son, <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, dismissed the Munshi and his relations from court and had them sent back to India. However, Edward did allow the Munshi to be the last to view Victoria's body before her casket was closed, and to be part of her funeral procession. Almost all of the correspondence between Victoria and Karim was burned on Edward's orders. <a href="Mary%20Curzon%2C%20Baroness%20Curzon%20of%20Kedleston">Lady Curzon</a> wrote on 9 August 1901,
<a href="Charlotte%20Knollys">Charlotte Knollys</a> told me that the Munshi bogie which had frightened all the household at Windsor for many years had proved a ridiculous farce, as the poor man had not only given up "all" his letters but even the photos signed by Queen and had returned to India like a whipped hound. All the Indian servants have gone back so now there is no Oriental picture & queerness at Court.

In 1905–06, <a href="George%20V">George, Prince of Wales</a>, visited India and wrote to the King from Agra, "In the evening we saw the Munshi. He has not grown more beautiful and is getting fat. I must say he was most civil and humble and really pleased to see us. He wore his C.V.O. which I had no idea he had got. I am told he lives quietly here and gives no trouble at all."

The Munshi died at his home, Karim Lodge, on his estate in Agra in 1909. He was survived by two wives, and was interred in a pagoda-like mausoleum in the Panchkuin Kabaristan cemetery in Agra beside his father.

On the instructions of Edward VII, the Commissioner of Agra, W. H. Cobb, visited Karim Lodge to retrieve any remaining correspondence between the Munshi and the Queen or her Household, which was confiscated and sent to the King. The Viceroy (by then <a href="Gilbert%20Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Minto">Lord Minto</a>), Lieutenant-Governor John Hewitt, and India Office civil servants disapproved of the seizure, and recommended that the letters be returned. Eventually the King returned four, on condition that they would be sent back to him on the death of the Munshi's first wife. Karim's family, who had emigrated to <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> during the <a href="Partition%20of%20India">Partition</a>, kept his diary and some of his correspondence from the time concealed until 2010, when it was made public.

As the Munshi had no children, his nephews and grandnephews inherited his wealth and properties. The Munshi's family continued to reside in Agra until Indian independence and the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a> in August 1947, after which they emigrated to <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. The estate, including Karim Lodge, was confiscated by the Indian government and distributed among Hindu refugees from Pakistan. Half of Karim Lodge was subsequently divided into two individual residences, with the remaining half becoming a nursing home and doctor's office.

Until the publication of Frederick Ponsonby's memoirs in 1951, there was little biographical material on the Munshi. Scholarly examination of his life and relationship with Victoria began around the 1960s, focusing on the Munshi as "an illustration of race and class prejudice in Victorian England". <a href="Mary%20Lutyens">Mary Lutyens</a>, in editing the diary of her grandmother Edith (wife of <a href="Robert%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lytton">Lord Lytton</a>, Viceroy of India 1876–80), concluded, "Though one can understand that the Munshi was disliked, as favourites nearly always are ... One cannot help feeling that the repugnance with which he was regarded by the Household was based mostly on snobbery and colour prejudice." Victoria biographer <a href="Elizabeth%20Pakenham%2C%20Countess%20of%20Longford">Elizabeth Longford</a> wrote, "Abdul Karim stirred once more that same royal imagination which had magnified the virtues of John Brown ... Nevertheless, [it] insinuated into her confidence an inferior person, while it increased the nation's dizzy infatuation with an inferior dream, the dream of Colonial Empire."

Historians agree with the suspicions of her Household that the Munshi influenced the Queen's opinions on Indian issues, biasing her against Hindus and favouring Muslims. But suspicions that he passed secrets to Rafiuddin Ahmed are discounted. Victoria asserted that ""no" political papers of any kind are ever in the Munshi's hands, "even" in her presence. He only helps her to read words which she cannot read or merely ordinary submissions on warrants for signature. He does not read English fluently enough to be able to read anything of importance." Consequently, it is thought unlikely that he could have influenced the government's Indian policy or provided useful information to Muslim activists.

The 2017 feature film "<a href="Victoria%20%26amp%3B%20Abdul">Victoria & Abdul</a>", directed by <a href="Stephen%20Frears">Stephen Frears</a> and starring <a href="Ali%20Fazal">Ali Fazal</a> as Abdul Karim and <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a> as Queen Victoria, offers a fictionalised version of the relationship between Karim and the Queen.

HMS Levant (1758)

HMS "Levant" was a 28-gun <a href="sixth-rate">sixth-rate</a> <a href="frigate">frigate</a> of the , which saw <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> service against France in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, and against France, Spain and the American colonies during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Principally a hunter of <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s, she was also designed to be a match for small French frigates, but with a broader hull and sturdier build at the expense of some speed and manoeuvrability. <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">Launched</a> in 1758, "Levant" was assigned to the Royal Navy's <a href="Jamaica%20Station%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Jamaica station</a> from 1759 and proved her worth in defeating nine French vessels during her first three years at sea. She was also part of the <a href="British%20expedition%20against%20Martinique">British expedition against Martinique</a> in 1762 but played no role in the landings or subsequent defeat of French forces at <a href="Fort%20Royal">Fort Royal</a>.

The frigate was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> following Britain's declaration of peace with France in 1763, but returned to service in 1766 for patrol duties in the Caribbean. Decommissioned for a second time in 1770, she was reinstated at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War and sent to the Mediterranean as part of a small British squadron based at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. Over the next three years she captured or sank a total of fourteen enemy craft including an 18-gun American privateer. In 1779 she brought home news of an impending Spanish assault on Gibraltar, ahead of Spain's declaration of war on Great Britain. 

The ageing frigate was finally removed from Navy service later that year, and her crew discharged to other vessels. She was <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up</a> at <a href="Deptford%20Dockyard">Deptford Dockyard</a> in 1780, having secured a total of 31 victories over 21 years at sea.

"Levant" was an oak-built 28-gun <a href="sixth%20rate">sixth rate</a>, one of 19 vessels forming part of the of <a href="Sailing%20frigate">frigates</a>. As with others in her class she was loosely modelled on the design and dimensions of , <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> in 1756 and responsible for capturing five French <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s in her first twelve months at sea. Orders from <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> to build the "Coventry"-class vessels were made after the outbreak of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, and at a time in which the <a href="Royal%20Navy%20Dockyards">Royal Dockyards</a> were fully engaged in constructing or <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> the Navy's <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a>. Consequently, and despite some <a href="Navy%20Board">Navy Board</a> misgivings, contracts for most "Coventry"-class vessels were issued to private shipyards, with an emphasis on rapid completion of the task.

The contract for "Levant"s construction were issued on 20 May 1757 to <a href="shipwright">shipwright</a> <a href="Henry%20Adams%20%28shipbuilder%29">Henry Adams</a> of <a href="Buckler%27s%20Hard">Buckler's Hard</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>. It was stipulated that work should be completed within ten months for the 28-gun vessel measuring approximately 586<a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20Measurement">tons burthen</a>. Subject to satisfactory completion, Adams would receive a comparatively modest fee of £9.5s per ton to be paid through periodic <a href="imprest%20system">imprests</a> drawn against the Navy Board. As private shipyards were not subject to rigorous naval oversight, the Admiralty also granted authority for "such alterations withinboard as shall be judged necessary" in order to cater to the preferences or ability of individual shipwrights.

After consultation with Admiralty, Adams took advantage of this freedom to make four substantive changes to the "Tartar" design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the <a href="mizzen%20mast">mizzen mast</a> to before it to improve the <a href="helmsman">helmsman</a>'s line of sight. The <a href="tiller">tiller</a> was also relocated, from an exposed position on the quarterdeck to a safer location belowdecks and near the <a href="stern">stern</a>. The vessel's <a href="hawsehole">hawsehole</a>s were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, in recognition of the vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the <a href="Bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> in order to form a battery of <a href="chase%20gun">chase gun</a>s.

"Levant"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> in June 1757 but work proceeded slowly and the vessel was not ready for launch until July 1758. As built, "Levant" was long with a keel, a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a <a href="Hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a> depth of . After Adams' modifications, she measured 595 tons burthen, or nearly ten tons larger than the size specified in the contract. Her armament comprised 24 <a href="Naval%20long%20gun">nine-pounder cannons</a> located along her gun deck, supported by four three-pounder cannons on the <a href="quarterdeck">quarterdeck</a> and twelve -pounder <a href="swivel%20guns">swivel guns</a> ranged along her sides. The Admiralty-designated complement was 200, comprising two <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29%23Commissioned%20officers">commissioned officers</a> a <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> and a <a href="lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a> overseeing 40 <a href="Warrant%20officer">warrant</a> and <a href="petty%20officer">petty officer</a>s, 91 <a href="naval%20rating">naval rating</a>s, 38 <a href="Royal%20Marines">Marines</a> and 29 servants and other ranks. Among these other ranks were four positions reserved for <a href="widow%27s%20man">widow's men</a> fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the families of sailors who died at sea.

The vessel was named after <a href="Levant">the Levant</a>, an area of the eastern <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>. In selecting her name the Board of Admiralty continued a tradition, dating to 1644, of using geographic features. Overall, ten of the nineteen "Coventry"-class vessels, including "Levant", were named after well-known regions, rivers or towns. With few exceptions the remainder of the class were named after figures from <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, following a more modern trend initiated in 1748 by <a href="John%20Montagu%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Sandwich">John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich</a> in his capacity as <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>. In sailing qualities "Levant" was broadly comparable with French frigates of equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her <a href="broadside">broadside</a> guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed which, when coupled with Adams' modifications, provided ample space for provisions, the <a href="mess">ship's mess</a> and a large <a href="magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazine</a> for <a href="gunpowder">powder</a> and <a href="round%20shot">round shot</a>. Taken together, these characteristics would enable "Levant" to remain at sea for long periods without resupply. She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced the weight of her hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.

"Levant" was launched on 6 July 1758 and sailed to <a href="Portsmouth%20Dockyard">Portsmouth Dockyard</a> for fitting-out and to take on armament and crew. She was formally commissioned in October, entering Royal Navy service during the early stages of the Seven Years' War against France. Command was assigned to Captain William Tucker, a nephew of London philanthropist <a href="Ralph%20Allen">Ralph Allen</a>, and previously the commander of the sixth-rate . There were delays in mustering sufficient crew, and the frigate was not finally ready to put to sea until June 1759. On 14 June Captain Tucker received orders to take position off <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a> and the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>, there to join a squadron commanded by Commodore John Moore. "Levant" set sail for this assignment on 23 July.

The British squadron, of which "Levant" was part, was tasked with disrupting French trade through the Caribbean and hunting privateers. However the frigate saw little action in her first six months in the region; French trade had virtually ceased since the outbreak of war with Britain, while a <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> outbreak killed some among "Levant"s crew. It was not until early 1760 that "Levant" defeated her first opponent, a 14-gun French privateer which was sunk with the loss of 120 of her crew. Thereafter combat was more frequent. Two small privateers were captured in early 1760 – the 8-gun "Poissan Volante" and the 12-gun "St Pierre" – and these vessels and their crews were delivered into British custody on the Leeward Islands. In June "Pickering", a British merchantman previously captured by the French, was retaken and sailed to <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a> as "Levant"s prize. A further victory followed on 29 June with the capture of French privateer "Le Scipio", after which "Levant" was put into harbour in Antigua for resupply. One contemporary source at this time records her as carrying only 20 of her 28 guns. She returned to sea before the end of the year, capturing the privateer "L'Union" on 18 December.

British military successes in European waters in 1760 offered freedom for the Navy to support offensive operations in the Caribbean in the following year. In January Major General <a href="Robert%20Monckton">Robert Monckton</a> set sail from North America to the Caribbean with 2,000 men and four ships of the line, for a planned invasion of <a href="Dominica">French Dominica</a>. "Levant" saw little action in advance of Monckton's arrival and captured only one vessel, the privateer "La Catherine", on 15 February. Monckton arrived in Antigua shortly after this capture; Captain Tucker was then deputised to carry the general aboard "Levant" for a visit to the various Leeward Island settlements while the invasion force assembled at Guadeloupe. Monckton departed the Leeward Islands in April and "Levant" resumed her hunt for privateers, capturing "La Dulcinée" on 13 July and "L'Aventurier" six days later. Another French privateer, "Conquerant", was captured on 19 November while "Levant" was in company with her fellow Royal Navy frigate, the 26-gun . At least four other vessels were also taken in this period; "Superbe", "Polly", "Petit-Creolle" and "Elizabeth."

Dominica having fallen to Monckton's forces in June, the British then set their sights on the French stronghold of <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>. Britain's <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Southern%20Department">Secretary of State for the Southern Department</a>, Sir <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt</a>, concluded that Martinique's capture would be the decisive battle for control of the Caribbean, and instructed that all available resources be committed to its invasion. An army of 13,000 troops was assembled, supported by a fleet under Admiral <a href="George%20Rodney">George Rodney</a>. "Levant" was added to Rodney's sizeable command in late 1761 and sailed as part of the <a href="British%20expedition%20against%20Martinique">expedition</a> in January 1762. She was present when the British landings commenced but is not recorded as having engaged with enemy forces either there or in the subsequent French defeat at <a href="Fort%20Royal">Fort Royal</a> between 25 January and 3 February.

"Levant" then returned to her station off the Leeward Islands, arriving there on 10 February. Captain Tucker had fallen ill with <a href="gout">gout</a>, and on 20 February he was replaced by Captain <a href="John%20Laforey">John Laforey</a>, previously of the sixth-rate . "Levant" made one capture under Laforey's command, and her last victory in that war, when she defeated French privateer "La Fier" on 13 May 1762. 

The 1763 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris</a> brought an end to the war between Britain and France, and "Levant" was subsequently declared surplus to the Navy's needs. She was in poor condition; Captain Laforey reported to Admiralty that rats had eaten through the hull and substantial work would be required to keep the ship afloat. Repairs were commenced, but by April 1763 Laforey had departed the vessel and command was transferred to Captain <a href="Molyneux%20Shuldham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Shuldham">Molyneux Shuldham</a> for the voyage back to England. Restored to seaworthiness, "Levant" reached Portsmouth Dockyard in August, where she was <a href="ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> and her crew discharged or reassigned. 

There were rumours that "Levant" would swiftly return to active service, but these proved unfounded and she remained tied up at Portsmouth. Her hull and fittings were surveyed in late 1763 to determine maintenance requirements, but no repairs were made. In September 1763 a member of her <a href="skeleton%20crew">skeleton crew</a> was robbed and murdered at <a href="Liphook">Liphook</a>, a village some distance from Portsmouth.

"Levant" returned to Navy service in 1766 under the command of Captain Basil Keith, and was assigned to patrol and convoy duties on the Navy's <a href="Jamaica%20Station%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Jamaica Station</a>. In August she docked at <a href="Deptford%20Dockyard">Deptford</a> to take on crew and supplies, setting sail for the Caribbean on 28 November. "Levant" held her Jamaica post for three years, but this extensive service in tropical waters left her in poor condition. In 1770 she returned to Deptford Dockyard where she was decommissioned and hauled out of the water for rebuilding. The work was granted to shipwright John Dudman and took six months from November 1770 to April 1771. Repair and rebuilding expenses were £5,869 with an additional £3,059 for fitting-out, amounting to considerably more than the vessel's original construction cost of £5,423.

The rebuilt frigate was recommissioned in August 1771 under Captain Samuel Thompson. After four months in home waters she was assigned to the Navy's Mediterranean squadron and took up position off <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> in January 1772. "Levant" remained at this station for three years, her uneventful service broken only by a 1773 transfer of command from Captain Thompson to Captain <a href="George%20Murray%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%2C%20born%201741%29">George Murray</a>, the son of former <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> commander <a href="Lord%20George%20Murray%20%28general%29">Lord Murray</a>.

"Levant" returned to Portsmouth in early 1775, but put to sea again on 22 June amid the early stages of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Captain Murray's orders were to join a Mediterranean squadron under the overall command of Captain <a href="Robert%20Mann%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Robert Mann</a>, which was tasked with intercepting merchant vessels suspected of supplying American rebels. While at sea Murray also took the opportunity to train his crew in seamanship and battle techniques, in preparation for future enemy engagement. In March 1776 she anchored in the Bay of <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> where the <a href="Dey%20of%20Algiers">Dey</a>, or local ruler, received her warmly and provided the crew with supplies of bread, vegetables, and three live sheep.

Mediterranean trade was busy, and "Levant" took part in halting and examining vessels with crews of various nationalities including Dutch, Genoese, Spanish, and the British Caribbean. Neutral shipping was permitted to continue on its way. However "Levant" detained a <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> merchantman named "Dolphin" in October 1776, on suspicion of being a supply vessel for the rebels, and sent her into Gibraltar along with her cargo of rice. In November 1776 "Levant" secured a substantial prize with the capture of another South Carolina vessel, "Argo", carrying rice and indigo worth £37,200. "Argo" was to have exchanged her cargo in <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> for clothing and medicine to supply the American rebellion.

Further success followed in early 1777 with the capture of the 18-gun American privateer "General Montgomery". News had reached England that this vessel was off the island of <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> in March, having sailed from the <a href="Port%20of%20Philadelphia">Port of Philadelphia</a> in February with a crew of 100 men. "Levant" was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the "General Montgomery" at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered "Levant" to fly <a href="false%20colours">false colours</a>, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. "General Montgomery" had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed "Levant" to draw near, finally turning to flee when Murray fired a warning shot. A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and "Levant" was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of "General Montgomery"s crew enlisted aboard "Levant", with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions until the end of the war.

"Levant" continued her Mediterranean patrols in 1778 and was rewarded on 24 March with the recapture of a British merchantman which had been bound for <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a> when seized by an American privateer off Gibraltar. On the same day as this capture, "Levant" fell into company with the 28-gun frigate . Her captain, Sir Thomas Rich, advised that he was pursuing , a 22-gun American privateer with three captured merchant ships in tow. On 21 March the privateer had surprised and destroyed "Enterprise"s <a href="tender%20%28boat%29">tender</a> before escaping into the night. Rich had given chase for the next three days; Murray now added "Levant" to the hunt and the two British frigates set courses to <a href="windward%20and%20leeward">windward and leeward</a> of the Americans' likely path. Both sailed through the night without sighting their prey. In the morning of 25 March they encountered one of "Revenge"s prizes, the 16-gun British merchantman "Hope", which promptly surrendered and was returned to Gibraltar. "Revenge" herself eluded capture and was later reported as having escaped to the neutral Spanish port of <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>.

France entered the war against Britain after signing a formal <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">Treaty</a> with the United States in March 1778. There was a subsequent reorganization of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean, with "Levant" joining a squadron of four other vessels based in Gibraltar under the overall direction of Admiral <a href="Robert%20Duff%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Robert Duff</a>. Of this squadron, "Levant" was the second largest, behind only Duff's 60-gun flagship . In July "Levant" encountered and captured "Robert", an American merchant vessel that had been bound for Boston with a cargo of salt. In August she took her first French prize of the War a merchantman with a cargo of tobacco and recaptured the British schooner "Lively", which had previously been seized by an American privateer off Scotland's <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Western Islands</a>. Two more French prizes followed: "Victorieux" seized "en route" to Marseilles, and "Duchess of Grumont", which surrendered off Toulon. The captured vessels were sent under guard to Gibraltar.

These ongoing victories belied the changing conditions applicable to "Levant"s hunt for enemy vessels off Gibraltar. American vessels had become scarce, especially since Spain had closed her ports to them in the winter of 1777 in retaliation for privateer attacks on Spanish ships. French trading vessels remained at sea but were occasionally accompanied by naval escorts large enough to prevent their capture by Gibraltar's small Royal Navy squadron. "Levant" was <a href="careening">careened</a> on a beach at Gibraltar over Christmas 1778 and then returned to sea, but her next capture was not until 14 March 1779 when in company with Captain Rich's "Enterprise" she seized a French vessel, "Thésée". A further victory followed on 1 April when "Levant", still in company with "Enterprise", took "Eclair", a French <a href="xebec">xebec</a> carrying wine and <a href="brandy">brandy</a> from Marseilles.

On 12 April 1779 Spain signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Aranjuez%20%281779%29">Treaty of Aranjuez</a> with France, setting terms for a joint military alliance against Britain. Despite the Treaty Spain delayed the formal declaration of war until June, to give time for better co-ordination of its battle fleet. In the interim "Levant" engaged and defeated a Spanish privateer whose crew were caught in the act of boarding a British merchant ship. A brief exchange of cannon fire holed the Spanish vessel below the waterline, sinking her; "Levant" rescued the majority of her crew and transported them to prison in Gibraltar.

Captain Murray then took "Levant" on a cruise to hunt for French or American vessels off Cadiz. While pursuing this task in June 1779 he ran across the Spanish battle fleet, comprising 32 ships of the line and two frigates, heading south towards an unknown destination. Spain was still nominally a neutral power and after a brief exchange of pleasantries the Spanish fleet left "Levant" unmolested and continued on its way. Murray immediately set sail for England to report that the Spanish were at sea, pausing off <a href="Land%27s%20End">Land's End</a> on 17 July to capture the French privateer "La Revanche". "Levant" finally reached Portsmouth in late July but by this time Murray's news of the Spanish fleet was out of date; Spain had already declared war on Britain and her fleet had reached Gibraltar to commence an <a href="Great%20Siege%20of%20Gibraltar">extended siege</a>.

Murray was ordered to take "Levant" back to sea immediately, departing Portsmouth on 27 July as escort to a convoy of merchant vessels bound for the Yorkshire port of <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a>. The ageing frigate then briefly joined a small Navy squadron on patrol off <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> before setting sail for the Spanish coast. On 5 August she took part in the recapture of a British merchant vessel, "Nine Colliers". She was off Cadiz in October 1779 when she won her final victory of the war, capturing the 20-gun Spanish privateer "Velenza de Alcantara" along with 200 of her crew.

But by month's end "Levant" was back in Portsmouth, where she was decommissioned and her crew discharged to other vessels. She had been at sea for 21 years, outlasting all but four of her sister ships in the "Coventry" class. Her erstwhile captain, George Murray, was assigned to command the 30-gun <a href="fifth%20rate">fifth rate</a> frigate ; he was promoted to the rank of <a href="admiral">admiral</a> in 1794, and died in 1797.

Despite "Levant"s age there was still some consideration of restoring her to active service. As late as 1 August 1780 there were newspaper reports that she was "repairing and will soon be fit for sea", but no repairs were made. On 16 August, Admiralty issued orders that she be sailed to Deptford Dockyard where, on 27 September, she was <a href="Ship%20breaking">broken up</a>. Her passing was mourned by her crew, with their sentiments recorded by "Levant"s former first lieutenant, Erasmus Gower, that "having captured so considerable a number of prizes ... few vessels, perhaps, have ever quitted a station with more éclat respecting herself, and more regret from the officers and other persons concerned, who derived advantage from her good fortune and the activity of her people."

Poppy Meadow

Poppy Meadow is a fictional character from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> soap opera "<a href="EastEnders">EastEnders</a>", played by <a href="Rachel%20Bright">Rachel Bright</a>. She was introduced by executive producer <a href="Bryan%20Kirkwood%20%28producer%29">Bryan Kirkwood</a> on 11 January 2011 as the best friend of established character <a href="Jodie%20Gold">Jodie Gold</a> (<a href="Kylie%20Babbington">Kylie Babbington</a>) in scenes filling in for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline. Poppy returned to the series in June 2011 as a supporting character and comedy element, in a move that was generally welcomed by the tabloid press; her storylines focused on her friendship with Jodie and their intertwined love lives. Both Jodie and Poppy left the series on 14 November 2011, but the possibility was left open for Poppy to return in the future. In June 2012 Bright reprised her role as Poppy, moving into <a href="Walford">Walford</a> and resuming her employment at the local beauty salon, this time as a regular character. Poppy's storylines became more prominent, her sister <a href="Tansy%20Meadow">Tansy</a> (<a href="Daisy%20Wood-Davis">Daisy Wood-Davis</a>) was introduced, along with the development of a romantic relationship with <a href="Fatboy%20%28EastEnders%29">Fatboy</a> (<a href="Ricky%20Norwood">Ricky Norwood</a>). The character was axed in September 2013 by new executive producer <a href="Dominic%20Treadwell-Collins">Dominic Treadwell-Collins</a>, and Poppy departed on 30 January 2014.

Poppy was introduced into the series in what critics described as "bizarre and utterly irrelevant" and "pointless" scenes, which substituted for cut scenes of the dead baby's parents at the graveside. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" critic Stuart Heritage considered Poppy to be "perhaps the greatest television bit-part character of the modern age" and several "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" writers gave Poppy positive reviews upon both of her returns.

Poppy arrives in <a href="Walford">Walford</a> as the best friend of <a href="Jodie%20Gold">Jodie Gold</a> (<a href="Kylie%20Babbington">Kylie Babbington</a>), chatting in <a href="The%20Queen%20Victoria">The Queen Victoria</a> about their daily lives and current affairs. Jodie tries to arrange a date for Poppy with <a href="Tamwar%20Masood">Tamwar Masood</a> (<a href="Himesh%20Patel">Himesh Patel</a>), until Tamwar's mother, <a href="Zainab%20Masood">Zainab</a> (<a href="Nina%20Wadia">Nina Wadia</a>), interferes with her plans. Poppy returns to Walford some months later, now dating Jodie's ex-boyfriend Julian. When Poppy loses her job, Jodie suggests she work at the Walford beauty salon as a receptionist. <a href="Tyler%20Moon">Tyler Moon</a> (Tony Discipline) flirts with Poppy, who initially rejects his advances, but after she reveals that her relationship with Julian is problematic she decides to date Tyler, to make Julian jealous. Off-screen she ends her relationship with Julian. Jodie and her boyfriend <a href="Darren%20Miller">Darren</a> (<a href="Charlie%20G.%20Hawkins">Charlie G. Hawkins</a>) become engaged; she asks Poppy, <a href="Lauren%20Branning">Lauren Branning</a> (<a href="Jacqueline%20Jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a>) and Lauren's sister <a href="Abi%20Branning">Abi</a> (<a href="Lorna%20Fitzgerald">Lorna Fitzgerald</a>) to be her bridesmaids. Darren is anxious that if Jodie finds out he had a "drunken encounter" with Lauren at his <a href="Bachelor%20party">stag party</a> she may cancel the wedding, but Poppy discovers his secret and threatens to tell Jodie if they do not. Jodie subsequently admits that she already knows and still wants to get married, but Darren calls off the wedding and leaves Walford. Poppy moves out of her mother's home and into a flat with Jodie, which they rent from <a href="Ian%20Beale">Ian Beale</a> (<a href="Adam%20Woodyatt">Adam Woodyatt</a>). After he increases their rent they refuse to pay, which leads to their eviction, and the girls move in with Tyler and his brother, <a href="Anthony%20Moon">Anthony</a> (<a href="Matt%20Lapinskas">Matt Lapinskas</a>); it soon becomes clear that Poppy is attracted to Anthony. He asks her out on a date, despite admitting to his brother that he has stronger feelings for Jodie, whom he later kisses. Remorseful, Jodie decides to leave London. She admits the kiss to Poppy, who is furious and refuses to speak to her. Tyler tricks the two girls into meeting up, and they are able to repair their friendship. Poppy also decides to leave London and goes to live with her mother in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, while Jodie goes to find Darren.

Poppy returns months later to help <a href="Tanya%20Branning">Tanya Branning</a> (<a href="Jo%20Joyner">Jo Joyner</a>), who is hired by <a href="Janine%20Butcher">Janine Butcher</a> (<a href="Charlie%20Brooks">Charlie Brooks</a>) to do her hair and make up for her wedding. Poppy tells Janine and Tanya about her "plush" new lifestyle, but when she arrives home her living arrangements are far from glamorous, and there is an eviction notice on her front door. Poppy is subsequently evicted from her bedsit, but <a href="Fatboy%20%28EastEnders%29">Fatboy</a> (<a href="Ricky%20Norwood">Ricky Norwood</a>) offers her a place to stay, and Tanya offers Poppy a permanent job at the salon. Poppy then moves into <a href="Dot%20Cotton">Dot Cotton</a>'s (<a href="June%20Brown">June Brown</a>) house after being offered a room by <a href="Cora%20Cross">Cora Cross</a> (<a href="Ann%20Mitchell">Ann Mitchell</a>). Poppy forgives Anthony, and begins a new friendship with <a href="Alice%20Branning">Alice Branning</a> (<a href="Jasmyn%20Banks">Jasmyn Banks</a>). She starts a relationship with Fatboy, after her sister <a href="Tansy%20Meadow">Tansy Meadow</a>'s (<a href="Daisy%20Wood-Davis">Daisy Wood-Davis</a>) visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's "high-flying" businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, in an effort to make herself look good in front of her younger "successful" sister. Although it is revealed that Tansy is not that successful, she tells Poppy that Fatboy loves her. The two start a relationship and later declare their love for each other. After a few months, Poppy sees text messages on Fatboy's phone from a girl called <a href="List%20of%20EastEnders%20characters%20%282013%29%23Chloe">Chloe</a> (Siobhan Athwal), and suspects he is cheating on her, and is further upset when she sees them together. However, Fatboy reveals that Chloe is his colleague and he has started working at McKlunkies again. Poppy is then made redundant when owner <a href="Sadie%20Young">Sadie Young</a> (<a href="Kate%20Magowan">Kate Magowan</a>) decides to leave Walford after discovering that her husband <a href="Jake%20Stone%20%28EastEnders%29">Jake Stone</a> (<a href="Jamie%20Lomas">Jamie Lomas</a>) has been having an affair with <a href="Lauren%20Branning">Lauren Branning</a> (<a href="Jacqueline%20Jossa">Jacqueline Jossa</a>), which causes Poppy to act cold towards Lauren.

Poppy interferes in Dot's relationship with her son, <a href="Nick%20Cotton">Nick</a> (<a href="John%20Altman%20%28actor%29">John Altman</a>), telling him that his mother does not want to speak to him. She then allows Fatboy to stay with her after Tamwar throws him out. Poppy is then devastated to learn that Fatboy shared a passionate kiss with <a href="Denise%20Fox">Denise Fox</a> (<a href="Diane%20Parish">Diane Parish</a>), after hearing the pair whispering about it. She then learns that Fatboy and Denise had slept together before he was even in a relationship with Poppy. This infuriates Poppy, who storms over to the Minute Mart and confronts Denise, leading to the two women clashing in the shop. Poppy then returns home and tells Fatboy that she has forgiven him, but she needs to move away from Walford so that they can have a fresh start. Fatboy refuses to move and says he wants to end their relationship. She packs her bags and leaves Walford for <a href="Hemel%20Hempstead">Hemel Hempstead</a>, but not before posting a letter through Ian's letterbox, detailing about his fiancée's infidelity.

Poppy initially appeared as a guest character in two episodes, broadcast on 11 and 13 January 2011, in "filler" scenes that were substituted for those cut from a controversial baby-swap storyline in which <a href="Ronnie%20Branning">Ronnie Branning</a> (<a href="Samantha%20Womack">Samantha Womack</a>)'s son <a href="James%20Branning">James</a> dies of <a href="sudden%20infant%20death%20syndrome">sudden infant death syndrome</a>, and she secretly swaps him with <a href="Kat%20Moon">Kat Moon</a>'s (<a href="Jessie%20Wallace">Jessie Wallace</a>) son, <a href="Tommy%20Moon">Tommy</a>. A spokeswoman for "EastEnders" claimed that although some of the baby-swap scenes had been edited in response to reaction from viewers, none had been removed: "Given the audience response to this storyline, we felt on this occasion that it was appropriate to respond and make some changes. The vast majority of material remains intact and we don't believe that those trims we have made will weaken or detract from the overall storyline for viewers". In an interview with the "Daily Mirror," Bright stated that her first scene was her favourite throughout her tenure, as "all [she] could think was, 'I'm sitting on a bench in the Square!'" Babbington, who played Jodie, revealed in May 2011 that Bright was to reprise her role. Bright made her return on 30 June 2011.

In 19 September 2011 episode, Poppy discovers that Jodie's fiance Darren (Hawkins) has cheated on her. Hawkins assessed the situation Poppy was in: "as everyone knows, Poppy's loyalties lie with Jodie – they're super best friends! Poppy wants Darren to own up straight away, because she feels that if he doesn't, she'll be lying to Jodie as well". He explained, "Poppy doesn't want to see Jodie in pain, but she can't keep the secret". Poppy and Jodie were reportedly used to add humour to the soap, in the style of reality-drama series "<a href="The%20Only%20Way%20Is%20Essex">The Only Way Is Essex</a>", but "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" assessed that the attempt had "flopped". On 24 October 2011 it was announced that the pair were to leave the show. Her departure storyline saw her to start to date Anthony (Lapinskas), who considered his character to be "pleased that somebody likes him". He added that while his character was also interested in Jodie, he did what he thought was expected of him in asking Poppy out. After he and Jodie kissed, Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy. An "<a href="Inside%20Soap">Inside Soap</a>" writer predicted that Anthony was heading for trouble, and that he was "playing with fire" by kissing both Poppy and Jodie. A source told RTÉ, "[Jodie] and Poppy have never let a man come between them. Poppy may have something to say to Jodie when she finds out they have kissed". The <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a> Daniel Kilkelly and the "<a href="Daily%20Star%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Daily Star</a>" Susan Hill confirmed that Poppy would forgive Jodie, and they made their final appearance on 14 November 2011. According to an "EastEnders" spokesperson, there was potential for Poppy to return in the future; in an interview with "Inside Soap", "EastEnders" executive producer <a href="Bryan%20Kirkwood%20%28producer%29">Bryan Kirkwood</a> said: "We may see Poppy pop up as I'm a big fan of Rachel Bright and the character, but Kylie is keen to pursue other roles".

On 18 May 2012 Daniel Kilkelly of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a> confirmed that Bright would be reprising her role and returning to "EastEnders". On her return, Bright said that it was "really exciting to be asked back", saying that it was "nice to just slot back in", adding, "I feel really lucky". Talking to "Inside Soap's" Allison Jones and Laura-Jayne Tyler, Bright said of her return, "The door was always left open for Poppy, but it was a big surprise to be asked back so quickly. I thought it might be further down the track, so when my agent rang, I was like, 'Yes — no problem!'". Bright stated that "fear crept over" when she was filming her first scene since her departure, as it was without Babbington. She added that she felt "safe working with Kylie", but felt that without her the audience might get to know Poppy better. In Poppy's return storyline on 12 June, she arrived back in Walford to help Tanya (Joyner) with Janine's (Brooks) wedding preparations. A spokesperson for the show claimed that Poppy had become "a successful <a href="nail%20artist">nail artist</a>" since her departure, but as Poppy's storylines progress that is revealed to be untrue; Poppy was trying to impress Tanya. Bright said in an "Inside Soap" interview of Poppy's storylines, "I think her job in Walford is to keep things light, and right now Poppy's in a happy place. She'll carry on dipping in and out of storylines, but viewers can expect to see more of her soon. I'm excited about that!". The magazine added that Poppy had made a "welcome return". Poppy begins a new friendship with Alice (Banks), who was stated to be a replacement for Jodie. Bright said of this new friendship, "They are polar opposites, but that works. I think Poppy almost mothers Alice by looking after her and giving her good advice. Or at least it's what Poppy thinks is good advice!".

Many viewers and fans of "EastEnders" expected Poppy's return to be only temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor <a href="Lorraine%20Newman">Lorraine Newman</a> decided that Bright will remain with "EastEnders" for the foreseeable future as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is "less than enthusiastic" to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, "The backroom staff had a lot of fun planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is "plenty more on the table" for Poppy adding, "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair "grow close" after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's "high-flying" businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with "<a href="Metro%20%28British%20newspaper%29">Metro</a>" she said, "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so when I came back and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship "looks long term".

The couple were at the center of a <a href="Red%20Button%20%28digital%20television%29">Red Button</a> <a href="Spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> episode, featuring how Poppy and Fatboy spent their Christmas together. The spinoff, entitled "<a href="All%20I%20Want%20for%20Christmas%20%28EastEnders%29">All I Want for Christmas</a>", featured the characters of Alice, Tyler (Discipline) and Tamwar (Patel), with Wood-Davis reprising her role as Tansy, whilst Keith Parry guest starred as "Santa Tramp". Bright said of the spinoff, "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [in the Christmas episode] because it is dominated by the <a href="Branning%20family">Brannings</a>. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", calling them the "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, "It's all very sweet for them both at the moment. I reckon they're going to be one of those couples who you want to shout 'Get a room!' at. They're characters who need to be loved. Poppy certainly hopes she's found her <a href="Prince%20Charming">Prince Charming</a>".

On 24 September 2013, it was announced that Poppy, along with three other characters—<a href="Kirsty%20Branning">Kirsty Branning</a> (<a href="Kierston%20Wareing">Kierston Wareing</a>), <a href="AJ%20Ahmed">AJ Ahmed</a> (<a href="Phaldut%20Sharma">Phaldut Sharma</a>) and <a href="Carl%20White">Carl White</a> (<a href="Daniel%20Coonan">Daniel Coonan</a>)—had been axed from the series by the new executive producer <a href="Dominic%20Treadwell-Collins">Dominic Treadwell-Collins</a>. It was reported that Treadwell-Collins was "determined to get "EastEnders" back to its best" and subsequently increase ratings. A "EastEnders" source added that Treadwell-Collins "didn't feel the characters who are leaving fit with the direction he is taking the show", leading to these characters being written out. The source continued; "He has only been in a month but he is already making big changes. He knows what he wants for "EastEnders" and is putting plans in place quickly". An "EastEnders" spokesperson confirmed this saying, "We can confirm these actors will be leaving "EastEnders". We wish them all the best". Bright filmed her final scenes before Christmas 2013 and Poppy departed in the last week of January 2014, after her relationship with Fatboy ended.

Poppy, Jodie's best friend, is a beautician. The "EastEnders" website describes Poppy as "a little bit 'uncomplicated'", but "no push over" and that she "brings out the best in everyone". Several critics have described Poppy as "ditzy". Sarah Dempster of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" deemed her "dumb", and <a href="Raidi%C3%B3%20Teilif%C3%ADs%20%C3%89ireann">RTÉ</a> Sarah Hardy called her "insanely grating". In a press release announcing Poppy and Jodie's departure, they were described as "giggly girls"; Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly, the "Daily Star" and "<a href="The%20List%20%28magazine%29">The List</a>" have similarly referred to them as a "ditzy duo". Bright stated in an interview that in real life she is "nothing like Poppy" but did later add, when asked if she would be a good beautician in real life, "I'm quite a perfectionist and I think Poppy is too".

Commenting on Poppy's 2012 return the BBC added, "The lure of Walford was too great and she's back to spread sunshine in <a href="Albert%20Square">Albert Square</a> again". Bright called her "fabulous", "cool" and "dappy" compared to her in real life. Writers of "Inside Soap" called her "bubbly" and "perky", calling her an "aspiring beautician". "The Sun" Anne Richardson called Poppy a "soap siren" adding that Poppy has "flower power". In 2012, Bright said that the public ask her why she is talking differently from Poppy, adding that she is "definitely one of a kind, so fans tend to be quite shocked when they realise I'm completely different from her". Bright said she both loves and hates Poppy's dress sense, as she has some items of clothing that are "really cute" but "the way she puts things together is slightly crazy! It's eccentric, but that suits Poppy".

Poppy's introduction to "EastEnders" in what Jody Thompson of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" described as "a bizarre and utterly irrelevant chat" was criticised by Daniella Graham of the "Metro", who said that "viewers were left questioning why on earth anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary". In contrast, "<a href="The%20Press%20and%20Journal%20%28Scotland%29">The Press and Journal</a>" Derek Lord deemed Poppy to have been "a welcome addition to the show"; he wrote that, "as a double act, [Jodie and Poppy are] no <a href="Morecambe%20and%20Wise">Morecambe and Wise</a>, but at least they bring an element of something approaching humour to the otherwise soul-destroying drabness of the London soap". <a href="Jim%20Shelley%20%28TV%20critic%29">Jim Shelley</a> of the "Daily Mirror" labelled Poppy the "Optimist of the week" for her line "I bet it's really nice here when they ain't having a funeral", and "Delicate flower of the week" for her "That is so well tragic innit?" when commenting on <a href="Tommy%20Moon">Tommy Moon</a>'s death. Stuart Heritage from "<a href="guardian.co.uk">guardian.co.uk</a>" said that Poppy made an impact in her two episodes, branding her as "perhaps the greatest television bit-part character of the modern age". Heritage added that she had "the name of a <a href="Bond%20girl">Bond girl</a>, the hair of a <a href="Claudia%20Winkleman">Winkleman</a> and the voice of a <a href="Katie%20Price">Katie Price</a> robot running low on batteries"; describing her as "electrifying", he hoped that she would return. Katy Moon from "Inside Soap" discussed Poppy's original two episode stint:

Upon Poppy's return in 2011, she and Jodie were widely known as a "double act". Roz Laws of the "<a href="Sunday%20Mercury">Sunday Mercury</a>" welcomed Poppy's return, observing that "Walford needs all the humour it can get these days". The "Daily Mail" Jaci Stephen loved Poppy and Jodie's scenes: "Great girls, excellent pairing and very funny. More, please!" In the "Daily Mirror", Jennifer Rodger called them a "refreshing change", and Tony Stewart deemed them "The daftest girls in Soapland and probably the funniest". Stewart was one of several critics to express displeasure over their axing, describing it as "a shame". Jane Simon and Brian McIver of the "<a href="Daily%20Record%20%28Scotland%29">Daily Record</a>" described them as "an adorable female double act [and] E20's answer to <a href="2%20Shoes">2 Shoes</a>", and wrote of their departure, "apparently there just isn't enough room for sunny, funny, glass-half-full types in Walford". "The Sun" Colin Robertson noted that Jodie, Poppy and <a href="Norman%20Simmonds">Norman Simmonds</a> (<a href="George%20Layton">George Layton</a>), who was axed at the same time as the duo, were "EastEnders" "three funniest characters"; a critic writing for "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" suggested that they had "injected some humour into the famously gloomy soap". "The Daily Mirror" Rodger said that she was "sad" that the duo had left, saying that she "found their scenes together hilarious", hoping that she would see both Bright and Babbington in a new show together. Bright stated that during her main stint in 2011, she received mail telling her saying how much fans liked the double act between Poppy and Jodie, and that they were a "breath of fresh air".<ref name="interview/poppy"></ref>

Upon Bright's return in 2012, she was still named "one half of Poppy and Jodie double-act", with the "Daily Mirror" Simon adding that Poppy was returning "just in time because some people in Walford are in dire need of a make-under". "Inside Soap" predicted that Albert Square would be a "cheerier place for the foreseeable future as bubbly Poppy Meadow makes a welcome return". "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" made a similar comment about Poppy's return saying that, "In happier news, the glorious Poppy Meadow is back. That is sooo lovely!". Although Stewart did not particularly aim this at Poppy, Stewart did complain about the younger characters in the cast, using Poppy as one of the examples. He said, "While there are some talented and award-winning young actors in the cast, you can't help but suspect that colouring books and crayons are handed out with the scripts at times". A "Daily Mirror" writer said that Poppy, played by the "excellent Rachel Bright", is "one of the comedy delights in this soap". The writer stated that she was "even more Essex than former "<a href="The%20Only%20Way%20Is%20Essex">Towie</a>" star <a href="Amy%20Childs">Amy Childs</a>".

As a member of the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20of%20Canada">National Research Council of Canada</a>, his "Farquharson Report" led to the establishment of the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20of%20Canada">Medical Research Council of Canada</a>, of which he was the first president. He received numerous honorary degrees from Canadian universities, and served on the first Board of Governors of <a href="York%20University">York University</a>. He died in 1965, leaving a wife and two daughters. Farquharson was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Canadian%20Medical%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Medical Hall of Fame</a> in 1998.

Farquharson was born in <a href="Claude%2C%20Ontario">Claude, Ontario</a> (a small town northwest of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>), on 4 August 1897 to Reverend William Farquharson, a <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> minister, and Annie McDonald Coutts. His brother Charles also became a doctor, while another brother, Robert, became the managing editor for "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" and was later an advisor at the Canadian Embassy to the United States. "Farquy", as he was nicknamed by friends, received his early education at <a href="Durham%2C%20Ontario">Durham</a> and graduated from <a href="Harbord%20Collegiate%20Institute">Harbord Collegiate Institute</a> in Toronto.

Farquharson was awarded research fellowships at <a href="Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital">Massachusetts General Hospital</a>, where he worked with <a href="Joseph%20Charles%20Aub">Joseph Charles Aub</a> and <a href="William%20Salter%20%28doctor%29">William Salter</a>, and at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> before becoming an assistant professor at the University of Toronto.

In 1931 he married Christina Jane Fraser, with whom he had two daughters: Helen, who became a <a href="hematologist">hematologist</a>, and Catherine Jane.

In addition to teaching at the University of Toronto, Farquharson established a private practice as a medical consultant, gaining a reputation as a "doctor's doctor" for his treatment of other physicians. In 1934 he became the head of the therapeutics department at Toronto. He continued to publish research findings on various topics, including <a href="anorexia%20nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a>. Farquharson was a charter member of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians%20and%20Surgeons%20of%20Canada">Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada</a>, which oversaw all Canadian postgraduate medical education; he served on its council from 1939 to 1943, and was the council's president from 1945 to 1947.

On 25 August 1943, Farquharson enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> (RCAF) and was assigned to No. 1 Air Command, based in <a href="Trenton%2C%20Ontario">Trenton, Ontario</a>. He was posted to the United Kingdom in 1944 and briefly returned to No. 1 Air Command before being released from service on 22 November 1945 with the rank of <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>. During the war, he chaired the Penicillin Committee of Canada, which regulated the distribution of <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> (an antibiotic that largely replaced the <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulfonamide</a> used earlier in the war) to the armed forces, and was a consultant to the RCAF's Director of Medical Services. He was also consulted on medical matters by both the other branches of the Canadian armed forces and by various <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> medical groups. He supervised medical experiments involving penicillin therapy conducted in Ontario hospitals in 1943–44, and was temporarily appointed Director of Medicine at Christie St. Veteran's Hospital in Toronto. After <a href="V-E%20Day">V-E Day</a>, he travelled to Belgium to supervise the administration of penicillin therapy, and later became involved in the care and treatment of war veterans. For his service in the war, Farquharson was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> in January 1946. His brother Charles also served in both world wars.

Farquharson was the director of medicine for Toronto veterans' hospitals from 1945 to 1947, and at the same time served as president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. In 1947 he was appointed to the Sir John and Lady Eaton Professor of Medicine chair at the University of Toronto. From 1947 until his retirement in 1960, he was the Physician-in-Chief of the Toronto General Hospital. His well-known patients included Canadian politician <a href="George%20A.%20Drew">George A. Drew</a>, who he advised to resign as head of the <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressive Conservative Party of Canada</a> and <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28Canada%29">Leader of the Opposition</a> following a near-fatal attack of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>; Drew did so, and was succeeded as party leader by <a href="John%20Diefenbaker">John Diefenbaker</a>, who later became <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>. Farquharson established clinical teaching programs at Women's College Hospital and <a href="Sunnybrook%20Hospital">Sunnybrook Hospital</a>, and expanded those already in place at St. Michael's and Toronto Western. He also appointed the first full-time clinical investigators to the Toronto medical school faculty and increased total faculty numbers from 40 to over 100. He became a Fellow of the <a href="American%20College%20of%20Physicians">American College of Physicians</a> in 1947 and of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</a> in 1950. He was appointed a member of the Bacteriological Warfare Review Committee, established in 1950 by the <a href="Defence%20Research%20Board">Defence Research Board</a> (of which he was a member from 1949 to 1952) and chaired by Dr. <a href="Charles%20Herbert%20Best">Charles Best</a>. For his service to the nation, he was awarded the <a href="Queen%27s%20Coronation%20Medal">Queen's Coronation Medal</a> in 1953.

Through his research in <a href="endocrinology">endocrinology</a> with colleague Arthur Squires, Farquharson discovered what became known as the "Farquharson Phenomenon": that the introduction of continuous <a href="exogenous">exogenous</a> <a href="Hormone%23Pharmacology">hormone doses</a> suppresses the natural production of that hormone in the patient and causes temporary atrophy in the producing organ. This phenomenon became one of the basic principles of endocrinology and a key factor in the etiology of hormonal abnormalities. Farquharson also made significant contributions related to <a href="anemia">anemia</a> and <a href="secondary%20metabolism">pigment metabolism</a>. He was the first Canadian doctor to publicize <a href="Sheehan%27s%20syndrome">Sheehan's syndrome</a>, and the first North American to report on <a href="Simmond%27s%20disease">Simmond's disease</a>. As an educator and researcher, he was an early promoter of laboratory testing in the evaluation of illness; he was known for advocating both this and awareness of potential psychological issues in patients.

Farquharson became a member of the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20of%20Canada">National Research Council of Canada</a> in 1951, and in 1957 was named the director of the Division of Medical Research. In 1958, he chaired a <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a> Committee tasked with producing a report on the state of medical research in Canada; this charge was in response to a 1957 report by the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges to the Prime Minister, which suggested that medical research in Canada was underfunded. While researching his report, he visited the Soviet Union in 1959 as part of a contingent representing the Research Council; he remarked on the country's apparent emphasis on scientific research, and invited Soviet scientists to visit Canada. Farquharson concluded that existing government support for research in Canada failed to specifically address medical research as an independent discipline and was financially insufficient. His "Farquharson Report" led to the formation of the <a href="Medical%20Research%20Council%20of%20Canada">Medical Research Council of Canada</a> in 1960, over which he presided until his death. As president, Farquharson advocated for progressive medical education taught by practising physicians and for continuing education via research for doctors. He was also able to increase the organization's budget for awards and grants from <a href="C%24">C$</a>4 million in 1963 to $9 million by 1965.

Farquharson became the Regent of the American College of Physicians in 1958 after having spent three years as the organization's Ontario representative. He joined the first Board of Governors of <a href="York%20University">York University</a> in 1959, and was a member of the University of Toronto Senate in the same year. He was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1960. He was also a member of a number of medical organizations in both Canada and the US, and chairman or board member for some 20 medical research groups.

In 1960, having reached the University of Toronto's compulsory retirement age, Farquharson left the university and the hospital. In recognition of his work for Toronto General Hospital, the twelve-bed Clinical Investigation Unit was named after him in 1961, and the Farquharson Foundation was established to support research conducted by the university's teaching hospitals. Also in 1961, Farquharson visited India, later remarking on the societal respect for doctors there. He also continued to advocate for support for universities.

Farquharson won the <a href="Heart%20and%20Stroke%20Foundation%20of%20Canada">National Heart Foundation</a>'s Award of Merit in 1960, followed by the <a href="Pharmaceutical%20Manufacturers%27%20Association%20of%20Canada">Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association of Canada</a> Health Research Foundation's Medal of Honour in 1964 "for his clinical assessment of antibiotics [and] service as a leading medical educator", becoming one of only 18 people to ever receive this award. He was featured on the cover of "<a href="Modern%20Medicine">Modern Medicine</a>" in November 1963. Farquharson was granted honorary degrees by a number of Canadian universities: the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a> in 1949, the <a href="University%20of%20Saskatchewan">University of Saskatchewan</a> in 1957, <a href="Laval%20University">Laval University</a> in 1959, <a href="Queen%27s%20University">Queen's University</a> in 1960, the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> in 1960, the University of Toronto in 1962, and the <a href="University%20of%20Montreal">University of Montreal</a> in 1965. He was named an honorary member of the Ontario Medical Association. He was also appointed a Knight of the Military and Hospitaller Order of St Lazarus of Jerusalem and an Honorary Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Medicine">Royal Society of Medicine</a> in London.
Farquharson died on 1 June 1965 at Ottawa Civic Hospital at age 68 after suffering a heart attack. He had been in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> to attend a meeting of the Medical Research Council. The University of Toronto held a memorial service commemorating his contributions to the school and the medical community.

The Farquharson Life Sciences Building, the first science building at York University, was renamed in honour of Farquharson. A biography of Farquharson was planned, but was never completed.

Farquharson Memorial Lecture was established in his memory; the first such lecture was delivered by <a href="John%20Eager%20Howard">John Eager Howard</a> of <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> in 1968 on the topic of <a href="calcium%20metabolism">calcium metabolism</a>. He was posthumously inducted into the <a href="Canadian%20Medical%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Medical Hall of Fame</a> in 1998 alongside such notable figures as <a href="Tommy%20Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a>, <a href="Norman%20Bethune">Norman Bethune</a> and <a href="Roberta%20Bondar">Roberta Bondar</a>.

Farquharson was credited by Professor William Goldberg of <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a> with "attack[ing] racism as part of [his] clinical teaching" because he suggested patient race should only be mentioned if relevant to their diagnosis; he is also credited with combating <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>. He is considered one of the "Fathers of Canadian Medicine" in both medical research and education. According to one memorial, "no Canadian since Sir <a href="William%20Osler">William Osler</a> has left as great an imprint upon the practice of Medicine".

Is This It

Is This It is the debut studio album by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="the%20Strokes">the Strokes</a>, released on July 30, 2001, by <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a>. It was recorded at Transporterraum in New York City with producer <a href="Gordon%20Raphael">Gordon Raphael</a> from March to April 2001. For their debut, the band strived to capture a simple sound that was not significantly enhanced in the studio. Building on their 2001 <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> "<a href="The%20Modern%20Age">The Modern Age</a>", the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during recording sessions, while songwriter and lead singer <a href="Julian%20Casablancas">Julian Casablancas</a> continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following its completion, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's original cover photograph caused controversy for being too sexually explicit, and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing on the compact disc version <a href="list%20of%20entertainment%20affected%20by%20the%20September%2011%20attacks">was also amended</a> in light of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>; however, the American vinyl release still includes the track "New York City Cops" as a result of its release falling on September 11, 2001.

Promoted by the music press for its twin-guitar interplay and melodic, <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>-influenced sound, "Is This It" peaked at number 33 on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200</a> and number two on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, going on to achieve <a href="platinum%20record">platinum status</a> in several countries. It received critical acclaim, with many praising it for its charisma and rhythm, which often referenced the works of 1970s <a href="garage%20rock">garage rock</a> bands. The album is considered to be crucial in the development of other alternative bands and of the post-millennial music industry, and has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 2000s and of all time. Three <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> were released from the album: "<a href="Hard%20to%20Explain">Hard to Explain</a>", "<a href="Last%20Nite">Last Nite</a>", and "<a href="Someday%20%28The%20Strokes%20song%29">Someday</a>".

In 1997, the Strokes consisted of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist <a href="Nick%20Valensi">Nick Valensi</a>, bassist <a href="Nikolai%20Fraiture">Nikolai Fraiture</a>, and drummer <a href="Fabrizio%20Moretti">Fabrizio Moretti</a>. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet to the music of <a href="reggae">reggae</a> artist <a href="Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</a>, <a href="protopunk">protopunk</a> group <a href="the%20Velvet%20Underground">the Velvet Underground</a>, and <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, "Our music was, like, [<a href="the%20Doors">the Doors</a>'], but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when we put them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool." In 1998, <a href="Albert%20Hammond%2C%20Jr.">Albert Hammond, Jr.</a>, who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.

By 2000, all band members had part-time jobs and were practicing new material several nights a week in a small hired recording space. In the fall of that year, their <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> caught the attention of <a href="Ryan%20Gentles">Ryan Gentles</a>, a talent booker at New York City's <a href="Mercury%20Lounge">Mercury Lounge</a>. He scheduled the Strokes for four December gigs. With support from personal mentor JP Bowersock and producer Gordon Raphael, the band recorded three tracks which later appeared on "Is This It": "The Modern Age", "Last Nite", and "Barely Legal". British label <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade Records</a> was impressed by the songs and released them as a January 2001 extended play titled "The Modern Age". Music press reaction was very positive and the Strokes embarked on a sold-out UK tour, followed by US support slots for alternative rock groups <a href="Doves%20%28band%29">Doves</a> and <a href="Guided%20by%20Voices">Guided by Voices</a>. Gentles quit his job to manage the band full-time and, in March 2001, the Strokes signed to RCA Records after a protracted bidding war.

After the deal with RCA, the Strokes started working with <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a>, who had produced recordings for alternative rock group <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>. Although a rapport developed between the two parties, the band remained unhappy at the results of preliminary sessions which sounded "too clean" and "too pretentious"; the three songs recorded with Norton were scrapped. Like "The Modern Age", "Is This It" was eventually recorded with Gordon Raphael at Transporterraum in <a href="East%20Village%2C%20Manhattan">Manhattan's East Village</a> in New York City. The studio is located in a basement with poor lighting, but despite its poor infrastructure, it includes modern <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> <a href="Digital%20Audio%20Workstation">Digital Audio Workstation</a> hardware. The Strokes liked Raphael's lack of ego and formed a good collaborative relationship with the producer.

Before recording started, both parties organized a listening session with the musical material Hammond and Casablancas had brought to show the tone and energy they liked. One of the prerequisites mentioned at the meeting was to take what was happening in music at the time, and go in a completely different direction. Casablancas wanted "Is This It" to sound like "a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record". The approach for the album became more studied than that of "The Modern Age". The group wanted the majority of songs to sound like them playing live, while they requested a few others to be like "a weird, in-studio production with a <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>, even though no drum machine was used". The songs of the latter type were done track-by-track and were crafted into non-standard rock arrangements. Raphael's background in <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a> played a large part in the album's conception.

During six weeks in the studio, the Strokes' gritty sound became the emphasis of the sessions. The band usually recorded songs only once, based on Casablancas's preference for "raw efficiency". <a href="Pro%20Co%20RAT">RAT</a> <a href="Effects%20unit">effects pedals</a> and <a href="overdrive%20%28music%29">overdriving</a> <a href="amplifier">amplifier</a>s were used at times, "taking sounds, disintegrating them and then bringing them back". The band wanted things to be only slightly <a href="stress%20%28music%29">stressed</a>, with no heavy-handedness in terms of studio effects; only <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distortion</a> and <a href="reverse%20echo">reverse echo</a> were widely used. Throughout the process, Raphael improvised according to the reactions that he got from the group. At one point, he had to cope with the threat of eviction from his Transporterraum studio, but once the Strokes received backing from RCA, time and money were no longer pressing concerns. The label's <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> delegate initially did not like what had been recorded and felt that the album was not going to be professional enough. The producer and the band were given complete control only when Casablancas persuaded the delegate by playing him some of the new material on a <a href="boom%20box">boom box</a>.

Inspired by the Velvet Underground's production and the direct approach of <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> band <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>, the miking scheme for the <a href="drum%20kit">drum kit</a> included only three microphones: one above it, one for the <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>, and one in the corner of the studio. It was crafted to capture "a compressed, explosive sound". On Moretti's advice, the transfer from the two loud guitars and the rumble of the bass picked up by the drum-kit microphones was not eliminated. The guitars were recorded more simply; Hammond and Valensi both used <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender</a> DeVille amps on opposite sides of the room, while Raphael positioned a mic on each. The sound was then fed directly into a <a href="preamp">preamp</a> with no <a href="Equalization%20%28audio%29">equalization</a>. Valensi commented that guitar teacher and mentor Bowersock was invaluable because he was articulating things to the producer that the group could not. While the rest of the Strokes played to a <a href="click%20track">click track</a>, Casablancas sang through a small <a href="Peavey%20Electronics">Peavey</a> practice amp to retain a sense of <a href="low%20fidelity">low fidelity</a> on the album. Raphael <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> as he went along to maintain control of the record until the final <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastering</a> stage; the producer aimed to show the Strokes a final product as soon as the band finished performing a track.

Casablancas's writing observes life in New York City and the relationships formed in such a metropolis. Exemplifying this theme, "The Modern Age" is a rant about the oddness of modern life. "Barely Legal" concerns the subject matter of a girl who has just arrived at the <a href="age%20of%20consent">age of consent</a>. Discussing its risqué nature, Moretti has stated, "It should be taken the way you interpret it. The lyrics mean different things to different people." "Alone, Together" continues the sexual theme by dropping hints about <a href="cunnilingus">cunnilingus</a>, while the yelp at the start of "New York City Cops" was created as a <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of rock band <a href="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>. "Soma" takes influence from <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley's</a> 1932 novel "<a href="Brave%20New%20World">Brave New World</a>" and its featured imaginary drug, soma. Here Casablancas is discussing drug use in order to fit in with the cool crowd. During the studio sessions, Casablancas introduced tracks with comic lines and some quips were used when the album was mixed.

Musically, "Is This It" has been described as a <a href="garage%20rock%20revival">garage rock revival</a>, <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a>, and <a href="post-punk%20revival">post-punk revival</a> album. All songs on the album were mixed using 11 audio tracks or less. According to Valensi, the album contains "no gimmicks, no tricks" to try to get the listener to like the compositions. It opens with the title track, which features a simple, <a href="metronome">metronomic</a> drum line, a recurring feature in the rest of the record. Containing one of the slowest <a href="tempo">tempo</a>s, "Is This It" is the Strokes' attempt at a <a href="ballad">ballad</a>. "The Modern Age" follows and includes a guitar <a href="riff">riff</a> accompanied by a complementary drum line. Its <a href="staccato">staccato</a> verse is followed by an upbeat, singalong chorus and a <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a>. Discussing the album's simplicity and measured approach, Valensi has commented, "We don't put in a guitar solo just to have one." "Soma" incorporates jerky rhythms and starts and ends with the same guitar and drum chimes, while "Barely Legal" contains some of the album's softer guitar melodies inspired by <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> as well as drumming patterns that evoke the sound of primitive 1980s drum machines.

The fifth track on the record, "Someday", is infused with <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> elements and interlocking guitar lines, the latter a recurring element of "Is This It". "Alone, Together" is driven by a staccato rhythm, and climaxes first with a guitar solo, then a repeat of the central guitar <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>. "Last Nite" is also a guitar-driven song, but leans towards pop music influences. At its core, there are reggae-inspired <a href="rhythm%20guitar">rhythm guitar</a> lines played by Hammond, and studio <a href="white%20noise">noise</a> effects. The <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a> plays simple interlocking notes and beats. Like "Soma", "Hard to Explain" contains processed drum tracks using <a href="dynamic%20range%20compression">dynamic range compression</a> and equalization studio techniques to make them sound like a <a href="drum%20machine">drum machine</a>. The song incorporates spliced <a href="ad-libbing">ad-libbing</a> extras from Casablancas, a feature also used on "New York City Cops". "Trying Your Luck", the album's mellowest point, follows and shows more melancholic vocals. The last track on "Is This It", "Take It or Leave It", is the only song in which Hammond used the <a href="bridge%20%28guitar%29">bridge</a> <a href="pickup%20%28music%20technology%29">pickup</a> of his <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> guitar.

Following the album's completion, the Strokes performed at Philadelphia music venues every Wednesday of May 2001. The band revealed the track listing of "Is This It" on May 15. A June headlining tour of the UK and Ireland was also confirmed, and almost immediately after the announcement, some venues sold out. "Hard to Explain" was named as the album's first single with a release date of June 25 to coincide with the tour. At the time, Moretti stated, "In Britain, people are much more responsive ... I'm so psyched to be going back, every show we played people were enjoying it. There's a lot of people here in America who think we've had it too easy, but they have never really heard the music."

Following the Strokes' June 20 show in Glasgow, Moretti suffered a fall and was hospitalized with a broken hand. Two of the last five UK gigs were canceled and a friend of the group, Matt Romano, flew to England to replace the injured drummer in the remaining concerts. In a press release, Gentles explained, "They will only carry on if they feel that they are 100% after rehearsing with Matt, as they wouldn't offer anything less to their fans." With Romano as a substitute, the band managed to satisfy the outstanding commitments. Live recorded versions of "Hard to Explain", its <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a> "New York City Cops", and "Last Nite" from "The Modern Age" aired on UK music show "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" on July 6, 2001. The Strokes headlined the <a href="T%20in%20the%20Park">T in the Park</a> festival in Scotland on July 7 after alternative rock group <a href="Weezer">Weezer</a> pulled out. A large part of the month of July was spent performing in cities in the West Coasts of America and Canada.

"Is This It" was released in Australia on July 30, 2001 to capitalize on the Strokes' recent tour of the country. The record was streamed on Australian websites by the band's distributor <a href="Bertelsmann%20Music%20Group">BMG</a> and remained available for listening even after the CD release. <a href="Geoff%20Travis">Geoff Travis</a>, head of the Strokes' UK label <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade</a>, commented that the Australian continent had "special dispensation" and that an export ban was put in place to ensure no interferences with release plans in the rest of the world. The Japanese release date of August 22 was timed to occur after two one-off shows by the band at the <a href="Summer%20Sonic%20Festival">Summer Sonic Festival</a>, while the UK release of August 27 coincided with the <a href="Reading%20and%20Leeds%20Festivals">Reading and Leeds Festivals</a>. The <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 terrorist attacks</a> in New York City postponed the group's <a href="CMJ%20Music%20Marathon">"CMJ" Music Marathon</a> performance, and shifted RCA's US release of "Is This It" from September 25 to October 9. A newly recorded song, "<a href="When%20It%20Started">When It Started</a>", replaced "New York City Cops" on the CD version of the album after the Strokes witnessed the "valiant response" of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Police%20Department">city's police department</a> during the tragedy. The vinyl release retained the original track list.

The July and August 2001 <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> of "Is This It" is by Colin Lane and features a photograph of a woman's nude bottom and hip, with a leather-gloved hand suggestively resting on it. The model was later revealed to be Lane's then-girlfriend, who explained that the photoshoot was spontaneous and happened after she came out of the shower naked. Lane recalled that a stylist had left the glove in his apartment and noted, "We did about 10 shots. There was no real inspiration, I was just trying to take a sexy picture." The result was included in the book "The Greatest Album Covers of All Time", in which Grant Scott, one of the editors, noted influences from the daring works of <a href="Helmut%20Newton">Helmut Newton</a> and <a href="Guy%20Bourdin">Guy Bourdin</a> in its design. Scott concluded, "It's either a stylish or graphically strong cover or a sexist "<a href="Smell%20the%20Glove">Smell the Glove</a>" travesty." Although British retail chains <a href="HMV">HMV</a> and <a href="Woolworths%20Group">Woolworths</a> objected to the photograph's controversial nature, they stocked the album without amendment.

The group deliberately left out the grammatically correct question mark from the album title because aesthetically, "it did not look right". The booklet insert contains stylized separate portraits of the Strokes, Raphael, Gentles, and Bowersock, all photographed by Lane. For the American market and the October 2001 release, the cover art of "Is This It" was changed to a psychedelic photograph of <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a> tracks in a <a href="bubble%20chamber">bubble chamber</a>. RCA product manager Dave Gottlieb commented that "it was straight up a band decision", while Gentles indicated that Casablancas had wanted it to appear globally. According to the band's manager, the frontman phoned him before the Japan and Europe release and said, "I found something even cooler than the ass picture." At the time, the Lane photograph was already at the presses and was included in the July and August 2001 versions. The Strokes' 2003 biography mentions the fear of objections from America's conservative retail industry and right-wing lobby as reasons for the artwork's alteration.

"Is This It" was a commercial success and entered the UK Albums Chart at number two after first week sales of 48,393 copies. The record was listed at number 71 on the UK Albums Chart for 2001 and was certified <a href="gold%20album">gold</a> by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> after charting continuously from its release in August to the end of the year. In the US, "Is This It" entered the "Billboard" 200 at number 74 after selling 16,000 units in the first week. 20,000 copies were shipped in America per week from October 2001 to January 2002, when a performance by the Strokes on nationwide TV show "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" caused a temporary rise in sales. A 60% increase allowed the album to reach a peak of number 33 on the "Billboard" 200 from its previous high of 63.

"Is This It" was certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> in February 2002 for shipments of 500,000 copies in the US, and by the <a href="Canadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Canadian Recording Industry Association</a> in April for 50,000 units in Canada. In 2002, the album attained platinum status in the UK and in Australia for sales of 300,000 and 70,000 copies respectively. The average US weekly sales were 7,000 by October 2002, when the reissue of the album with a bonus DVD caused an increase. By October 2003, the record had spent 58 weeks on the "Billboard" 200 since its release two years earlier, selling 900,000 copies in America; two million copies were sold worldwide. "Is This It" was certified platinum in Canada in 2004 after 100,000 units were shipped there. By the start of 2006, the album had sold over 600,000 copies in UK and over one million units in the US.

"Is This It" received widespread critical acclaim; aggregating website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reports a <a href="standard%20score">normalized</a> rating of 91, based on 26 critical reviews. Joe Levy of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" explained that the record is "the stuff of which legends are made", and summed it up as "more joyful and intense than anything else I've heard this year". <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", described the Strokes as "a great <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> band", and noted that "the beats implode, clashing/resolving with <a href="punk%20music">punky</a> brevity and gnarly faux simplicity". In a perfect 10 review, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" reviewer John Robinson indicated that "Is This It" was one of the best debut LPs by a guitar band during the past 20 years. In contrast, Jon Monks of "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus</a>" commented that its shallowness prevents it from ever being called a "classic". In his favorable A– review, <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" conceded that he did not know whether the Strokes would have a long-term impact, but noted that, at the time, the record "just feels right, and sometimes that's enough".

Mark Lepage of "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" claimed that "Is This It" is similar to the works of 1970s bands the Velvet Underground, <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a> and <a href="the%20Feelies">the Feelies</a>. "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>"s Ryan Schreiber suggested that, while the work of the Velvet Underground is an obvious inspiration for the Strokes, the band's only similarity to the other groups is the confidence with which they perform. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Heather Phares concluded, "Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences ... have 'critics' darlings' written all over them. But like the similarly lauded <a href="Elastica">Elastica</a> and <a href="Supergrass">Supergrass</a> before them, the Strokes don't rehash the sounds that inspire them—they remake them in their own image."

"Is This It" was named the best album of 2001 by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", "<a href="CMJ">CMJ</a>", "Entertainment Weekly", "NME", <a href="Playlouder">Playlouder</a>, and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>". "<a href="Magnet%20%28magazine%29">Magnet</a>", "<a href="Q%20magazine">Q</a>", and "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" included it in their respective unnumbered shortlists of the best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists: at number two by "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Glasgow%29">The Herald</a>", at number three by "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>", at number five by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", at number eight by "Rolling Stone" and by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", at number nine by "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Boston Phoenix</a>", and at number ten by "<a href="Kludge%20%28magazine%29">Kludge</a>". The record featured at number two behind <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="%26quot%3BLove%20and%20Theft%26quot%3B">Love and Theft</a>" in "The Village Voice"s 2001 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll, which aggregated the votes of 621 prominent reviewers. In 2002, "Is This It" was named Best Album at the <a href="NME%20Awards">"NME" Awards</a> and Best International Album at the <a href="Meteor%20Music%20Awards">Meteor Music Awards</a>. It was nominated in the latter category at the <a href="Brit%20Awards">Brit Awards</a>, where the Strokes won Best International Newcomer and received a nomination in the Best International Group category. The same year, the quintet won Band Of The Year and Best New Act at the "NME Awards" and was nominated in the latter category at the <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">MTV Europe Music Awards</a>.

Gary Mulholland of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" considers the release of "Is This It" a "world-changing moment" and notes that its impact was "immediate and dramatic" on both music and attire. <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>'s <a href="Zane%20Lowe">Zane Lowe</a> suggests that the album moved popular opinion from <a href="DJ">DJ</a>s and pop music to "<a href="Slim-fit%20pants">skinny jeans</a> and guitars", "the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day". Tam Gunn of "<a href="Fact%20%28UK%20magazine%29">FACT</a>" agrees and explains that it "caused a sea change" in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus points out that the Strokes' success created the commercial context for "other new-wavers" to flourish. "Rolling Stone" writes that "Is This It" inspired "a ragged revolt" in Britain, led by <a href="the%20Libertines">the Libertines</a> and <a href="Arctic%20Monkeys">Arctic Monkeys</a>, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like <a href="Kings%20of%20Leon">Kings of Leon</a>. "The Observer" shares a similar view and concludes that "a fine brood of heirs", like the Libertines and <a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated "rock's obsession with having a good time". <a href="Jared%20Followill">Jared Followill</a> of Kings of Leon notes that the album was one of the main reasons that he wanted to get into a band; he states, "The title track was one of the first <a href="bassline">bassline</a>s I learned ... I was just 15 at the time."

Jed Gottlieb of the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>" argues that, although "Is This It" provided substantial musical influence, its biggest success was in revamping the music industry and making A&R delegates scout and promote alternative bands. Gunn links the success of alternative music in British charts throughout the 2000s to the album, but notes that "the copyists" could never match the attention to detail and heartfelt emotion of the Strokes. Mulholland adds that even the pop stars of that decade who rediscovered <a href="disco">disco</a>, <a href="electro%20music">electro</a>, and <a href="synthpop">synthpop</a> owe a debt to the record, because its commercial success "made every forgotten art-pop experiment of the late 70s and early 80s instantly hip and ripe for reinvention". Hamish MacBain of "NME" writes that "the western world has moved on, and is now swinging to the tune of "Is This It"", while "Pitchfork"s Joe Colly suggests that "you only capture this kind of a lightning in a bottle once". Gunn concludes that, while the status of the album as the 2000s' most influential guitar record may be "a double-edged sword" because of poor quality copyists, its status as the decade's best pop album should not be in doubt.

In 2003, "Is This It" was ranked at number seven in "NME"s editorial staff list of the 100 Best Albums, while "Rolling Stone" included it at number 199 in its special updated issue of the "<a href="500%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BGreatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>". In 2005, "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" placed it at number 100 in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005, while Stylus included it at number four in its list of the Top 50 Albums of 2000–2005. In 2006, "Is This It" was ranked at number 48 by "The Observer" in the publication's list of The 50 Albums That Changed Music, while "Mojo" featured it at number 33 in its list of 100 Modern Classics, 1993–2006. In 2007, "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" included the record at number 21 in its editorial staff list of the 21 Albums That Changed Music. In 2008, "Entertainment Weekly" ranked it at number 34 in its list of the 100 Best Albums, 1983–2008.

In 2009, "Is This It" was ranked as the best record of the 2000s by "NME", ahead of the Libertines' "<a href="Up%20the%20Bracket">Up the Bracket</a>", and at number two by "Rolling Stone", behind <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s "<a href="Kid%20A">Kid A</a>", in their respective lists decided by the publications' staff and music industry members. "FACT" placed it at number two behind <a href="Burial%20%28musician%29">Burial</a>'s "<a href="Untrue%20%28album%29">Untrue</a>" in its editorial list of the 100 Best: Albums of the Decade, while "Billboard" featured it at number three in its critics' picks of the 20 Best Albums of the 2000s. The same year, "The Observer" included "Is This It" at number four in its Albums of the Decade list, while "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" ranked it at number five in its list of The 150 Greatest Albums Of The 21st Century.

Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward

Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure</a> video game developed by <a href="Chunsoft">Chunsoft</a>. It is the second installment in the <a href="Zero%20Escape">"Zero Escape" series</a>, and was released in 2012 for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>. The story follows the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> Sigma, a man who is abducted and forced along with eight other individuals to play the Nonary Game, which puts its participants in a life-or-death situation. As the story progresses, the characters begin to unravel the secrets behind the Nonary Game, as well as its true purpose.

The <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> alternates between two types of sections: Escape sections, where the player completes puzzles in <a href="escape%20the%20room">escape-the-room</a> scenarios; and Novel sections, where the player reads the game's narrative through <a href="visual%20novel">visual novel</a> segments, and makes decisions that influence the story toward one of twenty-four different endings. The player is given access to a <a href="flowchart">flowchart</a>, which allows them to revisit any previously completed section, and choose a different option to cause the story to proceed in another direction.

The game was developed as a result of the unexpected critical success that its predecessor, "<a href="Nine%20Hours%2C%20Nine%20Persons%2C%20Nine%20Doors">Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors</a>", received in North America. Game director <a href="Kotaro%20Uchikoshi">Kotaro Uchikoshi</a> wrote the script, which was then <a href="video%20game%20localization">localized</a> by <a href="Aksys%20Games">Aksys Games</a> and <a href="Rising%20Star%20Games">Rising Star Games</a> for North America and Europe respectively. "Virtue's Last Reward" was released to positive reviews. Critics praised the story and characters but were divided in their opinions of the Escape sections. Despite positive reviews, the game was a commercial failure in Japan, which led to the temporary cancellation of its sequel. Development on the sequel eventually resumed, and "<a href="Zero%20Time%20Dilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</a>" was released in 2016.

The <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> of "Virtue's Last Reward" is divided into two types of sections: Novel and Escape. In Novel sections, the player advances through the storyline and converses with <a href="non-playable%20character">non-playable character</a>s through <a href="visual%20novel">visual novel</a> segments. These sections require little interaction from the player other than reading the dialogue and text that appear on the screen. During Novel sections, the player may be presented with decision options that affect the course of the game. One recurring decision option is a <a href="prisoner%27s%20dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>-type choice where the player must choose to "ally" or "betray" the characters they are pitted against, with different results depending on what choices the two parties picked.

In between Novel sections are Escape sections, which occur when the player arrives in a room from which they need to find a means of escape. These are presented from a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person perspective</a>, with the player able to move between predetermined positions in each room. To escape, the player is tasked with finding various items and solving puzzles, reminiscent of <a href="escape%20the%20room">escape-the-room</a> games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects with each other to create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various <a href="brain%20teaser">brain teaser</a>s, such as "<a href="Lights%20Out%20%28game%29">Lights Out</a>" and <a href="sliding%20puzzle">sliding puzzle</a>s. In each Escape room, a safe can be found, which can be opened with two passwords. One of these passwords gives the player the key needed to escape from the room, while the other grants access to a hidden folder that provides the player with supplementary <a href="backstory">backstory</a> or other information. The player receives hints to the puzzle solutions from the game's characters; further, more direct, hints are received if the player changes the puzzle's difficulty level from "hard" to "easy".

The player has access to a <a href="flowchart">flowchart</a> that allows them to immediately revisit or "jump" to any previously completed Novel or Escape section without replaying the game from the beginning. This allows the player to transition to an earlier <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay%23Branching%20storylines">branching</a> point in the story and choose a different option that causes the story to progress in another direction. For example, the player can jump to a previous decision and ally with their opponent instead of betraying them, and vice versa. While there are 24 endings available, many endings are inaccessible initially and must be <a href="unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlocked</a> by experiencing events or learning information in other plotlines. For example, if a particular plotline cannot progress because a required password is unknown, the player must jump to another plotline and learn the password there before returning to the original one.

"Virtue's Last Reward" features nine main characters who are kidnapped by an unknown individual called Zero. The <a href="player%20character">player character</a> Sigma is joined by Phi, a girl with a "no-nonsense attitude"; Dio, a rude and insensitive man; Tenmyouji, an elderly man; Quark, an energetic young boy; Luna, a kind and quiet woman; Clover, an unpredictable girl who appeared in "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors"; Alice, a commanding and focused woman; and K, a man who wears an irremovable, full-body suit of armor. Zero III, an <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> who appears in the form of a <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>, controls the Nonary Game. Zero III is nicknamed "Zero Jr." by the participants to distinguish the entity from the human Zero, who is in turn nicknamed "Zero Sr." Each character, save Sigma, is fully voice acted in both Japanese and English.

The game is set in an abandoned warehouse-like facility containing rooms filled with puzzles, where Zero forces the characters to participate in the Nonary Game. The characters are affixed with bracelets that display a point value that is initially set at three. During the game they participate in rounds of the Ambidex Game, in which they have to choose to "ally" or "betray" the other characters. The choices made affect the players' bracelet points: if two opponents both choose "ally", each individual gains two points; if the two opponents both choose "betray", no change occurs; and if one opponent chooses "betray" while the other chooses "ally", the opponent who chose "betray" gains three points while the other opponent loses two points. Participants who gain at least nine points are able to escape, while those who reach zero points are executed.

In 2028, Sigma is abducted and placed inside an elevator with Phi. Zero III appears on a monitor and informs them that they are participants in the Nonary Game and that they must escape the elevator before it falls. Upon escaping, they find themselves in a warehouse-like facility with Dio, Quark, Tenmyouji, Luna, Alice, K, and Clover. Zero III informs the group that nine individual bracelet points are necessary to escape the facility, and points can only be earned by participating in the Ambidex Game.

The story begins branching into different timelines that can be experienced in any order, depending on the choices made by the player. While completing the first set of puzzle rooms, the participants learn of a <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a> caused by Radical-6, a virus that slows down its victims' <a href="cognition">cognition</a> and drives them to suicide. Depending on the given timeline, the characters also discover either the murdered body of an old woman or <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> bombs. The other participants' backstories are explored: Luna is a <a href="humanoid%20robot">humanoid robot</a>, tasked with maintaining the Nonary Game; K was raised by Zero Sr. inside of the facility; Tenmyouji willingly joined the game, together with his adopted grandson Quark, after being promised a chance to find a certain woman; Alice and Clover are government <a href="secret%20agent">secret agent</a>s tasked with stopping the religious <a href="cult">cult</a> Free the Soul; and Dio is a member of Free the Soul.

In a <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s%20cat">Schrödinger's cat</a>-like situation, immediately prior to the start of the Nonary Game, Dio either murdered the old woman and took her place in the game, or failed to do so but was still placed into the game by her and later planted the bombs. In the timeline leading to the game's ultimate ending, Sigma <a href="bomb%20disposal">defuses</a> the bombs, while Dio is restrained and incapacitated. The remaining participants proceed to the next set of puzzle rooms. As Sigma, Phi, and Tenmyouji complete their room, they uncover a <a href="hologram">holographic</a> message of the old woman, Akane Kurashiki, whom Tenmyouji – revealed to be the player character Junpei from "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors" – was seeking. Akane and Zero Sr. had developed the AB project, a project that encompassed the Nonary Game and the Ambidex Game, to train Sigma and Phi to transport their consciousnesses through time. This occurs shortly thereafter, and Phi subdues Dio before he can kill Akane. Akane explains that the game's dangerous elements were necessary to speed up one's brain to transport one's consciousness through time, and each participant was infected with Radical-6 to amplify this increase. The Nonary Game was designed so Sigma and Phi could experience multiple timelines and retain what they learn in each one. Sigma and Phi's consciousnesses are then returned to the present, where they find everyone has cooperated to acquire enough points to escape.

The group leaves the facility and emerges in a desert landscape on the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. The year is 2074 and most of humanity was killed by Radical-6 after it was unleashed by Free the Soul from a <a href="Exploration%20of%20Mars">Mars mission</a> test site in 2028. They re-enter the facility and discover a <a href="cryonics">cold sleep pod</a>. K explains that each person was brought to the facility to recreate the events that Zero Sr. and Akane had previously experienced. Clover, Alice, and Phi were abducted in 2028 and placed in cold sleep until the Nonary Game began. The pod opens to reveal a clone of Sigma, and K reveals he is actually Akane in disguise; in the timelines where Akane was killed, the armor was instead occupied by Sigma's clone, Kyle.

Akane explains that Sigma, after his abduction in 2028, had his consciousness transported into his elder self's body in 2074, while his elder self's consciousness was transported into the younger Sigma's body in 2028. The goal of the AB project was to enable the elder Sigma to prevent the Radical-6 outbreak in 2028 with his future knowledge; Dio sought to stop the project. Akane makes Phi and Sigma's consciousnesses jump to 2029, after the outbreak. Sigma, as Zero Sr., spends the next 45 years developing the AB project together with Akane, while Phi is kept in cold sleep. Sigma creates Kyle as a spare, in case his own body gets damaged. Immediately before the start of the Nonary Game in 2074, Sigma and Phi jump back to 2028 to infiltrate the Mars mission test site.

"Virtue's Last Reward" was developed by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who had previously led the production of "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors". While his original intention was to make "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors" a stand-alone title, its unexpected critical success in North America prompted him to continue the series. In an attempt to reduce costs, Uchikoshi asked Chunsoft if he could develop "Virtue's Last Reward" and its eventual sequel simultaneously, as both games would use the same <a href="game%20engine">engine</a> and <a href="digital%20asset">digital asset</a>s; Chunsoft agreed to his proposal, and <a href="green-light">green-lit</a> production.

Development of "Virtue's Last Reward" began on the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>, but this changed early in production following the announcement of the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>. The development team at Chunsoft wanted to utilize the <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) features of the newer systems, and changed production of the game to the Nintendo 3DS and PlayStation Vita. As neither system had been released yet, the team was under the assumption that the 3D features would require <a href="3D%20modeling">3D character models</a>. Uchikoshi later remarked that designing 3D character models proved to be a challenge for Chunsoft due to company's inexperience with 3D effects.

"Virtue's Last Reward" marks a tonal shift from the suspense present within "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors", to a more relaxed and exploration-heavy atmosphere. Uchikoshi stated that the results of a Japanese survey indicated that players who did not purchase "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors" thought it looked scary; he "didn't have a choice but to tone it down" for "Virtue's Last Reward".

Uchikoshi began by writing a basic story and worked with a sub-writer, who helped brainstorm ideas and identify problems. The Ambidex Game was intended to have philosophical significance, as the logical decisions made hurts its participants both on a group level and on a personal one. He sought to create a balanced cast of supporting characters, in terms of genders, personalities, and ages represented, and used the <a href="Enneagram%20of%20Personality">Enneagram of Personality</a> as reference. Sigma was not given a strong personality in order for players to more easily empathize with him. Uchikoshi enlivened the supporting characters by making them "mysterious" so that players were curious about their backstories, and deliberately made certain ones appear suspicious to misdirect players from determining who the "real bad guy" is. Because the Moon was one of the game's major themes, the character Zero III appears as a rabbit— a reference to the <a href="moon%20rabbit">moon rabbit</a> in <a href="Japanese%20folklore">Japanese folklore</a>.

Some changes were made to the initial plot of "Virtue's Last Reward". During one scene, Dio handcuffs Clover and Tenmyouji to a sink, which prevents them from participation in the Nonary Game (the punishment for not participating is death). Originally, Dio was meant to "do something even more messed up" to Clover, but the president of Chunsoft opposed this scene for "ethical reasons", after which it was changed. While the game ends in the year 2029 with humanity dying out and Sigma aspiring to change the future, Uchikoshi later felt this ending alone was inappropriate following the <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a>. He added an extended, non-<a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canonical</a> ending featuring Kyle to lighten the mood. Uchikoshi also considered including several scientific and philosophical concepts that eventually were left out. These scrapped ideas included the <a href="Monty%20Hall%20problem">Monty Hall problem</a>, a brain teaser based on <a href="probability">probability</a>; and the <a href="Capgras%20delusion">Capgras delusion</a>, a mental disorder in which someone believes that a person they know has been replaced with an identical-looking impostor.

As with "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors", <a href="Aksys%20Games">Aksys Games</a> <a href="Video%20game%20localization">localized</a> "Virtue's Last Reward" for its North American release. Nobara Nakayama translated the game's text from Japanese to English, which was then localized by editor Ben Bateman. Bateman later stated that overcoming various translation issues was one of the hardest aspects of editing "Virtue's Last Reward". Although Uchikoshi had written the game with the English-language audience in mind, which avoided several plot-related translation problems, a few jokes did not translate properly and had to be changed during localization. There were also two characters who "talked like animals" in the Japanese version of the game: Zero III, who added "-usa" to the end of its sentences, which is the first half of "usagi" (the Japanese word for "rabbit"); and Sigma, who added "-nya" (the Japanese <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeia</a> for the sound cats make) to the end of his sentences whenever he talked about cats. Bateman solved this by writing rabbit and cat themed puns. Another challenge for Bateman was keeping track of the story moments from each branching path. It was important to know whether information regarding each character had been revealed yet to the player in that timeline, as this would ultimately affect the word choice and attitude of each line of dialogue.

For voice casting, the localization team was sent a list of people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were supposed to say, so they would know how to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by <a href="Rising%20Star%20Games">Rising Star Games</a>, only features the Japanese audio track.

To promote the game, Chunsoft released an <a href="original%20video%20animation">original video animation</a> in December 2011. Created by the Japanese animation studio <a href="Gonzo%20%28company%29">Gonzo</a>, the animation serves as an introduction to the game, showcasing the characters and the basic Ambidex Game rules. As well as the video animation, a <a href="browser%20game">Flash game</a> was produced and made available on the Japanese "Virtue's Last Reward" website. The gameplay of the Flash game has the player attempt to open a metal door by quickly clicking on it. As the door begins to open, Clover is revealed on the other side, and the player begins clicking on her breasts. Richard Eisenbeis of "<a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>" was perplexed by the Flash game, stating that: "as it is pretty much the <a href="antithesis">antithesis</a> of everything presented in "Virtue's Last Reward", I truly wonder how this Flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title. Perhaps it's just due to a [public relations] department following the old adage: '<a href="sex%20sells">sex sells</a>'."

"Virtue's Last Reward" was released in Japan on February 16, 2012. In its first week of release, the Nintendo 3DS version sold 9,307 copies while the PlayStation Vita version sold 6,538 copies. The game was then released in North America on October 23, and in Europe on November 23; this was the first "<a href="Zero%20Escape">Zero Escape</a>" game to be released in Europe. People who <a href="pre-order">pre-order</a>ed the North American version of the game through <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> received a replica of the bracelet that the characters wear; a similar pre-order bonus had been given out for "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors". The bracelets could later be purchased through the Aksys Games store, with all proceeds going to the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Sandy">Hurricane Sandy</a> relief.

Shortly after the game's release in North America, a game-breaking <a href="Glitch%23Video%20game%20glitches">glitch</a> was discovered in the Nintendo 3DS version: saving the game in specific Escape sections would corrupt the <a href="saved%20game">saved game</a>'s data, forcing the player to restart the game from the beginning. In response, Aksys Games recommended that players avoid saving during Escape sections. By 2013, Aksys Games announced that the glitch had been patched in the <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> version, but some players continued to report that the glitch still existed.

"Zero Escape: The Nonary Games", a <a href="product%20bundling">bundle</a> that contains <a href="video%20game%20remake">remastered</a> versions of "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors" and "Virtue's Last Reward", was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and PlayStation Vita in the West on March 24, 2017. People who purchased the Windows version through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> in its first week of release received a complimentary soundtrack, with songs from "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors" and "Virtue's Last Reward". In Japan, the Microsoft Windows version was released on March 25, while the console versions were released on April 13. The European PlayStation Vita version will be released later in 2017.

"Virtue's Last Reward" received "generally favorable reviews" on both platforms, according to the <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Several reviewers found the game's narrative to be complex and engaging: <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Heidi Kemps enjoyed its mix of <a href="horror%20fiction">horror</a>, <a href="drama">drama</a>, and <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, and "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" called it a "page-turner with flashes of real intelligence"; "Edge" later noted that it lacked the shock value of "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors". "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" Kimberly Wallace and Tony Ponce of "<a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>" liked the use of <a href="plot%20twist">plot twist</a>s, but Ponce felt that the ending featured too many of them, and that the revelations were more confusing than surprising. Writing for RPGFan, John McCarroll liked how the dialogue ranged from humorous to saddening and harrowing. Only Austin Boosinger of <a href="Adventure%20Gamers">Adventure Gamers</a> was critical of the dialogue, calling it "one of the slowest and most overwritten adventure games" ever made.

The characters were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" and Martin Robinson of "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" called them believable and easy for the player to care about. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of "<a href="Nintendo%20Life">Nintendo Life</a>" considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed that there was little reason to care for them until their backstories were revealed.

Reviewers were divided in their opinions of the Escape sections. "Edge" and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were satisfying to solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them dull and uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were awkward and oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a> was improved from "Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors". Many reviewers praised the flowchart for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or restart the game from the beginning, but Boosinger and "Edge" criticized it for removing the tension of making wrong decisions.

The game's visuals and overall presentation were positively received. Thomas thought that the 3D visuals were "beautifully" rendered, and that they were much better than those of its predecessor. These comments were shared by Patterson, who remarked that while she was initially skeptical of the visuals from gameplay screenshots, her opinion changed after playing the game. McCarroll felt that many of the environments looked similar and that they were often colorless. Manson thought that the character models fit well with the realistic environments, but noted that there was a limited amount of character animations. Critics enjoyed the voice acting, with Thomas calling it "among the best performances I've ever heard in any game, period".

"Virtue's Last Reward" received some awards from gaming publications, including: Handheld Game of the Year from GameSpot, Best 3DS/DS Story from IGN, Best Handheld Exclusive from "Game Informer", and Best Story and Best Graphic Adventure from RPGFan. The game also received nominations for Best Narrative at the 13th Annual <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, and Game of the Year from "Kotaku", "<a href="Pocket%20Gamer">Pocket Gamer</a>", and GameSpot. <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a>, "<a href="Game%20Developer%20%28magazine%29">Game Developer</a>", 1UP.com, and Amazon.com placed "Virtue's Last Reward" within their non-ranked lists of the Best Games of 2012, while RPGFan listed it as one of the thirty essential <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s from the years 2010 to 2015.

In December 2012, Uchikoshi mentioned details of a third "Zero Escape" game, and by June 2013, he had finished planning the story. Less than a year later, it was announced that the project was put on hold indefinitely in response to the series' poor commercial reception in Japan. Uchikoshi examined the possibility of financing the development through the use of <a href="crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> on a website like <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a>, but felt that the idea would not be persuasive enough for it to meet the goal; he also sought out opportunities with executives and investors. The series' <a href="fandom">fandom</a> created Operation Bluebird, an online campaign to raise awareness of the series and support the game's development, in response to its hiatus.

In March 2015, Aksys Games launched the website 4infinity.co, which only consisted of a countdown timer. Fans of the series noticed that the number <a href="fonts">fonts</a> on the countdown timer resembled the fonts from cover art, which led to speculation it was counting down to an announcement regarding a third "Zero Escape" game. The countdown ended in July, which coincided with the 2015 <a href="Anime%20Expo">Anime Expo</a>. During the Expo, Aksys Games held a <a href="Panel%20discussion">panel</a> at which they announced the continued development of the game. It was released in June 2016, under the new name "Zero Time Dilemma".

Starring <a href="Titi%20Rajo%20Bintang">Titi Rajo Bintang</a>, Henidar Amroe, and Ray Sahetapi, it tells the life story of Adjeng, who was <a href="child%20molestation">sexually abused as a child</a> by her mother's boyfriend. Filmed over 18 days after several years of development, the film adapted two of Ayu's short stories from her debut anthology of the same name. Owing to its low budget of <a href="Indonesian%20Rupiah">Rp</a> 620 million, its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students, although several established actors appeared at reduced rates.

"Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" has been described as "anti-Sjuman" because of the disparity between Ayu's more personal directing style and the <a href="social%20realism">social realism</a> of her father, <a href="Sjumandjaja">Sjumandjaja</a>. Although commercially unsuccessful, the film was well received by critics. It won five national-level awards and was screened at several international film festivals. Two Indonesian publications, "<a href="Tempo%20%28Indonesian%20magazine%29">Tempo</a>" and "<a href="The%20Jakarta%20Post">The Jakarta Post</a>", selected it as among the best films of 2008.
Adjeng (<a href="Titi%20Rajo%20Bintang">Titi Rajo Bintang</a>) lives alone in an apartment paid for by her boyfriend, a rich businessman (<a href="Joko%20Anwar">Joko Anwar</a>). A writer of children's stories, she wishes to write short stories for adults; in this, she is mentored by Asmoro (Ray Sahetapy) – with whom she is also having sex. Meanwhile, Adjeng's mother (Henidar Amroe) handles various aspects of her life, constantly calling her and making surprise visits. This has led Adjeng's friends, Venny (Ayu Dewi) and Andien (Fairuz Faisal), to tease her about her overbearing mother.

When Adjeng goes clubbing with her friends, she drinks too much and vomits, later passing out in a toilet. As she lies with her head on the seat she recalls that, as a child (Nadya Romples), she had been forced to eat vegetables she had previously vomited. Later, when Andien uses her apartment for a <a href="one-night%20stand">one-night stand</a>, Adjeng peeks and recalls how she had observed her mother having sex with her lover (<a href="Bucek%20Depp">Bucek Depp</a>), a man who had previously <a href="Child%20sexual%20abuse">molested</a> Adjeng – an act which is not shown explicitly. This background, as well as her recollections of life as a teenager (played by Banyu Bening) at the home of her womanising father (<a href="August%20Melasz">August Melasz</a>) are worked into Adjeng's short story "Lintah" ("Leech").

When Asmoro reads the story, he says that it is unrealistic and that readers need a <a href="Climax%20%28narrative%29">climax</a>. However, Adjeng insists that reality is unrealistic and that not all victims of rape are willing to call the police. Several days later, while they are lying in bed, Asmoro shows Adjeng that "Lintah" had been published in "<a href="Kompas">Kompas</a>". Adjeng's mother, aware of the story's <a href="autobiography">autobiographical</a> nature, is furious and, after going to Adjeng's apartment, blames everything on Adjeng's father abandoning them.

Upset, Adjeng goes out with Venny and Andien, but when the two begin arguing about motherhood Adjeng leaves them both in the street. She then goes to a café to drink with Asmoro, who comforts her. When she returns home she checks her messages, most of which are about the short story. Venny and Andien, meanwhile, return to their families and think of the importance of children.

The following day, Asmoro sees the businessman, Adjeng's boyfriend, leaving her apartment, which puts him in a foul mood. He and Adjeng fight, and Asmoro almost smothers Adjeng with a pillow before saying that they are through. As Adjeng lies on the bed, she recalls how her mother's lover raped her and how her mother murdered him. As the phone rings, Adjeng watches the people from her past going about life in a residential complex, smiles, and returns to writing.


The film was originally meant to be based on the short story "Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" from <a href="Djenar%20Maesa%20Ayu">Djenar Maesa Ayu</a>'s 2002 debut, a critically and commercially successful short story anthology of the same name. However, Djenar later chose to base the film on "Lintah" ("Leech") and "Melukis Jendela" ("Painting the Window"), two other stories from the anthology. Ayu had originally not intended to film her stories, but agreed after she was approached by a consortium who offered to fund her. She asked Indra Herlambang, a writer-cum-television personality, to help her write the screenplay as she "never could write stories with a plot", and she needed him to keep her motivated. The two wrote the screenplay over a period of two years, having difficulty finding new investors after the original ones dropped out.

In 2004 Ayu began taking filmmaking classes to prepare herself to direct the film. She also watched several films directed by her father, the director <a href="Sjumandjaja">Sjumandjaja</a>, in preparation for production. Production began in October 2006, with some of the film crew – including art director Hardiyansah B. Yasin – drawn in after Ayu met them at a cafe in South Jakarta and discovered that they were active in the local <a href="indie%20film">indie film</a> scene. The group helped collect the <a href="Indonesian%20rupiah">Rp</a> 620 million (US$75,000) needed for production; as a cost-saving measure, numerous crew members were film students.

Many of the roles were written with specific actors in mind, with casting for other roles promoted by <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a>. Titi Rajo Bintang, a lecturer at the Daya Kemang Institute of Art, was cast in the starring role of Adjeng after Ayu and her then-husband, Sri Aksana Sjuman (Ayu's brother), convinced her. At first she was uncomfortable with some of her scenes and her lack of training, as this was her first film role. However, she received support from her husband, who told her that she should act professionally and that "in a kissing scene ... [her] body should not reject it". The couple also provided the soundtrack for "Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!", including three original songs – "When You Smile", "Someday", and "Love, Sadness & Happiness" – performed by Rajo Bintang.

Model turned actress Henidar Amroe was chosen to play Adjeng's mother; Ayu later said that the role had been written with her in mind. Although worried about the sexual content of the film, Amroe accepted the role, calling it a "crazy" plot that "read like a foreign movie". The young Adjeng was played by Ayu's daughter, Banyu Bening. Several of the established actors cast, including <a href="Jajang%20C.%20Noer">Jajang C. Noer</a>, Ray Sahetapy, and August Melasz, agreed to appear in the film for less than their usual fee. Shooting took place over 18 days, although 14 had originally been allocated.

"Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" deals with the after effects of <a href="child%20molestation">child molestation</a> in a way that the Indonesian magazine "<a href="Tempo%20%28Indonesian%20magazine%29">Tempo</a>" describes as an "interesting time control experiment", replete with flashbacks which clearly establish the time frame in which scenes happen. According to Wicaksono Adi, in his review for "<a href="Kompas">Kompas</a>", Adjeng's writing is her therapy, as it entails constant reconstruction and deconstruction of her troubled past; he posits that this ultimately allows Adjeng to fight back against the authority figures who had troubled her since she was young. In a making-of documentary on the film, Ayu said that she had no moral message or social criticism in mind when creating the film, considering it instead a form of self-exploration. Admitting that the film could be read as a critique of <a href="violence%20against%20women">violence against women</a> and children, she said that she could empathise as a woman.

Adi also sees a <a href="love%E2%80%93hate%20relationship">love–hate relationship</a> between Adjeng and her mother, which results in Adjeng's promiscuity – a common act in the <a href="Sastra%20Wangi">Sastra Wangi</a> literary movement of which Ayu is considered a part. The relationship between mother and daughter is reflective of themes in the earlier works "<a href="Pasir%20Berbisik">Pasir Berbisik</a>" ("Whispering Sands"; 2001), by <a href="Nan%20Achnas">Nan Achnas</a>, and "<a href="Eliana%2C%20Eliana">Eliana, Eliana</a>" (2003), by <a href="Riri%20Riza">Riri Riza</a>. However, unlike the aforementioned films, "Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" did not end with the daughter and mother on divergent paths. The reviewer Totot Indrarto, also writing for "Kompas", wrote that Adjeng was the title "monkey" character of the film, being looked down upon by everyone around her; however, those who judge her do not actually know her, thus, in Indrarto's opinion, making them the "monkeys".

A review in "Tempo" described the film as "anti-Sjuman" owing to the differences in styles between father and daughter. Sjumandjaja's films tended to fall under <a href="social%20realism">social realism</a>, while Ayu's debut had more of a personal, symbolic aspect with a touch of <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a>. The film does not show Adjeng's molestation, instead symbolizing it by showing a <a href="leech">leech</a> feeding; in one case, when Adjeng is raped in a bathtub, losing her virginity, the scene is represented by blood-red water and numerous leeches feeding.

"Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" received a wide release on 3 January 2008. Commercially unsuccessful in the country, the film was screened at several international film festivals, including the 2008 <a href="Singapore%20International%20Film%20Festival">Singapore International Film Festival</a> (SIFF), the 2008 <a href="Tallinn%20Black%20Nights%20Film%20Festival">Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival</a> in Estonia, and the 2009 Asian Hot Shot Film Festival in Berlin. The film was released on DVD in Indonesia on 9 May 2008 by Jive! Collection, after passing through the censorship board in March. The DVD featured English-language subtitles, English- and Indonesian-language editions of the source short stories, and a behind-the-scenes documentary.

The film received generally positive reviews. Seno Joko Suyono, in a review for "Tempo", stated that the cliched plot of family crisis became more interesting with the introduction of sex; he also called the climax "sweet yet disturbing". Later in 2008 the magazine selected "Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" as the best local movie of 2008, writing that Ayu had taken to directing like "a fish that had long floundered on the dry ground and was finally returned to the sea." Iskandar Liem, writing for "<a href="The%20Jakarta%20Post">The Jakarta Post</a>", also listed the film as among the top ten of the year, alongside international works such as <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" and another Indonesian film, Riri Riza's "<a href="Laskar%20Pelangi">Laskar Pelangi</a>" ("The Rainbow Warriors"). He described the film as "unflinching in its brutal honesty and fluid in its visual allegory", welcoming Ayu as "a rebellious new voice" in Indonesia's film industry.

Ening Nurjanah, an organiser of the women-themed film festival V, described Djenar as "an example of director who can portray a strong woman in her films", with the film "breaking new ground" in portraying women's sexuality. The Vietnamese-American actor <a href="Dustin%20Nguyen">Dustin Nguyen</a>, who judged the film at SIFF, considered the film unexpected and "un-Indonesian", "well made, well acted, but [with] more of a Western sensibility. Lisabonar Rahman, writing for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20Indonesia">Rolling Stone Indonesia</a>", praised Rajo Bintang's acting and the film's portrayal of Adjeng's background, on which she wrote "the expression of [the background] is very powerful, keeping us speechless from fear"; however, she found the sound quality inadequate.

In his review for "Kompas", Adi wrote that Ayu had made a well developed and acted film, a "good debut for [Indonesia's] future director", although he considered the cinematography incapable of fully expressing the character's psychological torment. Indrarto described "Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" as interesting despite technical flaws, containing a strong message that viewers should not judge someone or bother them when they are unlikely to know that person's true background.

"Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" was nominated for two Golden Screen Awards at the 2008 <a href="Indonesian%20Movie%20Awards">Indonesian Movie Awards</a>. It also received six Citra Award nominations at the 2009 <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a> (IFF), winning three. <a href="Aria%20Kusumadewa">Aria Kusumadewa</a>'s "<a href="Identitas">Identitas</a>" ("Identity"; 2009) bested "Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!" in <a href="Citra%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Best Film</a> and <a href="Citra%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>, while <a href="Joko%20Anwar">Joko Anwar</a>'s "<a href="Pintu%20Terlarang">Pintu Terlarang</a>" ("Forbidden Door"; 2009) took Best Editing.

Piano music of Gabriel Fauré

The French composer <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Gabriel Fauré</a> (1845–1924) wrote in many genres, including songs, chamber music, orchestral pieces, and choral works. His compositions for piano, written between the 1860s and the 1920s, include some of his best known works.

Fauré's major sets of piano works are thirteen <a href="nocturne">nocturne</a>s, thirteen <a href="barcarolle">barcarolle</a>s, six <a href="impromptu">impromptu</a>s, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed during several decades in his long career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are "Romances sans paroles", <a href="piano%20ballad">Ballade</a> in F major, <a href="Mazurka">Mazurka</a> in B major, "Thème et variations" in C major, and "Huit pièces brèves". For <a href="piano%20four%20hands">piano duet</a>, Fauré composed the "<a href="Dolly%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Dolly Suite</a>" and, together with his friend and former pupil <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a>, an exuberant parody of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> in the short suite "Souvenirs de Bayreuth".

Much of Fauré's piano music is difficult to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement.

Although for much of his career he made his living as a church organist, Fauré greatly preferred the piano. He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, "In piano music there's no room for padding – one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all." Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Fauré said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as "Piano piece No X". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity; he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, "the greater they are, the worse they play me." Even a virtuoso such as <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> said that he found Fauré's music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Fauré, "I've run out of fingers". Fauré's years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using <a href="Arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists. This tendency may have been even stronger because Fauré was <a href="ambidextrous">ambidextrous</a>, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a> wrote to him in 1917, "Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to get to the end of it by dint of absolute determination."

As a man, Fauré was said to possess "that mysterious gift that no other can replace or surpass: charm", and charm is a conspicuous feature of many of his early compositions. His early piano works are influenced in style by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, and throughout his life he composed piano works using similar titles to those of Chopin, notably <a href="nocturnes">nocturnes</a> and <a href="barcarolle">barcarolle</a>s. An even greater influence was <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other. The authors of "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>" (1955) wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, "and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated." When Fauré was a student at the <a href="Louis%20Niedermeyer">École Niedermeyer</a> his tutor had introduced him to new concepts of harmony, no longer outlawing certain chords as "<a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonant</a>". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Fauré anticipated the techniques of <a href="Impressionist%20music">Impressionist</a> composers.

In later years Fauré's music was written under the shadow of the composer's increasing deafness, becoming gradually less charming and more austere, marked by what the composer <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a> called "intensity on a background of calm." The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the accessible earlier piano works, rather than the later music, which expresses "such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation" that listeners are left uneasy. The Fauré scholar <a href="Jean-Michel%20Nectoux">Jean-Michel Nectoux</a> writes:

The nocturnes, along with the barcarolles, are generally regarded as the composer's greatest piano works. Fauré greatly admired the music of Chopin, and was happy to compose in forms and patterns established by the earlier composer. Morrison notes that Fauré's nocturnes follow Chopin's model, contrasting serene outer sections with livelier or more turbulent central episodes. The composer's son Philippe commented that the nocturnes "are not necessarily based on rêveries or on emotions inspired by the night. They are lyrical, generally impassioned pieces, sometimes anguished or wholly elegiac."

Nectoux rates the first nocturne as one of the best of the composer's early works. It is dedicated, like Fauré's song <a href="Trois%20m%C3%A9lodies%2C%20Op.7%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">"Après un rêve"</a>, to his friend and early patron Marguerite Baugnies. Morrison calls the piece "cloistered and elegiac." Though published as the composer's Op 33/1 in 1883, it was written considerably earlier. It opens with a slow, pensive melody, followed by a more agitated second theme and another melody in C major, and ends with the return of the opening theme. The pianist and academic <a href="Sally%20Pinkas">Sally Pinkas</a> writes that the work contains many hallmarks of Fauré's style, including "undulating rhythms, syncopation of the accompaniment against the melody and layered textures are already in evidence."

The second nocturne opens with a bell-like passage, "andantino espressivo", recalling – although Fauré said it was unconscious – the sound of distant bells that he heard frequently when a boy. Nectoux singles out "the light footed episode in alternating fifths and sixths" and its extremely delicate passagework, and points to the influence of Fauré's former teacher Saint-Saëns in the "allegro ma non troppo" <a href="toccata">toccata</a> section. Saint-Saëns himself declared the piece "absolutely entrancing."

In the third nocturne, Morrison notes that the composer's fondness for syncopation is at its gentlest, "nostalgia lit by passion." Like its predecessors, it is in tripartite form. An expansive melody with syncopated left-hand accompaniment leads into a middle section in which a "dolcissimo" theme metamorphoses into bursts of passion. The return of the opening section is concluded by a gentle <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> that introduces new harmonic subtleties.

The fourth nocturne, dedicated to the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau, contrasts a lyrical opening section and an episode in E minor with a sombre theme recalling the tolling of a bell. The first theme returns and is followed by a short coda. The pianist <a href="Alfred%20Cortot">Alfred Cortot</a>, generally a great admirer of Fauré, found the piece "rather too satisfied with its languor."

By contrast with its predecessor, the fifth nocturne is more animated, with unexpected shifts into remote keys. Nectoux writes of its undulating outline, and the "almost improvisatory, questioning character" of the opening.
The sixth nocturne, dedicated to Eugène d'Eichthal, is widely held to be one of the finest of the series. Cortot said, "There are few pages in all music comparable to these." Morrison calls it "among the most rich and eloquent of all Fauré's piano works." The pianist and writer Nancy Bricard calls it "one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature." Fauré wrote it after a six-year break from composing for the piano. The piece begins with an emotional, outpouring phrase, with echoes of Fauré's song cycle "<a href="La%20bonne%20chanson%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">La bonne chanson</a>". The second theme, at first seemingly tranquil, has what the composer <a href="Charles%20Koechlin">Charles Koechlin</a> calls a persistent inquietude, emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment. The initial theme returns, and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle, contemplative melody. A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion. Copland wrote that it was with this work that Fauré first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, "The breath and dignity of the opening melody, the restless C sharp minor section which follows (with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Fauré), the graceful fluidity of the third idea: all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section; then, after a pause, comes the return of the consoling first page."

The seventh nocturne departs from the A–B–A form of Fauré's earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas's view is it constructed more like a <a href="Ballade%20%28classical%20music%29">ballade</a> than a nocturne. It opens with a slow ("molto lento") theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion. Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness, and of the composer's struggle against despair. Pinkas, however, regards the work as a "contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance." It is sometimes known as the "English" nocturne, having been composed while Fauré was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist <a href="Adela%20Maddison">Adela Maddison</a>.
Fauré did not intend the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His publisher collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as "8 pièces brèves", allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.
The ninth nocturne, dedicated to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, is the first of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a <a href="whole%20tone%20scale">whole tone scale</a>. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.

Like its immediate predecessor, the tenth nocturne is on a smaller scale than those of Fauré's middle period. In contrast with the ninth, however, the tenth is darker and angrier. The composer applies the A–B–A form less rigorously than in earlier nocturnes, and the opening bars of the piece recur intermittently throughout, eventually building to a fierce climax, described by Morrison as "a slow central climb ... that inhabits a world of nightmare." The piece ends with a calm coda. It is dedicated to Madame Brunet-Lecomte.

The eleventh nocturne was written in memory of Noémi Lalo; her widower, <a href="Pierre%20Lalo">Pierre Lalo</a>, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Fauré. Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.

With the twelfth nocturne Fauré returned to the scale and complexity of his middle-period works, but both melodically and harmonically it is much harder to comprehend. There are deliberate dissonances and harmonic ambiguities that Pinkas describes as "taking tonality to its limit while still maintaining a single key." Morrison writes that "the ecstatic song of No 6 is transformed in a central section where lyricism is soured by dissonance, held up, as it were, to a distorting mirror." The work is in Fauré's customary nocturne form, A–B–A, but with a reiteration of the material of the second section, harmonically transformed, followed by a coda that draws on material from the opening section.

Fauré scholars are generally agreed that the last nocturne – which was the last work he wrote for the piano – is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is "incontestably the most moving and inspired of the series." Bricard calls it "the most inspired and beautiful in the series." For Pinkas, the work "achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression." The work opens in a "pure, almost rarefied atmosphere" (Nectoux), with a "tone of noble, gentle supplication ... imposing gravity and ... rich expressive four part writing." This is followed by an "allegro", "a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang" (Pinkas). The repeat of the opening section completes the work.

Barcarolles were originally folk songs sung by <a href="gondola">Venetian gondoliers</a>. In Morrison's phrase, Fauré's use of the term was more convenient than precise. Fauré was not attracted by fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as "barcarolle" if his publishers did not insist. His son Philippe recalled, "he would far rather have given his Nocturnes, Impromptus, and even his Barcarolles the simple title Piano Piece no. so-and-so." Nevertheless, following the precedents of Chopin and most conspicuously Mendelssohn, Fauré made extensive use of the barcarolle, in what his biographer Jessica Duchen calls "an evocation of the rhythmic rocking and lapping of water around appropriately lyrical melodies."

Fauré's ambidexterity is reflected in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard as well as in the bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.

Like the nocturnes, the barcarolles span nearly the whole of Fauré's composing career, and they similarly display the evolution of his style from the uncomplicated charm of the early pieces to the withdrawn and enigmatic quality of the late works. All are written with compound time signatures (6/8 or 9/8), except number 7, which is in 6/4.

The first barcarolle was dedicated to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. <a href="Caroline%20Montigny-R%C3%A9maury">Caroline Montigny-Rémaury</a>) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20Nationale%20de%20Musique">Société Nationale de Musique</a> in 1882. The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in <a href="time%20signature">6/8 time</a>. It develops into a more elaborate form before the introduction of the second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.

The second barcarolle, dedicated to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, and points to the influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected <a href="time%20signature">9/8</a> in the middle of the piece.

The third barcarolle is dedicated to Henriette Roger-Jourdain, wife of Fauré's friend, the painter . It opens with a simple phrase that is quickly elaborated into trills reminiscent of Chopin. The middle section, like that of the first, keeps the melody in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated ornaments above and below. The pianist <a href="Marguerite%20Long">Marguerite Long</a> said that these ornaments "crown the theme like sea foam."

One of the best-known of the set, the fourth barcarolle is "tuneful, quite short, perhaps more direct than the others." (Koechlin).
Dedicated to <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy</a>, the fifth barcarolle was written after a five-year period in which Fauré composed nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It is the first of Fauré's piano works in which there are no identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.

Koechlin brackets the sixth and seventh of the set together as a contrasting pair. Both pieces show "an economy of writing", the sixth "more moderate and tranquil in expression". The Fauré scholar <a href="Roy%20Howat">Roy Howat</a> writes of a "sensuous insouciance" with an underlying virtuosity and wit under the "deceptively nonchalant surface".

The seventh barcarolle contrasts with its predecessor in being more restless and sombre, recalling Fauré's "Crépuscule" from his song cycle "<a href="La%20chanson%20d%27%C3%88ve">La chanson d'Ève</a>".

Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau, the eighth barcarolle opens in with a cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy. The second episode, in C minor, marked "cantabile", is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a "fortissimo" chord.

The ninth barcarolle, in Koechlin's view, "recalls, as in a hazy remoteness, the happiness of the past". Nectoux writes that it consists of "a series of harmonic or <a href="polyphonic">polyphonic</a> variations on a strange, sombre, syncopated theme, whose monotony recalls some sailor's song".
Dedicated to Madame Léon Blum, the tenth barcarolle stays more closely within conventional tonality than its predecessor, "with a certain sedate gravity ... the monotony appropriate to a grey evening" (Koechlin). The melancholy theme is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's Venetian themes from "Songs Without Words", but is developed in a way characteristic of Fauré, with "increasingly animated rhythms and, at certain points, excessively complex textures" (Nectoux).

Dedicated to Laura, daughter of the composer <a href="Isaac%20Alb%C3%A9niz">Isaac Albéniz</a>. The eleventh and twelfth of the set can be viewed as another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing austerity of Fauré's later style.

Dedicated to <a href="Louis%20Di%C3%A9mer">Louis Diémer</a>, the twelfth barcarolle is an "allegretto giocoso". It opens in what was by now for Fauré a rare uncomplicated theme, in the traditional Venetian manner, but is developed in more subtle rhythms. Despite the increasing complexity of the polyphonic lines, Fauré keeps the melody prominent, and the piece ends with it transformed into "a theme of almost triumphal character" (Nectoux).

The last of the set is dedicated to Magda Gumaelius. Koechlin writes of it: "bare, superficially almost dry, but at heart most expressive with that deep nostalgia for vanished bright horizons: sentiments that the composer suggests in passing rather than comments on in loquacious or theatrical oratory; he seemed to desire to preserve the soothing and illusory serenity of the mirage."

Cortot compared the first impromptu to a rapid barcarolle, redolent of "sunlit water", combining "stylised coquetry and regret".

Dedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina, the second impromptu maintains an airy <a href="tarantella">tarantella</a> rhythm. It is scored less richly than the first of the set, giving it a lightness of texture.

The third impromptu is the most popular of the set. Morrison calls it "among Fauré's most idyllic creations, its principal idea dipping and soaring above a gyrating, moto perpetuo accompaniment". It is marked by a combination of dash and delicacy.

Dedicated to "Madame de Marliave" (Marguerite Long), the fourth impromptu was Fauré's return to the genre in his middle period. Unlike much of his music of the period, it avoids a dark mood, but Fauré had by now moved on from the uncomplicated charm of the first three of the set. His mature style is displayed in the central section, a contemplative "andante", which is followed by a more agitated section that concludes the work.

Nectoux describes this impromptu as "a piece of sheer virtuosity celebrating, not without humour, the beauties of the whole-tone scale." Morrison, however, writes that the work "seethes with unrest".

The last work in the published set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904. Cortot made a transcription for piano, published in 1913 as Fauré's Op 86 "bis". The outer sections are light and brilliant, with a gentler central section, marked "<a href="meno%20mosso">meno mosso</a>".

The four valses-caprices are not a cycle, but rather two sets of two, the first from Fauré's early period and the second from his middle period. Morrison calls all four "more 'caprice' than 'waltz, and comments that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Saëns waltzes. They show Fauré at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting in and out of unexpected keys. Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Fauré's music, wrote, "the several "Valses-Caprices," in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure's "esprit". His is too orderly, too logical a mind to be really capricious." Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their "sensual grace ... perfect distinction ... impassioned tenderness."

Chopin's influence is marked in the first two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to that at the end of Chopin's <a href="Waltz%20in%20E%20minor%20%28Chopin%29">Waltz in E minor</a>. In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt ("<a href="Au%20bord%20d%27une%20source">Au bord d'une source</a>") in the opening bars. In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's "<a href="Grande%20valse%20brillante%20in%20E%20flat%20major%20%28Chopin%29">Grande Valse Brillante</a>", Op, 18.

Orledge writes that the second two valses-caprices are subtler and better integrated than the first two; they contain "more moments of quiet contemplation and more thematic development than before." There still remain touches of virtuosity and traces of Liszt, and these two valses-caprices are, in Orledge's words, the only solo pieces in the middle period to end in a loud and spectacular manner.
No 3 is dedicated to Mme. Philippe Dieterlen, No 4 to Mme. Max Lyon.

Fauré wrote these three "songs without words" while still a student at the École Niedermeyer, in about 1863. They were not published until 1880, but they then became some of his most popular works. Copland considered them immature pieces, which "should be relegated to the indiscretions every young composer commits." Later critics have taken a less severe view; Morrison describes the Romances as "an affectionate and very Gallic tribute to Mendelssohn's urbanity, agitation and ease." The commentator Keith Anderson writes that although they were a popular French counterpart to Mendelssohn's "<a href="Songs%20without%20Words">Songs without Words</a>", Fauré's own voice is already recognisable. Instead of placing the slowest piece in the middle of the set and ending with the lively A minor piece, Fauré, already with musical views of his own, switches the expected order, and the set ends "pianissimo", fading to nothing.

The first romance, in A major, has as an opening theme an uncomplicated melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. The theme is presented first in the higher and then in the middle register, before flowing evenly to its conclusion.

The second romance, in A minor, an exuberant piece, has a strong semiquaver figure supporting the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later to become one of Fauré's most recognisable characteristics. After a lively display, the piece ends quietly.

The final piece of the set, in A major, is a serene "andante", with a flowing tune in the Mendelssohnian style. After gentle variation, it equally gently fades to silence at the end.

The Ballade, dedicated to <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, dates from 1877. It is one of Fauré's most substantial works for solo piano, but is better known in a version for piano and orchestra that he made in 1881 at Liszt's suggestion. Playing for a little over 14 minutes, it is second in length only to the "Thème et variations." Fauré first conceived the music as a set of individual pieces, but then decided to make them into a single work by carrying the main theme of each section over into the following section as a secondary theme. The work opens with the F major theme, an "andante cantabile", which is followed by a slower section, marked "lento", in E minor. The third section is an andante introducing a third theme. In the last section, an allegro, a return of the second theme brings the work to a conclusion in which Nectoux comments, the treble sings with particular delicacy.

<a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a> knew Fauré, and the Ballade is thought to have been the inspiration for the sonata by Proust's character Vinteuil that haunts Swann in "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time">In Search of Lost Time</a>". <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, reviewing an early performance of the Ballade, compared the music with the attractive soloist, straightening her shoulder-straps during the performance: "I don't know why, but I somehow associated the charm of these gestures with the music of Fauré himself. The play of fleeting curves that is its essence can be compared to the movements of a beautiful woman without either suffering from the comparison." Morrison describes the Ballade as "a reminder of halcyon, half-remembered summer days and bird-haunted forests".

The <a href="Mazurka">Mazurka</a> was composed in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It is a tribute to Chopin, and contains echoes of the earlier composer's music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Fauré wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Fauré's part. The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Fauré's friendship with <a href="Sergei%20Taneyev">Sergei Taneyev</a> at around the time of its composition.

The "Pavane" (1887) was conceived and originally written as an orchestral piece. Fauré published the version for piano in 1889. In the form of an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> heard Fauré play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than <a href="beats%20per%20minute">crochet=100</a>. Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the "Pavane" was not a piece of German romanticism.

Written in 1895, when he was 50, this is among Fauré's most extended compositions for piano, with a performance time of about 15 minutes. Although it has many passages that reflect the influence of Schumann's "<a href="Symphonic%20Studies%20%28Schumann%29">Symphonic Studies</a>", in Jessica Duchen's words "its harmonies and pianistic idioms" are unmistakably those of Fauré. As in the earlier "Romances sans paroles", Op 17, Fauré does not follow the conventional course of ending with the loudest and most extrovert variation; the variation nearest to that description is placed next to last, and is followed by a gentle conclusion, "a typically Faurean understated finish." Copland wrote of the work:
Fauré's opera based on the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first performed in 1913, after which the composer published a version of the prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble "andante moderato" theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano.

Fauré did not intend these pieces to be published as a set; they were composed as individual works between 1869 and 1902. When <a href="Julien%20Hamelle">Hamelle</a>, his publishers, insisted on issuing them together as "Eight Short Pieces" in 1902, the composer successfully demanded that none of the eight must be allocated its own title. When he moved on to another publisher, Hamelle ignored his earlier instructions and issued subsequent editions with titles for each piece. Nectoux comments that the labelling of the eighth piece as "Nocturne No 8" is particularly questionable (see "Nocturne [No 8]", below). In the first decade of the 21st century the publisher Peters issued a new critical edition of the Eight Pieces with the spurious titles removed. The eight pieces take less than three minutes each in performance.

Capriccio in E major: Dedicated to Madame Jean Leonard Koechlin. Morrison calls it "capricious indeed", and notes a harmonic twist at the end "as nonchalant as it is acrobatic". It was originally written as a sight-reading test for students at the <a href="Paris%20Conservatoire">Paris Conservatoire</a>, of which Fauré was the professor of composition from 1896 and director from 1905 to 1920.

Fantaisie in A major: Koechlin calls this piece a pleasant "<a href="Album%20leaf%20%28music%29">feuillet d'album</a>".

Fugue in A minor: This, like the other fugue in the set, is a revised version of a fugue Fauré composed at the start of his career, when he was a church organist in <a href="Rennes">Rennes</a>. They are both, in Koechlin's view "in a pleasant and correct style, obviously less rich than those in the Well-Tempered Clavier, and more careful, but whose reserve conceals an incontestable mastery".

Adagietto in E minor: An "andante moderato", "serious, grave, at once firm and pliant, attaining real beauty" (Koechlin).

Improvisation in C minor: Orledge calls this piece a middle period "song without words". It was composed as a sight-reading test for the Conservatoire.

Fugue in E minor: See Fugue in A minor, above.

Allégresse in C major: "A bubbling perpetuum mobile whose surging romantic feelings are only just kept under restraint" (Orledge). "A song, pure and gay, uplifted to a sunlit sky, a youthful outpouring, full of happiness." (Koechlin).

Nocturne [No 8] in D major: As noted above, this piece stands apart from the larger-scale works to which Fauré gave the title "nocturne". It would not be listed among them were it not for the publisher's unauthorised use of the title in this case. It is the longest of the eight pieces of Op 84, but is much shorter and simpler than the other 12 nocturnes, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.

The nine préludes are among the least known of Fauré's major piano compositions. They were written while the composer was struggling to come to terms with the onset of deafness in his mid-sixties. By Fauré's standards this was a time of unusually prolific output. The préludes were composed in 1909 and 1910, in the middle of the period in which he wrote the opera "<a href="P%C3%A9n%C3%A9lope">Pénélope</a>", barcarolles Nos. 8–11 and nocturnes Nos. 9–11.

In Koechlin's view, "Apart from the "Préludes" of Chopin, it is hard to think of a collection of similar pieces that are so important". The critic Michael Oliver wrote, "Fauré's Préludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness ... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity." Jessica Duchen calls them "unusual slivers of magical inventiveness." The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.

"Andante molto moderato". The first prélude is in the manner of a nocturne. Morrison refers to the cool serenity with which it opens, contrasted with the "slow and painful climbing" of the middle section.

"Allegro." The "moto perpetuo" of the second prélude is technically difficult for the pianist; even the most celebrated Fauré interpreter can be stretched by it. Koechlin calls it "a feverish whirling of dervishes, concluding in a sort of ecstasy, with the evocation of some fairy palace."

"Andante." Copland considered this prélude the most immediately accessible of the set. "At first, what will most attract you, will be the third in G-minor, a strange mixture of the romantic and classic." The musicologist <a href="Vladimir%20Jank%C3%A9l%C3%A9vitch">Vladimir Jankélévitch</a> wrote, "it might be a barcarolle strangely interrupting a theme of very modern stylistic contour".

"Allegretto moderato." The fourth prélude is among the gentlest of the set. The critic Alain Cochard writes that it "casts a spell on the ear through the subtlety of a harmony tinged with the modal and its melodic freshness." Koechlin calls it "a guileless pastorale, flexible, with succinct and refined modulations".

"Allegro." Cochard quotes the earlier writer <a href="Louis%20Aguettant">Louis Aguettant</a>'s description of this prélude as "This fine outburst of anger ("Ce bel accès de colère")". The mood is turbulent and anxious; the piece ends in quiet resignation reminiscent of the "Libera me" of the "<a href="Requiem%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Requiem</a>".

"Andante." Fauré is at his most classical in this prélude, which is in the form of a <a href="canon%20%28music%29">canon</a>. Copland wrote that it "can be placed side by side with the most wonderful of the Preludes of the "<a href="The%20Well-Tempered%20Clavier">Well-Tempered Clavichord</a>"."

"Andante moderato." Morrison writes that this prélude, with its "stammering and halting progress" conveys an inconsolable grief. After the opening andante moderato, it becomes gradually more assertive, and subsides to conclude in the subdued mood of the opening. The rhythm of one of Fauré's best-known songs, "N'est-ce-pas?" from "<a href="La%20bonne%20chanson">La bonne chanson</a>", runs through the piece.

"Allegro." In Copland's view this is, with the third, the most approachable of the Préludes, "with its dry, acrid brilliance (so rarely found in Faure)." Morrison describes it as "a repeated-note scherzo" going "from nowhere to nowhere."

"Adagio." Copland described this prélude as "so simple – so absolutely simple that we can never hope to understand how it can contain such great emotional power." The prélude is withdrawn in mood; Jankélévitch wrote that it "belongs from beginning to end to another world." Koechlin notes echoes of the "Offertoire" of the "Requiem" throughout the piece.

Subtitled "Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les thèmes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung" ("Fantasy in the form of a quadrille on favourite themes from "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Der Ring des Nibelungen</a>""). Fauré admired the music of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.
From 1878, Fauré and his friend and ex-pupil <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Messager">André Messager</a> made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw "<a href="Das%20Rheingold">Das Rheingold</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>" at <a href="Cologne%20Opera">Cologne Opera</a>; the complete "Ring" cycle in Munich and London; and "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger</a>" in Munich and at <a href="Bayreuth%20Festival">Bayreuth</a>, where they also saw "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>". They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent "Souvenirs de Bayreuth", written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from "The Ring". It consists of five short sections in which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms. The manuscript (in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France">Bibliothèque nationale</a>, Paris) is in Messager's hand.

Between 1867 and 1873, Fauré wrote a symphonic work for full orchestra. The piece was first heard in 1873 when Fauré and Saint-Saëns performed it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived. <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Bo%C3%ABllmann">Léon Boëllmann</a> made a new transcription of the first movement in 1893.

The "Dolly Suite" is a six-section work for <a href="piano%20four-hands">piano duet</a>. It was inspired by Hélène, nicknamed "Dolly", daughter of the singer <a href="Emma%20Bardac">Emma Bardac</a> with whom Fauré was intimately associated in the 1890s. The opening piece was a present for Dolly's first birthday, and Fauré added the other five pieces to mark her subsequent birthdays and other family occasions. Unusually for Fauré, who generally favoured strictly functional titles, the movements of the suite have whimsical titles associated with Dolly and her family.

Its six movements take about fifteen minutes to perform. The first is a Berceuse, or cradle-song. "Mi-a-ou", despite a title suggesting a cat, in fact represents the infant Dolly's attempts to pronounce the name of her brother Raoul; after "Le jardin de Dolly", the "Kitty Valse", again confounds its feline title, being a sketch of the family's pet dog. After the gentle "Tendresse", the suite ends with a lively evocation of Spain, which, Orledge notes, is one of Fauré's few purely extrovert pieces.

From the orchestral suite drawn from his music for the stage presentation "<a href="Masques%20et%20bergamasques%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Masques et bergamasques</a>", Fauré made a transcription for piano duet, which was published in 1919. Like the orchestral suite, it consists of four movements, titled "Ouverture", "Menuet", "Gavotte" and "Pastorale".

Fauré made <a href="piano%20roll">piano roll</a>s of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913. The rolls that survive are of the "Romance sans paroles" No 3, Barcarolle No 1, Prelude No 3, Nocturne No 3, "Thème et variations", "Valses-caprices" Nos 1, 3 and 4, and piano versions of the "Pavane", and the "Sicilienne" from Fauré's music for "Pelléas and Mélisande". Several of these rolls have been transferred to CD. Recordings on disc were few until the 1940s. A survey by <a href="John%20Culshaw">John Culshaw</a> in December 1945 singled out recordings of piano works played by <a href="Kathleen%20Long">Kathleen Long</a>, including the Nocturne No 6, Barcarolle No 2, the Thème et Variations, Op 73, and the Ballade Op 19 in its orchestral version. Fauré's music began to appear more frequently in the record companies' releases in the 1950s.

In the LP and particularly the CD era, the record companies built up a substantial catalogue of Fauré's piano music, performed by French and non-French musicians. The piano works were first recorded largely complete in the mid-1950s by <a href="Germaine%20Thyssens-Valentin">Germaine Thyssens-Valentin</a>, with later sets being made by <a href="Grant%20Johannesen">Grant Johannesen</a> (1961), <a href="Jean%20Doyen">Jean Doyen</a> (1966–1969), <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Collard">Jean-Philippe Collard</a> (1974), <a href="Paul%20Crossley%20%28musician%29">Paul Crossley</a> (1984–85), <a href="Jean%20Hubeau">Jean Hubeau</a> (1988–89), and <a href="Kathryn%20Stott">Kathryn Stott</a> (1995). Recital selections of major piano works have been recorded by many pianists including <a href="Vlado%20Perlemuter">Vlado Perlemuter</a> (1989), <a href="Pascal%20Rog%C3%A9">Pascal Rogé</a> (1990), and <a href="Kun-Woo%20Paik">Kun-Woo Paik</a> (2002).

They had produced Rihanna's 2010 hit singles "<a href="Only%20Girl%20%28In%20the%20World%29">Only Girl (In the World)</a>" and "<a href="What%27s%20My%20Name%3F%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">What's My Name?</a>" for her fifth album "<a href="Loud%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">Loud</a>".

Eriksen and Hermansen recorded the song's instrumentation, and Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. were assigned as its <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>s.

In December 2011, Rihanna asked her fans on Twitter to recommend a song from "Talk That Talk" for release as the third single. On January 10, 2012, she announced that the title track was chosen and also debuted the single's cover—a black-and-white image in which Rihanna is dressed in "street punk/rockabilly clothes" and crouches against a wall. According to Jazmine Gray of "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" magazine, the singer has an ambiguous facial expression on the cover. On January 17, <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> serviced "Talk That Talk" to <a href="urban%20contemporary">urban contemporary</a> radio stations in the United States. It was also sent to US <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit</a> and <a href="Rhythmic%20contemporary">rhythmic</a> radios on February 14. On March 26, "Talk That Talk" was released in France as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a>, which contained the album version of the song and the Chuckie Extended Remix of "We Found Love".

"Talk That Talk" has a length of three minutes and twenty-nine seconds. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's Claire Suddath characterized it as a lively <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> track with a <a href="Pop%20music">pop</a> <a href="Hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>. It features <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> <a href="Beat%20%28music%29">beats</a>, "hard drums", unrefined <a href="synths">synths</a>, and a <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sample</a> of the song "I Got a Story to Tell" by rapper <a href="The%20Notorious%20B.I.G.">The Notorious B.I.G.</a>.

Adrian Thrills from the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" described the song as "slow and sultry". Similarly, Sam Lansky of <a href="MTV%20Buzzworthy">MTV Buzzworthy</a> found it sensual and confident, and observed that Rihanna counts when she sings the song's <a href="Refrain">chorus</a>. <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Chad Grischow wrote that a "fuzzy synth melody" interjects Rihanna's "sexy plea for pillow talk", which is complemented by "bling-loving rap from Jay-Z." <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>'s Robert Copsey felt that its <a href="Riff%20%28music%29">riff</a> is similar to Rihanna's 2010 single "<a href="Rude%20Boy%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Rude Boy</a>".

The song begins with a rap verse performed by Jay Z, whose lines include: "I talk big money, I talk big homes / I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome / Million dollar voice, came through phone / We heading to the top, if you coming, come on". He raps at a slow pace and incorporates both <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a>s and humorous remarks, including a sexual reference that Claire Suddath viewed was an indication of Jay Z's enjoyment on the song: "[I] had it by her bladder, she's like 'Oh I gotta pee!'." Melissa Maerz from "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" remarked that he "even touts their jet-set lifestyle on the title track, bragging that he can fly out to Pisa / Just to get some pizza."

"<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" critic Gavin Martin commented that the song has Rihanna "stealing not just <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>'s bootylicious crown but also her husband Jay Z for a frisky exchange against sibilant drum cracks." <a href="Sputnikmusic">Sputnikmusic</a>'s Steve M. felt that it could be a major hit on radio partly because of Jay Z's guest rap. Reem Buhazza of "<a href="The%20National%20%28Abu%20Dhabi%29">The National</a>" similarly felt that "Talk That Talk", along with "<a href="You%20da%20One">You da One</a>" and "<a href="Roc%20Me%20Out">Roc Me Out</a>", is part of "the winning combination of made-for-radio pop sensibility". David Griffiths from <a href="4Music">4Music</a> found the song to be compelling and viewed it as another successful collaboration between Rihanna and Jay-Z. Lansky from MTV Buzzworthy was not surprised that another collaboration between the two was a success. <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a>' Jocelyn Vena called it "big and hard with just enough brightness" and felt that the song discusses <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a> more appropriately than "<a href="Cockiness%20%28Love%20It%29">Cockiness (Love It)</a>"; in the latter, Rihanna expresses her desire to have sex while singing the lyrics "Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion".

Lewis Corner of "Digital Spy" gave the song four out of five stars and called it an enticing, anthemic club song. In a review of "Talk That Talk", <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">"Pitchfork"</a>s Lindsay Zoladz wrote that it is one of the album's more lighthearted songs, even though it is not as good as "Umbrella". <a href="Consequence%20of%20Sound">Consequence of Sound</a>'s Chris Coplan found Jay Z's rap unenthusiastic, but said that Rihanna is as emotional and invested in her singing as she was on "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>". "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine's Chuck Arnold called the song "another moment in the sun." Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" thought that it is a collaboration that "does not go unnoticed". On the critical side, Priya Elan of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" wrote that the song is a "gamble that doesn't pay off". The single was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap/Sung%20Collaboration">Best Rap/Sung Collaboration</a> at the <a href="2013%20Grammy%20Awards">2013 Grammy Awards</a>. but lost to "<a href="No%20Church%20in%20the%20Wild">No Church in the Wild</a>" (2012) by Jay-Z and Kanye West featuring <a href="Frank%20Ocean">Frank Ocean</a> and <a href="The-Dream">The-Dream</a>.
After the release of the album, the song charted in many countries owing to strong digital sales. It debuted and peaked at number 31 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 and sold 73,000 digital copies, which was the highest debut on the chart for that week.

<a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> William Francis James McCann, (19 April 1892 – 14 December 1957) was an Australian soldier of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, and a prominent figure in the military and ex-service community of <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. Born and raised in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, he worked as a teacher before the war. He enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> as a <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> in 1914, and rose through the ranks to be <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> during the <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli campaign</a> of 1915. In 1916–1918 he fought on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France and Belgium, was wounded twice, and rose to the rank of <a href="major">major</a>. For his gallantry during the war, he was made a <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Companion of the Distinguished Service Order</a> and twice awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>. After the war, he served as <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a> of the <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a> until its disbandment in 1919.

Returning home, McCann became a barrister and formed a legal partnership with <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> recipient <a href="Arthur%20Blackburn">Arthur Blackburn</a>. McCann was active in returned servicemen's organisations, as president of the South Australian branch of the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League">Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League</a> from 1924 to 1931, and as a state vice-president from 1938 to 1949. He was a foundation member of the <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Club of Adelaide</a>, looking after the dependents of deceased servicemen. His service in the part-time <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Citizen Military Forces</a> saw him reach the rank of lieutenant colonel and command the <a href="43rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">43rd Battalion</a> between 1927 and 1930. Appointed as state prices commissioner and deputy Commonwealth prices commissioner from 1938 to 1954; in 1946 an arson attack on his home was linked to his anti–<a href="black%20market">black market</a>eering work in those roles. In recognition of his work with the ex-service community, McCann was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1935, and a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> in 1956.

William Francis James McCann was born at <a href="Glanville%2C%20South%20Australia">Glanville</a>, outside <a href="Adelaide%2C%20South%20Australia">Adelaide, South Australia</a>, on 19 April 1892, to <a href="South%20Australian%20Railways">South Australian Railways</a> engine driver John Francis McCann and his wife Eliza, Francis. He attended various <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a>s then <a href="Adelaide%20High%20School">Adelaide High School</a>, and completed teacher training with the state <a href="Department%20for%20Education%20and%20Child%20Development">Education Department</a> in December 1913. He taught in <a href="Ethelton%2C%20South%20Australia">Ethelton</a>, <a href="Malvern%2C%20South%20Australia">Malvern</a> and Glanville prior to the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. His pre-war military experience consisted of four years in the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">volunteer cadets</a> while he was at school and participating in the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> Rifle Club during his teacher training.

McCann enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 24 August 1914 at <a href="Morphettville%2C%20South%20Australia">Morphettville, South Australia</a>. He was allotted to the South Australian-raised <a href="10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">10th Battalion</a>, part of the <a href="3rd%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Brigade</a>, as a <a href="private%20%28rank%29">private</a> with the regimental number 405. Within a week he had been promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>. The <a href="battalion">battalion</a> embarked for overseas in October, and sailed via <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a>, to Egypt, arriving in early December. While the force was training in Egypt, McCann was appointed as a <a href="platoon%20sergeant">platoon sergeant</a> in the battalion's D Company. After completing training, the 3rd Brigade was designated as the <a href="covering%20force">covering force</a> for the <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a>, <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, on 25 April 1915, and so was the first brigade ashore about 4:30 am. Four days later McCann was appointed as <a href="company%20sergeant%20major">company sergeant major</a>. During that period, the 10th Battalion suffered casualties of 13 officers and 453 men from the 29 officers and 921 men who landed. On 19 May the battalion helped repel a concerted Turkish <a href="counter-attack">counter-attack</a> against the landing force, after which it settled into a routine of rotating through various positions in the line. His outstanding service during the period 6 May to 28 June gained McCann several mentions in <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</a> routine orders. In July, McCann and most of the battalion had a three-day rest on the island of <a href="Imbros">Imbros</a>, but were quickly back in the trenches at Anzac. McCann was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 4 August, by which time nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 14 November. McCann remained at Anzac, serving as battalion intelligence and signalling officer until the unit was withdrawn to the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> in late November, followed by evacuation to Egypt the following month.

When the bulk of the AIF was transferred to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, McCann shipped to France in late March 1916 as the <a href="Reconnaissance">scouting</a>, <a href="Sniper">sniping</a> and <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> officer of his battalion. After disembarking in <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a>, he commanded a composite <a href="guard%20of%20honour">guard of honour</a> drawn from the <a href="9th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">9th</a> and 10th Battalions. On 16 April 1916, he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> and was appointed as <a href="second-in-command">second-in-command</a> of A Company. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a> on 23 July, he commanded the lead company of the battalion when it entered a bomb (<a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>) fight over the O.G.1 trench system in support of the 9th Battalion. The Australian Official War Historian, <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, described his actions as follows: According to McCann, his party was forced back due to the lack of grenades and the failure of other groups to keep in touch with his party. The citation for his <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, awarded for his actions at Pozières, read; "For conspicuous gallantry in action. He led his company in the attack, bombing the enemy back, and, in spite of heavy casualties, pressed forward until severely wounded by a bomb."

McCann was the first member of the 10th Battalion to be awarded the Military Cross, and was also the first unit officer to receive an award in the field for any specific action. The wound to his head had severely fractured his skull, but he remained at his post until he had reported the situation to the commanding officer of the 9th Battalion. He was evacuated to hospital in England, and his award was reported in the <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> "<a href="Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">Advertiser</a>" newspaper on 29 September along with a photograph and brief details of his service. After he had recovered sufficiently, he attended an investiture at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> on 4 October to receive his Military Cross from <a href="George%20V">King George V</a>. The same day, a fellow 10th Battalion officer, <a href="Arthur%20Blackburn">Arthur Blackburn</a>, received his <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his own actions at Pozières that closely followed those of McCann. McCann was medically classified to be repatriated to Australia on a hospital ship, but ignored these orders and returned to his battalion in France in November. On arrival, he was placed in command of B Company. Suffering from illness, he was evacuated in February 1917, and after recovering was sent to a training school for a month. He rejoined the battalion in March.

On the night of 8 April 1917, as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a> began, the 10th Battalion attacked <a href="Louverval">Louverval</a> Wood, an outpost of the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> of German defences. McCann was wounded in the neck during the attack, and after having it bandaged and being scarcely able to speak, remained with his troops for several hours, and according to the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>", "was an inspiration to his men". Once the situation was clear, he reported for medical attention and was evacuated to hospital in England. After six weeks recuperating, McCann rejoined his unit at the end of May, assuming command of A Company. He remained with the battalion throughout the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a> in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> from July to November 1917, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Menin%20Road%20Ridge">Battle of the Menin Road Ridge</a> in September, before being <a href="secondment">seconded</a> to a training battalion in the United Kingdom in late December. He returned to his battalion in June 1918. On 29 June, after the battalion had captured a section of the German line using "<a href="peaceful%20penetration">peaceful penetration</a>" tactics, McCann's company was in the newly won positions when the Germans counter-attacked and got between his advanced posts. He led his company signallers, messengers and reserve platoon forward into the gap. The Germans dropped their weapons, which included a machine gun, and ran.

During the 10th Battalion's capture of <a href="Merris">Merris</a> in July, his company's successful severing of the German lines of communication resulted in the award of a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to McCann's Military Cross. The citation read: 

On 10 August, during early fighting in the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, which began on 8 August 1918 with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amiens%20%281918%29">Battle of Amiens</a>, the 10th Battalion was tasked with providing support to an attack led by the 9th Battalion, which had suffered significant casualties as it attacked near <a href="Lihons">Lihons</a>. Unable to capture German positions in Crépey Wood, the 9th Battalion called on the 10th for assistance. As McCann commanded the strongest company of the 10th Battalion, he was sent forward. He led A Company in clearing the wood, his sub-unit sustaining only 15 casualties in the fighting, and capturing 10 badly wounded Germans. The 9th Battalion and McCann's company established posts in the wood. After a German barrage fell on the newly won positions, McCann was visiting his posts along the northern edge of the wood when he saw 200 to 300 Germans approaching to attack. This counter-attack overran one of the four A Company posts, and one isolated post withdrew. The German counter-attack also forced the withdrawal of the 9th Battalion from the eastern edge of the wood. The two remaining A Company posts continued fighting. One, manned by McCann, one other officer and seven men, fought the Germans for an hour. The Germans got into the post three times, and each time the Australians forced them out. McCann and his party eventually drove them off, killing 90 of the enemy. McCann's company suffered 30 casualties in the fighting, but their efforts allowed the 9th Battalion to re-establish its posts along the eastern edge of the wood. The next morning, McCann's company was subjected to a heavy gas bombardment in Crépey Wood, and he was allocated three <a href="tank">tank</a>s of the 5th Tank Brigade to clear the area north of his positions. Another German counter-attack developed, and the enemy got behind the Australian positions. McCann was reinforced; then, gathering troops from both his company and the 9th Battalion and moving forward by "vigorous action and hard, confused fighting", he and others closed the gap in the front line. For his actions at Crépey Wood, McCann was later made a <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Companion of the Distinguished Service Order</a>, the second highest award for acts of gallantry by officers. The citation read: 

The 10th Battalion was back in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance continued north of <a href="Proyart">Proyart</a>. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the <a href="1st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">1st Brigade</a>. Learning of German positions in Luc Wood that were holding up the advance, the commanding officer, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Maurice%20Wilder-Neligan">Maurice Wilder-Neligan</a>, tasked McCann, commanding two companies, to clear the area. Along with flanking troops, McCann secured the wood, capturing 15 prisoners and four machine guns, allowing the advance to continue. McCann temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in late August before being promoted to temporary <a href="Major%20%28rank%29">major</a> on 23 September. The battalion saw its last action of the war later that month. McCann again temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in early October, and was substantively promoted to major on 21 October. Shortly after this he attended a strategy and tactics course at the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>, before returning to the battalion in November, when he was appointed as unit second-in-command. In early January 1919, McCann was appointed <a href="commanding%20officer">commanding officer</a>. He led the 10th Battalion until its disbandment in March, and was <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mentioned</a> in <a href="Field%20Marshal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig's</a> final despatch of 16 March 1919. Also in March, McCann led a party of American delegates on a tour of the war zone and, the following month, headed the 3rd Brigade contingent in the <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> march through London. On 3 May he was invested with his Distinguished Service Order and the bar to his Military Cross at Buckingham Palace. Later that month he embarked for Australia, arriving in Adelaide in June. He was admitted to <a href="Keswick%2C%20South%20Australia">Keswick</a> Repatriation General Hospital on his return, and was discharged from the AIF on 8 September 1919. Two of McCann's brothers also served in the AIF, and one was killed in action. McCann was issued with the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20Star">1914–15 Star</a>, <a href="British%20War%20Medal">British War Medal</a>, and <a href="Victory%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Victory Medal</a> for his service during the war.

McCann resigned from the Education Department in November 1919, having turned his hand to agriculture the previous month. He farmed at <a href="Truro%2C%20South%20Australia">Truro</a> and <a href="Manoora%2C%20South%20Australia">Manoora</a> but was hampered by his war injuries, and abandoned these plans in August the following year. In accordance with normal procedures, while serving in the AIF he had been appointed an honorary major in the peacetime army, the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Citizen Military Forces</a> (CMF). He was substantively promoted to major in the CMF on 1 October 1920, on the Reserve of Officers List. McCann began studying as an <a href="articled%20clerk">articled clerk</a> in December 1920. He married Mildred Southcott on 20 August 1921; they had two sons and a daughter. In 1921 he began an active association with the South Australian branch of the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League">Returned Sailors' and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia</a> (RSSILA), initially as a state vice-president. In this capacity he was also a member of the Soldier's Children's Education Board.

In March 1922, McCann began studying law at the University of Adelaide. He was elected president of the state branch of the RSSILA in 1924. McCann was an early advocate for the building of the <a href="National%20War%20Memorial%20%28South%20Australia%29">National War Memorial</a> in Adelaide, defended the status of Anzac Day as a public holiday against protests from the retail sector due to reduced shopping hours, and represented the interests of <a href="Soldier%20settlement%20%28Australia%29">soldier settlers</a>. He was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">Bar</a> on 25 July 1925, and went into partnership with Arthur Blackburn, forming the law firm Blackburn and McCann. On 19 May 1927, he transferred from the Reserve of Officers List to the part-time 10th Battalion, and on 1 July was transferred to the part-time <a href="43rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">43rd Battalion</a> as its commanding officer, gaining promotion to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 1 December. In 1928, McCann was a foundation member of the <a href="Legacy%20Australia">Legacy Club of Adelaide</a>, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen. When the National War Memorial design was being finalised, McCann strongly supported including the names of all South Australians who were killed in World War I; his suggestion was incorporated in the design. At the 1928 national conference of the RSSILA, McCann sharply criticised the defence policy of the Federal Government, particularly funding provided; "[d]efence has been brought down to such a low point", he said, "that it is now an absurdity."

McCann was an active member of the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Movement">Big Brother Movement</a> in South Australia; this involved supporting boys that had migrated to Australia from the United Kingdom under the <a href="Home%20Children">Child Migrant</a> scheme. He commanded the 43rd Battalion until July 1930 when he transferred to the Unattached List, and continued as president of the RSSILA until 1931, leading the RSSILA delegation to the biennial conference of the <a href="Royal%20Commonwealth%20Ex-Services%20League">British Empire Service League</a> in London in 1929. Returning from the conference and a tour of the former battlefields and war cemeteries, McCann contended that World War I had not been worthwhile, as tremendous loss had produced little gain, a stance that led to public criticism.

McCann took a leave of absence from the state presidency of the RSSILA to unsuccessfully run for the extremely <a href="marginal%20seat">marginal</a> <a href="Division%20of%20Boothby">Division of Boothby</a> as a <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Nationalist</a> candidate in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201929">1929 federal election</a>. His decision to run was criticised in some quarters as undermining the apolitical stance of the RSSILA. His campaign was supported by Senator <a href="Harold%20Edward%20Elliott">Harold Edward Elliott</a>, a <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victorian</a> who had first met then-Sergeant McCann during the Gallipoli campaign and had been so impressed with him that he had offered McCann a commission in his battalion. McCann received 19,675 votes, comprising some 44.4 per cent of the tally, against the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> incumbent, <a href="John%20Price%20%28South%20Australian%20politician%29">John Price</a>, who received 24,641 votes, or 55.6 per cent. McCann's defeat was part of a nationwide swing to the Labor Party that saw the Nationalist–Country coalition government lose office. He subsequently resigned as state president of the RSSILA, effective from before the election.

In 1930, McCann was nominated for the position of national president of the RSSILA, as part of a South Australian push for preference for returned servicemen in employment matters. In the event, the sitting president was re-nominated and narrowly re-elected with support from the state branches of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, and a <a href="casting%20vote">casting vote</a> by the <a href="returning%20officer">returning officer</a>. In December 1930, McCann was again elected president of the state branch of the RSSILA, but retired from the post the following year. In 1934, McCann was appointed as the chair of the state government Industrial Board, which was responsible for government employees engaged in construction.

In early 1935, McCann was appointed to act in the place of Blackburn, who was now the city <a href="coroner">coroner</a>, during the latter's absence on leave and other duties. The same year, McCann transferred back to the CMF officers' reserve, and was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (Civil Division) for services to returned soldiers and sailors. He also ran unsuccessfully for election as the president of the state branch of the RSSILA, became a <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a>, and was awarded the <a href="King%20George%20V%20Silver%20Jubilee%20Medal">King George V Silver Jubilee Medal</a>. In 1938, McCann successfully ran for election as a <a href="councillor">councillor</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20Burnside">City of Burnside</a>, and was re-elected as a state vice-president of the RSSILA, continuing in this role until 1949.

From 1938 to 1954 he was the state prices commissioner and deputy Commonwealth prices commissioner. Following the outbreak of World War II, McCann briefly commanded a special constabulary of men over 45 – known as the South Australian Emergency National Defence League – and was involved in raising the RSSILA <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a>, the Australian equivalent of the British <a href="Home%20Guard">Home Guard</a>. During the war, McCann was the chairman of the state Fighting Forces Comfort Fund, which sent parcels to troops serving overseas. In 1944, McCann was re-elected as a Burnside councillor, but resigned the following year. In 1946, his inquiries as prices commissioner into <a href="black%20market">black market</a>eering resulted in his home being deliberately set alight. A man was subsequently convicted for the crime and sentenced to six years imprisonment with hard labour. The following year, McCann was elected the first president of the Tenth Battalion AIF Association, which combined the old 10th Battalion Club and the World War II <a href="2/10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/10th Battalion</a> Club. His wife, Mildred, died in 1948. In 1956 he was appointed <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> for services to ex-servicemen. He died of <a href="coronary%20disease">coronary disease</a> at <a href="Tusmore%2C%20South%20Australia">Tusmore</a> on 14 December 1957 and was buried at <a href="North%20Road%20Cemetery">North Road Cemetery</a>. The "Australian Dictionary of Biography" described him as "an able speaker and a keen debater with a pleasant and tenacious personality".

Typhoon Gay (1992)

Typhoon Gay, known in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> as Typhoon Seniang, was the strongest and longest-lasting storm of the <a href="1992%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season">1992 Pacific typhoon season</a>. It formed on November 14 near the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a> from a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a>, which also spawned two other systems. Typhoon Gay later moved through the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a> as an intensifying <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a>, and after passing through the country it reached its peak intensity over open waters. The <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)</a> estimated peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a minimum <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of . However, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)</a>, which is the official warning center in the western Pacific, estimated winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), with a pressure of . Gay weakened rapidly after peaking because of interaction with another typhoon, and it struck <a href="Guam">Guam</a> with winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) on November 23. The typhoon briefly re-intensified before weakening and becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> south of Japan on November 30.

The typhoon first affected the Marshall Islands, where 5,000 people became homeless and heavy crop damage was reported. The nation's capital of <a href="Majuro">Majuro</a> experienced power and water outages during the storm. There were no fatalities among Marshall Islands citizens, although the typhoon killed a sailor traveling around the world. When Gay struck Guam, it became the sixth typhoon of the year to affect the island. Most of the weaker structures had been destroyed during <a href="Typhoon%20Omar">Typhoon Omar</a> earlier in the year, resulting in little additional damage from Gay. Because of its substantial weakening, the typhoon had a disrupted inner-core and produced minimal rainfall. However, strong winds scorched the plants on Guam with saltwater, causing extensive defoliation. Further north, high waves from the typhoon destroyed a house on <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a>, and heavy rainfall in <a href="Okinawa%20Prefecture">Okinawa</a>, Japan, caused flooding and power outages.

The origins of Typhoon Gay were from a tropical disturbance east of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a> along a <a href="monsoon%20trough">monsoon trough</a> that extended west to the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> in mid-November 1992. The same trough had earlier spawned <a href="Cyclone%20Forrest">Tropical Storm Forrest</a> and would later create <a href="Typhoon%20Hunt">Typhoon Hunt</a>. The tropical disturbance moved westward across the dateline and gradually became better organized with increased <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a>. On November 14, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)</a> issued a <a href="Tropical%20Cyclone%20Formation%20Alert">Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert</a>. At 1800 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> that day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 31W, located to the east of the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>. The <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)</a> also assessed that the depression had <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">developed</a> by that time. The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Gay.

For most of Typhoon Gay's existence, a strong <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> to its north steered the storm to the west or west-northwest. The JTWC upgraded the storm to <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> status early on November 17, and the JMA followed suit the next day. Gay first affected <a href="Mejit%20Island">Mejit Island</a> and eventually crossed the central portion of the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>. Owing to favorable <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s and upper-level <a href="wind%20shear">wind pattern</a>s, the storm entered a phase of <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapid deepening</a> similar to other November typhoons near that location. On November 19, the JTWC upgraded Gay to a <a href="super%20typhoon">super typhoon</a>, which is a typhoon with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">1-minute sustained wind</a>s of 240 km/h (150 mph). Gradual intensification ensued, and based on <a href="Dvorak%20technique">satellite estimates</a>, the JTWC estimated that Typhoon Gay attained peak winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) at 0000 UTC on November 21. The agency also estimated that the typhoon reached a minimum <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of , which would have made Gay the <a href="List%20of%20the%20most%20intense%20tropical%20cyclones">most intense typhoon</a> since <a href="Typhoon%20Tip">Typhoon Tip</a> in 1979, tying with <a href="Hurricane%20Patricia">Hurricane Patricia</a> in 2015 for the second-strongest tropical cyclone worldwide. At the same time, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph), with a pressure of .

After Gay attained its peak intensity, <a href="outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> from Typhoon Hunt to its northwest increased the <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a> over the typhoon. The wind shear deteriorated Gay's northern <a href="eyewall">eyewall</a>, causing the typhoon to weaken. In the 24 hours after Gay reached its peak intensity, the JTWC estimated that the winds had decreased by 65 km/h (40 mph) to below super typhoon status; such rapid weakening is uncommon for a storm over open waters. <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model">Tropical cyclone forecast model</a>s had anticipated Gay to make a turn to the north and northeast, but it maintained a west-northwest track toward <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. Despite weakening steadily, the typhoon maintained a large size with a <a href="Radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">wind diameter</a> of . Around 0000 UTC on November 23, Gay made <a href="landfall">landfall</a> on Guam, becoming the third typhoon in three months to strike the island—the others were <a href="Typhoon%20Omar">Typhoon Omar</a> in August and Typhoon Brian in October. Both the JTWC and the JMA estimated the typhoon to have had winds of 160 km/h (100 mph) at landfall. The influence from Typhoon Hunt diminished after Gay affected Guam, allowing it to begin restrengthening. Late on November 25, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 215 km/h (135 mph). Gay subsequently slowed while moving along the western periphery of the <a href="subtropical%20ridge">subtropical ridge</a>, and it turned north while gradually weakening. On November 28, the JMA downgraded Gay to a tropical storm, and the JTWC followed suit the next day. The JMA assessed that Gay became an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> at 0000 UTC on November 30; however, the JTWC continued issuing advisories until December 1, making it the longest-lasting typhoon of the season with 63 advisories. The remnant of Gay accelerated and turned to the northeast, passing to the southeast of Japan and crossing the International Date Line.

Typhoon Gay first affected the Marshall Islands, striking several atolls in the archipelago with typhoon-force winds. On <a href="Mejit%20Island">Mejit Island</a>, the first island to be affected, the typhoon destroyed every wooden structure and left most of the islanders homeless. High winds downed all of the island's trees and destroyed 75% of the crops. Nearby, <a href="Ailuk%20Atoll">Ailuk Atoll</a> experienced similar winds, though house damage was minor despite similar crop losses. The large wind field extended to the south, affecting <a href="Maloelap%20Atoll">Maloelap</a> and <a href="Aur%20Atoll">Aur</a> atolls with winds that damaged 30% of the houses and crops. Further south, the Marshall Islands capital city of <a href="Majuro">Majuro</a> experienced lightning strikes from the typhoon, which caused an island-wide power outage and cuts to the water supply and radio communication. Debris from the storm closed the <a href="Marshall%20Islands%20International%20Airport">Marshall Islands International Airport</a> for two days. On <a href="Ujae%20Atoll">Ujae Atoll</a>, the typhoon destroyed an automated meteorological observing station that had been installed in 1989. The typhoon left over 5,000 people homeless across the country, but there were no native deaths and only one injury in the archipelago owing to well-executed warnings and preparations. However, large waves from the typhoon sank a boat in a small lagoon, killing one of the boat's two sailors.

After affecting the Marshall Islands, Gay tracked toward Guam and became the fifth typhoon to come within of the island in six months. Extensive preparations were made, including the sending of ships to mitigate damage and flying <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> planes to other bases in the region. The schools, government buildings, airport, and port were closed, and about 4,300 people evacuated to storm shelters. Further north, 1,639 people evacuated to storm shelters on <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a>, which set the record for the most storm evacuees at the time.

Despite weakening greatly from its peak intensity, Gay struck Guam with sustained winds of 160 km/h (100 mph), with gusts to 195 km/h (120 mph) on <a href="Nimitz%20Hill">Nimitz Hill</a>. The winds were strong enough to disrupt power and water utilities, as well as destroy a few houses. As a result of its weakening, Gay had a disrupted inner-core with little precipitation, which prompted the JTWC to label it as a "dry typhoon"; rainfall totals on the island ranged from only 40–90 mm (1.5–3.5 in). Despite the extreme winds, little wind-thrown trees or snapped branches were observed. The combination of the winds and light rainfall, however, sprayed saltwater over the island's vegetation, leading to near island-wide loss of leaves. Majority of the local <a href="Dicotyledon">dicots</a> withered and lost their leaves within two days after the storm, while other plants such as <a href="Arecaceae">palms</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s and <a href="gymnosperm">gymnosperm</a>s retained their foliage but turned brown. The defoliation led to significant losses for crop farmers; in some locations, the crops did not recover for four years. Along the east coast of Guam, Gay produced a <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> of 1.2–1.8 m (4–6 ft). The surge reached 3.4 m (11 ft) on <a href="Cabras%20Island">Cabras Island</a> in northern Guam, washing sand and water onto coastal roads and breaking a boat from its moorings. The JTWC estimated that damage would have been worse had Typhoon Omar not destroyed the weaker structures three months earlier; little additional damage occurred to the island's capital of <a href="Hag%C3%A5t%C3%B1a%2C%20Guam">Hagåtña</a>. The typhoon destroyed four iron roofs on <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a> Island, located north of Guam. On Saipan to its north, the storm surge destroyed one house and threatened the foundation of several others; twelve families required rescue by emergency workers. The storm caused power outages, and one house sustained fire damage due to candles and kerosene lamps.

While Gay was becoming <a href="Extratropical%20transition">extratropical</a>, <a href="Okinawa%20Prefecture">Okinawa Prefecture</a> experienced heavy rainfall. The highest total was , and one station recorded in a ten-minute period. The rains flooded four buildings and inundated crop fields. Rough winds with gusts peaking at caused isolated power outages and the cancellation of two airline flights.

Marshall Islands president <a href="Amata%20Kabua">Amata Kabua</a> declared nine islands as disaster areas. United States president <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> also declared the Marshall Islands a disaster area on December 16. Despite being an independent nation, the Marshall Islands were eligible to the same funding from the <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> as a U.S. state or territory. The United States provided a loan of $508,245 (1994 USD) for emergency assistance and to train locals to mitigate future events. After the storm, workers near Majuro planted seeds to regrow the damaged crops.

The rapid succession of typhoons in 1992 caused a significant drop in tourism in Guam. During typhoons Omar and Gay, there was little communication between residents on the island. As a result, the Guam Communications Network was created to facilitate future relief efforts during storms.
A research paper published ten years after the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak technique</a>, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315 km/h) 195 mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. <a href="Typhoon%20Angela">Typhoon Angela</a> in 1995 presented similar features and could have been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.

2012–13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team

The 2012–13 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> during the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20season">2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season</a>.the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan Wolverines men's basketball</a> team played its home games in <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, at the <a href="Crisler%20Center">Crisler Center</a>. This season marked the team's 96th consecutive year as a member of the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a>, and it is occasionally referred to as "Team 96". The team was led by sixth-year <a href="head%20coach">head coach</a> <a href="John%20Beilein">John Beilein</a>.

The team closed the season with a 5–5 run to finish tied for fourth in the conference and won one game in the <a href="2013%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">Big Ten Tournament</a> before being eliminated.

The team was led by 2013 <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20men%27s%20college%20basketball%20national%20player%20of%20the%20year%20awards">national player of the year</a>, <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Big Ten Player of the Year</a> and <a href="2013%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20All-Americans">2013 Consensus All-American</a> <a href="Trey%20Burke">Trey Burke</a> and three additional All-Conference honorees. <a href="Tim%20Hardaway%2C%20Jr.">Tim Hardaway, Jr.</a> was named to the 2012–13 All-Big Ten first team by the coaches and to the second team by the media; Robinson was named an honorable mention All-Big Ten by the media, and Morgan was an All-Big Ten Defensive team selection. Stauskas and McGary earned multiple Big Ten Freshman of the Week recognitions during the season. Burke was the second National Player of the Year and eighth first-team consensus All-American in Michigan basketball history.

Michigan entered the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as the youngest team in the field. The team made its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1993–94</a> team did so. The Wolverines made their first "official" appearance in the Final Four and the national title game since the 1989 national championship season; appearances in 1992 and 1993 were vacated due to a <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20basketball%20scandal">scandal</a>. Following the season, at the <a href="2013%20NBA%20Draft">2013 NBA Draft</a>, Burke and Hardaway were selected ninth and twenty-fourth, respectively, becoming the first pair of first-round NBA draft choices from Michigan since the <a href="1994%20NBA%20Draft">1994 NBA Draft</a>.

The team lost both of its <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captains</a> from the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">prior season</a> to graduation after they completed their eligibility. Senior two-time captain Douglass turned pro, joining <a href="Basket%20Navarra%20Club">Basket Navarra Club</a> of the <a href="Liga%20Espa%C3%B1ola%20de%20Baloncesto">Liga Española de Baloncesto</a>. Senior three-time captain Novak graduated to play for <a href="Landstede%20Basketbal">Landstede Basketbal</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20Basketball%20League">Dutch Basketball League</a>. In addition to the loss of senior co-captains, the team lost three players who decided to transfer: Evan Smotrycz, Carlton Brundidge and Colton Christian. Smotrycz, who transferred to <a href="Maryland%20Terrapins%20men%27s%20basketball">Maryland</a>, had started in 42 of the 69 games he played during his first two years. He left the program as the fifth-best all-time three-point shooter with a percentage of 40.5. Brundidge transferred to <a href="Detroit%20Titans%20men%27s%20basketball">Detroit</a> and Christian transferred to <a href="FIU%20Panthers">Florida International</a>. The program also announced the departure of walk-on Sai Tummala and the return of walk-on Corey Person for a fifth year.

Glenn Robinson III, son of former <a href="List%20of%20first%20overall%20NBA%20draft%20picks">first overall NBA draft pick</a> <a href="Glenn%20Robinson">Glenn Robinson</a>, verbally committed on September 14, 2010 as the first commitment in Michigan's class of 2012. On March 26, 2011, Michigan received its second verbal commitment of the class of 2012 from Canadian wing guard Nik Stauskas. On November 3, <a href="Mitch%20McGary">Mitch McGary</a>, who was ranked as the number two prospect in the nation at the time, announced his verbal commitment to Michigan. Within hours of the commitment, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> announced that Michigan ranked as the fifth best class in the nation. Each of the three signed a <a href="National%20Letter%20of%20Intent">National Letter of Intent</a> with the team on November 9. After several other schools announced their commitments, the signing of McGary moved Michigan from outside the top 25 at the end of October to the number 7 class in the nation by mid-November, according to ESPN. That November, McGary, Robinson and Stauskas ranked 3, 34, and 79, respectively, in the <a href="Rivals.com">Rivals.com</a> Class of 2012 Top 150.

All three recruits had playoff success: McGary was a member of <a href="Brewster%20Academy">Brewster Academy</a>'s National Prep Championship team. Stauskas earned the championship game MVP of the NEPSAC Class AA Championship after leading <a href="St.%20Mark%27s%20School%20%28Massachusetts%29">St. Mark's</a> to victory. Robinson led <a href="Lake%20Central%20High%20School">Lake Central</a> to its first <a href="Indiana%20High%20School%20Athletic%20Association">Indiana High School Athletic Association</a> sectional title in 15 years. He earned the "<a href="Post-Tribune">Post-Tribune</a>" Boys basketball player of the year award for <a href="Northwest%20Indiana">Northwest Indiana</a> and the state MVP from the "Indiana Basketball News".

McGary was invited to participate in the four-team April 1, 2012 All-American Championship, along with future teammate Robinson in New Orleans. Robinson was awarded the ESPNHS All-American Championship Player of the Game for his 16-point, 4-rebound performance, which included 5 dunks among his 6-for-7 shooting night. McGary was also selected to represent <a href="USA%20Basketball">USA Basketball</a> at the fifteenth annual Nike Hoops Summit on April 7 as part of the 2012 USA Junior National Select Team.

<a href="Spike%20Albrecht">Michael "Spike" Albrecht</a> committed to Michigan on April 6, 2012. Albrecht led <a href="Northfield%20Mount%20Hermon%20School">Northfield Mount Hermon School</a> to the 2012 NEPSAC Class AAA Boys' Basketball Tournament, defeating McGary's Brewster Academy in the semifinals. Albrecht was MVP of the tournament. Albrecht was a former AAU teammate of McGary and Robinson. Albrecht's and outgoing captain Novak's fathers were collegiate teammates. Albrecht was a 2011 graduate of <a href="Crown%20Point%20High%20School">Crown Point High School</a>. After most of the big signings announced their decisions on the April 11 signing day, Michigan was ranked as the early number 5 preseason selection as a team by ESPN.

<a href="Zak%20Irvin">Zak Irvin</a> was named 2013 <a href="Indiana%20Mr.%20Basketball">Indiana Mr. Basketball</a>, giving <a href="Hamilton%20Southeastern%20High%20School">Hamilton Southeastern High School</a> the state's first back-to-back winners (<a href="Gary%20Harris">Gary Harris</a>) from the same high school. <a href="Derrick%20Walton">Derrick Walton</a> was runner up in the 2013 <a href="Mr.%20Basketball%20of%20Michigan">Mr. Basketball of Michigan</a> by a 2130–2086 margin to Iowa State signee Monte Morris despite having one more first place vote. Both Walton and Irvin were 2013 <a href="Parade%20All-American">Parade All-American</a> honorees and were named state Boys Basketball <a href="Gatorade%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20awards%23Basketball">Gatorade Player of the Year</a>.

Michigan basketball hosted its on campus media day <a href="press%20conference">press conference</a> on October 10, 2012 at <a href="Crisler%20Center">Crisler Center</a>. The team was represented by Burke, Hardaway, Morgan and Beilein at the Big Ten Conference Basketball Media Day press conference on October 24 in <a href="Rosemont%2C%20Illinois">Rosemont, Illinois</a>. When the 24-person Big Ten Media poll was announced, Michigan was predicted to finish second to <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Indiana%20Hoosiers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Indiana</a>. Burke was a preseason All-Conference selection by the same media.

Michigan enjoyed high expectations from the national media as well during the preseason. "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>" named them to the number 5 position in its preseason poll, while conference foes Indiana and <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Ohio State</a> were ranked number 1 and 3, respectively. Michigan also earned the number 5 ranking in both the preseason <a href="Coaches%27%20Poll">Coaches' Poll</a> and preseason <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> poll, but behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#4) in both. This was Michigan's highest preseason ranking since the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1992–93 team</a>. "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" ranked Michigan number 9 in its October preseason power rankings, again behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#6), but when it printed its November preseason poll listed Michigan at number 6 ahead of Ohio State (#7), but behind Indiana (#1). Prior to the first <a href="exhibition%20game">exhibition game</a> on November 1, senior Josh Bartelstein was named team captain.

ESPN's Eamonn Brennan noted that Michigan was a perimeter oriented team with possibly the best one-two guard combination in the country. Burke and Hardaway were both preseason <a href="John%20R.%20Wooden%20Award">John R. Wooden Award</a> top 50 selections. Burke was a preseason All-American (Associated Press first team, <a href="CBS%20Sports">CBS Sports</a> second team, "Sports Illustrated" second team, ESPN second team, "Sporting News" third team) as well as a preseason <a href="Naismith%20Award">Naismith Award</a> top 50 selection.

The acronym "WE ON" was the slogan for the whole team for the 2012–13 season. The team and coaching staff selected it at the beginning of the season as another way for Michigan to say <a href="Bo%20Schembechler">Bo Schembechler's</a> famous quote, "the Team, the Team, the Team." The acronym "WE ON" stands for "When Everyone Operates N'sync." Michigan assistant coach <a href="Bacari%20Alexander">Bacari Alexander</a> even tweeted that the acronym summarizes this team-focused mindset. According to <a href="Dave%20Brandon">Dave Brandon</a>, assistant coach LaVall Jordan and director of basketball operations Travis Conlan guided the team to develop the slogan.

<a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> warm up shirts were created and were first worn on November 21, 2012, before Michigan's <a href="NIT%20Season%20Tip-Off">NIT Season Tip-Off</a> game against the Pittsburgh Panthers. The shirts use the <a href="school%20colors">school colors</a> with blue with maize lettering. On February 12, 2013, when Michigan played the first of two regularly scheduled <a href="Michigan%E2%80%93Michigan%20State%20basketball%20rivalry">rivalry games</a> against <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Michigan%20State%20Spartans%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Michigan State</a>, students in the <a href="Izzone">Izzone</a> at the <a href="Breslin%20Center">Breslin Center</a> wore T-shirts with "YOU OFF" printed in Spartan colors (green and white). Michigan State went on to win the game by 23 points.

"WE" – WE is also an acronym for "Wolverine Excellence", which is chiefly used by the team. Wolverine Excellence calls for players and managers to focus on its five core values: integrity, unity, passion, diligence and appreciation.

"ON" – ON represented each player's individual commitment to season-long improvement. There was a "U-M Fuse Box" (mock-University of Michigan set of switches) in the Men's Basketball locker room in Crisler Center. Each player had selected one word on which to focus during the season and before every practice and game, each player flipped his switch "on." This represented each player's commitment to improvement every day.

Prior to the season, the five freshmen were dubbed the "Fresh Five", a moniker hearkening remembrance of the incoming freshman class of 1991, known as the <a href="Fab%20Five%20%28University%20of%20Michigan%29">Fab Five</a>, that led Michigan to back-to-back Championship games while starting the majority of games. However, the nickname and its expectations were downplayed most of the season by the team. Nonetheless, during the final two weeks of the regular season "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" ran a feature story on the team that reinvigorated the nickname while noting that the current five were the supporting cast rather than the stars of the team like the original five.

ESPN's Chantel Jennings tweeted a picture of a <a href="Flag%20of%20Canada">Flag of Canada</a> redone in Michigan's team colors of <a href="Maize%20%28color%29">maize</a> and <a href="blue">blue</a> at <a href="Crisler%20Arena">Crisler Arena</a> on December 4. One of her followers noted that the big version on the wall was a general Stauskas fan flag and that a little version of the flag was added next to it for each three-pointer Canadian Stauskas made in the game. By mid-December of his freshman season, the students in the Maize Rage (<a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan</a> student section at Crisler Arena) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag. The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas. The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January.

The team, which represented Michigan Basketball for the ninety-sixth season in the Big Ten Conference, is sometimes referred to as Team 96 or Squad 96. Although this team represented Michigan for the ninety-sixth consecutive year, there was controversy as to whether the team should in fact be marketed as Team 96 because the <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1908–09 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team</a> was not properly accounted for among the prior teams. The subsequent team was marketed as Team 98.

Hardaway began the season with his fourth career <a href="double-double">double-double</a> by scoring 25 <a href="point%20%28basketball%29">points</a> (including 5-for-5 <a href="three-point%20shot">three-point shooting</a>) and adding 10 <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a> in a 100–62 win over <a href="Slippery%20Rock%20University%20of%20Pennsylvania">Slippery Rock</a>; this earned him his second career Big Ten Player of the Week award. The 100-point performance of November 9 was Michigan's first since the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2007–08 team</a> posted 103 points against <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Oakland%20Golden%20Grizzlies%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Oakland</a> on December 12, 2007.

Michigan hosted games for the first two rounds of the 2012 NIT Season Tip-Off. The team's first game of the tournament, a November 12 contest against the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20IUPUI%20Jaguars%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">IUPUI Jaguars</a>, resulted in a 91–54 Michigan victory. The win also gave Michigan its first consecutive 90-point performances since the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2000–01 team</a> recorded three consecutive 90-point games. The following night, Michigan defeated <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Cleveland%20State%20Vikings%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Cleveland State</a> by a 77–47 margin, marking the first time the school opened the season with three consecutive 30-point victories. The win also marked the first time Michigan had posted three consecutive 30-point wins since the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1988–89 Wolverines team</a> (the <a href="1989%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1989 national champion</a>) won five consecutive 30-point games.

In the championship rounds of the NIT Season Tip-Off tournament at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> on November 21 and 23, Michigan defeated <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kansas State</a>, respectively, to win the tournament. Hardaway, who totaled 39 points at the Garden, was the tournament MVP and was joined on the all-tournament team by Burke, who contributed 27 points and 10 assists. Stauskas earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week honors for his NIT tournament performance in which he averaged 12.5 points and 4.5 rebounds. On November 27, Michigan raised its Big Ten championship banner from the season before. Then, the team defeated its first ranked opponent of the season – <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NC%20State%20Wolfpack%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">NC State</a> (#18 AP/#18 Coaches) – in the <a href="ACC%E2%80%93Big%20Ten%20Challenge">ACC–Big Ten Challenge</a>. The win was supported by Burke's first career double-double which included a career-high 11 assists, no <a href="Turnover%20%28basketball%29">turnovers</a> and 18 points as well as a career-high 20 points from Stauskas in a 79–72 victory.

Ranked third in both polls, Michigan established a record as the highest ranked visiting team in the history of <a href="Carver%20Arena">Carver Arena</a> on December 1. Giving Stauskas his first career start, Michigan emerged victorious over <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Bradley%20Braves%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Bradley</a>. It was the third game of the season that Michigan never trailed in. Stauskas repeated as Big Ten Freshman of the Week on December 3 for his back-to-back 20-point performances.

On December 4, Michigan defeated <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Western%20Michigan%20Broncos%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Western Michigan</a> 73–41, giving the team its first 8–0 start since the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1996–97 team</a>; the team never trailed in the game. Michigan defeated <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Arkansas</a> 80–67 in its December 8 matchup. It marked the fourth 9–0 start in school history (1988–89, <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1985–86</a> and <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1926–27</a>) and the third consecutive game that Michigan never trailed. Michigan went to 10–0 on December 11 by defeating <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Binghamton%20Bearcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Binghamton</a> 67–39.

Michigan traveled to play in the December 15 Brooklyn Hoops Winter Festival at the <a href="Barclays%20Center">Barclays Center</a>, where they defeated <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">West Virginia</a> (coach Beilein's previous employer) 81–66 to move to 11–0 for the third time in school history (1985–86 and 1988–89). The team never trailed in the contest. For averaging 23.0 points, 6.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 <a href="steal%20%28basketball%29">steals</a> with only 1.0 turnover in the games against Binghamton and West Virginia, Burke earned Player of the Week on December 17.

On December 20, the team became the second in school in history (1985–86 went 16–0) to reach 12–0 when it beat <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Eastern%20Michigan%20Eagles%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Eastern Michigan</a>. After recording his first career double-double in the game with only 18 minutes of play, McGary was recognized as Big Ten Freshman of the Week. Hardaway suffered an ankle injury that caused him to miss the December 29 game against <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Central%20Michigan%20Chippewas%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Central Michigan</a> and that broke his 81 consecutive games played streak that went back to the beginning of his Michigan career. The game also marked the team's second game without <a href="Jon%20Horford">Jon Horford</a>, who dislocated his knee during the West Virginia game. In Hardaway's absence, Burke posted his second career double-double with 22 points and a career-high tying 11 assists and Robinson posted his second career 20-point game.

Michigan concluded January by beating Northwestern a second time on January 30, becoming the first team in the country to reach 20 wins. After enduring an injured ankle against Illinois, starting center Jordan Morgan missed his first game since <a href="redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirting</a> a full season for the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2009–10 Wolverines</a> when he sat out the Northwestern game.

It marked the first time both teams were ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll, and resulted in Michigan losing back-to-back games and three consecutive road games for the first time since the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">2010–11 team</a> did so. Burke's 18 points, 4 assists and 3 steals were one of Michigan's few bright spots in their February 12 contest.

On March 6, with its Big 10 Conference Championship destiny in its own hands, Michigan defeated Purdue to set up a championship showdown with Indiana on March 10.

Burke and Morgan also missed last-second shots at the rim. Michigan wound down its regular season with its fifteenth sellout and five seniors on the roster: Eso Akunne, Josh Bartelstein, Blake McLimans, Corey Person, and Matt Vogrich. The loss kept Michigan from its first undefeated home season since the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1976–77 team</a>.

Michigan participated in the <a href="2013%20Big%20Ten%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">2013 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament</a> at the <a href="United%20Center">United Center</a> in Chicago. As the #5 seed, they defeated Penn State in the opening round on March 14 by an 83–66 margin. In the second round, the team lost to Wisconsin, 68–59. Prior to the <a href="2013%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>, Jeff Goodman of <a href="CBSSports.com">CBSSports.com</a> named Michigan first among tournament teams in terms of having the most future <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">NBA</a> talent on its roster (in the absence of <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Kentucky%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Kentucky</a>, which was left to accept an invitation to the <a href="2013%20National%20Invitation%20Tournament">2013 National Invitation Tournament</a>). Among Michigan's starting lineup, Burke, Robinson, Hardaway, and McGary were all expected to be likely <a href="NBA%20Draft">NBA Draft</a> choices, while Stauskas had the potential to be one.

Despite its highly touted lineup, Michigan entered the tournament as the sixth youngest team in the country and the youngest team in the field of 68 teams according to "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>", based on weighted minutes played. The game marked Michigan's first NCAA Championship Monday appearance since 1989. Some sources claim 1993 as the school's last appearance, but those results have been vacated by the NCAA due to the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20basketball%20scandal">University of Michigan basketball scandal</a>.
Michigan was entered in the tournament's South region where it would play its first two games at <a href="The%20Palace%20of%20Auburn%20Hills">The Palace of Auburn Hills</a> in nearby <a href="Auburn%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Auburn Hills, Michigan</a>.

Michigan then ousted 5th-seeded <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20VCU%20Rams%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">VCU</a> by a 78–53 margin. That gave Michigan its first Sweet Sixteen appearance since the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">1993–94</a> team went to the <a href="1994%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament</a>.

Several players had career-highs in the game: Stauskas with 6 three-point shots, Burke 8 rebounds, McGary 5 steals and off the bench Albrecht 7 points and 3 steals. Eight of McGary's 11 points came as Michigan built the initial 13–0 lead and 5 of Stauskas' 6 three-pointers came as Michigan built a 41–17 lead and closed the half with a 47–30 lead. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. McGary and Stauskas joined Burke on the five-man South All-Regional team. Following the regional championship postgame prayer and with Mrs. Beilein's consent, McGary and Hardaway gave Beilein a <a href="Gatorade%20shower">Gatorade shower</a>.

Michigan lost the April 8 national championship game against Midwest number one seed <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Louisville%20Cardinals%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Louisville</a> by an 82–76 score. Albrecht scored 17 first-half points on 4-for-4 three-point shooting. Burke scored 24 points in the championship game and made the seven-man All-Tournament team (which was revised multiple times) along with teammates McGary and Albrecht. The turning point of the game was described as a missed call by the referees when, as Michigan trailed 67–64 with 5 minutes left, Burke pinned <a href="Peyton%20Siva">Peyton Siva</a>'s dunk attempt with a clean, all-ball block, but was called for a foul, resulting in two made free throws by Siva. Michigan never got closer than 4 points the rest of the game. Louisville's championship has since been vacated by the NCAA, as well as all its wins from 2011 to 2015. This followed an escort recruitment scandal at the university.
