The Magdalen Reading

The Magdalen Reading is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century <a href="Panel%20painting">oil-on-panel</a> <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a> by the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a> painter <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. The panel, originally <a href="oak">oak</a>, was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period. She is identifiable as the <a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Magdalen</a> from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the <a href="Mary%20of%20Bethany%23Catholic%20identification%20with%20Mary%20Magdalene">Magdalen was conflated</a> with both <a href="Mary%20of%20Bethany">Mary of Bethany</a> who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil and the unnamed "sinner" of . <a href="Iconography">Iconography</a> of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.

The background of the painting had been <a href="overpainting">overpainted</a> with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the <a href="Museu%20Calouste%20Gulbenkian">Museu Calouste Gulbenkian</a>, Lisbon, which shows the head of <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Saint Joseph</a>, while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be <a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">Saint Catherine of Alexandria</a>, is thought to be from the same larger work. The original altarpiece was a "<a href="sacra%20conversazione">sacra conversazione</a>", known only through a drawing, "<a href="Virgin%20and%20Child%20with%20Saints%20%28van%20der%20Weyden%29">Virgin and Child with Saints</a>", in Stockholm's <a href="Nationalmuseum">Nationalmuseum</a>, which followed a partial copy of the painting that probably dated from the late 16th century. The drawing shows that "The Magdalen" occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of "The Magdalen", which measures .

Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. "The Magdalen Reading" can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian <a href="Lorne%20Campbell%20%28Art%20historian%29">Lorne Campbell</a> as "one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works."

<a href="Mary%20Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> as depicted in early <a href="Renaissance%20art">Renaissance painting</a> is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on <a href="Mary%20of%20Bethany">Mary of Bethany</a>, who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and "listened to His Word", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister <a href="Martha">Martha</a> who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve. Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a "chemise" of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript "looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible" and is "clearly a devotional text". It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.

Van der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings. She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden <a href="sideboard">sideboard</a>. By her feet is her usual <a href="emblem">attribute</a> of an <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a> jar; in the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s she brought spices to the <a href="Holy%20Sepulchre">tomb of Jesus</a>. The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an <a href="Archery">archer</a> atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.
Van der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a> or his workshop. It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of <a href="Saint%20Barbara">Saint Barbara</a> in Campin's "<a href="The%20Werl%20Triptych">Werl Altarpiece</a>", and also the Virgin in an "<a href="Annunciation">Annunciation</a>" attributed to Campin in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white. Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue <a href="sash">sash</a>, while the gold <a href="brocade">brocade</a> of her <a href="Petticoat">underskirt</a> is adorned by a jewelled hem. Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a "<a href="Prostitution">fallen woman</a>" is hinted at by the <a href="Nap%20%28textile%29">nap</a> in the <a href="fur">fur</a> lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil. Darwent wrote, "Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't." In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as <a href="Hans%20Memling">Memling</a> and <a href="Quentin%20Matsys">Matsys</a> often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she "is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in "The Magdalen Reading" by Rogier van der Weyden".

The level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as "far exceed[ing]" <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">van Eyck</a>. Her lips are painted with a shades of <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a>, white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of <a href="impasto">impasto</a>, grid and dots of varying colour and size.

Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary. The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal <a href="Rosary%23Rosary%20beads">rosary beads</a> have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>.

Lorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as "small miracles of painting", and says that "the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position. Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and "much too narrow and papery in effect". A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases. The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small <a href="pitcher%20%28container%29">pitcher</a>, possibly a <a href="reliquary">reliquary</a>. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.

"Virgin and Child with Saints", a drawing in Stockholm's <a href="Nationalmuseum">Nationalmuseum</a>, is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden, who possibly may have been the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Drapery%20Studies">Master of the Coburger Rundbl√§tter</a>. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with <a href="mitre">mitre</a> and <a href="crosier">crosier</a> making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes. This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.

At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces, possibly due to damage, although "The Magdalen" fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings". From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1¬†m high by 1.5¬†m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period. The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of L√©o Lardus in <a href="Suresnes">Suresnes</a>, France.

The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist. Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear <a href="rosary">rosary</a> beads in one hand and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the <a href="Museu%20Calouste%20Gulbenkian">Museu Calouste Gulbenkian</a> in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> shows the head of a figure believed to be the <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Saint Joseph</a>; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.

There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at <a href="Suresnes">Suresnes</a>. The figure may represent <a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">Saint Catherine of Alexandria</a>, and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling. In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel. Some art historians, including <a href="Martin%20Davies%20%28museum%20director%29">Martin Davies</a> and John Ward, have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is <a href="chamfer">chamfer</a>ed. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3¬†cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures , the Saint Joseph .

Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is "obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the "Magdalen"", it "seems likely" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that "about half way up the right edge of this fragment ["Catherine"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke¬†... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist". The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes.

The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward‚Äîwhich combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints‚Äîis widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the "<a href="recto%20and%20verso">verso</a>" shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.

Van der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany, identified by the time of <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a> as the repentant prostitute of . She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a> and <a href="Titian">Titian</a> which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a <a href="Gaze">male gaze</a>), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer. Writing in "The Crying Face", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a "pictorial formula for crying".

By the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a <a href="psalter">psalter</a> or <a href="book%20of%20hours">book of hours</a> in the privacy of their homes. Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news‚Äîa witness‚Äîand hence directly associated with the text.

The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance. Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer. According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in <a href="Sainte-Baume">Sainte-Baume</a> and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance. By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and "borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth".

The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. She signified the "sacrament of anointing (<a href="Chrism">Chrism</a> and <a href="Anointing">Unction</a>)" by pouring precious <a href="spikenard">spikenard</a> on Christ's feet at his tomb.

The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives "before 1438". Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a>. He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's "<a href="The%20Werl%20Triptych">Werl Altarpiece</a>".

Because van der Weyden, like most of the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">early Netherlandish painters</a>, was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin "<a href="Miraflores%20Altarpiece">Miraflores Altarpiece</a>" continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved, or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain.

"The Magdalen Reading" can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, when the work was already cut down. The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem. After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin in Paris, whose "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>, London by <a href="Charles%20Lock%20Eastlake">Charles Lock Eastlake</a> in 1860; an acquisition that also included two <a href="Robert%20Campin">Robert Campin</a> portraits and panels by <a href="Simon%20Marmion">Simon Marmion</a> (1425‚Äì1489). This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery. Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955. In general the "painted surface is in very good condition", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.

"The Magdalen Reading" was transferred from its original oak to a <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> panel (West Indian <a href="swietenia">swietenia</a>) by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was "Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery. Artificial <a href="ultramarine">ultramarine</a>-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830. The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels. The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin. It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish <a href="Nationalmuseum">National Museum of Fine Arts</a> in 1918.

John Francis Jackson, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (23 February 1908¬†‚Äì 28 April 1942) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> and squadron commander of World War¬†II. He was credited with eight aerial victories, and led <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†75 Squadron</a> during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">Battle of Port Moresby</a> in 1942. Born in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, he was a <a href="Pastoral%20farming">grazier</a> and businessman, who also operated his own private plane, when he joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) Reserve in 1936. Called up for active service following the outbreak of war in 1939, Jackson served with <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†23 Squadron</a> in Australia before he was posted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20Theatre">Middle East</a> in November 1940. As a fighter pilot with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†3 Squadron</a> he flew <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a>s, <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s and <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Tomahawks</a> during the <a href="North%20African%20campaign">North African</a> and <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20campaign">Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign</a>s.

Jackson was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> and <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mentioned in Despatches</a> for his actions in the Middle East. Subsequently, posted to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre</a>, he was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in March 1942 and given command of No.¬†75 Squadron at <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a>, operating P-40 Kittyhawks. Described as "rugged, simple" and "true as steel", Jackson was nicknamed "Old John" in affectionate tribute to his thirty-four years. He earned praise for his leadership during the defence of Port Moresby before his death in combat on 28¬†April. His younger brother <a href="Leslie%20Douglas%20Jackson">Les</a> took over No.¬†75 Squadron, and also became a fighter ace. <a href="Jacksons%20International%20Airport">Jacksons International Airport</a>, Port Moresby, is named in John Jackson's honour.

John Jackson was born on 23 February 1908 in the <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> suburb of <a href="New%20Farm%2C%20Queensland">New Farm</a>, Queensland, the eldest son of businessman William Jackson and his wife Edith. Educated at <a href="Brisbane%20Grammar%20School">Brisbane Grammar School</a> and <a href="The%20Scots%20PGC%20College">The Scots College, Warwick</a>, Jackson joined the <a href="Young%20Australia%20League">Young Australia League</a>, with which he visited Europe. After leaving school he ran a <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">grazing property</a> in <a href="St%20George%2C%20Queensland">St George</a>. By the early 1930s, he was in business as a stock and station agent, and had interests in engineering and financial concerns. He was inspired by the <a href="MacRobertson%20Air%20Race">1934 London to Melbourne Air Race</a> to take up flying, and purchased a <a href="British%20Aircraft%20Swallow">Klemm Swallow</a> monoplane. In 1936, he took part in the <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n centenary air race, flying from Brisbane to <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. That August, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) Reserve, or Citizen Air Force. In 1937, he upgraded his aircraft to a <a href="Beechcraft%20Model%2017%20Staggerwing">Beechcraft Staggerwing</a>, a type that was faster than many in the RAAF's inventory.

On 17 February 1938, Jackson married Elisabeth Thompson at Christ Church, <a href="North%20Adelaide">North Adelaide</a>; the couple had a son and a daughter. Following the outbreak of World War¬†II, Jackson was called up for active duty and commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in the RAAF on 2¬†October 1939. His twenty-year-old brother Arthur, also a pilot and keen to join the Air Force, was killed in a flying accident later that month. Two other brothers, Edward and <a href="Leslie%20Douglas%20Jackson">Leslie</a>, joined the RAAF in November. John Jackson served initially with <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†23 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s at <a href="Archerfield%2C%20Queensland">Archerfield</a>, Queensland. He was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> in April 1940. That October, he was posted to join <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron</a>, which had been based in Egypt since August. He arrived in the Middle East in November 1940.

Jackson first saw action with No.¬†3 Squadron in the <a href="North%20African%20campaign">North African campaign</a> at the controls of a <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a>. Soon after he arrived, he had an accident taking off that finished with the biplane on its nose. Though he considered himself a "full-blown operational pilot", his experience in air-to-air gunnery was "practically nil", and he essentially learned the skills of being a fighter pilot as he went along. Once the unit had converted to <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s, he began to score victories in quick succession. He shot down three <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B87">Junkers Ju¬†87</a>s in a single sortie near <a href="Mersa%20Matruh">Mersa Matruh</a> on 18¬†February 1941, the same action in which <a href="Gordon%20Steege">Gordon Steege</a> claimed three.

On 5 April 1941, Jackson fired several bursts at a Ju¬†87 before his guns jammed; he then made two dummy attacks and forced the German plane to crash land in a <a href="wadi">wadi</a>, thus claiming his fourth victory. After converting to <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Tomahawks</a>, No.¬†3 Squadron took part in the <a href="Syria%E2%80%93Lebanon%20campaign">Syria‚ÄìLebanon campaign</a>. Jackson became an <a href="flying%20ace">ace</a> on 25¬†June, when he destroyed a <a href="Potez%20630">Potez 630</a> light bomber (possibly a misidentified <a href="Lior%C3%A9%20et%20Olivier%20LeO%2045">LeO 451</a>) of the <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> air force. He claimed a <a href="Dewoitine%20D.520">Dewoitine D.520</a> fighter on 10¬†July. The next day Jackson shared in the destruction of another D.520 with <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a>; the pair tossed a coin to take full credit for it; Gibbes won to claim his first "kill".

Jackson was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> on 1¬†July 1941. By now his younger brother Ed had been posted to No.¬†3 Squadron and was serving with him in Palestine. With the campaign in Syria concluding in mid-July, the unit undertook no operations in August and personnel went on leave before returning to action in Egypt the next month. The rural-bred Jackson took to the night life in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, but his stay at a first-class hotel left him bewildered as to the purpose of the room's <a href="bidet">bidet</a>, which he eventually determined was "some feminine arrangement". Peter Ewer, in "Storm Over Kokoda", observed: "There was something of the <a href="Patrician%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">patrician</a> about John Jackson, but his well-to-do background had a distinctly Australian tinge to it. He liked a game of cards, with a bet on the outcome." In "Whispering Death", Mark Johnston noted that although "tall and blue-eyed", he "did not have the air of a '<a href="Boys%27%20Own">boy's own</a>' or movie star pilot", but rather was "balding, ambling and no extrovert". Jackson returned to Australia in November 1941. He was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>, and awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) for his "marked keenness and determination" during operations with No.¬†3 Squadron in the Middle East. The former award was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 1¬†January 1942 and the latter, which listed him as "John Henry Jackson", on 7¬†April. The DFC was presented to Jackson's widow Elisabeth, after his death.

Following his return from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an instructor at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No.¬†1 Service Flying Training School</a>, based at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Station Point Cook</a>, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough job and I take my hat off to the boys who have been doing it since war broke out¬†... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, but I doubt if they have any chance of ever getting there‚Äîthey are so valuable here." In January 1942, he was posted to <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†4 Squadron</a>, which operated Wirraways in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>.

As the Japanese advanced towards New Guinea in early 1942, the RAAF urgently established three new fighter units for Australia's northern defence, <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos.¬†75</a>, <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">76</a> and <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">77 Squadrons</a>. Jackson was promoted to acting <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.¬†75 Squadron on 19¬†March, barely two weeks after the unit was formed at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland. He took over from Wing Commander <a href="Peter%20Jeffrey%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Jeffrey</a>, who had led No.¬†3 Squadron in the Middle East and been given the task of preparing No.¬†75 for operations at <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, where the local <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> garrison was under regular attack by Japanese bombers. Jeffrey later recalled chiding Jackson for his eagerness to return to combat despite having already done enough in the war, to which the latter replied, "What are you fighting for? King and country? Well, I'm fighting for my wife and kids and no Jap bastard's going to get them!" On 21¬†March, Jackson led the squadron's main force to Seven Mile Aerodrome to take part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">defence of Port Moresby</a>, a crucial early battle in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>, and what military aviation historian Andrew Thomas called "one of the most gallant episodes in the history of the RAAF". The unit was equipped with <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawks</a>, whose long-awaited arrival had seen them irreverently dubbed "Tomorrowhawks", "Neverhawks", and "Mythhawks" by the beleaguered garrison at Moresby. Jackson's age of thirty-four was considered advanced for a fighter pilot, and he was affectionately known as "Old John" to his men, one of whom was his younger brother Les, now a flight lieutenant. As CO, Jackson's leadership was to prove inspirational to his pilots, many of whom had received only nine days of training in fighter tactics, and fired their guns just once.
On 22¬†March, the day after he arrived in New Guinea, Jackson took No.¬†75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese airfield at <a href="Lae">Lae</a>. Rather than attacking directly from the south, he led the Kittyhawks in from the east, where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach. Achieving the surprise he had hoped for, Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield, ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti-aircraft fire. The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged. They also shot down two <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi Zero</a> fighters in the air, and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae, along with one that had crash-landed on takeoff from Moresby. The Japanese struck back the next day, destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile Aerodrome. With his losses mounting, Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to <a href="Horn%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Horn Island</a> in Far North Queensland, but refused. On 4¬†April, Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae, after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed, but seventeen others damaged. Two days later, Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore with the aid of a life jacket that John dropped to him, not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother.

Jackson himself had to ditch into the sea on 10¬†April, when he was shot down after being surprised by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a>, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US <a href="Douglas%20SBD%20Dauntless">Douglas Dauntless</a> on 23¬†April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as "a mere scratch". On 27¬†April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.¬†75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: "Tomorrow I'm going to show you how". According to journalist <a href="Osmar%20White">Osmar White</a>, who saw him on the night of the 27th, Jackson's "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" but he appeared "weary in soul" and "too long in the shadows". White concluded: "He had done more than conquer fear‚Äîhe had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.¬†75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.

Les Jackson took over command of No.¬†75 Squadron the day after his brother was killed. Although the squadron was no longer an effective fighting unit, it had checked Japan's attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack, and the town continued to function as an important Allied base. John Jackson was survived by his wife and children, and interred in Moresby's Bomana War Cemetery. His estate was sworn for <a href="probate">probate</a> at a value of <a href="Australian%20pound">¬£</a>29,780 (<a href="Australian%20dollar">$</a>1,870,800 in 2011). His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> (AWM), Canberra. Jackson was a keen amateur film maker, and a four-minute reel of <a href="16mm%20film">16¬†mm</a> footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM. Moresby's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson's Strip in his honour; it later became <a href="Jacksons%20International%20Airport">Jacksons International Airport</a>. In a 1989 interview, fellow No.¬†75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented, "I would say that had John¬†F. Jackson not existed, the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role for as long as it was¬†... So the whole spirit of John¬†F's leadership, and I suppose his final sacrifice, was the thing that made 75 Squadron." In March 2003, the St George township erected a monument to Jackson and another local RAAF identity, Aboriginal fighter pilot <a href="Len%20Waters">Len Waters</a>.

Mycena aurantiomarginata

Mycena aurantiomarginata, commonly known as the golden-edge bonnet, is a species of <a href="agaric">agaric</a> fungus in the family <a href="Mycenaceae">Mycenaceae</a>. First formally <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1803, it was given its current name in 1872. Widely distributed, it is common in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, Central America, and Japan. The fungus is <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a>, and produces <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">fruit bodies</a> (<a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) that grow on the <a href="forest%20floor">floor</a> of <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous forest</a>s. The mushrooms have a bell-shaped to conical <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to in diameter, set atop a slender <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> up to long with yellow to orange hairs at the base. The fungus is named after its characteristic bright orange <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gill</a> edges. A microscopic characteristic is the club-shaped <a href="Cystidium">cystidia</a> that are covered with numerous spiky projections, resembling a <a href="mace%20%28bludgeon%29">mace</a>. The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of the mushroom has not been determined. "M.¬†aurantiomarginata" can be distinguished from similar "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>" species by differences in size, color, and <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. A 2010 publication reported the discovery and characterization of a novel <a href="pigment">pigment</a> named mycenaaurin¬†A, isolated from the mushroom. The pigment is responsible for its color, and it has <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> activity that may function to prevent certain bacteria from growing on the mushroom.

The species, originally named "Agaricus marginatus" by the Danish naturalist <a href="Heinrich%20Christian%20Friedrich%20Schumacher">Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher</a> in 1803, has several <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>. <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> renamed it "Agaricus aurantio-marginatus" in his 1821 "<a href="Systema%20Mycologicum">Systema Mycologicum</a>", while <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> called it "Agaricus schumacheri" in 1828. Although Schumacher had the earliest publication date, Fries's name is <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a>, and so the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> he used is given <a href="Nomenclature%23Scientific%20nomenclature">nomenclatural</a> precedence. French mycologist <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Qu√©let</a> transferred the species to the genus "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>" in 1872. In 1930 <a href="Karel%20Cejp">Karel Cejp</a> considered it to be a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "<a href="Mycena%20elegans">Mycena elegans</a>".

According to <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a>'s organization of the genus "Mycena", "M.¬†aurantiomarginata" is <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> in <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Calodontes", subsection "Granulatae", which contains species with roughened cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on gill edges), such as "<a href="Mycena%20rosella">M.¬†rosella</a>", "<a href="Mycena%20flavescens">M.¬†flavescens</a>", "M.¬†elegans", and "<a href="Mycena%20strobilinoides">M.¬†strobilinoides</a>". In his 1992 study of "Mycena", Dutch mycologist <a href="Rudolph%20Arnold%20Maas%20Geesteranus">Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus</a> put "M.¬†aurantiomarginata" in the section "Luculentae", characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white <a href="spore%20print">spore deposit</a>, and spiny cystidia." M.¬†aurantiomarginata" was included in a 2010 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis focused on clarifying the <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationships between Northern European species in the section "Calodontes". The results suggested that, based on the similarity of <a href="60S">nuclear large subunit</a> <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> sequences, the fungus is closely related to "<a href="Mycena%20crocata">M.¬†crocata</a>" and "<a href="Mycena%20leaiana">M.¬†leaiana</a>". This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several "Mycena" species can be <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l partners of the orchid "<a href="Gastrodia%20confusa">Gastrodia confusa</a>".

The specific epithet "aurantiomarginata" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, and refers to the orange edges of its gills ("aurantius", "orange"; "marginata", "bordered"). In the United Kingdom, the mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "golden-edge bonnet".

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "M.¬†aurantiomarginata" ranges in shape from obtusely conic to bell-shaped, and becomes flat in maturity, reaching diameters of . The cap color is variable, ranging from dark <a href="olive%20%28color%29">olive</a> <a href="wikt%3Afuscous">fuscous</a> (dark brownish-gray) to yellowish-olive in the center, while the margin is orangish. Alexander H. Smith, in his 1947 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of North American "Mycena" species, stated that the caps are not <a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a> (changing color depending on the level of hydration), while "Mycena" specialist Arne Aronsen says they are. The overall color fades as the mushroom ages. The surface is moist, and young individuals are covered with fine whitish powder, but this soon sloughs off to leave a polished surface that develops radial grooves in maturity. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thin (about 1¬†mm thick in the center of the cap) and flexible.

<a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">Gills</a> are <a href="adnation">adnate</a> with a <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> tooth (where the gills curve up to join the stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and initially narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted on the walls of the cystidia, is found in the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a> and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).

The cylindrical <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> is long by thick, hollow, and stiff but flexible; it is somewhat thicker at the base. It has a brownish to grayish-olive color that is sometimes tinged with shades of orange. The surface is smooth except for orange powder near the top, while the base is covered with stiff orange hairs. Smith reports the mushroom tissue to have no distinctive taste or odor, while Aronsen says the odor is "very conspicuous; sweet, fruity, often experienced as farinaceous or faintly of anise". Like many small "Mycena" species, the <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of the mushroom is unknown, as it is too insubstantial to consider collecting for the table.
The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are elliptic, smooth, and <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>, with dimensions of 7‚Äì9 by 4‚Äì5¬†<a href="micrometre">Œºm</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells of the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25‚Äì32 by 5.5‚Äì7¬†Œºm. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are abundant and similar in <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>: club-shaped to somewhat <a href="wikt%3Acapitate">capitate</a> (with a head), the tops sparsely to densely covered with small spines (said to resemble a mace), filled with a bright orange <a href="pigment">pigment</a>, and measuring 28‚Äì36 by 7‚Äì12¬†Œºm. The flesh of the cap is covered with a <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a>, on the surface of which are found scattered cystidia similar to those on the gills. Directly beneath the cuticle is a layer of enlarged cells, and beneath this are filamentous <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present in the hyphae.

"Mycena aurantiomarginata" uses a tetrapolar <a href="mating%20in%20fungi">mating system</a>, whereby <a href="gene">gene</a>s at two different <a href="mating-type%20region">locations</a> on the <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s regulate sexual compatibility, or <a href="mating%20type">mating type</a>. This system prevents <a href="self-fertilization">self-fertilization</a> and ensures a high degree of <a href="genotype">genotypic</a> diversity. When the fungal mycelia is grown in <a href="pure%20culture">culture</a> on a <a href="petri%20dish">petri dish</a>, the <a href="clonal%20colony">colonies</a> are white, odorless, and typically have a central patch of congested aerial hyphae that grow upward from the colony surface, which abruptly become flattened to submerged, and occasionally form faint zone lines. The hyphae commonly form deposits of tiny amorphous crystals where they contact other mycelial fronts, especially where the hyphae are <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetatively</a> incompatible and destroy each other by <a href="lysis">lysis</a>.

"Mycena aurantiomarginata" is generally recognizable in the field by its olive-brown to orangish cap, bright orange gill edges, and yellowish hairs at the base of the stipe. "<a href="Mycena%20elegans">M.¬†elegans</a>" is similar in appearance to "M.¬†aurantiomarginata", and some have considered them synonymous. "M.¬†elegans" is larger, with a cap diameter up to and stipe length up to , darker, and has pale greenish-yellow colors on the gill edges and stipes that stain dull reddish-brown in age. "<a href="Mycena%20leaiana">M.¬†leaiana</a>" is readily distinguished from "M.¬†aurantiomarginata" by the bright orange color of its fruit bodies, its clustered growth on rotting wood, and the presence of a gelatinous layer on its stipe. "<a href="Mycena%20strobilinoides">M.¬†strobilinoides</a>" closely resembles "M.¬†aurantiomarginata" in shape, size, spore morphology, and the presence of hairs at the stipe base. It has a cap color that ranges from scarlet to yellow, and features scarlet edges on widely spaced, pale pinkish-orange to yellow gills.

"Mycena aurantiomarginata" is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> fungus, deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter found on the <a href="forest%20floor">forest floor</a>, such as needle carpets. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow scattered, in groups, or in <a href="wikt%3Atuft">tufts</a> under <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s (usually <a href="spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a>), and are often found on <a href="moss">moss</a>. In North America, it is found in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and the species is widely distributed in western and northern Europe. In Central America, the mushroom has been collected on the summit of <a href="Cerro%20de%20la%20Muerte">Cerro de la Muerte</a> in the <a href="Cordillera%20de%20Talamanca">Cordillera de Talamanca</a>, Costa Rica, on <a href="plant%20litter">leaf litter</a> of "<a href="Comarostaphylis%20arbutoides">Comarostaphylis arbutoides</a>" (a highly branched evergreen shrub or tree in the <a href="heath%20family">heath family</a>). In 2010, it was reported from <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> in northern Japan, where it was found growing on "<a href="Picea%20glehnii">Picea glehnii</a>" forest litter in early winter. It has also been recorded from North Africa.

In 2010, a pigment compound isolated and characterized from fruit bodies of "Mycena aurantiomarginata" was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter Spiteller in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Natural%20Products">Journal of Natural Products</a>". The chemical, mycenaaurin¬†A, is a <a href="polyene">polyene</a> compound that consists of a tridecaketide (i.e., 13 adjacent <a href="methylene%20bridge">methylene bridge</a> and <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s with two <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> <a href="wikt%3Amoiety">moieties</a> on either end of the molecule). The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived <a href="biosynthesis">biosynthetically</a> from <a href="S-Adenosyl%20methionine">"S"-Adenosyl methionine</a>. The tridecaketide itself contains an alpha-<a href="pyrone">pyrone</a>, a <a href="conjugated%20system">conjugated</a> <a href="wikt%3Ahexaene">hexaene</a>, and a single <a href="alkene">alkenyl</a> moiety. Jaeger and Spiteller suggest that mycenaaurin¬†A might function as a defense compound, since it exhibits <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> activity against the <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a> bacterium "<a href="Bacillus%20pumilus">Bacillus pumilus</a>". The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies, and not in the colorless <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a>. An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi "<a href="Candida%20albicans">Candida albicans</a>" and "<a href="Aspergillus%20fumigatus">Aspergillus fumigatus</a>".

Infinity Blade

Infinity Blade was a <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a> with <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">role-playing elements</a> developed by <a href="Chair%20Entertainment">Chair Entertainment</a> and <a href="Epic%20Games">Epic Games</a> and released through the <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a> on December 9, 2010. It was the first <a href="iOS">iOS</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> to run on the <a href="Unreal%20Engine%23Unreal%20Engine%203">Unreal Engine</a>. In the game, the unnamed <a href="player%20character">player character</a> fights a series of one-on-one battles in a derelict castle to face the immortal God King. When in battle, players swipe the screen to attack and <a href="parry%20%28fencing%29">parry</a>, and tap the screen to dodge and block enemy attacks. Upon defeat, the player restarts the game as the character's descendant with the same items and <a href="Experience%20point%23Level-based%20progression">experience level</a>.

The game was developed by a team of twelve people, who took two months to make a <a href="playable%20demo">playable demo</a> and three more to finish the game. "Infinity Blade" was intended to demonstrate the new iOS version of the Unreal Engine, and to combine the swordplay of "<a href="Karateka%20%28video%20game%29">Karateka</a>" and "<a href="Prince%20of%20Persia%20%281989%20video%20game%29">Prince of Persia</a>" with the loneliness of "<a href="Shadow%20of%20the%20Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>". The game received four free expansions that added new equipment, endings, and game modes.

"Infinity Blade" was the fastest-grossing app in the history of iOS upon its release. It made US$1.6 million in its first four days, and over US$23 million by the end of 2011. It was well received by gaming critics. Reviews praised the graphics and compared the mobile game favorably to <a href="console%20game">console game</a>s. Critics also praised the swipe-based combat system, but split opinions on the cyclical gameplay as either addictive or repetitive. Chair later released an <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a> <a href="Porting%23Porting%20in%20gaming">port</a> and two sequels: "<a href="Infinity%20Blade%20II">Infinity Blade II</a>" and "<a href="Infinity%20Blade%20III">Infinity Blade III</a>". Author <a href="Brandon%20Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> also wrote two novellas set between the games: "" and "".

The game was removed from the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a> on December 10, 2018, alongside <a href="Infinity%20Blade%20II">Infinity Blade II</a> and <a href="Infinity%20Blade%20III">Infinity Blade III</a> due to difficulties in updating the game for newer hardware.

In the primary portion of "Infinity Blade", the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The path through the castle is a series of discrete locations where the player can <a href="Panning%20%28camera%29">pan</a> the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a> as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons at the bottom of the screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also <a href="parry%20%28fencing%29">parry</a> incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a swipe to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a> for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health bar</a>. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked‚Äîsuch as a shield bash‚Äîthat must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.

In addition to combat, there is also a mild <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> component. An <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a> system <a href="Experience%20point%23Level-based%20progression">levels up</a> the player character and their equipment (weapons, armor, shields, helms, and magic rings). Equipment pieces have special properties and a predetermined amount of experience points required to master them. Mastering a piece of equipment increases its sale value but decreases the player's experience gain by 20%. Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain <a href="attribute%20points">attribute points</a> that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using in-game money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. In-game money can be <a href="Micropayment">purchased with real money</a> within the game.

The game follows a cyclical narrative structure in which the protagonist and his descendants individually explore a castle in a quest to battle the primary antagonist, the immortal God King. In the game's introduction, the non-playable protagonist has just finished this quest, but is slain by the God King. The player then assumes the role of the dead protagonist's descendant as he starts his own journey at the beginning of the castle. This cycle, called a bloodline, continues after the player finally faces the God King and either dies or wins. The player may also choose to join the God King and terminate the cycle; upon doing so, the game resumes at the checkpoint before fighting the God King. Enemy difficulty increases with each bloodline cycle. Another bloodline ending is unlocked after purchasing the Infinity Blade item: the sword is placed into a pedestal in the castle's underground dungeons and three doors open. After then defeating each of the three "Deathless"‚Äîimmortal beings like the God King‚Äîof increasing difficulty found within, a final fourth door opens and the player faces a mechanized warrior guarding the high-tech chamber where the God King is reborn whenever he is killed. Upon defeating the mechanized warrior, the chamber is revealed to be controlled by an ancestor of the player character, who chose to serve the God King. After fighting the ancestor, the player character is told that the Infinity Blade has the ability to prevent immortals like the God King from resurrecting after death. The player is then given the option of either starting the next bloodline as they do when defeated, or resetting the game and starting <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game+</a> mode, which resets all gold and item progression but maintains the character's experience level, letting the player remaster the items and level up even further.

<a href="Chair%20Entertainment">Chair Entertainment</a> released four <a href="expansion%20pack">expansions</a> as free updates to the game. The first, released December 20, 2010, added a new enemy, equipment, and microtransactions. It also removed an experience level cap. The second update, titled "Infinity Blade: The Deathless Kings", was released on March 2, 2011 and added the dungeons as a second branch to the game's path. This expansion also added new equipment, enemies, and the second ending where the player character defeats his ancestor. The third update, "Infinity Blade: Arena", was released on May 19, 2011. It added the <a href="player%20versus%20player">player vs. player</a> "Arena Mode", a tiered combat game progression where one player fights as the hero and the other as an enemy from the game. The update also included new equipment and a single-player version of Arena Mode called "Survival Mode". On October 4, 2011, a fourth update added a new enemy and new equipment to coincide with the announcement of the forthcoming sequel "<a href="Infinity%20Blade%20II">Infinity Blade II</a>".

"Infinity Blade" was created by <a href="Chair%20Entertainment">Chair Entertainment</a>, a subsidiary company of <a href="Epic%20Games">Epic Games</a>. In July 2010, Chair had both recently finished the <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> game "<a href="Shadow%20Complex">Shadow Complex</a>" and been acquired by Epic. Chair was brainstorming <a href="Kinect">Kinect</a> and <a href="Wii">Wii</a> games, including an idea similar to "Infinity Blade", and Epic was nearing completion of an <a href="iOS">iOS</a> version of the <a href="Unreal%20Engine%23Unreal%20Engine%203">Unreal Engine 3</a> graphics engine and in need of a "killer game" to show it off. Epic had previously licensed the engine for use in numerous console and <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> games. They asked Chair to develop a game for the engine in five months, with a playable demo for the <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> Special Event conference in two months. The team decided within a few days to work on the "Infinity Blade" concept, codenamed "Project Sword". In lieu of the normal initial game development where working prototypes test gameplay ideas, Chair spent the first week of development refining the gameplay concept on paper before beginning to code. Many of the core gameplay ideas were developed in their first few hours. Geremy Mustard, Chair's co-founder and technical director, estimates that the team cut two-third of that initial design due to lack of time. Refining the complex touch-based interface was complicated due to the Unreal Engine's incomplete status and the native iOS code library's lack of support for fast touch-based gameplay. The five-month development was completed by a team of twelve people from Chair, with assistance from Epic. In addition to Geremy Mustard, the team was composed of Chair co-founder and creative director Donald Mustard; Simon Hurley as producer; Joshua Andersen and Scott K. Bowen as programmers; Adam Ford as art director; Orlando Barrowes, Bert Lewis, Mike Low, Scott Stoddard, and Nathan Trewartha as artists and animators; and Brandon Raul Campos as lead tester.

The game's swipe-based swordplay was based on Donald Mustard's desire for an uncommon gameplay based on nuanced sword fighting and parrying. He described the game's influences as the combat of "<a href="Karateka%20%28video%20game%29">Karateka</a>" and "<a href="Prince%20of%20Persia%20%281989%20video%20game%29">Prince of Persia</a>" combined with the "lonely epicness" of "<a href="Shadow%20of%20the%20Colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>". Chair sought to develop an experience that could be picked up and played for a minute (a single battle) or for half an hour (a bloodline). They felt that many other developers accustomed to consoles were wrong to make iOS games that required long playing experiences to feel meaningful, and so Chair developed the bloodline concept as a natural breakpoint. They also felt that mobile games like "Infinity Blade" with constant action elements went too long without giving the player time to relax and resulted in player exhaustion, and so Chair kept their individual battles short with brief cinematic pauses in longer battles. Chair showed their playable demo at the Apple conference on September 1, 2010, after weeks of rehearsal, and attracted a lot of attention to the game. It was released on December 9, 2010. While Chair itself spent little on marketing, Apple used the game extensively in advertisements for its devices.

The music for the game was composed by Josh Aker, who had written the music for previous Chair games. The soundtrack was intended by Aker to be "intense" during combat, but to vary between "serene" and "otherworldly" outside battle. It is a mixture of live and synthetic instrument performances. <a href="Cello">Cello</a> and <a href="nyckelharpa">nyckelharpa</a> were the primary instruments used. Aker wanted to have "avant-garde performances" for the recordings. The soundtrack was sold as a digital album, "Infinity Blade: Original Soundtrack", through several online music retailers. Chair began to develop the game's first update before the initial game was released. They intended only to add new monsters and features, but added the ability to purchase gold due to customer requests. Chair did not rebalance the game to incentivize in-app purchases. Work on "The Deathless Kings" update began immediately afterwards. Chair felt that releasing several large, free updates to the game would increase their overall user base and result in more total sales due to <a href="word%20of%20mouth">word of mouth</a>.

"Infinity Blade" was noted for its sales at launch, selling more than 270,000 copies and making over US$1.6 million in its first four days‚Äîthe "fastest-grossing app" ever released for iOS at the time. By the end of 2011, it had made at least US$23 million in revenue. Around fourteen months after the initial release, Chair noted that half of the game's sales were for the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and half were for the <a href="iPad">iPad</a> and <a href="iPod">iPod</a>. After releasing the sequel, Epic Games noted in 2012 that the series was Epic's most profitable by measure of revenue against <a href="person-hour">person-hour</a>s spent in development.

"Infinity Blade" was reviewed by several major gaming sites in addition to mobile game-focused sites. Critics praised the game's graphics heavily. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> reviewer Hilary Goldstein said that it was "an absolute stunner for any handheld device and ushers in a new era of possibility for high-end graphics." "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" Ryan Rigney called the game "downright gorgeous" and said that the graphics were almost at the level of a <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> game, which was echoed by John Meyer of "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>", who claimed that it had the best graphics of any iPad game. The reviewer for "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" further praised the art direction, especially with regards to the enemy and armor designs.

The gameplay was generally praised by reviewers, who typically found the combat engaging but were split on the repetitive aspects of the game. <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s Matt Clark said that the sword gameplay "just feels right", while Mark Brown of "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>" said that the combat had an excitement factor that pushed players to keep on going for one more battle. Tracy Erickson of "<a href="Pocket%20Gamer">Pocket Gamer</a>" described the swipe-based combat system as "easy to understand, though tough to master", and Nick Chester of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> said that although the combat was not very complicated, it was fun to play. The role-playing game elements were praised‚ÄîDestructoid's Chester called them "satisfying" and IGN's Goldstein said that they added to the game's difficulty. Brown's review for "Eurogamer", however, said that while good they were not as engaging as the combat, and the "Edge" review dismissed them as minimal. Reviewers had mixed opinions on the effectiveness of the bloodline system's repetition: Destructoid's Chester described it as addictive and IGN's Goldstein agreed, but Erickson's review for "Pocket Gamer" said that the game had problems with repetition and "Wired" Meyer dismissed it as "repetitive ... as the title suggests". J. Nicholas Geist, writing for "<a href="Kill%20Screen">Kill Screen</a>", focused his entire review on the cyclical nature of the game, treating its nature of repetition with small changes between each bloodline as a metaphor for life. Most reviewers found themselves between the two extremes, with Brown of "Eurogamer" simultaneously describing it as "alarmingly repetitious" but still addictive and 1UP.com's Clark saying that enjoying the game required getting past the repetition, despite being "stellar".

On October 28, 2011, Epic Games and Adrenaline Amusements released an arcade version of the game, "Infinity Blade FX". The game is played on a 46-inch screen rigged with optical sensors so as to mimic a large iPhone or iPad screen. Each arcade stand contains up to three screens, and players can play against each other or in the single-player game. A sequel to the iOS game, "<a href="Infinity%20Blade%20II">Infinity Blade II</a>", was announced on October 4, 2011, during the Apple <a href="iPhone%204S">iPhone 4S</a> keynote presentation. It was released on December 1, 2011, and features enhanced graphics, a new storyline, and new fighting styles. A spinoff game, "Infinity Blade: Dungeons", was in development for iOS by Epic Games subsidiary Impossible Games, but was cancelled in February 2013 when Impossible Games was shut down. A final game in the trilogy, "<a href="Infinity%20Blade%20III">Infinity Blade III</a>", was released on September 18, 2013.

A <a href="novella">novella</a> by author <a href="Brandon%20Sanderson">Brandon Sanderson</a> was released prior to both "Infinity Blade II" and "III" to serve as a <a href="Interquel">story bridge</a> between the games. "Infinity Blade: Awakening" was released as an <a href="e-book">e-book</a> on October 4, 2011 to correspond with the announcement of "Infinity Blade II". The story gives the protagonist of the first game a name, Siris, introduces the idea that the God King was one of multiple Deathless in the world, as is Siris, and has Siris and the assassin Isa journey to find the Worker of Secrets in order to kill the resurrected God King and the other Deathless. The second e-book novella, "Infinity Blade: Redemption", was released on September 9, 2013 just prior to the third game. In it, Siris and the God King escape from their imprisonment by the Worker of Secrets, while extensive flashbacks show the rise of the Deathless in a future-Earth analogue. While Siris disrupts the Worker of Secret's plans, the God King confronts and is killed by the Worker.

A Chinese version of the game for <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and Android was published by <a href="Tencent">Tencent Games</a> on November 28, 2015.

A day after Epic Games removed the "Infinity Blade" trilogy from the App Store, the titular weapon made a <a href="Crossover%20%28fiction%29">crossover</a> appearance in the winter-themed seventh season of "<a href="Fortnite">Fortnite</a> <a href="Fortnite%20Battle%20Royale">Battle Royale</a>" as a unique, very powerful melee weapon that can be obtained in a match, granting any player who finds it devastating abilities and extra survivability, at the cost of being unable to use other items. Three days later, however, Epic Games later "vaulted" the weapon over concerns that it was too <a href="balance%20%28game%20design%29">overpowered</a>. Epic Games later brought back the Infinity Blade in February 2019 as a restricted item that is only available in the limited-time mode "Sword Fight", nerfing it and allowing multiple copies of it to be found from loot chests.

La Stazione

La Stazione (, "The Station") is an Italian restaurant and former <a href="train%20station">train station</a> in the <a href="New%20Paltz%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">village of New Paltz</a> in <a href="Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York">Ulster County</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. The building was the first of two railroad stations constructed in the <a href="New%20Paltz%2C%20New%20York">town of New Paltz</a>, and it is the only former <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Railroad">Wallkill Valley Railroad</a> station standing at its original location.

After a lengthy public debate over whether to place the station to the east or west of the <a href="Wallkill%20River">Wallkill River</a>, it was built in 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was formally opened during a large ceremony on December¬†20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the <a href="Mohonk%20Mountain%20House">Mohonk Mountain House</a> by many vacationers, including two <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. presidents</a>. In the late 19th century, over a dozen <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>es ran between the station and Mohonk daily.

The station burned down in 1907 and was rebuilt later that year. The rise of the <a href="automobile">automobile</a> caused the railroad to end passenger service in 1937; by 1959 the station was completely closed and sold off. After closure, it was used for a variety of businesses, including serving as a <a href="public-access%20television">public-access television</a> station. Freight service along the Wallkill Valley line continued until 1977, when the corridor was shut to regular rail traffic.

The building was in such a state of disrepair by the 1980s that it was almost demolished, and the nearby tracks were torn up and sold for scrap by 1984. However, the station avoided demolition and was renovated in 1988. It was used as a <a href="real%20estate">real estate</a> office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Rail%20Trail">Wallkill Valley Rail Trail</a>. In 1999, the station became an Italian restaurant and received its current name, La Stazione. The building was expanded in 2003 and served as the setting for a scene in a 2008 mob film.

In February 1864, plans were in place to extend the route of the proposed <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Railroad">Wallkill Valley Railroad</a> between the <a href="Town%20%28New%20York%29">towns</a> of <a href="Shawangunk%2C%20New%20York">Shawangunk</a> and <a href="New%20Paltz%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">New Paltz</a>. A civil engineering survey to determine a possible route and cost of such an endeavor was undertaken in March of that year. The proposal sparked a controversy as to whether the route would run east or west of the <a href="Wallkill%20River">Wallkill River</a> in New Paltz. The western route was roughly shorter, and the eastern route would cost $25,000 more. However, it was felt that the increased economic activity from having the rail line run east of the river, and directly through the village of New Paltz, would offset the expense. <a href="Municipal%20bond">Bonding</a> for the rail line through New Paltz, at a cost of $123,000, was completed by January 1869. The Wallkill Valley Railroad was the first rail line in <a href="Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York">Ulster County</a>, and was heralded as a cure for the region's isolation from the rest of the industrialized world.
By November 1869, the <a href="Gardiner%2C%20New%20York">Gardiner</a> rail depot, to the south of New Paltz, was ceremoniously opened by the railroad's president, Floyd McKinstry. The station immediately began to see regular traffic. A second Gardiner station was constructed in the hamlet of Forest Glen, in the northern part of Gardiner. The railroad company was contractually obligated to start construction in New Paltz by May¬†18, 1870, and work on the New Paltz station commenced that day. The depot was designed to be . The design included freight and baggage rooms, as well as a <a href="water%20tank">water tank</a> and <a href="Motive%20power%20depot">engine house</a>. The station had two waiting rooms, while most stations on the Wallkill line only had one. The New Paltz station, as with the other Wallkill Valley stations, was based on "standard patterns¬†... rather than by individual architects".

Half the station's lumber came from <a href="Honesdale%2C%20Pennsylvania">Honesdale</a>, Pennsylvania, via the <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Canal">Delaware and Hudson Canal</a> and its <a href="Framing%20%28construction%29">framework</a> was raised on July¬†1, 1870. Work was completed by September 1870. John C. Deyo had provided the <a href="carpentry">carpentry</a>, Snyder and Fuller painted it, and John C. Shaffer was the <a href="General%20contractor">contractor</a>. Shaffer had also constructed living quarters for the railroad's workers.

The <a href="masonry">masonry</a> for a bridge over the <a href="Plattekill%20Creek">Plattekill Creek</a> between Gardiner and New Paltz was completed by late June 1870, and <a href="trestle">trestle</a> work was done by July. Beginning in late September 1870, the railroad had begun laying <a href="Track%20%28rail%20transport%29">tracks</a> between Gardiner and New Paltz. The tracks reached the Plattekill Creek bridge by the end of October, and the rail line reached New Paltz on December¬†1, 1870.

The rail line was officially opened in New Paltz on December¬†20, 1870, during a day-long celebration. At that time, the Wallkill Valley line was connected to the <a href="Erie%20Railroad">Erie Railroad</a>'s Montgomery‚ÄìGoshen branch to the south; an inaugural train containing about 350 passengers ran to <a href="Goshen%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Goshen</a>, making stops at each station along the way, before heading back to New Paltz. The station's <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph</a> was used to "receive¬†... election returns" throughout the 1870s.

On March¬†3, 1880, four men robbed the station's safe. They broke into the depot late at night and dragged the safe to the center of the station. They then attempted to drill holes into the safe and explode it with gunpowder, but failing that, cut off one of its sides. The contents of the safe were 300 cigars and a few bills and papers. After the suspects were arrested in <a href="Poughkeepsie%2C%20New%20York">Poughkeepsie</a>, the local <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff</a> was reluctant to transfer the suspects to New Paltz. The Poughkeepsie police were insistent that they be paid immediately for their services. The day after their arrest, the men were allowed to go to a barber shop for a shave; some witnesses were unable to identify the suspects because of this, and the officers were publicly chided for incompetence. Cigars in the suspects' pockets were identical to the cigars in the safe, and along with tools recovered from the site, they were used to identify the men. The suspects were brought to a jail in <a href="Kingston%2C%20New%20York">Kingston</a> pending the ruling of a <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> that April. A large crowd gathered at the New Paltz depot to watch them depart. The men were described as "cracksmen of the <a href="first%20water">first water</a>", possibly "stylish", and so proficient at <a href="safe-cracking">safe-cracking</a> that, "if they any chance at all, or hold of any weapon, they pick their way thro' the jail as easily as boring through a lime heap". The men were subsequently convicted. As a result of the burglary, station agent Dwight Marsh was given a revolver, and it became policy not to keep valuables in the safe overnight. On December¬†8, 1880, another thief broke a window at the depot and stole a box of cigars.

Two sheds had been built adjacent to the station by 1881. The land the sheds were built on was purchased the previous year by <a href="Mohonk%20Mountain%20House">Mohonk Mountain House</a> co-founder <a href="Albert%20Smiley">Albert Smiley</a> for $500. The sheds were built for the resort's horses. During this period, as many as 14 <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>es each day transported guests between the station and Mohonk. The <a href="West%20Shore%20Railroad">West Shore Railroad</a> purchased the Wallkill Valley line in June 1881, and placed an additional <a href="Siding%20%28rail%29">siding</a> by the depot in 1887 to allow daily "special extra-fare trains¬†... for the Minnewaska and Mohonk visitors".

President <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a> visited the station with his daughter in 1884. He was welcomed by the railroad's director and brought to <a href="Lake%20Mohonk">Lake Mohonk</a>. President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> occasionally attended conferences at the Mohonk Mountain House. In 1892, several townspeople held a reception for him at the station, giving him "three rousing cheers". Other notable Mountain House guests who arrived by train were opera singer <a href="Ernestine%20Schumann-Heink">Ernestine Schumann-Heink</a> and orator <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>. A <a href="Sanitary%20sewer">sewage line</a> was installed from the station to the Wallkill River in 1905.

As soon as the station in the village was completed, a second station was built at Springtown, a <a href="Hamlet%20%28New%20York%29">hamlet</a> in the northwestern part of the town of New Paltz that once sported "its own post office, church, school, hotel, a gambling den¬†... and a bevy of bars". The station was planned to be two stories tall with an area of . A bridge across the Wallkill River to Springtown was completed by December 1870, and the station was constructed at the point where the rail line crossed Coffey Road. Throughout its history, the Springtown station was occupied by various tenants who took up residence.

The original New Paltz station burned down around 4:45 A.M. on April¬†23, 1907, damaging freight and killing station agent E. J. Snyder's dog. The fire originated in the office stove, and spread rapidly before local fire companies could arrive. A <a href="Passenger%20car%20%28rail%29">passenger car</a> was used as a temporary station while the building was rebuilt. By late September 1907, the concrete foundation and the framework of the new building had been put in place, but work on the interior did not begin until November because the lumber had not arrived. The depot was completely rebuilt by December¬†31, 1907, and in active use by February¬†7, 1908. While the original station had a <a href="Gable">gabled roof</a>, the rebuilt station was <a href="hip%20roof">hipped</a>. The direction of the new station's <a href="batten">batten</a>s was horizontal; the original station had had vertical slats. The rebuilt freight house was placed a distance from the depot.

The building was not fully rebuilt until 1911. A house was constructed at the site of the Springtown depot the year before it was rebuilt. The <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Service%20Commission">New York Public Service Commission</a>, a <a href="regulatory%20agency">regulatory agency</a> founded in 1907, ruled in May 1911 that the new Springtown station was adequate. The Springtown station had no <a href="Station%20master">station agent</a> or freight house. In 1925, sparks shooting off a passing train caused a fire in Springtown that burned down six buildings, causing $7,000 in damage. The prominence of the New Paltz station, as well as the growth of <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20at%20New%20Paltz">SUNY New Paltz</a> in the village, caused the decline of Springtown as a community.

Passenger service along the Wallkill Valley line ceased in 1937, due to the increased usage of <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s. By December 1958 the building (then owned by the <a href="New%20York%20Central%20Railroad">New York Central Railroad</a>) was no longer used as a railroad station. It was sold off in 1959, and hosted a number of local endeavors, serving as a chapter house for the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a> and as an office for a <a href="public-access%20television">public-access television</a> station. Under the ownership of the television station, the roof and floorboards were repaired.

In April 1977, the owner of the property, Fetner and Gold Associates, attempted to open the building as a bar. Their <a href="Special-use%20permit">zoning permit</a> was rejected; the village mayor was "unalterably opposed" to the prospect, and the board believed the proposed bar would lead to complaints from nearby apartments. It was also believed that it would be unsafe to open a bar adjacent to an active rail line, and that such a venture would threaten the nearby <a href="Huguenot%20Street%20Historic%20District">Huguenot Street Historic District</a>. On December¬†31, 1977, all regular <a href="Freight%20rail%20transport">freight service</a> ceased along the Wallkill Valley line. By the early 1980s the depot had become a "hangout for youths to drink and carouse" and the village considered dismantling it. <a href="Consolidated%20Rail%20Corporation">Conrail</a>, at that time the owner of the rail line, removed all tracks along the corridor between 1983 and 1984 and salvaged the steel.

Robert Mark Realty bought the former station in 1986 and renovated it at a cost of $175,000. Work began in October 1987 and was more than halfway done by January 1988. Matt Bialecki, the architect who had overseen the renovation of the former New Paltz opera house as a restaurant, served as the project's architect. Wilro Builders served as the contractor. The building's design follows a <a href="Shingle%20Style%20architecture">Shingle Style architecture</a> and its <a href="siding">siding</a>s are both shingle and <a href="Clapboard%20%28architecture%29">clapboard</a>. There are <a href="bay%20window">bay window</a>s on the east and west faces, and <a href="rafter">rafter</a>s are partly visible. The building served as a <a href="real%20estate">real estate</a> office.

On February¬†9, 1999, the village approved a plan to allow the building to open as a 36-seat <a href="Italian-American%20cuisine">Italian restaurant</a> under the co-ownership of two men, Jeff DiMarco and Rocco Panetta. It was at this time the station was given its current name, La Stazione. DiMarco had previously managed construction for an adjacent restaurant, the "Gilded Otter". He sold his ownership of La Stazione in August 2000.

The building is adjacent to a <a href="rail%20trail">rail trail</a>, and there is a bike rack by the building's northern end. The village of New Paltz purchased its section of the former Wallkill Valley rail corridor from Conrail in 1991, formally opening it on October¬†9, 1993 as a public walkway, the <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Rail%20Trail">Wallkill Valley Rail Trail</a>. The permit allowing La Stazione to operate as a restaurant also required the placement of a sign in the building's parking lot to indicate the presence of the trail. The village allowed La Stazione to place a public picnic table under an <a href="Overhang%20%28architecture%29">overhang</a> by the rail trail, on the condition that the restaurant did not provide outdoor food service. In August 1999, the restaurant was forced to remove a gas tank and gas line that were placed under the trail; failure to do so could have resulted in the revocation of La Stazione's <a href="certificate%20of%20occupancy">certificate of occupancy</a>, preventing the building from being operated as a restaurant.

In 2001, the village was experiencing water drainage issues in the area by the restaurant. By early 2002, the village approved plans for an expansion of La Stazione, which addressed the drainage issues; the restaurant offered to install larger pipes than were necessary in exchange for the village "defray their costs". When the Gardiner station burned down on October 10, 2002, La Stazione was left as the last former station of the Wallkill Valley Railroad remaining at its original location. The building's addition was completed in 2003.

A scene from the 2008 <a href="mob%20film">mob film</a> "<a href="Front%20Man%20%28film%29">Front Man</a>" was filmed at La Stazione; the film's director, Ray Genadry, is the cousin of the restaurant's owner, Rocco Panetta. The scene featured Chris Colombo, son of the late <a href="Joseph%20Colombo">Joseph Colombo</a>, a former boss of the <a href="Colombo%20crime%20family">Colombo crime family</a>. Colombo had previously starred in a 2005 mobster documentary on <a href="HBO">HBO</a>. The building was added to the <a href="New%20Paltz%20Downtown%20Historic%20District">New Paltz Downtown Historic District</a> on July 24, 2009.

SMS "Kaiserin" was the third vessel of the of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. "Kaiserin"s keel was laid in November 1910 at the <a href="Howaldtswerke">Howaldtswerke</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. She was launched on 11 November 1911 and was commissioned into the fleet on 14 May 1913. The ship was equipped with ten guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of . "Kaiserin" was assigned to the <a href="III%20Battle%20Squadron">III Battle Squadron</a> and later the <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Battle Squadron</a> of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for the majority of her career, including <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Along with her four sister ships, , , , and , "Kaiserin" participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May¬†and 1 June 1916. The ship was also involved in <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>, in October 1917. She later saw action during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> in November 1917.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> in November 1918, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> interned "Kaiserin" and most of the <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s of the High Seas Fleet in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied powers</a> negotiated the final version of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. On 21 June 1919, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered the fleet to be scuttled</a> to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. "Kaiserin" was raised in May 1936 and subsequently <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap.

Ordered under the contract name "Ersatz Hagen" as a replacement for the obsolete <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> , "Kaiserin" was laid down at the <a href="Howaldtswerke">Howaldtswerke</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in November 1910. She was launched on 11 November 1911, after which fitting-out work was completed. At the launching ceremony, Admiral <a href="Hans%20von%20Koester">Hans von Koester</a> gave a speech and Princess <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20Louise%20of%20Prussia">Victoria Louise</a> christened the ship. A dockyard crew delivered the ship to the Navy on 13 May 1913; she was commissioned into the fleet the following day. During trials the ship's turbine engines were damaged, and "Kaiserin" did not join the fleet until 13 December 1913.

The ship was long <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a> and <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> a maximum of . She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. "Kaiserin" was powered by three sets of Parsons turbines, each of which drove a single propeller shaft; they were supplied with steam by 16 coal-fired boilers. The powerplant produced a top speed of . She carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of .

"Kaiserin" was armed with a main battery of ten <a href="30.5%20cm%20SK%20L/50%20gun">30.5 cm SK L/50 gun</a>s in five twin turrets. The ship dispensed with the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, with two of them arranged in a <a href="superfire">superfiring pair</a> aft. The other two turrets were placed <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23E">"en echelon"</a> amidships, such that both could fire on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The ship was also armed with fourteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/45">15 cm SK L/45</a> guns in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s amidships, eight <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">8.8¬†cm SK L/45 guns</a> in casemates and four 8.8¬†cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. The ship's armament was rounded out by five <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all mounted in the hull.

After joining the <a href="III%20Battle%20Squadron">III Battle Squadron</a> in December 1913, "Kaiserin" participated in the routine fleet training exercises. Squadron exercises were conducted in February, followed by fleet maneuvers, both in the North Sea. The fleet trained again in May, in both the North and Baltic Seas. "Kaiserin" left Germany on 7 July for the annual summer cruise to Norway, but was recalled prematurely on 22 July because of rising international tensions following the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>. Upon returning to Germany, "Kaiserin" steamed to <a href="Brunsb%C3%BCttel">Brunsb√ºttel</a> on 24 July, where she was the first battleship to traverse the recently deepened <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>. The voyage required lightening, and in just under twelve hours "Kaiserin" exited the locks at <a href="Holtenau">Holtenau</a> in Kiel where she met the rest of her squadron. On 31 July, the entire squadron returned to the North Sea via the Canal. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom, with its powerful <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, declared war on Germany.

"Kaiserin" was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Ingenohl intended to use the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a>. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding "Kaiserin" and her four <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a>‚Äîand eight <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>s came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany.

"Kaiserin" went into the Baltic for squadron training from 23 to 29 January 1916. Upon returning to the North Sea, the ship went into drydock in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> for periodic maintenance, which lasted from 31 January to 20 February. The Kaiser removed Ingenohl from his post on 2 February, following the loss of at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> the month before. Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> succeeded him as the commander of the fleet. Pohl continued the policy of sweeps into the North Sea to destroy isolated British formations. The fleet conducted a series of advances into the North Sea throughout 1915; "Kaiserin" was present for the sweeps on 17 to 18 May, 29 to 30 May, 10 August, 11 to 12 September, and 23 to 24 October. The III Squadron completed the year with another round of unit training in the Baltic from 5 to 20 December.

Pohl's tenure as fleet commander was brief; by January 1916 <a href="hepatic%20cancer">hepatic cancer</a> had weakened him to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5 to 7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the <a href="Hoofden">Hoofden</a>. "Kaiserin" was also present during an advance to the Amrun Bank on 2 to 3 April. The fleet conducted another sortie on 21 to 22 April.

"Kaiserin" was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916; her commander at the time was "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapit√§n zur See</a>" ("KzS") <a href="Karl%20Sievers">Karl Sievers</a>. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, "Kaiserin" was the second ship in the VI Division of III Squadron and the seventh ship in the line, directly astern of "Kaiser" and ahead of "Prinzregent Luitpold". The VI Division was behind only the V Division, consisting of the four s. The eight battleships of the - and es assigned to the I and II Divisions in I Squadron followed the VI Division. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation.

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. At 16:19, "Kaiserin" was forced to temporarily stop the turbine on the center shaft, as the condenser had started leaking. The crew were able to restart the engine before "Kaiserin" came into action. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, , spotted both the I¬†Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">two-point</a> turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.

At approximately 17:40, the British light cruiser fired a single torpedo at "Kaiserin" at the extreme range of at least , which failed to find its target. After Scheer ordered the fleet to open fire, "Kaiserin" briefly engaged the battlecruiser ; "Kaiserin" failed to score a hit and by 17:54 "New Zealand" and the rest of the British battlecruisers had increased speed and moved out of range. The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, lay directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. "Kaiserin" and her three sisters fired on "Nomad" with their secondary guns while the I Squadron battleships dispatched "Nestor". At around 19:00, the German battle line came into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; "Kaiserin" fired three salvos from her main battery at an unidentified four-funneled cruiser but made no hits.

Shortly after 19:00, a shell from the British battlecruiser disabled the German cruiser ; Rear Admiral Behncke in "K√∂nig" attempted to maneuver the III Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered "Wiesbaden" with fire from their main guns. The eight III Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. The armored cruisers , , and joined in the attack on the crippled "Wiesbaden". Between 19:14 and 19:17, several German battleships and battlecruisers opened fire on "Defence" and "Warrior". "Kaiserin" initially engaged one of the battleships in the British 5th Battle Squadron and scored a hit; according to "Kaiserin"s logs, the ship in question was . After three minutes firing at "Malaya", "Kaiserin" shifted fire to "Defence". In short succession, the German dreadnoughts hit "Defence" with several heavy caliber shells. One salvo penetrated the ship's ammunition magazines and, in a tremendous explosion, destroyed the cruiser. After "Defence" exploded, "Kaiserin" shifted her fire to a target believed to be the battlecruiser . Heavy haze forced "Kaiserin" to check fire after two salvos.

By 20:00, Scheer ordered the German line to complete a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. "Kaiserin" had come too close to "Prinzregent Luitpold" and was forced to haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside "Kaiserin" at high speed. As a result, "Kaiserin" had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; "Kaiserin" was now the seventh ship from the rear of the German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. "Kaiserin" was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.

After a series of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> by 04:00 on 1¬†June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> and "Kaiserin", "Kaiser", "Prinzregent Luitpold", and stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In the course of the battle, "Kaiserin" fired one-hundred and sixty 30.5¬†cm shells and one-hundred and thirty-five 15¬†cm rounds. She emerged from the battle completely unscathed.

In early August, "Kaiserin" and the rest of the operational III Squadron units conducted divisional training in the Baltic. On 18 August, Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers‚Äî and ‚Äîsupported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including "Kaiser", would trail behind and provide cover. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

Another fleet advance followed on 18 to 20 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4 November, "Kaiserin" took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s, and , that had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four "K√∂nig"-class battleships remained in III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five "Kaiser"-class ships, including "Kaiserin", were transferred to <a href="IV%20Battle%20Squadron">IV Squadron</a>. While transiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal on 14 March 1917, "Kaiserin" became grounded. One of her bilge keels was damaged and some of water entered the ship. Repairs were conducted at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">Imperial Dockyard in Kiel</a> from 15 to 18 March. "Kaiserin" returned to the North Sea on 30 March and remained there on guard duty until 8 June. On 9 June, she went to the Baltic for a month-long series of exercises, which were completed on 2 July. She resumed guard duties in the German Bight on 3 July and continued in this role until 11 September, when "Kaiserin" was detached to join the special unit assigned to <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>.

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>. The "Admiralstab" (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of <a href="Saaremaa">√ñsel</a>, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the <a href="S%C3%B5rve%20Peninsula">Sworbe Peninsula</a>. On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and <a href="Muhu">Moon</a> Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, "Moltke", along with the III and IV¬†Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of <a href="Naval%20mine">mine</a> warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men. By this time, the IV Battle Squadron had come under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="Wilhelm%20Souchon">Wilhelm Souchon</a>. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on √ñsel numbered some 14,000 men.

The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when "Moltke" and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while "Kaiserin" and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the <a href="Sworbe%20Peninsula">Sworbe Peninsula</a> on √ñsel. "Kaiserin", along with "Kaiser" and "Prinzregent Luitpold", were tasked with silencing the Russian guns at <a href="Hundsort">Hundsort</a> on √ñsel, which had taken "Moltke" under fire. The ships opened fire at 05:44, and by 07:45, Russian firing had ceased and German troops were moving ashore. Two days later, Souchon left Tagga Bay with "Kaiserin", "Friedrich der Grosse", and "Prinzregent Luitpold" to support German ground forces advancing on the Sworbe Peninsula. "Kaiserin" was assigned to suppress a Russian battery at <a href="Zerel">Zerel</a>, though heavy fog delayed her from engaging her target. The Russians opened fire first, which was quickly returned by "Kaiserin" and "K√∂nig Albert". "Friedrich der Grosse" came to the two ships' assistance; the three battleships fired a total of 120 large-caliber shells over the span of an hour. The fourth Russian salvo <a href="%3Awikt%3Astraddle">straddled</a> "Kaiserin", which began to steer erratically to avoid the Russian gunfire. The heavy firing prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts.

On the night of 15 October, "Kaiserin" and "K√∂nig Albert" were sent to replenish their coal stocks in <a href="Putzig">Putzig</a>. On the 19th, they were briefly joined in Putzig by "Friedrich der Grosse", which continued on to <a href="Kuressaare">Arensburg</a> with "Moltke". The next morning, Vice Admiral <a href="Ehrhard%20Schmidt">Ehrhard Schmidt</a> ordered the special naval unit to be dissolved and returned to the North Sea. In a communique to the naval headquarters, Schmidt noted that ""Kaiserin" and "K√∂nig Albert" can immediately be detached from Putzig to the North Sea." The two ships then proceeded to Kiel via <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>; after reaching Kiel, they transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal back to the North Sea.

On 17 November 1917, "Kaiserin" and "Kaiser" were assigned to provide cover for the II Scouting Group while it conducted a minesweeping operation in the North Sea. Significant British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers, attacked the II Scouting Group; the two battleships immediately steamed to their assistance. In the ensuing <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight">Second Battle of Heligoland Bight</a>, "Kaiserin" scored a hit on the light cruiser . The battlecruiser briefly engaged the German dreadnoughts, but both forces withdrew. After the action, Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a> criticized "Kaiserin"s commander, "KzS" <a href="Kurt%20Gra%C3%9Fhoff">Kurt Gra√ühoff</a>, for lagging too far behind the minesweepers to provide adequate protection. He was subsequently relieved of command of the ship. "Kaiserin" went into drydock for maintenance on 22 December, and work lasted until 5 February 1918. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23‚Äì25 April 1918, which had been intended to intercept a heavily defended convoy between Britain and Norway; faulty German intelligence prevented the Germans from catching the convoy. After returning to port, she resumed guard duties in the German Bight. The IV Squadron undertook another training exercise in the Baltic from 18 June to 13 August. A final round of drills took place on 22‚Äì28 October.

"Kaiserin" and her four sisters were to have taken part in a <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">final fleet action</a> at the end of October 1918, days before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from its base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the <a href="Grand%20Admiral">Grand Admiral</a> ("Gro√üadmiral") of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy. The goal was to improve Germany's bargaining position in the imminent peace negotiations, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated, "I no longer have a navy."

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the Allies interned most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, in the British naval base in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral <a href="Adolf%20von%20Trotha">Adolf von Trotha</a> made clear to Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any circumstances. The fleet rendezvoused with the British <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive fleet consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men.

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered the ships to be sunk</a> at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. "Kaiserin" sank at 14:00; she was subsequently raised on 14 May 1936 and broken up later that year in <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>.

Charles Robert Mowbray Fraser Cruttwell (23 May 1887¬†‚Äì 14 March 1941) was a British historian and academic who served as <a href="dean%20%28academic%29">dean</a> and later principal of <a href="Hertford%20College%2C%20Oxford">Hertford College, Oxford</a>. His field of expertise was modern European history, his most notable work being "A History of the Great War, 1914‚Äì18". He is mainly remembered, however, for the vendetta pursued against him by the novelist <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, in which Waugh showed his distaste for his former tutor by repeatedly using the name "Cruttwell" in his early novels and stories to depict a sequence of unsavoury or ridiculous characters. The prolonged minor humiliation thus inflicted may have contributed to Cruttwell's eventual mental breakdown.

Cruttwell gained first-class honours at <a href="The%20Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">The Queen's College, Oxford</a>, and was elected a Fellow of <a href="All%20Souls%20College">All Souls College</a>, Oxford, in 1911, and he became a lecturer in history at Hertford College the following year. His academic career was interrupted by war service, during which he suffered severe wounds; he returned to Oxford in 1919 and became dean of Hertford, and then principal of the college in 1930. It was during his tenure as dean that the feud with Evelyn Waugh developed while Waugh was a history scholar at Hertford in 1922‚Äì1924. Waugh pursued this hostility until shortly before Cruttwell's death.

Cruttwell's term as Hertford's principal saw the production of his most important scholarly works, including his war history which earned him the degree of <a href="Doctor%20of%20letters">DLitt</a>. Beyond his college and academic duties Cruttwell held various administrative offices within the university, and was a member of its <a href="Hebdomadal%20Council">Hebdomadal Council</a>, or ruling body. In private life Cruttwell served as a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> in Hampshire, where he had a country home, and stood unsuccessfully for the <a href="Oxford%20University%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">university's parliamentary seat</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 general election</a>, representing the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>. Ill-health, aggravated by his war injuries, caused his retirement from the Hertford principalship in 1939. A mental collapse led to his committal to an institution, where he died two years later.

Cruttwell was born on 23 May 1887, in the village of <a href="Denton%2C%20Norfolk">Denton, Norfolk</a>, the eldest of three sons of the Rev. <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20Cruttwell">Charles Thomas Cruttwell</a>, <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">Rector</a> of St Mary's Church. The elder Cruttwell was a scholar and historian of Roman literature; his wife Annie (n√©e Mowbray), was the daughter of <a href="Sir%20John%20Mowbray%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Mowbray</a>, who served as Conservative member of parliament for <a href="City%20of%20Durham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Durham</a> from 1853 to 1868 and for one of the two Oxford University <a href="Oxford%20University%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">parliamentary seats</a> from 1868 to 1899. The young Cruttwell was educated at <a href="Rugby%20School">Rugby School</a>, where in 1906 he won a scholarship to <a href="The%20Queen%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">The Queen's College, Oxford</a>, to read classics and history. At Queen's, Cruttwell enjoyed considerable academic success, including <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification">a first class honours degree</a> in modern history. In 1911 he was elected to a fellowship at <a href="All%20Souls%20College">All Souls College</a> and a year later was appointed to a history lectureship at Hertford College.

On the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in August 1914, Cruttwell was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the 1/4th Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Berkshire%20Regiment">Royal Berkshire Regiment</a>, a <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> unit in which his brother was also serving. By 1915 he was serving in the trenches, in France and Flanders, and led numerous patrols into <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a>, receiving a severe leg wound. Early in 1916, persistent <a href="myalgia">myalgia</a> and <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a> led to him being declared unfit for further active service. In August 1917 he was an instructor with an Officer Training Battalion in Oxford, and late in the war joined the Intelligence Department at the War Office. Demobilised in 1919, he resumed his academic life in Oxford, and in 1922 published a short history of his regiment's wartime exploits.

Apart from its physical effects, Cruttwell's wartime experience seemingly inflicted permanent psychological damage on his personality, replacing the general good manners of his youth with a short-tempered, impatient and bullying character. The novelist <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>, an undergraduate at Hertford in the 1920s, wrote later that "It was as though he had never cleansed himself from the muck of the trenches".

On his return to Hertford College, Cruttwell was elected to a fellowship in modern history and a year later was appointed Hertford's <a href="Dean%20%28education%29">dean</a>, responsible for general discipline within the college; he held this post for five years. He also became active in the administration of Oxford University and was elected to its ruling body, the <a href="Hebdomadal%20Council">Hebdomadal Council</a>. He served as a university statutory commissioner and was one of several academics nominated by the <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29">Vice-Chancellor</a> as delegates to the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>.

Cruttwell's administrative competence was recognised in 1930, when he was elected principal of Hertford College. In this office, he helped to establish the university's geography school and arranged that the first Oxford professorship in geography was based at Hertford. During his tenure as principal, he completed his most significant academic works, including his Great War history (1934) which earned him the Oxford degree of <a href="Doctor%20of%20letters">DLitt</a>. In 1936 Cruttwell delivered the <a href="Lees-Knowles%20Lectures">Lees-Knowles Lecture</a> at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, under the title "The Role of British Strategy in the Great War". In the same year he published a biography of the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> and in 1937 produced his final major academic work, "A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World". An attempt in 1935 to emulate his grandfather and become one of the university's members of parliament failed when, as a Conservative candidate in the general election of 1935, Cruttwell was defeated. An Independent, <a href="A.%20P.%20Herbert">A. P. Herbert</a>, beat him on the third ballot in a <a href="single%20transferable%20vote">single transferable vote</a> system. This was the first time since the 1860s, that a Conservative had failed to hold either of the two university seats, a humiliation noted with relish by Waugh who harboured a deep hostility towards his former tutor. According to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", Cruttwell had underestimated the nature and determination of the opposition and had taken his election as a Conservative for granted. In first preferences, he came bottom of the poll with only 1,803 votes, while his Conservative running mate, <a href="Hugh%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Baron%20Quickswood">Lord Hugh Cecil</a>, gained 7,365, almost five times as many. Because he polled less than one-eighth of the first ballot votes, Cruttwell forfeited his <a href="Deposit%20%28politics%29">deposit</a>.

Evelyn Waugh joined Hertford College on a scholarship in January 1922. He had received a congratulatory letter from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose: "about the best of any of the Candidates in the group". Despite this warmth, Waugh's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable‚Äî"not at all the kind of don for whom I had been prepared by stories of <a href="Benjamin%20Jowett">Jowett</a>." The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed between them was Waugh's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship. Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study. Waugh, however, considered the scholarship a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure. He involved himself in a range of university activities to the detriment of his academic work, until Cruttwell brusquely advised him in his third term that he should take his studies more seriously‚Äîa warning which Waugh interpreted as an insult. "I think it was from then on that our mutual dislike became incurable", he wrote.

During his remaining time at Hertford, Waugh missed few opportunities to ridicule Cruttwell. He did this in numerous unsigned contributions to "Isis", including an article in March 1924 in the "Isis Idols" series. The mockery in this article was disguised as a paean of praise, according to Waugh's biographer Martin Stannard, arranged around an unflattering photograph of Cruttwell displaying "bad teeth within an unfortunate smile". Cruttwell made no apparent response to these provocations, other than a dismissive reference to Waugh as "a silly suburban sod with an inferiority complex".

Waugh left Hertford in the summer of 1924 without completing his degree, and he received a brief note from Cruttwell expressing disappointment with his performance. The pair never met again, but Cruttwell spoke disparagingly of Waugh a few years later to Waugh's prospective mother-in-law Lady Burghclere, describing him as vice-ridden and "living off vodka and absinthe". Once Waugh had established himself as a writer, he resumed the vendetta against his former tutor by introducing a succession of disreputable or absurd characters named Cruttwell into his novels and stories. In "<a href="Decline%20and%20Fall">Decline and Fall</a>" (1928), Toby Cruttwell is a psychopathic burglar; in "<a href="Vile%20Bodies">Vile Bodies</a>" (1930), the name belongs to a snobbish Conservative MP. In "<a href="Black%20Mischief">Black Mischief</a>" (1932), Cruttwell is a social parasite, and he becomes a dubious <a href="osteopath">osteopath</a> or "bone-setter" in "<a href="A%20Handful%20of%20Dust">A Handful of Dust</a>" (1934). In "<a href="Scoop%20%28novel%29">Scoop</a>" (1938), General Cruttwell is a salesman with a fake tropical tan at the Army and Navy Stores. The 1935 short story "Mr Loveday's Little Outing" recounts the grisly deeds of an escaped homicidal maniac, and it was originally published as "Mr Cruttwell's Little Outing". The final Cruttwell reference in Waugh's fiction came in 1939 in the short story "An Englishman's Home" in the form of an embezzling <a href="Cub%20scout">Wolf Cub</a> master. A survey was conducted in 1935 in which novelists were asked to nominate their best work, and Waugh responded that he had yet to write his masterpiece: "It is the memorial biography of C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, some time Dean of Hertford College, Oxford, and my old history tutor. It is a labour of love to one to whom, under God, I owe everything". Cruttwell made no public response, although he anticipated each new Waugh novel with much anxiety about how he might be portrayed, according to Stannard.

Cruttwell remained a bachelor his whole life. His one proposal of marriage was to socialite and New York society hostess Anne Huth-Jackson, but it was rebuffed and there are no accounts of other romantic attachments. Beyond his academic duties, he enjoyed entertaining at his country house near the village of <a href="Highclere">Highclere</a> in Hampshire where he was active in the local community and served as a Justice of the Peace. His health suffered from the effects of his war wounds, and he was subject to recurrent <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>. In 1939, his poor physical condition caused him to retire early from Hertford, followed by a period of mental illness possibly exacerbated by the continuing mockery from Waugh. He was ultimately confined to the <a href="Stoke%20Park%20Hospital">Burden Neurological Institute</a> at <a href="Stapleton%2C%20Bristol">Stapleton, Bristol</a>, where he died on 14 March 1941, aged 53. He left his book collection and a bequest of ¬£1,000 to Hertford College, together with an oil portrait of him painted in 1937 by his cousin Grace Cruttwell. The probate value of his estate was ¬£19,814.

Cruttwell's professional reputation has been overshadowed by the attention given to his feud with Waugh, the true significance of which, according to Geoffrey Ellis's biographical sketch, may have been exaggerated. Cruttwell's experiences as a soldier were such that he spent his entire career writing about war, according to another biographer. "In "A History of Peaceful Change in the Modern World" (1937) he wracks his brains for peaceful changes that were not contingent upon war". His standing as a military historian is largely based on his 1934 Great War history, which Ellis praises as "most notable for its frank and fearless judgements on those identified as the principal actors (military, naval and political) in that tragic conflict". The work was widely praised in the press at the time of publication; "<a href="Naval%20Review%20%28magazine%29">The Naval Review</a>" thought that its description of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> was "admirable": "for those who wish to gain a clear but not too detailed idea of the general course of the war, and of the relations of the different parts of it to one another, the book should be invaluable". Against this, the <a href="Royal%20United%20Services%20Institute">Royal United Services Institute</a>'s review thought the book under-sourced and the quality of its writing poor in places. More recently, writer and broadcaster <a href="Humphrey%20Carpenter">Humphrey Carpenter</a> has criticised the book as lacking in humanity, displaying "almost no awareness of the appalling degree of suffering it chronicles". Nevertheless, historian <a href="Llewellyn%20Woodward">Llewellyn Woodward</a> considered it "the most profound study of any war in modern times", and the inspiration for his own Great War history of 1970, while strategist <a href="Colin%20S.%20Gray">Colin S. Gray</a> describes Cruttwell as "the most balanced of the historians of that conflict".

Cruttwell's relations with his colleagues and students have been the subject of contradictory reports. Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings describes him as "unprepossessing" in appearance, "good-hearted but difficult", inclined to misogyny, brusque and sometimes offensive towards his male colleagues. Waugh's description is of someone "tall, almost loutish, with the face of a petulant baby", of indistinct speech, who "smoked a pipe which was attached to his blubber-lips by a thread of slime". Stannard records that Waugh's student contemporary <a href="Christopher%20Hollis">Christopher Hollis</a> found nothing particularly remarkable about Cruttwell. "Like Waugh", says Stannard, "Cruttwell played up his eccentricities and had an uncharitable sense of humour". Ellis's 2004 biographical sketch suggests that much of Cruttwell's rebarbative manner may have been the result of simple shyness.

There was clearly mutual animosity between Cruttwell and Waugh, and Hastings points out that Cruttwell would have been justified in suspending Waugh from the college on numerous occasions but did not do so. Ellis acknowledges a "forceful, forthright and eccentric character" but stresses Cruttwell's generous hospitality to close friends and his concern for his undergraduates' welfare.

Peveril Castle

Peveril Castle (also Castleton Castle or Peak Castle) is a ruined 11th-century castle overlooking the village of <a href="Castleton%2C%20Derbyshire">Castleton</a> in the English county of <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. It was the main settlement (or "<a href="caput">caput</a>") of the <a href="English%20feudal%20barony">feudal barony</a> of <a href="William%20Peverel">William Peverel</a>, known as the <a href="Honour%20of%20Peverel">Honour of Peverel</a>, and was founded some time between the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a> of 1066 and its first recorded mention in the <a href="Domesday%20Survey">Domesday Survey</a> of 1086, by Peverel, who held lands in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> and Derbyshire as a <a href="tenant-in-chief">tenant-in-chief</a> of the king. The town became the economic centre of the barony. The castle has views across the <a href="Hope%20Valley%2C%20Derbyshire">Hope Valley</a> and <a href="Cave%20Dale">Cave Dale</a>.

<a href="William%20Peverel%20the%20Younger">William Peveril the Younger</a> inherited his father's estates, but in 1155 they were confiscated by King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry¬†II</a>. While in royal possession, Henry visited the castle in 1157, 1158, and 1164, the first time hosting King <a href="Malcolm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm¬†IV of Scotland</a>. During the <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%931174">Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174</a>, the castle's garrison was increased from a porter and two watchmen to a force led by 20 <a href="knight">knight</a>s shared with the castles of <a href="Bolsover%20Castle">Bolsover</a> and <a href="Nottingham%20Castle">Nottingham</a>. The <a href="Earl%20of%20Derby">Earls of Derby</a> had a claim to the Peveril family's estates through marriage, and in 1199 <a href="William%20de%20Ferrers%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">William de Ferrers</a>, the fourth earl, paid 2,000 <a href="mark%20%28money%29%23England%20and%20Scotland">marks</a> for the Peak lordship, although the castle remained under royal control. The closest Peveril Castle came to seeing battle was in 1216, when King John gave the castle to William de Ferrers, but the <a href="castellan">castellan</a> refused to relinquish control. Although they were both John's supporters, the king authorised the earl to use force to evict the castellan, who eventually capitulated, although there is no evidence that the castle was assaulted.

In 1223 the castle returned to the Crown. In the 13th century there were periods of building work at the castle, and by 1300 its final form had been established. Toward the end of the 14th century, the barony was granted to <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a>. Having little use for the castle, he ordered some of its material to be stripped out for re-use, marking the beginning of its decline. From the time of John of Gaunt to the present day, the castle has been owned and administered by the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a>. Peveril Castle became less important administratively, and by 1609 it was "very ruinous and serveth for no use". In the 19th century, Sir <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> featured the castle in his novel "<a href="Peveril%20of%20the%20Peak">Peveril of the Peak</a>". The site is situated in a <a href="National%20parks%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">national park</a>, and cared for by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>. Peveril Castle is protected as a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a> and a <a href="Grade%20I%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>.

Peveril Castle stands on a limestone outcrop overlooking the west end of <a href="Hope%20Valley%2C%20Derbyshire">Hope Valley</a>, in the midst of an ancient landscape. Overlooking the head of the valley, 2 km to the west, is <a href="Mam%20Tor">Mam Tor</a>, a <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>, and to the east at <a href="Brough-on-Noe">Brough-on-Noe</a> is the <a href="castra">Roman fort</a> of Navio. The valley formed a natural line of communication and had extra importance due to valuable mineral resources in the area, particularly lead.
The small <a href="Hope%20Castle%2C%20Derbyshire">Hope Castle</a> lay halfway along the valley. The castle's founder, <a href="William%20Peverel">William Peveril</a>, was a follower of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> and was rewarded for supporting him during the <a href="Norman%20Conquest">Norman Conquest</a>. The first mention of him in England records that in 1068 he was granted the new <a href="Nottingham%20Castle">castle at Nottingham</a> by William the Conqueror, who was in the process of subduing the Midlands and northern England. An unsubstantiated legend states that Peveril was William's illegitimate son. By the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086, Peveril had become a powerful landowner, with holdings in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The exact year he founded the castle is uncertain, although it must have been started by 1086 as it is recorded in the Domesday Book, one of 48¬†castles mentioned in the survey and the only one in Derbyshire. The castle was recorded as standing at "Pechesers" which has been translated as both "Peak's Tail" and "<a href="Peak%20Cavern">Peak's Arse</a>". Although the earliest Norman castles were usually built in timber, Peveril Castle seems to have been designed from outset to be built in stone.
William Peveril had custody of royal lands such as the district of <a href="Hope%2C%20Derbyshire">Hope</a>, and although he had his own estates, he relied on continued royal favour to maintain power in this way. In 1100 the new king, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry¬†I</a>, granted William "his <a href="demesne">demesne</a> in the Peak". Thus the Peak became an independent lordship under William Peveril's control, and the castle became an important centre of administration for the area, allowing the collection of taxes. Castleton benefited from the castle's new status and began to grow as the lordship's economic heart. William Peveril died in 1114 and was succeeded by his son, <a href="William%20Peverel%20the%20Younger">William Peveril the Younger</a>. In the civil war known as <a href="The%20Anarchy">The Anarchy</a> between King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a> and the <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>, Peveril backed the losing side and his fortunes suffered after his capture at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281141%29">Battle of Lincoln</a> in 1141. In 1153 Peveril was suspected of attempting to poison <a href="Ranulf%20de%20Gernon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester</a>. In 1153 the future King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry¬†II</a> accused Peveril of "plundering and treachery" and threatened to confiscate his estates and hand them over to the Earl of Chester. Two years later Henry, now king, followed through his threat. The Earl of Chester was dead by this time, and the king kept the property for himself. Once under royal control, Peveril became the administrative centre of the <a href="Forest%20of%20High%20Peak">Forest of High Peak</a>.

William Peveril the Younger died in 1155, and as his only male heir had predeceased him, the family's claim on the confiscated estates was taken up by the husband of William's daughter, <a href="Margaret%20Ferrers%2C%20Countess%20of%20Derby">Margaret Peveril</a>. Margaret had married <a href="Robert%20de%20Ferrers%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby</a>. King Henry II visited Peveril Castle three times during his reign. During the first visit, in 1157, he hosted King <a href="Malcolm%20IV%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm IV of Scotland</a> who paid homage to Henry after ceding <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> and <a href="Westmorland">Westmorland</a> to the English king. Henry II visited again in 1158 and 1164. When a group of barons led by Henry's sons <a href="Henry%20the%20Young%20King">Henry the Young King</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany</a>, and Prince <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard</a>, later Richard the Lionheart, took part in the <a href="Revolt%20of%201173%E2%80%931174">Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174</a> against the king's rule, the king spent ¬£116 on building work at Peveril and <a href="Bolsover%20Castle">Bolsover Castle</a>s in Derbyshire. The garrison was also increased. Previously Peveril was guarded by two watchmen and a porter, but this was expanded to a force led by 20 knights shared with Bolsover and Nottingham castles during the revolt. After the revolt ended in 1174, further steps were taken to improve Peveril Castle, and the <a href="Pipe%20Rolls">Pipe Rolls</a> (records of royal expenditure) show that between 1175 and 1177 ¬£184 was spent on building the keep. Building in stone was expensive, and though Peveril's keep was small, moderately-sized stone castles such as the contemporary <a href="Orford%20Castle">Orford</a> could cost thousands of pounds. Henry II's average income during his reign has been estimated to be around ¬£10,000 per year. As few documents have survived, it is uncertain when parts of the castle were built, and archaeological investigations have been unsuccessful in dating the stonework. Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by his son, Richard the Lionheart. Soon after his coronation, Richard granted the lordship of the Peak, including the castle, to his brother <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>. While Richard was on crusade, John rebelled and on his return Richard confiscated the lordship.

John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. <a href="William%20de%20Ferrers%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby</a> maintained the claim of the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000¬†<a href="Mark%20%28money%29%23England%20and%20Scotland">marks</a> (¬£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support in the face of country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan <a href="Brian%20de%20Lisle">Brian de Lisle</a> refused to hand them over. Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission to use force to retake the castles.

The situation was still chaotic when King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry¬†III</a> became king after his father's death in 1216. Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers' forces in 1217 after a siege, there is no indication that Peveril was assaulted, and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender. Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King Henry¬†III came of age. When the time came he was reluctant to hand over the property, and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223. Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive, they do not specify how the money was spent. As a result, it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work; however, Richard Eales, who wrote the 2006 <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> guidebook, suggests that there were two periods of building, when sums spent were larger than usual: ¬£54 in 1204‚Äì1207 and ¬£67 in 1210‚Äì1212. The medieval historian <a href="Sidney%20Painter">Sidney Painter</a> estimated that in about 1200 there were only seven magnates in England whose annual income exceeded ¬£400 and a knight could easily live on ¬£10 to ¬£20 per year.
The rest of the 13th century was relatively peaceful, and records show that Peveril Castle was maintained by the Crown. In 1235, in preparation for the king's visit, the north wall and bridge were repaired. After significant work in 1250‚Äì52 (¬£60 spent), 1272‚Äì1275 (¬£40) and 1288‚Äì1290 (¬£151), it is likely that the castle buildings were complete by 1300. King Henry gave Prince Edward (later King <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward¬†I</a>) Peveril Castle along with the <a href="County%20Palatine">County Palatine</a> of <a href="Chester">Chester</a> with the royal holdings in Wales and Ireland. Some of the lands, including Peveril, were made part of <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Castile">Eleanor of Castile</a>'s <a href="dower">dower</a>, to come into her possession should her husband, Prince Edward, die. At this time, the Peak lordship was worth around ¬£300 a year. At the outbreak of the Second Barons' War in 1264, Peveril Castle was occupied by <a href="Robert%20de%20Ferrers%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby</a>. <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a> pressured King Henry¬†III into giving him Peveril, although it was recovered by the Crown after De Montfort's death in 1265. The castle was returned to Eleanor's dower, and as she predeceased her husband the lordship returned into royal hands. Its income was used to provide for members of the royal family such as King <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward¬†II's</a> queen, <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella of France</a>, and their children, and royal favourites such as <a href="Piers%20Gaveston">Piers Gaveston</a>. In 1331 <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward¬†III</a> gave the lordship to his wife, <a href="Philippa%20of%20Hainault">Philippa of Hainault</a>. It was given to <a href="John%20de%20Warenne%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey</a>, in 1345. After its return to the Crown, the estate was given to <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>, Edward¬†III's third surviving son, partially in exchange for the <a href="Earl%20of%20Richmond">Earldom of Richmond</a>.

John of Gaunt's ownership marked the start of Peveril Castle's decline. He was the richest nobleman in England and held several castles. As Peveril Castle was relatively unimportant, John decided not to maintain it and in 1374 gave orders to strip the lead from the buildings for re-use at <a href="Pontefract%20Castle">Pontefract Castle</a>. It was inherited by his son <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry Bolingbroke</a>, later King Henry¬†IV, and remained under royal control, administered by the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lancaster">Duchy of Lancaster</a>. During the 15th century, Peveril became less important as administrative functions were moved elsewhere. Although other castles administered by the Duchy of Lancaster were repaired in 1480, there is no indication that this happened at Peveril. A survey conducted for the Duchy in 1561 revealed that Peveril was in a state of decay, and as a result, along with <a href="Donnington%20Castle">Donnington</a>, was one of two castles that were subsequently abandoned. The castle however hosted local courts until 1600. A survey in 1609 found that Peveril was "very ruinous and serveth for no use". At some point in the post-medieval period the keep's facing stone was removed from three sides. The steep slope prevented the removal of the stone from the fourth side. At one point, the castle was used to house animals.

With the advent of the railways in the 19th¬†century, the area became a tourist attraction. The Duchy of Lancaster undertook maintenance in the 19th¬†century to ensure the castle's condition did not deteriorate further, mostly by clearing rubble and adding mortar. Sir <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>'s 1823 novel "<a href="Peveril%20of%20the%20Peak">Peveril of the Peak</a>", set in the mid 17th century, described the castle ruins.

In 1932 the Duchy gave custody of the castle to the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a>, while retaining ownership. The site is today cared for by English Heritage, the successor to the Office of Works. The surrounding landscape has been protected as a <a href="National%20parks%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">national park</a> since 1951. The castle is a <a href="scheduled%20monument">scheduled monument</a>, which means it is a "nationally important" historic building and <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a> which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a <a href="Grade%20I%20listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a> (first listed in 1985), and recognised as an internationally important structure. It has been described as "perhaps the finest medieval landmark of the Peak District", and architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> remarked that it is "By far the most important castle in the county ‚Äì in fact the only one of importance". Before <a href="Duffield%20Castle%2C%20Derbyshire">Duffield Castle</a> in the south of the county was <a href="slighting">destroyed</a> in 1266 it had one of the largest <a href="keep">keep</a>s in England, though only the foundations survive.

Peveril Castle in Castleton is roughly triangular in shape, about , on top of a hill overlooking the Hope Valley. The land slopes steeply away from the castle's perimeter, forming an almost sheer face to the south east, and the winding approach from the north is the most practical way to the castle. Not only was the site naturally defensible, but its prominence would have allowed the castle to be a highly visible symbol of the builder's power. The town of Castleton provided supplies to the castle. It commands views of Hope Valley below and Treak Cliff, Mam Tor, Black Tor, and <a href="Lose%20Hill">Lose Hill</a>. The castle was entered through the <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a> to the east. Its design was simple, wide with a passage across. Little survives, although earlier drawings contain details of mouldings that suggest the structure was built in the 12th century, perhaps by Henry¬†II or King John.

The <a href="Curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain walls</a> enclosing the castle show the multiple phases of construction at Peveril, with stonework from the Norman period ‚Äì differentiated by the use of "<a href="opus%20spicatum">opus spicatum</a>" ‚Äì to modern repairs. The walls were surmounted by walkways, which next to the gatehouse would have stood about above the ground level immediately outside the castle. In the 12th century, a tower projecting less than was added to the north wall. In Eales' opinion, it "would have been of limited military value, compared with the boldly projecting towers of later castles" which allowed defenders to deploy flanking fire along the base of the walls. The land within the castle slopes downwards from west to east. Water storage would have been a concern for the garrison of the castle, but how they procured water is uncertain.
The southern curtain wall is a modern replacement along the line of the medieval wall. There are the remains of two round or semi-circular towers projecting from the wall. Enough of one tower survives that one can see the use of Roman tiles in the construction, probably from the fort of Navio away. It is uncertain when these towers were built, although it is thought they may date from the 13th century. Foundations mark the position of buildings abutting the south wall, probably the old hall and a chapel. A document from 1246 recorded a chapel at the castle; the remains of the easternmost building against the south wall are assumed to mark the site of the chapel, as they are oriented roughly east‚Äìwest. Foundations at the west end of the north wall mark a large building: probably a hall where the lord of the castle would have eaten and entertained high-status guests. It is unclear when the new hall was built, probably replacing the old hall in the south of the castle, although an "old hall" was mentioned in a document of 1251, implying there was also a new hall by that time. The kitchen and food stores would have stood at the east end of the hall, although little remains of those structures. Buildings were also constructed against the west curtain wall, probably high-status apartments. Although the main approach to Peveril Castle was from the north, there was also a gate in the west, reached via a bridge spanning the gorge and linking the castle with an enclosure on the other side. As it has not been excavated, the exact form the enclosure took is uncertain. Its purpose is also a matter of speculation, whether it was an elaborate outer bailey for defence or used for storage and stabling.

The keep occupies the southern corner of Peveril Castle. Construction probably began in around 1176, instigated by Henry¬†II. Its plan is square, measuring less than , and the parapet is above the keep's base; as the ground is uneven, on the other side it rises above ground level. It is smaller than contemporary royal keeps such as those at <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover</a> and <a href="Scarborough%20Castle">Scarborough</a> Castles. Today the exterior is coarse, but originally the facing would have been smooth; the south-east side, where the steep natural slope prevented removal of the facing stone, gives an idea of how it may once have appeared. A projection in the south-east face of the keep housed a <a href="garderobe">garderobe</a>. As was usual with Norman keeps, Peveril's was entered through the first floor and was accessed by a staircase. This entrance level would have been a large public room and the basement used for storage. A narrow staircase in the east corner allowed access to the basement and the wall walk around the top of the keep.

SMS "Prinzregent Luitpold" was the fifth and final vessel of the of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. "Prinzregent Luitpold"s keel was laid in October 1910 at the <a href="Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. She was launched on 17¬†February 1912 and was commissioned into the navy on 19¬†August 1913. The ship was equipped with ten guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of .

"Prinzregent Luitpold" was assigned to the III¬†Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for the majority of her career; in December 1916, she was transferred to the IV¬†Battle Squadron. Along with her four sister ships, , , , and , "Prinzregent Luitpold" participated in all of the major fleet operations of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War¬†I</a>, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31¬†May¬†‚Äì 1¬†June 1916. The ship was also involved in <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>, in late 1917.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> in November 1918, "Prinzregent Luitpold" and most of the <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied powers</a> negotiated the final version of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. On 21¬†June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered the fleet to be scuttled</a> to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. "Prinzregent Luitpold" was raised in July 1931 and subsequently <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap in 1933.

"Prinzregent Luitpold" was long <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a> and <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> a maximum of . She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. She had a crew of 41¬†officers and 1,043¬†enlisted men. "Prinzregent Luitpold" was powered by two sets of Parsons <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, supplied with steam by 14¬†coal-fired boilers. Unlike her four sisters, the ship was intended to use a <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel engine</a> on the center shaft, but this was not ready by the time work on the ship was completed. The engine was never installed, and so "Prinzregent Luitpold" was slightly slower than her sisters, which were equipped with a third turbine on the center shaft. The powerplant produced a top speed of . She carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of .

"Prinzregent Luitpold" was armed with a main battery of ten <a href="30.5%20cm%20SK%20L/50%20gun">30.5 cm SK L/50 gun</a>s in five twin turrets. The ship dispensed with the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, one forward and two of them arranged in a <a href="superfire">superfiring pair</a> aft. The other two turrets were placed <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23E">"en echelon"</a> amidships, such that both could fire on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The ship was also armed with fourteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/45">SK L/45 guns</a> in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s amidships, eight <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45 guns</a> in casemates and four 8.8¬†cm L/45 anti-aircraft guns. The ship's armament was rounded out by five torpedo tubes, all mounted in the hull; one was in the bow, and the other four were on the broadside.

Ordered under the contract name "Ersatz Odin" as a replacement for the obsolete <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> , "Prinzregent Luitpold" was laid down at the <a href="Howaldtswerke">Howaldtswerke</a> dockyard in <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> in October 1910. She was launched on 17¬†February 1912 and christened by <a href="Princess%20Theresa%20of%20Bavaria">Princess Theresa of Bavaria</a>; <a href="Ludwig%20III%20of%20Bavaria">Ludwig¬†III</a>, the last king of Bavaria and the son of the ship's namesake, <a href="Luitpold%2C%20Prince%20Regent%20of%20Bavaria">Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria</a>, gave a speech. After fitting-out work was completed, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 19¬†August 1913. "Prinzregent Luitpold" was equipped with facilities for a squadron commander, and became the flagship of the III¬†Battle Squadron upon commissioning.

Directly after commissioning, "Prinzregent Luitpold" took part in the annual autumn maneuvers, which followed the fleet cruise to Norway. The exercises lasted from 31¬†August to 9¬†September. Unit drills and individual ship training were conducted in October and November. In early 1914, "Prinzregent Luitpold" participated in additional ship and unit training. The annual spring maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea at the end of March. Further fleet exercises followed in April and May in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship went to <a href="Kiel%20Week">Kiel Week</a> that year. Despite the rising international tensions following the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination</a> of <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> on 28¬†June, the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> began its summer cruise to Norway on 13¬†July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25¬†July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's <a href="July%20Ultimatum">ultimatum to Serbia</a>. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off <a href="Cape%20Skadenes">Cape Skadenes</a> before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.

"Prinzregent Luitpold" was present during the first <a href="sortie">sortie</a> by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3¬†November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16¬†December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. He intended to use the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="I%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BScouting%20Group">I¬†Scouting Group</a> to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15¬†December the fleet left port to <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a>. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding "Prinzregent Luitpold" and her four <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a>‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Kaiser Wilhelm¬†II</a> to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany.

"Prinzregent Luitpold" went into the Baltic for squadron training from 23¬†to 29¬†January 1916. While on the maneuvers, the newer battleship became the III¬†Squadron flagship. Vice Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a>, the commander of III¬†Squadron, lowered his flag on 24¬†January and transferred it to "K√∂nig". The Kaiser removed von Ingenohl from his post on 2¬†February, following the loss of the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> the month before. Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> succeeded him as the commander of the fleet. Pohl continued the policy of sweeps into the North Sea to destroy isolated British formations. On 24¬†April, "Prinzregent Luitpold" ran aground in the <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20Canal">Kaiser Wilhelm Canal</a>, though she was freed without causing significant damage. A series of advances into the North Sea were conducted throughout the rest of 1915; "Prinzregent Luitpold" was present for the sweeps on 17‚Äì18 May, 29‚Äì30 May, 10¬†August, 11‚Äì12 September, and 23‚Äì24 October. The III¬†Squadron completed the year with another round of unit training in the Baltic on 5‚Äì20 December.

Pohl's tenure as fleet commander was brief; by January 1916 <a href="hepatic%20cancer">hepatic cancer</a> had weakened him to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties. He was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5‚Äì7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the <a href="Hoofden">Hoofden</a>. "Prinzregent Luitpold" was also present during an advance to the <a href="Amrun%20Bank">Amrun Bank</a> on 2‚Äì3 April. Another sortie was conducted on 21‚Äì22 April.

"Prinzregent Luitpold" was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> which took place on 31¬†May and 1¬†June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, "Prinzregent Luitpold" was the third ship in the VI¬†Division of III¬†Squadron and the seventh ship in the line, directly astern of and ahead of . The VI¬†Division was behind only the V¬†Division, consisting of the four s. The eight - and s of the I¬†and II¬†Divisions in I¬†Squadron followed the VI¬†Division. The six elderly <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>s of the III¬†and IV¬†Divisions in II¬†Battle Squadron formed the rear of the formation.

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I¬†Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, "K√∂nig", spotted both the I¬†Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">two-point</a> turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.

"Prinzregent Luitpold" engaged the nearest target her gunners could make out, one of the s, at a range of some , though her shots fell short. Beatty's ships increased speed and at 17:51 veered away to further increase the distance to the III¬†Squadron battleships. At 18:08, "Prinzregent Luitpold" shifted her fire to the battleship at a range of , though without any success. By 18:38, "Malaya" disappeared in the haze and "Prinzregent Luitpold" was forced to cease fire. The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, lay directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. "Prinzregent Luitpold" and her three sisters destroyed "Nomad" with their secondary guns while the I¬†Squadron battleships dispatched "Nestor". At around 19:00, the German battle line came into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; "Prinzregent Luitpold" fired two salvos from her main battery at an unidentified four-funneled cruiser at 19:03 but made no hits.

Shortly after 19:00, the German cruiser had become disabled by a shell from the British battlecruiser ; Rear Admiral <a href="Paul%20Behncke">Paul Behncke</a> in "K√∂nig" attempted to maneuver the III¬†Squadron to cover the stricken cruiser. Simultaneously, the British 3rd and 4th Light Cruiser Squadrons began a torpedo attack on the German line; while advancing to torpedo range, they smothered "Wiesbaden" with fire from their main guns. The eight III¬†Squadron battleships fired on the British cruisers, but even sustained fire from the battleships' main guns failed to drive off the British cruisers. The armored cruisers , , and joined in the attack on the crippled "Wiesbaden". Between 19:14 and 19:17, several German battleships and battlecruisers opened fire on "Defence" and "Warrior". Instead of joining the fire on the much closer cruisers, "Prinzregent Luitpold" engaged the leading battleships of the British line, firing a total of 21¬†salvos. The gunners reported ranges of , though this was an overestimation that caused the ship's salvos to fall past their intended target.

By 20:00, the German line was ordered to complete a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. "Kaiserin" had come too close to "Prinzregent Luitpold" and was forced to haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. "Prinzregent Luitpold" came up alongside "Kaiserin" at high speed, which forced "Kaiserin" to remain out of line temporarily. The turn reversed the order of the German line; "Prinzregent Luitpold" was now the eighth ship from the rear of the German line, leading the III¬†Squadron. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night-cruising formation. "Kaiserin" was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.

After a series of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> by 04:00 on 1¬†June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I¬†Squadron battleships took up defensive positions in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a>, and "Prinzregent Luitpold", "Kaiserin", "Kaiser", and stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In the course of the battle, "Prinzregent Luitpold" fired one-hundred and sixty-nine 30.5¬†cm shells and one-hundred and six 15¬†cm rounds. She and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed.

In early August, "Prinzregent Luitpold" and the rest of the operational III¬†Squadron units conducted divisional training in the Baltic. On 18¬†August, Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31¬†May operation; the two serviceable German battlecruisers‚Äî and ‚Äîsupported by three dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including "Prinzregent Luitpold", would trail behind and provide cover. During the operation, "Prinzregent Luitpold" carried the Commander of <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

Another fleet advance followed on 18‚Äì20¬†October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4¬†November, "Prinzregent Luitpold" took part in an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats‚Äî and ‚Äîthat had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1¬†December; the four "K√∂nig"-class battleships remained in III¬†Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five "Kaiser"-class ships, including "Prinzregent Luitpold", were transferred to IV¬†Squadron. "Prinzregent Luitpold" became the flagship of the new squadron. In the Wilhelmshaven Roads on 20¬†January 1917, the ship struck a steel <a href="hawser">hawser</a> that became entangled in the ship's starboard propeller. In March, "Friedrich der Grosse" was replaced as the fleet flagship by the newly commissioned battleship . "Friedrich der Grosse" in turn replaced "Prinzregent Luitpold" as the flagship of IV¬†Squadron. Steadily decreasing morale and discontent with rations provoked a series of small mutinies in the fleet. On 6¬†June and 19¬†July, stokers protested the low quality of the food they were given, and on 2¬†August, some 800¬†men went on a hunger strike. The ship's officers relented and agreed to form a "Menagekommission", a council that gave the enlisted men a voice in their ration selection and preparation. One of the ringleaders of the protests, however, was arrested and executed on 5¬†September.

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>. The "Admiralstab" (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic island of <a href="Saaremaa">√ñsel</a>, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the <a href="S%C3%B5rve%20Peninsula">Sworbe Peninsula</a>. On 18¬†September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and <a href="Muhu">Moon</a> Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, "Moltke", along with the III¬†and IV¬†Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300¬†ships, supported by over 100¬†aircraft and six zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600¬†officers and enlisted men. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian pre-dreadnoughts and , the armored cruisers , , and , 26¬†destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on √ñsel numbered some 14,000¬†men.

The operation began on the morning of 12¬†October, when "Moltke" and the III¬†Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while "Prinzregent Luitpold" and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the <a href="Sworbe%20Peninsula">Sworbe Peninsula</a> on √ñsel. "Prinzregent Luitpold", along with "Kaiser" and "Kaiserin", were tasked with silencing the Russian guns at <a href="Hundsort">Hundsort</a> which had taken "Moltke" under fire. The ships opened fire at 05:44, and by 07:45, Russian firing had ceased and German troops were moving ashore. Two days later, Vice Admiral <a href="Wilhelm%20Souchon">Wilhelm Souchon</a> left Tagga Bay with "Prinzregent Luitpold", "Friedrich der Grosse", and "Kaiserin" to support German ground forces advancing on the Sworbe Peninsula. By 20¬†October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, √ñsel, and Dag√∂ were in German possession. The previous day, the "Admiralstab" had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the 24th, "Prinzregent Luitpold" was detached from the task force and returned to Kiel.

After arriving in Kiel, "Prinzregent Luitpold" went into drydock for periodic maintenance, from which she emerged on 21¬†December. She then proceeded on to Wilhelmshaven, where she resumed guard duty in the Bight. On 17¬†March 1918, the ship steamed to the Baltic for training exercises, and the following day the battlecruiser rammed her outside Kiel. The accident caused no serious damage, however. The ship participated in the fruitless advance to Norway on 23‚Äì25¬†April 1918, after which she resumed guard duties in the German Bight.

"Prinzregent Luitpold" and her four sisters were to have taken part in a <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">final fleet action</a> at the end of October 1918, days before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the <a href="Grand%20Admiral">Grand Admiral</a> ("Gro√üadmiral") of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29¬†October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of¬†29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated "I no longer have a navy".

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, was interned in the British naval base in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral <a href="Adolf%20von%20Trotha">Adolf von Trotha</a> made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any circumstances. The fleet rendezvoused with the British <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370¬†British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their <a href="Breech%20mechanism">breech blocks</a>, and their crews were reduced to 200¬†officers and men per ship.

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21¬†June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered the ships to be sunk</a> at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21¬†June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. "Prinzregent Luitpold" sank at 13:30; she was subsequently raised on 9¬†July 1931 and broken up by 1933 in <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>, as with several other vessels, upside-down having capsized in the scuttling.

SMS K√∂nig Albert

SMS "K√∂nig Albert" was the fourth vessel of the of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. "K√∂nig Albert"s keel was laid on 17 July 1910 at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> dockyard in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>. She was launched on 27 April 1912 and was commissioned into the fleet on 31 July 1913. The ship was equipped with ten guns in five twin turrets, and had a top speed of . "K√∂nig Albert" was assigned to the III Battle Squadron and later the IV Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for the majority of her career, including <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Along with her four <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, , , , and , "K√∂nig Albert" participated in most of the major fleet operations of World War I, though she was in drydock for maintenance during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> between 31 May and 1 June 1916. As a result, she was the only battleship actively serving with the fleet that missed the largest naval battle of the war. The ship was also involved in <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>, an amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>, in late 1917.

After Germany's defeat in the war and the signing of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> in November 1918, "K√∂nig Albert" and most of the <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. The ships were disarmed and reduced to skeleton crews while the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied powers</a> negotiated the final version of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered the fleet to be scuttled</a> to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. "K√∂nig Albert" was raised in July 1935 and subsequently <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap in 1936.

Ordered under the contract name "Ersatz √Ñgir" as a replacement for the obsolete <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> , "K√∂nig Albert" was laid down at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> dockyard in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> on 17 July 1910. She was launched on 27 April 1912; <a href="Princess%20Mathilde%20of%20Saxony%20%281863%E2%80%931933%29">Princess Mathilde of Saxony</a> christened the ship, and her brother, the last king of Saxony, <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20III%20of%20Saxony">Friedrich August III</a> gave the speech. Following the completion of fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 31 July 1913.

The ship was long <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a> and <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> a maximum of . She had a beam of and a draft of forward and aft. "K√∂nig Albert" was powered by three sets of Schichau <a href="turbine">turbine</a>s, supplied with steam by 16 coal-fired <a href="water-tube%20boiler">boilers</a>. The powerplant produced a top speed of . She carried of coal, which enabled a maximum range of at a cruising speed of . She had a crew of 41¬†officers and 1,043¬†enlisted.

"K√∂nig Albert" was armed with a main battery of ten <a href="30.5%20cm%20SK%20L/50%20gun">30.5 cm SK L/50 gun</a>s in five twin <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a>. The ship disposed of the inefficient hexagonal turret arrangement of previous German battleships; instead, three of the five turrets were mounted on the centerline, with two of them arranged in a <a href="superfire">superfiring pair</a> aft. The other two turrets were placed <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23E">"en echelon"</a> amidships, such that both could fire on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. The ship was also armed with fourteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/45">SK L/45 guns</a> in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s amidships, eight <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45 guns</a> in casemates and four 8.8¬†cm L/45 <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s. The ship's armament was rounded out by five <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, all mounted in the hull.

Although "K√∂nig Albert" was the last ship in her class to be launched, she was the third to be commissioned, owing to turbine damage on and delays on 's diesel engine. The ship was selected to form part of the special Detached Division, alongside her sister and the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> . The Division was placed under the command of "Konteradmiral" (Rear Admiral) von Rebeur Paschwitz and sent on a tour of South America, with the goals of testing the new turbine propulsion system and representing the growing power of the Imperial Navy. The three ships left <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 9 December 1913 and steamed for <a href="German%20West%20Africa">German West Africa</a>, where they made several stops, including <a href="Lom%C3%A9">Lom√©</a>, Togo, and <a href="Limbe%2C%20Cameroon">Victoria</a> and <a href="Douala">Duala</a>, <a href="Kamerun">Kamerun</a>. The Division then proceeded to <a href="German%20South-West%20Africa">German South-West Africa</a>, making stops in <a href="Swakopmund">Swakopmund</a> and <a href="L%C3%BCderitzbucht">L√ºderitzbucht</a>, and South Africa, stopping in <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> en route. On 15 February 1914, the Division reached <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, which ceremonially greeted the visiting German warships.

From Rio de Janeiro, "Strassburg" went to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina, while "K√∂nig Albert" and "Kaiser" steamed to <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, Uruguay. "Strassburg" then rejoined the battleships in Montevideo, and all three then rounded <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> and steamed to <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valpara√≠so</a>, Chile. Between 2 and 11 April they remained in Valparaiso, which marked the furthest point of their journey. On the return voyage, the three ships made additional stops, including in <a href="Bah%C3%ADa%20Blanca">Bah√≠a Blanca</a>, Argentina, before returning to Rio de Janeiro. The Division then began the trip back to Germany, stopping in <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>, <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, and <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>. The ships reached <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> on 17 June 1914, after having traveled some without incident. On 24 June, the Detached Division was dissolved, and "K√∂nig Albert" and "Kaiser" joined their classmates in the III Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>.

Throughout the first two years of the war, the High Seas Fleet, including "K√∂nig Albert", conducted a number of sweeps and advances into the North Sea. The first occurred on 2‚Äì3 November 1914, though no British forces were encountered. Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, adopted a strategy in which the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> raided British coastal towns to lure out portions of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a> where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. The <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a> on 15‚Äì16 December 1914 was the first such operation. On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding "K√∂nig Albert" and her four <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a>‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire British Grand Fleet. Under orders from <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned back toward Germany.

Following the loss of at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Admiral von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> replaced him as commander of the fleet. Admiral von Pohl conducted a series of fleet advances in 1915 in which "K√∂nig Albert" took part; in the first one on 29‚Äì30 March, the fleet steamed out to the north of <a href="Terschelling">Terschelling</a> and returned without incident. Another followed on 17‚Äì18 April, where "K√∂nig Albert" and the rest of the fleet covered a mining operation by the II Scouting Group. Three days later, on 21‚Äì22 April, the High Seas Fleet advanced toward the <a href="Dogger%20Bank">Dogger Bank</a>, though again failed to meet any British forces. On 15 May, a <a href="Bushing%20%28bearing%29%23Bushing">bushing</a> came loose in the ship's starboard turbine, which forced the crew to turn the engine off and <a href="wikt%3Adecouple">decouple</a> it. The center and port side shafts were still capable of propelling the ship at , however. On 29‚Äì30 May, the fleet attempted to conduct a sweep in the North Sea, but inclement weather forced Pohl to cancel the operation some off <a href="Schiermonnikoog">Schiermonnikoog</a>. The fleet remained in port until 10 August, when it sortied to <a href="Helgoland">Helgoland</a> to cover the return of the <a href="auxiliary%20cruiser">auxiliary cruiser</a> . A month later, on 11‚Äì12 September, the fleet covered another mine-laying operation off the <a href="Swarte%20Bank">Swarte Bank</a>. The last operation of the year, conducted on 23‚Äì24 October, was an advance in the direction of <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> which concluded without result.

On 11 January 1916, Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> replaced the ailing von Pohl, who was suffering from liver cancer. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. The first of Scheer's operations was conducted the following month, on 5‚Äì7 March, with an uneventful sweep of the <a href="Hoofden">Hoofden</a>. On 25‚Äì26 March, Scheer attempted to attack British forces that had raided <a href="Tondern">Tondern</a>, but failed to locate them. Another advance to Horns Reef followed on 21‚Äì22 April. On 24 April, the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of the I Scouting Group conducted a <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">raid on the English coast</a>. "K√∂nig Albert" and the rest of the fleet sailed in distant support. The battlecruiser struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a>. A short artillery duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the I¬†Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.

After the raid on Yarmouth, several of the III Squadron battleships developed problems with their condensers. This included "K√∂nig Albert"; tubing needed to be replaced in all three main condensers, which necessitated extensive dockyard work. The ship went into drydock in the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Wilhelmshaven">Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven</a> on 29 May, two days before the rest of the fleet departed for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>. Work on the ship was not completed until 15 June, and as a result, "K√∂nig Albert" was the only German dreadnought in active service to miss the battle. On 18 August 1916, "K√∂nig Albert" took part in an operation to bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a>. Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the original 31 May plan: the two serviceable German battlecruisers‚Äî and ‚Äîaugmented by three faster dreadnoughts, were to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty's</a> battlecruisers. Scheer would trail behind with the rest of the fleet and provide support. Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

Another fleet operation took place on 18‚Äì19 October, though it ended without encountering any British units. Unit training in the Baltic was then conducted, and on the return voyage the III Squadron was diverted to assist in the recovery of a pair of <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s stranded on the Danish coast. The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four "K√∂nig"-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five "Kaiser"-class ships, including "K√∂nig Albert", were transferred to IV Squadron. "K√∂nig Albert" saw no major operations in the first half of 1917, and on 18 August she went into drydock at the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">Imperial Dockyard in Kiel</a> for periodic maintenance, which lasted until 23 September.

In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, the German naval command decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>. On 18 September, the "Admiralstab" (the Navy High Command) issued the order for a joint operation with the army to capture <a href="Saaremaa">√ñsel</a> and <a href="Muhu">Moon</a> Islands. The naval component, organized as a Special Unit ("Sonderverband"), was to comprise the flagship, "Moltke", along with the III and IV¬†Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet. Along with nine light cruisers, three torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of <a href="naval%20mine">mine</a> warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, supported by over 100 aircraft and six zeppelins. Opposing the Germans were the old Russian <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>s and , the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s , , and , 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on √ñsel numbered some 14,000 men.

The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when "Moltke" and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while "K√∂nig Albert" and the rest of IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the <a href="S%C3%B5rve%20Peninsula">Sworbe Peninsula</a> on √ñsel. The coastal artillery in both locations were quickly silenced by the battleships' heavy guns. On the morning of the 14th, "K√∂nig Albert", "Friedrich der Grosse", and "Kaiserin" were detached to support German troops advancing toward <a href="Ansek%C3%BCll">Ansek√ºll</a>. "K√∂nig Albert" and "Kaiserin" were assigned to suppress a Russian battery at <a href="Zerel">Zerel</a>, though heavy fog delayed them from engaging the target. The Russians opened fire first, which was quickly returned by the two ships. "Friedrich der Grosse" came to the two ships' assistance and the three battleships fired a total of 120 large-caliber shells at the battery at Zerel over the span of an hour. The battleships' gunfire prompted most of the Russian gun crews to flee their posts.

On the night of 15 October, "K√∂nig Albert" and "Kaiserin" were sent to replenish their coal stocks in <a href="Putzig">Putzig</a>. On the 19th, they were briefly joined in Putzig by "Friedrich der Grosse", which continued on to <a href="Kuressaare">Arensburg</a> with "Moltke". The next morning, Vice Admiral Schmidt ordered the special naval unit to be dissolved; in a communique to the naval headquarters, Schmidt noted that ""Kaiserin" and "K√∂nig Albert" can immediately be detached from Putzig to the North Sea." The two ships then proceeded to Kiel via Danzig, where they transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal back to the North Sea. After returning to the North Sea on 23 October, "K√∂nig Albert" served as the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> for a force of heavy ships, including "Kaiserin", , , and the battlecruiser , supporting a mine-sweeping operation in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. Afterward she resumed guard duty in the Bight.

"K√∂nig Albert" and her four sisters were to have taken part in a <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">final fleet action</a> at the end of October 1918, days before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the <a href="Grand%20Admiral">Grand Admiral</a> ("Gro√üadmiral") of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>. The ship remained on picket duty in the Bight until 10 November. This kept her away from the mutinous vessels, until she returned to port and her crew joined the mutiny. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated "I no longer have a navy."

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, were interned in the British naval base in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral <a href="Adolf%20von%20Trotha">Adolf von Trotha</a> made it clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. This consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men.

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">ordered the ships to be sunk</a> at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. "K√∂nig Albert" capsized and sank at 12:54. On 31 July 1935, the ship was raised and broken up for scrap over the following year in <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a>.

Golding Bird

Golding Bird (9 December 1814¬†‚Äì 27 October 1854) was a British <a href="medical%20doctor">medical doctor</a> and a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</a>. He became a great authority on <a href="kidney%20disease">kidney disease</a>s and published a comprehensive paper on <a href="urolithiasis">urinary deposits</a> in 1844. He was also notable for his work in related sciences, especially the medical uses of electricity and <a href="electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a>. From 1836, he lectured at <a href="Guy%27s%20Hospital">Guy's Hospital</a>, a well-known teaching hospital in London and now part of <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a>, and published a popular textbook on science for medical students called "Elements of Natural Philosophy".

Having developed an interest in chemistry while still a child, largely through self-study, Bird was far enough advanced to deliver lectures to his fellow pupils at school. He later applied this knowledge to medicine and did much research on the chemistry of urine and of <a href="kidney%20stones">kidney stones</a>. In 1842, he was the first to describe <a href="oxaluria">oxaluria</a>, a condition which leads to the formation of a particular kind of stone.

Bird, who was a member of the <a href="London%20Electrical%20Society">London Electrical Society</a>, was innovative in the field of the medical use of electricity, designing much of his own equipment. In his time, electrical treatment had acquired a bad name in the medical profession through its widespread use by <a href="Quackery">quack</a> practitioners. Bird made efforts to oppose this quackery, and was instrumental in bringing medical <a href="electrotherapy">electrotherapy</a> into the mainstream. He was quick to adopt new instruments of all kinds; he invented a new variant of the <a href="Daniell%20cell">Daniell cell</a> in 1837 and made important discoveries in <a href="electrometallurgy">electrometallurgy</a> with it. He was not only innovative in the electrical field, but he also designed a flexible <a href="stethoscope">stethoscope</a>, and in 1840 published the first description of such an instrument.

A devout Christian, Bird believed Bible study and prayer were just as important to medical students as their academic studies. He endeavoured to promote Christianity among medical students and encouraged other professionals to do likewise. To this end, Bird was responsible for the founding of the <a href="Christian%20Medical%20Association%20%281854%29">Christian Medical Association</a>, although it did not become active until after his death. Bird had lifelong poor health and died at the age of 39.

Bird was born in <a href="Downham">Downham</a>, Norfolk, England, on 9 December 1814. His father (also named Golding Bird) had been an officer in the <a href="Inland%20Revenue">Inland Revenue</a> in Ireland, and his mother, Marrianne, was Irish. He was precocious and ambitious, but childhood <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a> and <a href="endocarditis">endocarditis</a> left him with poor posture and lifelong frail health. He received a <a href="Classical%20education%20movement">classical education</a> when he was sent with his brother Frederic to stay with a clergyman in <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Berkshire">Wallingford</a>, where he developed a lifelong habit of self-study. From the age of 12, he was educated in London, at a private school that did not promote science and provided only a classical education. Bird, who seems to have been far ahead of his teachers in science, gave lectures in chemistry and botany to his fellow pupils. He had four younger siblings, of whom his brother Frederic also became a physician and published on botany.

In 1829, when he was 14, Bird left school to serve an <a href="apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a> with the <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a> William Pretty in Burton Crescent, London. He completed it in 1833 and was licensed to practise by the <a href="Worshipful%20Society%20of%20Apothecaries">Worshipful Society of Apothecaries</a> at Apothecaries' Hall in 1836. He received this licence without examination because of the reputation he had gained as a student at Guy's, the London teaching hospital where he had become a medical student in 1832 while still working at his apprenticeship. At Guy's he was influenced by <a href="Thomas%20Addison">Thomas Addison</a>, who recognised his talents early on. Bird was an ambitious and very capable student. Early in his career he became a Fellow of the Senior Physical Society, for which a thesis was required. He received prizes for medicine, <a href="obstetrics">obstetrics</a>, and <a href="ophthalmic%20surgery">ophthalmic surgery</a> at Guy's and the silver medal for botany at Apothecaries' Hall. Around 1839 to 1840, he worked on breast disease at Guy's as an assistant to Sir <a href="Astley%20Cooper">Astley Cooper</a>.

Bird graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20St%20Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> with an <a href="Doctor%20of%20Medicine">MD</a> in 1838 and an <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Scotland%29">MA</a> in 1840 while continuing to work in London. St Andrews required no residence or examination for the MD. Bird obtained his degree by submitting testimonials from qualified colleagues, which was common practice at the time. Once qualified in 1838, at the age of 23, he entered <a href="general%20practice">general practice</a> with a surgery at 44 Seymour Street, Euston Square, London, but was unsuccessful at first because of his youth. In the same year, however, he became physician to the <a href="Finsbury%20Dispensary">Finsbury Dispensary</a>, a post he held for five years. By 1842, he had an income of ¬£1000 a year from his private practice. Adjusted for inflation, this amounts to a spending power of about ¬£ now. At the end of his career, his income was just under ¬£6000. He became a <a href="Licentiate%20%28degree%29">licentiate</a> of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Physicians">Royal College of Physicians</a> in 1840, and a <a href="fellow">fellow</a> in 1845.
Bird lectured on <a href="natural%20philosophy">natural philosophy</a>, <a href="medical%20botany">medical botany</a> and <a href="urinary%20pathology">urinary pathology</a> from 1836 to 1853 at Guy's. He lectured on "<a href="materia%20medica">materia medica</a>" at Guy's from 1843 to 1853 and at the Royal College of Physicians from 1847 to 1849. He also lectured at the <a href="Aldersgate%20School%20of%20Medicine">Aldersgate School of Medicine</a>. Throughout his career, he published extensively, not only on medical matters, but also on electrical science and chemistry.

Bird became the first head of the electricity and <a href="galvanism">galvanism</a> department at Guy's in 1836, under the supervision of Addison, since Bird did not graduate until 1838. In 1843, he was appointed assistant physician at Guy's, a position for which he had lobbied hard, and in October that year he was put in charge of the children's <a href="outpatient">outpatient</a>s ward. Like his electrotherapy patients, the children were largely <a href="poor%20relief">poor relief</a> cases who could not afford to pay for medical treatment and were much used for the training of medical students. It was generally accepted at this time that poor relief cases could be used for experimental treatment, and their permission was not required. Bird published in the hospital journal a series of reports on childhood diseases, based on case studies from this work.

Marrying Mary Ann Brett in 1842, Bird moved from his family home at Wilmington Square, <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>, to 19 Myddleton Square. They had two daughters and three sons, the second of whom, <a href="Cuthbert%20Hilton%20Golding-Bird">Cuthbert Hilton Golding-Bird</a> (1848‚Äì1939), became a notable surgeon. Another son, Percival Golding-Bird, became a priest in Rotherhithe,

Bird was a Fellow of the <a href="Linnean%20Society%20of%20London">Linnaean Society</a> (elected 1836), the <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20London">Geological Society</a> (elected 1836) and the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> (elected 1846). He joined the <a href="Pathological%20Society%20of%20London">Pathological Society of London</a> (which eventually merged into the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Medicine">Royal Society of Medicine</a>) when it was formed in 1846. He also belonged to the <a href="London%20Electrical%20Society">London Electrical Society</a> founded by <a href="William%20Sturgeon">William Sturgeon</a> and others. This body was very unlike the elite scholarly institutions; it was more like a <a href="craft%20guild">craft guild</a> with a penchant for spectacular demonstrations. Nevertheless, it had some notable members, and new machines and apparatus were regularly discussed and demonstrated. Bird was also a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a> from 1841 and was the <a href="Worshipful%20Master">Worshipful Master</a> of the St Paul's lodge in 1850. He left the Freemasons in 1853.

Bird was vain, with a tendency to self-promotion, and his driving ambition occasionally led him into conflict with others. He was involved in a number of very public disputes in contemporary medical journals, including the <a href="%23Pulvermacher%20controversy">dispute with the Pulvermacher Company</a> and a <a href="%23Flexible%20stethoscope">dispute over the development of the stethoscope</a>. However, he was said to give his patients his undivided attention and a complete commitment to their welfare. He was a fine speaker, a good lecturer and an eloquent debater.

Diagnosed with heart disease by his brother in 1848 or 1849, Bird was forced to stop work. By 1850, however, he was again working as hard as ever and had extended his practice so much that he needed to move to a larger house in Russell Square. But in 1851, acute <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a> led Bird to take an extended holiday with his wife in <a href="Tenby">Tenby</a>, where he pursued investigations in botany, marine fauna and cave life as pastimes. These long summer breaks were repeated in 1852 and 1853 at <a href="Torquay">Torquay</a> and Tenby. Even on holiday, his fame caused him to receive many requests for consultations. In 1853, he purchased an estate, St Cuthbert, for his retirement in <a href="Royal%20Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>, but it needed some work, and he could not leave London until June 1854. Meanwhile, he continued to see patients, but only in his house, despite seriously deteriorating health. He died on 27 October 1854 at St Cuthbert from a <a href="urinary%20tract%20infection">urinary tract infection</a> and suffering from <a href="kidney%20stone">kidney stone</a>s. His early death at 39 may have been due to a combination of lifelong frail health and overwork, which Bird himself knew to be destroying him. He is buried in Woodbury Park Cemetery, Tunbridge Wells.

After his death, Mary instituted the Golding Bird Gold Medal and Scholarship for sanitary science, later named the Golding Bird Gold Medal and Scholarship for bacteriology, which was awarded annually at Guy's teaching hospital. The prize was instituted in 1887 and was still being awarded in 1983, although it is no longer a current prize. From 1934 onwards, a Golding Bird Gold Medal and Scholarship was also awarded for obstetrics and <a href="gynaecology">gynaecology</a>.
Among the notable recipients of the medal were <a href="Nathaniel%20Burnett%20Ham">Nathaniel Ham</a> (1896), <a href="Alfred%20Salter">Alfred Salter</a> (1897), <a href="Russell%20Brock%2C%20Baron%20Brock">Russell Brock</a> (1926), <a href="Alan%20John%20Beale">John Beale</a> (1945), and <a href="D.%20Bernard%20Amos">D. Bernard Amos</a> ("circa" 1947‚Äì1951).

The collateral sciences are those sciences that have an important role in medicine but do not form part of medicine themselves, especially physics, chemistry, and botany (because botany is a rich source of drugs and poisons). Until the end of the first half of the 19th century, chemical analysis was rarely used in medical diagnosis¬†‚Äì there was even hostility to the idea in some quarters. Most of the work in this area at that time was carried out by researchers associated with Guy's.

By the time Golding Bird was a medical student at Guy's, the hospital already had a tradition of studying physics and chemistry as they related to medicine. Bird followed this tradition and was particularly influenced by the work of <a href="William%20Prout">William Prout</a>, an expert in chemical physiology. Bird became well known for his knowledge of chemistry. An early example dates from 1832, when he commented on a paper on the <a href="copper%20sulphate">copper sulphate</a> test for <a href="arsenic%20poisoning">arsenic poisoning</a>, delivered by his future brother-in-law R. H. Brett to the Pupils' Physical Society. Bird criticised the test's positive result when a green precipitate is formed, claiming the test was inconclusive because precipitates other than <a href="copper%20arsenite">copper arsenite</a> can produce the same green colour.

Bird did not limit himself to challenging his future brother-in-law. In 1834, Bird and Brett published a paper on the analysis of blood serum and urine, in which they argued against some work by Prout. Prout had said (in 1819) that the pink sediment in urine was due to the presence of <a href="ammonium%20purpurate">ammonium purpurate</a>, but Bird's tests failed to verify this. Though Bird was still only a student and Prout held great authority, Prout felt it necessary to reply to the challenge. In 1843, Bird tried to identify the pink compound; he failed, but was convinced it was a new chemical and gave it the name "purpurine". This name did not stick, however, and the compound became known as <a href="uroerythrin">uroerythrin</a> from the work of <a href="Franz%20Simon%20%28chemist%29">Franz Simon</a>. Its structure was finally identified only in 1975.

Around 1839, recognising Bird's abilities in chemistry, Astley Cooper asked him to contribute to his book on breast disease. Bird wrote a piece on the chemistry of milk, and the book was published in 1840. Although the book is primarily about human anatomy, it includes a chapter on <a href="comparative%20anatomy">comparative anatomy</a> covering several species, for which Bird carried out an analysis of dog and porpoise milk. Also in 1839, Bird published his own "Elements of Natural Philosophy", a textbook on physics for medical students. Taking the view that existing texts were too mathematical for medical students, Bird avoided such material in favour of clear explanations. The book proved popular and remained in print for 30 years, although some of its mathematical shortcomings were made good in the fourth edition by <a href="Charles%20Brooke%20%28surgeon%29">Charles Brooke</a>.

In 1836, Bird was put in charge of the newly formed department of electricity and galvanism under the supervision of Addison. While this was not the first hospital to employ electrotherapy, it was still considered very experimental. Previous hospital uses had either been short-lived or based on the whim of a single surgeon, such as John Birch at <a href="St%20Thomas%27%20Hospital">St Thomas' Hospital</a>. At Guy's, the treatment was part of the hospital system and became well-known to the public, so much so that Guy's was parodied for its use of electricity in the "New Frankenstein" satirical magazine.

In his electrotherapy, Bird used both <a href="electrochemical">electrochemical</a> and <a href="electrostatic">electrostatic</a> machines (and later also <a href="electromagnetic%20induction">electromagnetic induction</a> machines) to treat a very wide range of conditions, such as some forms of <a href="Choreia%20%28disease%29">chorea</a>. Treatments included peripheral nerve stimulation, <a href="electrical%20muscle%20stimulation">electrical muscle stimulation</a> and <a href="electric%20shock%20therapy">electric shock therapy</a>. Bird also used his invention, the <a href="%23Electric%20moxa">electric moxa</a>, to heal <a href="skin%20ulcer">skin ulcer</a>s.

It was already clear from the work of <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> that electricity and galvanism were essentially the same. Bird realised this, but continued to divide his apparatus into electrical machines, which (according to him) delivered a high voltage at low current, and galvanic apparatus, which delivered a high current at low voltage. The galvanic equipment available to Bird included <a href="electrochemical%20cell">electrochemical cell</a>s such as the <a href="voltaic%20pile">voltaic pile</a> and the <a href="Daniell%20cell">Daniell cell</a>, a variant of which Bird devised himself. Also part of the standard equipment were <a href="induction%20coil">induction coil</a>s which, together with an interrupter circuit, were used with one of the electrochemical cells to deliver an electric shock. The electrical (as opposed to galvanic) machines then available were friction-operated <a href="electrostatic%20generator">electrostatic generator</a>s consisting of a rotating glass disc or cylinder on which silk flaps were allowed to drag as the glass rotated. These machines had to be hand-turned during treatment, but it was possible to store small amounts of <a href="static%20electricity">static electricity</a> in <a href="Leyden%20jar">Leyden jar</a>s for later use.

By 1849, generators based on <a href="Faraday%27s%20law%20of%20induction">Faraday's law of induction</a> had become advanced enough to replace both types of machines, and Bird was recommending them in his lectures. Galvanic cells suffered from the inconvenience of having to deal with the <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> acids in the surgery and the possibility of spillages; electrostatic generators required a great deal of skill and attention to keep them working successfully. Electromagnetic machines, on the other hand, have neither of these drawbacks; the only criticism levelled by Bird was that the cheaper machines could only deliver an <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a>. For medical use, particularly when treating a problem with nerves, a unidirectional current of a particular polarity was often needed, requiring the machine to have <a href="Commutator%20%28electric%29">split rings</a> or similar mechanisms. However, Bird considered alternating current machines suitable for cases of <a href="amenorrh%C5%93a">amenorrh≈ìa</a>.

The required direction of current depended on the direction in which electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed to be in the same direction. For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the <a href="frog%20galvanoscope">frog galvanoscope</a>. The electromagnetic <a href="galvanometer">galvanometer</a> was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the <a href="sciatic%20nerve">sciatic nerve</a> connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head from ear to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.

Bird designed his own <a href="interrupter">interrupter</a> circuit for delivering shocks to patients from a voltaic cell through an induction coil. Previously, the interrupter had been a mechanical device requiring the physician to turn a cog wheel or employ an assistant to do so. Bird wished to free his hands to apply the electricity more exactly to the required part of the patient. His interrupter worked automatically by magnetic induction at a reasonably fast rate. The faster the interrupter switches, the more frequently an electric shock is delivered to the patient; the aim is to make the frequency as high as possible.

Bird's interrupter had the medically disadvantageous feature that current was supplied in opposite directions during the <a href="Switch%23Contacts">make and break</a> operations. Treatment often required the current to be supplied in one specified direction only. Bird produced a unidirectional interrupter using a mechanism now called split rings. This design suffered from the disadvantage that automatic operation was lost and the interrupter had once again to be hand-cranked. Nevertheless, this arrangement remained a cheaper option than electromagnetic generators for some time.

Three classes of electrotherapy were in use. One was the <a href="electric%20bath%20%28electrotherapy%29">electric bath</a>, which consisted of sitting the patient on an insulated stool with glass legs and connecting the patient to one <a href="electrode">electrode</a>, usually the positive one, of an electrostatic machine. The patient's skin became charged as if he or she were in a "bath of electricity". The second class of treatment could be performed while the patient was in the electric bath. This consisted of bringing a negative electrode close to the patient, usually near the spine, causing sparks to be produced between the electrode and the patient. Electrodes of various shapes were available for different medical purposes and places of application on the body. Treatment was applied in several sessions of around five minutes, often blistering the skin. The third class of treatment was electric shock therapy, in which an electric shock was delivered from a galvanic battery (later electromagnetic generators) via an induction coil to greatly increase the voltage. It was also possible to deliver electric shocks from the charge stored in a Leyden jar, but this was a much weaker shock.

Electric stimulation treatment was used to treat nervous disorders where the nervous system was unable to stimulate a required glandular secretion or muscle activity. It had previously been successfully used to treat some forms of asthma. Bird used his apparatus to treat <a href="Sydenham%27s%20chorea">Sydenham's chorea</a> (St Vitus's dance) and other forms of <a href="spasm">spasm</a>, some forms of paralysis (although the treatment was of no use where nerves had been physically damaged), <a href="opiate">opiate</a> overdose (since it kept the patient awake), bringing on <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a> where this had failed (<a href="amenorrhoea">amenorrhoea</a>), and <a href="hysteria">hysteria</a>, a supposed disease of women. Paralysed bladder function in young girls was attributed to the now archaic condition of hysteria. It was treated with the application of a strong electric current between the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> and the <a href="mons%20pubis">pubis</a>. Although the treatment worked, in that it caused the bladder to empty, Bird suspected in many cases it did so more through fear and pain than any therapeutic property of electricity.

Electric shock treatment had become fashionable among the public, but often was not favoured by physicians except as a last resort. Its popularity led to many inappropriate treatments, and fraudulent practitioners were widespread. Quack practitioners claimed the treatment as a cure for almost anything, regardless of its effectiveness, and made large sums of money from it. Bird, however, continued to stand by the treatment when properly administered. He convinced an initially sceptical Addison of its merits, and the first publication (in 1837) describing the work of the electrifying unit was authored by Addison, not Bird, although Bird is clearly, and rightly, credited by Addison. Having the paper authored by Addison did a great deal to gain acceptability in a still suspicious medical fraternity. Addison held great authority, whereas Bird at this stage was unknown. Bird's 1841 paper in "Guy's Hospital Reports" contained an impressively long list of successful case studies. In 1847 he brought the subject fully into the realm of "materia medica" when he delivered the annual lecture to the Royal College of Physicians on this subject. He spoke out tirelessly against the numerous quack practitioners, in one case exposing railway telegraph operators who were claiming to be medical electricians, although they had no medical training at all. In this way, Bird was largely responsible for the rehabilitation of electrical treatment among medical practitioners. His work, with Addison's support, together with the increasing ease of using the machines as the technology progressed, brought the treatment into wider use in the medical profession.

Bird invented the "electric moxa" in 1843. The name is a reference to the <a href="acupuncture">acupuncture</a> technique of <a href="moxibustion">moxibustion</a> and was probably influenced by the introduction of <a href="electroacupuncture">electroacupuncture</a>, in which the needles are augmented by an electric current, two decades earlier in France. The electric moxa, however, was not intended for acupuncture. It was used to produce a <a href="suppuration">suppurating</a> sore on the skin of the patient to treat some conditions of inflammation and congestion by the technique of <a href="Counterirritant">counter-irritation</a>. The sore had previously been created by much more painful means, such as <a href="cautery">cautery</a> or even burning charcoal. Bird's design was based on a modification of an existing instrument for the local electrical treatment of <a href="hemiplegia">hemiplegia</a>, and consisted of a silver electrode and a zinc electrode connected by copper wire. Two small blisters were produced on the skin, to which the two electrodes were then connected and held in place for a few days. Electricity was generated by electrolytic action with body fluids. The blister under the silver electrode healed, but the one under the zinc electrode produced the required suppurating sore.

The healing of the blister under the silver electrode was of no importance for a counter-irritation procedure, but it suggested to Bird that the electric moxa might be used for treating obstinate <a href="leg%20ulcer">leg ulcer</a>s. This was a common complaint among the working classes in Bird's time, and hospitals could not admit the majority of cases for treatment. The moxa improved the situation by enabling sufferers to be treated as outpatients. The silver electrode of the moxa was applied to the ulcer to be healed, while the zinc electrode was applied a few inches away to a place where the upper layer of skin had been cut away. The whole apparatus was then bandaged in place as before. The technique was successfully applied by others on Bird's recommendation. <a href="Thomas%20Spencer%20Wells">Thomas Wells</a> later discovered that it was unnecessary to damage the skin under the zinc plate. He merely moistened the skin with vinegar before applying the zinc electrode.

There was some controversy over Bird's endorsement of a machine invented by one I. L. Pulvermacher that became known as <a href="Pulvermacher%27s%20chain">Pulvermacher's chain</a>. The main market for this device was the very quack practitioners that Bird so detested, but it did actually work as a generator. Bird was given a sample of this machine in 1851 and was impressed enough to give Pulvermacher a testimonial stating that the machine was a useful source of electricity. Bird thought that it could be used by physicians as a portable device. Electrically, the machine worked like a voltaic pile, but was constructed differently. It consisted of a number of wooden <a href="dowel">dowel</a>s, each with a <a href="bifilar%20coil">bifilar winding</a> of copper and zinc coils. Each winding was connected to the next dowel by means of metal hooks and eyes, which also provided the electrical connection. The electrolyte was provided by soaking the dowels in vinegar.

Naively, Bird appears to have expected Pulvermacher not to use this testimonial in his advertising. When Pulvermacher's company did so, Bird suffered some criticism for unprofessional behaviour, although it was never suggested that Bird benefited financially, and Bird stated in his defence that the testimonial was only ever intended as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh. Bird was particularly upset that Pulvermacher's company had used quotations from Bird's publications about the benefits of electrical treatment and misrepresented them as describing benefits of Pulvermacher's product. Bird also criticised Pulvermacher's claim that the chain could be wrapped around an affected limb for medical treatment. Although the flexible nature of its design lent itself to wrapping, Bird said that it would be next to useless in this configuration. According to Bird, the patient's body would provide a conductive path across each cell, thus preventing the device from building up a medically useful voltage at its terminals.

Bird used his position as head of the department of electricity and galvanism to further his research efforts and to aid him in teaching his students. He was interested in <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> and repeated the experiments of <a href="Antoine%20C%C3%A9sar%20Becquerel">Antoine C√©sar Becquerel</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Davy">Edmund Davy</a> and others to extract metals in this way. He was particularly interested in the possibility of detecting low levels of <a href="Heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a> poisons with this technique, pioneered by Davy. Bird also studied the properties of <a href="albumen">albumen</a> under electrolysis, finding that the albumen coagulated at the <a href="anode">anode</a> because <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> was produced there. He corrected an earlier erroneous conclusion by W. T. Brande that high electric current caused coagulation at the <a href="cathode">cathode</a> also, showing that this was entirely due to fluid flows caused by the strong electric field.

The formation of copper plates on the cathode was noticed in the Daniell cell shortly after its invention in 1836. Bird began a thorough investigation of this phenomenon in the following year. Using solutions of <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>, <a href="potassium%20chloride">potassium chloride</a> and <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a>, He succeeded in coating a mercury cathode with <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a> and <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> respectively, producing <a href="Amalgam%20%28chemistry%29">amalgams</a> of each of these. Not only <a href="chloride">chloride</a>s were used; <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a>, aluminium and <a href="silicon">silicon</a> were obtained from the <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> and <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s of these elements.

In 1837, Bird constructed his own version of the Daniell cell. The novel feature of Bird's cell was that the two solutions of copper sulphate and <a href="zinc%20sulphate">zinc sulphate</a> were in the same vessel, but kept separate by a barrier of <a href="Plaster%20of%20Paris">Plaster of Paris</a>, a common material used in hospitals for setting <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>s. Being porous, Plaster of Paris allows <a href="ion">ion</a>s to cross the barrier, while preventing the solutions from mixing. This arrangement is an example of a single-cell Daniell cell, and Bird's invention was the first of this kind. Bird's cell was the basis for the later development of the porous pot cell, invented in 1839 by <a href="John%20Dancer">John Dancer</a>.

Bird's experiments with his cell were important for the new discipline of <a href="electrometallurgy">electrometallurgy</a>. An unforeseen result was the <a href="Deposition%20%28chemistry%29">deposition</a> of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. On breaking apart the plaster it was found that veins of copper were formed running right through it. So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. Bird's experiments sometimes get him credit for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind <a href="electrotyping">electrotyping</a>. However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.

Bird thought there was a connection between the functioning of the nervous system and the processes seen in electrolysis at very low, steady currents. He knew that the currents in both were of the same order. To Bird, if such a connection existed, it made <a href="electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a> an important subject to study for biological reasons.

In 1837 Bird took part in an investigation of the dangers posed by the <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> content of cheap candles. These were <a href="stearin">stearin</a> candles with <a href="white%20arsenic">white arsenic</a> added, which made them burn more brightly than ordinary candles. The combination of cheapness and brightness made them popular. The investigation was conducted by the <a href="Westminster%20Medical%20Society">Westminster Medical Society</a>, a student society of Westminster Hospital, and was led by <a href="John%20Snow%20%28physician%29">John Snow</a>, later to become famous for his public health investigations. Snow had previously investigated arsenic poisoning when he and several fellow students were taken badly ill after he introduced a new process for preserving <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s at the suggestion of lecturer Hunter Lane. The new process involved injecting arsenic into the blood vessels of the corpse. Snow found that the arsenic became airborne as a result of chemical reactions with the decomposing corpse, and this was how it was ingested. Bird's part in the candle investigation was to analyse the arsenic content of the candles, which he found to have recently been greatly increased by the manufacturers. Bird also confirmed by experiment that the arsenic became airborne when the candles were burnt. The investigators exposed various species of animal and bird to the candles in controlled conditions. The animals all survived, but the birds died. Bird investigated the bird deaths and analysed the bodies, finding small amounts of arsenic. No arsenic was found on the feathers, however, indicating that poisoning was not caused by breathing airborne arsenic, since arsenic in the air would be expected to adhere to the feathers. However, Bird found that large amounts of arsenic were in the birds' drinking water, indicating that this was the route taken by the poison.

Although it had been known how to prepare <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> since 1776, it was not at first recognised that <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> was the mechanism of death and injury from stoves burning <a href="carbon">carbon</a>aceous fuels. A coroner's inquest into the death in 1838 of James Trickey, a nightwatchman who had spent all night by a new type of charcoal burning stove in <a href="St%20Michael%2C%20Cornhill">St Michael, Cornhill</a>, concluded that the poison involved was carbonic acid (that is, <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>) rather than carbon monoxide. Both Bird and Snow gave evidence to the inquest supporting poisoning by carbonic acid. Bird himself started to suffer ill effects while collecting air samples from the floor near the stove. However, the makers of the stove, Harper and Joyce, produced a string of their own expert witnesses, who convinced the jury to decide that death was caused by <a href="apoplexy">apoplexy</a>, and that "impure air" was only a contributing factor. Among the unscientific claims made at the inquest by Harper and Joyce were that carbonic gas would rise to the ceiling (in fact it is heavier than air and, according to Bird, would lie in a layer close to the floor, just where the sleeping Trickey's head would rest) and that "deleterious vapour" from the coffins in the vaults had risen into the church. After the inquest Joyce threatened to sue a journal which continued to criticise the stove for its lack of ventilation. In a subsequent clarification, Bird made it clear that any stove burning carbonaceous fuel was dangerous if it did not have a chimney or other means of ventilation. In fact, Trickey had only been placed in the church in the first place at the suggestion of Harper, who was expecting him to give favourable reports of the new stove's performance.

Bird read a paper to the Senior Physical Society in 1839, reporting on tests he conducted of the effects on sparrows of poisoning by carbonaceous fumes. This paper was of some importance and resulted in Bird giving his views to the <a href="British%20Association">British Association</a> in the same year. (He acted as a secretary to the chemical section of the British Association in Birmingham.) Bird also presented the paper at the Westminster Medical School, where Snow took a special interest in it. Until then, Snow and many others had believed that carbonic acid acted merely by excluding <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. The experiments of Bird and others convinced him that it was harmful in its own right, but he still did not subscribe to Bird's view that it was an active poison. Also in 1839, Bird published a comprehensive paper in "Guy's Hospital Reports", complete with many case histories, in which he documents the state of knowledge. He realised that at least some cases of poisoning from stoves were due not to carbonic acid, but to some other agent, although he still had not identified it as carbon monoxide.

Bird did a great deal of research in <a href="urology">urology</a>, including the chemistry of both <a href="urine">urine</a> and kidney stones, and soon became a recognised expert. This work occupied a large proportion of his effort, and his writings on urinary sediments and kidney stones were the most advanced at the time. His work followed on from, and was much influenced by, that of <a href="Alexander%20Marcet">Alexander Marcet</a> and William Prout. Marcet was also a physician at Guy's; Prout held no position at Guy's, but was connected with the hospital and well known there. For instance, when Marcet discovered a new constituent of kidney stones, <a href="xanthic%20oxide">xanthic oxide</a>, he sent it to Prout for analysis. Prout discovered a new substance himself in 1822, a constituent of urine which he named <a href="melanic%20acid">melanic acid</a>, because it turned black on contact with air.

Bird studied and categorised the collection of stones at Guy's, concentrating particularly on the crystal structures of the nuclei, since stone formation followed once there was a nucleus on which to form. He considered the chemistry of the nuclei to be the most important aspect of stone formation. Bird identified many species of stone, classified by the chemistry of the nucleus, but determined that they all fell within two overall groups: organic stones caused by a misfunctioning bodily process, and excessive inorganic salts causing sediment on which the stone could <a href="nucleate">nucleate</a>. In 1842, Bird became the first to describe <a href="oxaluria">oxaluria</a>, sometimes called Bird's disease, which is caused by an excess of <a href="oxalate%20of%20lime">oxalate of lime</a> in the urine. This is the second most common cause of kidney stones, the first being <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> and its ammonium salt. There are several others, such as <a href="ammonium%20oxalate">ammonium oxalate</a>. In his great work "Urinary Deposits", Bird devotes much space to the identification of chemicals in urine by microscopic examination of the appearance of crystals in it. He shows how the appearance of crystals of the same chemical can vary greatly under differing conditions, and especially how the appearance changes with disease. "Urinary Deposits" became a standard text on the subject; there were five editions between 1844 and 1857. In the fourth edition Bird added a recommendation to wash out the bladder in cases of alkaline urine, after an experiment by Snow showed that stale urine became alkaline when fresh urine was slowly dripped into it. Bird knew that alkaline urine encouraged phosphate precipitation and the consequent encrustation and stone formation. The last edition of "Urinary Deposits" was updated after Bird's death by Edmund Lloyd Birkett.

Bird was the first to recognise that <a href="urinary%20cast">urinary cast</a>s are an indication of <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a>. Casts were first discovered by <a href="Henry%20Bence%20Jones">Henry Bence Jones</a>. They are microscopic cylinders of <a href="Tamm-Horsfall%20protein">Tamm-Horsfall protein</a> that have been precipitated in the kidneys and then released into the urine.

A prevalent idea in the 18th and early 19th centuries was that illness was a result of the condition of the whole body. The environment and the activity of the patient thus played a large part in any treatment. The epitome of this kind of thinking was the concept of the <a href="vitalism">vital force</a>, which was supposed to govern the chemical processes within the body. This theory held that organic compounds could only be formed within living organisms, where the vital force could come into play. This belief had been known to be false ever since <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich W√∂hler</a> succeeded in synthesising <a href="urea">urea</a> from inorganic precursors in 1828. Nevertheless, the vital force continued to be invoked to explain organic chemistry in Bird's time. Sometime in the middle of the 19th century, a new way of thinking started to take shape, especially among younger physicians, fuelled by rapid advances in the understanding of chemistry. For the first time, it became possible to identify specific chemical reactions with specific organs of the body, and to trace their effects through the various functional relations of the organs and the exchanges between them.

Among these younger radicals were Bird and Snow; among the old school was <a href="William%20Addison%20%28physician%29">William Addison</a> (a different person from Bird's superior at Guy's). Addison disliked the modern reliance on laboratory and theoretical results favoured by the new generation, and challenged <a href="Richard%20Bright%20%28physician%29">Richard Bright</a> (who gave his name to Bright's disease) when Bright suggested that the source of the problem in <a href="oedema">oedema</a> was the kidneys. Addison preferred to believe that the condition was caused by intemperance or some other external factor, and that since the whole body had been disrupted, it could not be localised to a specific organ. Addison further challenged Bright's student, Snow, when in 1839 Snow suggested from case studies and laboratory analysis that oedema was associated with an increase in <a href="albumin">albumin</a> in the blood. Addison dismissed this as a mere <a href="epiphenomenon">epiphenomenon</a>. Bird disagreed with Snow's proposed treatment, but his arguments clearly show him to be on the radical side of the debate, and he completely avoided whole-body arguments. Snow had found that the proportion of urea in the urine of his patients was low and concluded from this that urea was accumulating in the blood, and therefore proposed <a href="bloodletting">bloodletting</a> to counter this. Bird disputed that increased urea in the blood was the cause of kidney disease and doubted the effectiveness of this treatment, citing the results of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Magendie">Fran√ßois Magendie</a>, who had injected urea into the blood, apparently with no ill effects. It is not clear whether Bird accepted Snow's reasoning that urea must be accumulating, or whether he merely adopted it for the sake of argument; while a student in 1833, he had disputed this very point with another of Bright's students, George Rees.

<a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a> is another important figure in the development of the new thinking, although his position is ambiguous. He explained chemical processes in the body in terms of addition and subtraction of simple molecules from a larger organic molecule, a concept that Bird followed in his own work. But even the <a href="materialism">materialistic</a> Liebig continued to invoke the vital force for processes inside "living" animal bodies. This seems to have been based on a belief that the entire living animal is required for these chemical processes to take place. Bird helped to dispel this kind of thinking by showing that specific chemistry is related to specific organs in the body rather than to the whole animal. He challenged some of Liebig's conclusions concerning animal chemistry. For example, Liebig had predicted that the ratio of uric acid to urea would depend on the level of activity of a species or individual; Bird showed this to be false. Bird also felt that it was not enough simply to count atoms as Liebig did, but that an explanation was also required as to why the atoms recombined in one particular way rather than any other. He made some attempts to provide this explanation by invoking the electric force, rather than the vital force, based on his own experiments in electrolysis.

Bird designed and used a flexible tube <a href="stethoscope">stethoscope</a> in June 1840, and in the same year he published the first description of such an instrument. In his paper he mentions an instrument already in use by other physicians (Drs. Clendinning and Stroud), which he describes as the "snake <a href="ear%20trumpet">ear trumpet</a>". He thought this instrument had some severe technical faults; in particular, its great length led to poor performance. The form of Bird's invention is similar to the modern stethoscope, except that it has only one earpiece. An ill-tempered exchange of letters occurred in the "London Medical Gazette" between another physician, John Burne, and Bird. Burne claimed that he also used the same instrument as Clendinning and Stroud and was offended that Bird had not mentioned him in his paper. Burne, who worked at the <a href="Westminster%20Hospital">Westminster Hospital</a>, pointed with suspicion to the fact that Bird's brother Frederic also worked there. In a reply full of anger and sarcasm, Bird pointed out that in his original paper he had already made clear that he claimed no credit for the earlier instrument. Bird found the flexible stethoscope convenient as it avoided uncomfortably leaning over patients (as would be required by a rigid stethoscope) and the earpiece could be passed to other doctors and students to listen. It was particularly useful for Bird, with his severe rheumatism, as he could apply the stethoscope to the patient from a seated position.

When Bird took up lecturing on science at Guy's, he could not find a textbook suitable for his medical students. He needed a book that went into some detail of physics and chemistry, but which medical students would not find overwhelmingly mathematical. Bird reluctantly undertook to write such a book himself, based on his 1837‚Äì1838 lectures, and the result was "Elements of Natural Philosophy", first published in 1839. It proved to be spectacularly popular, even beyond its intended audience of medical students, and went through six editions. Reprints were still being produced more than 30 years later in 1868. The fourth edition was edited by Charles Brooke, a friend of Bird's, after the latter's death. Brooke made good many of Bird's mathematical omissions. Brooke edited further editions and, in the sixth edition of 1867, thoroughly updated it.

The book was well received and was praised by reviewers for its clarity. The "Literary Gazette", for instance, thought that it "teaches us the elements of the entire circle of natural philosophy in the clearest and most perspicuous manner". The reviewer recommended it as suitable not just for students and not just for the young, saying that it "ought to be in the hands of every individual who desires to taste the pleasures of divine philosophy, and obtain a competent knowledge of that creation in which they live".

Medical journals, on the other hand, were more restrained in their praise. The "<a href="Provincial%20Medical%20and%20Surgical">Provincial Medical and Surgical</a>", for instance, in its review of the second edition, thought that it was "a good and concise elementary treatise¬†... presenting in a readable and intelligible form, a great mass of information not to be found in any other single treatise". But the "Provincial" had a few technical quibbles, among which was the complaint that there was no description of the construction of a stethoscope. The "Provincial" reviewer thought that the book was particularly suitable for students who had no previous instruction in physics. The sections on magnetism, electricity and light were particularly recommended.

In their review of the 6th edition, "Popular Science Review" noted that the author was now named as Brooke and observed that he had now made the book his own. The reviewers looked back with nostalgia to the book they knew as "the Golding Bird" when they were students. They note with approval the many newly included descriptions of the latest technology, such as the <a href="dynamo">dynamo</a>s of <a href="Henry%20Wilde%20%28engineer%29">Henry Wilde</a> and <a href="Werner%20von%20Siemens">Werner von Siemens</a>, and the <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a> of Browning.

The scope of the book was wide-ranging, covering much of the physics then known. The 1839 first edition included <a href="statics">statics</a>, <a href="dynamics%20%28mechanics%29">dynamics</a>, <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a>, <a href="mechanics">mechanics</a>, <a href="hydrostatics">hydrostatics</a>, <a href="pneumatics">pneumatics</a>, <a href="hydrodynamics">hydrodynamics</a>, <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a>, <a href="magnetism">magnetism</a>, electricity, <a href="atmospheric%20electricity">atmospheric electricity</a>, <a href="electrodynamics">electrodynamics</a>, <a href="thermoelectricity">thermoelectricity</a>, <a href="bioelectricity">bioelectricity</a>, <a href="light">light</a>, <a href="optics">optics</a>, and <a href="polarized%20light">polarized light</a>. In the 1843 second edition Bird expanded the material on electrolysis into its own chapter, reworked the polarized light material, added two chapters on "thermotics" (<a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>¬†‚Äì a major omission from the first edition), and a chapter on the new technology of photography. Later editions also included a chapter on <a href="electric%20telegraph">electric telegraph</a>y. Brooke was still expanding the book for the sixth and final edition. New material included the magnetic properties of iron in ships and <a href="Spectroscopy">spectrum analysis</a>.

Bird was a committed Christian throughout his life. Despite his extremely busy professional life, he meticulously observed the Sabbath and saw to the Christian education of his children. He showed generosity to the poor, offering them treatment at his house every morning before going about his professional schedule. After it became clear that the remainder of his life was going to be very limited, he devoted much time to his religion. He wanted to promote Christian teachings and Bible reading among medical students. From 1853 Bird organised a series of religious meetings of medical professionals in London, aiming to encourage physicians and surgeons to exert a religious influence over their students.

For several years prior to 1853, student prayer meetings had been held in some of the London hospitals, particularly St Thomas'. Bird aimed to mould this movement into a formal association, an ambition which was to crystallise as the <a href="Christian%20Medical%20Association%20%281854%29">Christian Medical Association</a>. He was heavily influenced in this by the Medical Missionary Society of <a href="John%20Hutton%20Balfour">John Hutton Balfour</a> at <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a>. Bird aimed to form a national body with a chapter in each teaching hospital; a prototype student group was already in existence at Guy's. He was strongly opposed by some sections of the medical profession, who felt that students should concentrate on their studies. Among the insults levelled at Bird were "<a href="wikt%3Asaponaceous">saponaceous</a> piety" and being a <a href="wikt%3AMawworm">Mawworm</a>. This opposition continued after the formation of the Association. The constitution of the new Christian Medical Association was agreed at Bird's home on 17 December 1853 in a meeting of medical and surgical teachers and others. It was based on a draft prepared by the Guy's student group. Bird died before the inaugural public meeting of the Association in November 1854 at <a href="Exeter%20Hall">Exeter Hall</a>.

Bird was quick to defend the virtuousness of students. In November 1853, in a reply to a letter from a student in the "Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal" complaining of a lack of moral care from his superiors, Bird attacked the prevalent public view that students were "guilty of every kind of open vice and moral depravity". Bird laid much of the blame for this public opinion on the caricatures of students in the writings of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. He went on to say that the behaviour and character of students had greatly improved over the preceding ten years. He attributed this improvement in part to the greatly increased study requirements imposed on students, but also in part to Christian influences acting on them. He also commented that pious students had once been ridiculed, but were now respected.



Bird was frequently mentioned in the transactions of the <a href="Medical%20Society%20of%20London">Medical Society of London</a>. Some examples are:

Joppenbergh Mountain

Joppenbergh Mountain is a nearly mountain in <a href="Rosendale%20Village%2C%20New%20York">Rosendale Village</a>, a <a href="Hamlet%20%28New%20York%29">hamlet</a> in the town of <a href="Rosendale%2C%20New%20York">Rosendale</a>, in <a href="Ulster%20County%2C%20New%20York">Ulster County, New York</a>. The mountain is composed of a <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> overlain by <a href="Glacier">glacially</a> deposited material. It was named after Rosendale's founder, Jacob Rutsen, and <a href="Mining">mined</a> throughout the late 19th¬†century for <a href="dolostone">dolostone</a> that was used in the manufacture of <a href="natural%20cement">natural cement</a>. Extensive mining caused a large cave-in on December 19, 1899, that destroyed equipment and collapsed <a href="Shaft%20mining">shafts</a> within Joppenbergh. Though it was feared that several workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all the miners were outside, eating lunch. Since the collapse, the mountain has experienced shaking and periodic rockfalls.

During the late 1930s, Joppenbergh became the site of several <a href="ski%20jumping">ski jumping</a> competitions, which continued until the early 1940s. The original slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the slope was coated with <a href="borax">borax</a> for a summer competition. Several <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new slope was built on the mountain, and the revived competitions continued until 1971.

The town of Rosendale considered buying land near the mountain in 2003 for parking, and the following year, the town leased a tract of land to build a municipal parking lot. Joppenbergh was put up for sale in 2009, and in March 2011, the <a href="Open%20Space%20Institute">Open Space Institute</a> (OSI) offered to purchase the entire property and sell it to the town. The Rosendale town board initially agreed to the deal the following month, with payment planned to come from a surplus fund. That June, however, the board found that the surplus fund had already been exhausted and could not cover the entire cost of the purchase. Ultimately, the OSI completed its purchase of Joppenbergh in October 2011, without town money.

Joppenbergh is named after <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> Jacob Rutsen, born "Jacobsen Rutger van Schoonderwoerdt". Rutsen was a merchant, and the son of a <a href="New%20Netherland">Dutch immigrant</a>, from <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>; he founded the first settlement in what is now the town of <a href="Rosendale%2C%20New%20York">Rosendale, New York</a>, in the late 17th¬†century. The spelling of the mountain's name has been disputed, and has been rendered as "Joppenberg" and "Joppenburgh". It has also been called "Jacob's Nose", "Jacob's Mount", and, in an early 18th-century deed, "Jobsenbright".

Sources differ on whether Joppenbergh is or . Both measurements give Joppenbergh a lower elevation than the highest point in the town of Rosendale, a peak of the <a href="Shawangunk%20Ridge">Shawangunk Ridge</a>.

The bedrock underlying the mountain is composed of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="dolostone">dolostone</a> <a href="Geological%20unit">members</a> of the <a href="Helderberg%20Group">Helderberg Group</a>, laid during the <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a> era. Most of the Helderberg <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>s in Rosendale are located north of the <a href="Rondout%20Creek">Rondout Creek</a>, and have given Rosendale a <a href="Karst">karst topography</a>, resulting in "sink holes, disappearing streams, caves, and springs". The mountain's surface is composed of unconsolidated, <a href="Glacier">glacially</a> deposited <a href="Outwash%20plain">outwash</a> and <a href="till">till</a>, with several <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s exposing Joppenbergh's bedrock. Soils have been mapped as Farmington-Rock outcrop complex. In some areas, the soil depth is less than , which hinders <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> filtration. Other parts of the mountain have a steep, 30¬†percent <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a>. These areas, comprising nearly 75¬†percent of the property, cannot be easily developed.

In 1825, engineers working on the <a href="Delaware%20and%20Hudson%20Canal">Delaware and Hudson Canal</a> found large numbers of dolostone rocks in the region, which enabled the production of <a href="natural%20cement">natural cement</a>. The rocks contained <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a> of the Upper <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a>'s Rondout <a href="Formation%20%28stratigraphy%29">formation</a>. Joppenbergh was rich in the mineral, and was <a href="Mining">mined</a>. Several quarries operated on the mountain, including the New York and Rosendale Cement Company, and the James Cement Company. No one company had complete control of the entire mountain.

By late December 1899, mining had compromised Joppenbergh's integrity enough to cause a series of landslides, followed by a large <a href="cave-in">cave-in</a> on December¬†19. Four collapses occurred that day, beginning at 8¬†AM, and culminating in the 11:30¬†AM collapse of the "Black Smoke Mine" shaft network. Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain, eating lunch.

The collapse rendered the canal and nearby road impassable, and caused a boiler explosion that shook the nearby <a href="Rosendale%20trestle">Rosendale trestle</a>. At the time of the collapse, the total cost of the damage was estimated to be between $20,000 and $25,000. Another, larger collapse happened the following week, late at night. This cave-in was believed to have been caused by the December¬†19 collapse. Shortly after the landslides, "swarms of gawking spectators" crowded the village to photograph the debris; one such photograph was alleged to depict the <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna</a>. Frequent <a href="rockfall">rockfall</a>s as a result of mining led to calls to destroy the mountain in 1907.

Throughout the 1930s the tourist industry in Rosendale flourished, generating almost $700,000 each year between spring and autumn. The Rosendale Township Association, founded in 1934 to encourage tourism in the town, sought out new activities to attract tourists to Rosendale during the winter. In 1936 the association asked a <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>-based <a href="telemark%20skiing">telemark skiing</a> club to build its new <a href="Ski%20jumping%20hill">ski jumping slope</a> in Rosendale. The group leased Joppenbergh from owner Warren Sammons.

Rosendale's first <a href="ski%20jumping">ski jumping</a> competition was held on January¬†24, 1937. The ski track was designed by Harold Schelderup, a ski hill designer from Norway. Bad weather caused the cancellation of competitive events, but a skiing exhibition still occurred. That April, the Telemark club held a special dinner in Brooklyn to honor members who performed well in the January competition. The club planned to hold a summer competition by covering the mountain with "straw and pine needles". Harold Schelderup, who was recognized at the dinner for his skills, performed in the summer tournament. Joppenbergh's ski track was coated with <a href="borax">borax</a>, and the tournament was held on July¬†18, 1937 at 2:30 in the afternoon, with enough parking provided for 500 cars. In front of a crowd of 3,300 people, "jumpers took off from an in-run covered with borax and landed on a hill covered with mats and carpets topped with straw and borax".
<a href="Nordic%20combined%20at%20the%201936%20Winter%20Olympics">Olympic skier</a> <a href="Paul%20Ottar%20Satre">Ottar Satre</a> set a record jump of in 1937. The following year a extension was placed atop the mountain to increase jumpers' distance. Although Satre's record was expected to be beaten by more than , the winner of the January¬†23, 1938 competition was Norwegian skier Nils Eie, who jumped only . Harold Schelderup also participated in the competition, which was held the week after he won a separate tournament in <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains</a>. Another Joppenbergh tournament was planned for March¬†7, 1938. Competitions were held in 1940 and 1941. The length of the slope was increased to in 1941, but the United States' entrance into World War II caused skiers to enter the military, and competitions were not held after the war.

Skiing resumed on Joppenbergh in the 1960s. The Rosendale Nordic Ski Club was organized on January¬†11, 1964, and immediately created the Joppenbergh Mountain Corporation (JMC) to manage the Joppenbergh property. Three hundred shares of stock were issued for the JMC, priced at $100 per share, to build a new slopeand to buy the mountain itself for $20,000 from its owner, Mary Sammons. The JMC gained control of the property on August¬†20, 1964, and immediately announced its intent to build a new ski slope on the site of the original one, as well as a parking lot capable of holding 10,000 cars. The goal of the club was to make Rosendale the "Nordic Ski Capital of the East". A new slope was completed on November¬†14, 1965, and augmented by a <a href="snowmaking">snowmaking</a> system to provide artificial snow. When a ski jumping competition was held on January¬†30, 1966, skier Leif Bringslimark achieved a jump from the new slope. Competitions were held January¬†22, 1967 and January¬†27, 1968. The winner of the 1968 tournament was Per Coucheron, a 22-year-old <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth</a> student who reached . The slope was icy prior to the competition; a snowmaking machine was used the night before the jump, and club members, as well as the competitors themselves, "help[ed] manicure the slope". When the jump began, the slope was in fine condition.

The Rosendale Outing Ski Club organized a competition on January¬†25 and¬†26, 1969, attended by a crowd of 3,000 people. <a href="List%20of%20Olympic%20medalists%20in%20Nordic%20combined">Olympic medalist</a> <a href="Franz%20Keller%20%28skier%29">Franz Keller</a> jumped down a slope on Joppenbergh, though he managed to reach during practice. It had rained the week before the competition, and although 20 truckloads of snow were brought in, the condition of the track was "extremely fast". Several participants fell, and one was brought to a hospital in <a href="Kingston%2C%20New%20York">Kingston</a>.

A jump took place on January¬†18, 1970, the same year that the Rosendale Outing Ski Club became part of the Rosendale Nordic Ski Club. The new club organized Rosendale's final skiing competition, which took place on February¬†6 and¬†7, 1971. Keller's record was broken twice on February¬†6, by <a href="Middlebury%20College">Middlebury College</a> student Hugh Barber. The Barber reached heights of and during the competition, and during practice, in front of 3,500 spectators. Although Barber believed the ski hill was in "great condition", 10 to 15¬†percent of participants had fallen during the tournament. Consistently unfavorable weather conditions and a lack of profitability were the major reasons skiing stopped on Joppenbergh; the poor design of the slope, as well as infighting among ski club members, also contributed. The slope was subsequently abandoned, and an adjacent facility, for the ski jumps, fell into disuse. The JMC continued to own and maintain the property after skiing ceased.

Periodic rockfalls continue to happen, with debris sliding down the mountain face. In 1984, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20213">State Route¬†213</a> was moved away from Joppenbergh and closer to <a href="Rondout%20Creek">Rondout Creek</a> to protect motorists. A <a href="retaining%20wall">retaining wall</a> was put up at the foot of the mountain to prevent falling rocks from rolling onto the street. During the 1980s, Vidacable TV Systems leased part of the mountain from the JMC to set up an <a href="Radio%20masts%20and%20towers">antenna</a>. <a href="Cellular%20One">Cellular One</a> considered building a <a href="Cell%20site">cell tower</a> on top of Joppenbergh in 1992, but decided not to do so. Although there was public opposition to the proposal, Cellular One stated that local sentiment was not a factor in its decision against building the tower. In 1995 the mountain was studied by the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Service%20Commission">New York Public Service Commission</a> to determine a possible route for new <a href="transmission%20line">transmission line</a>s laid by a local <a href="public%20utility">energy utility</a>.

The body of a 25-year-old substitute teacher from Kingston, Amy Glauner, was found on Joppenbergh after an October 1998 search. Police determined that she died of <a href="Head%20injury">head trauma</a> following a fall. Her car had been found in a <a href="parking%20lot">parking lot</a> by the mountain.
In 2003, the town of Rosendale considered either leasing a tract of land near Joppenbergh, or purchasing a lot, to expand parking on Main Street. The lot belonged to former village mayor Joseph Reid, who refused to sell it to the town. Although the town board considered using <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a> to acquire Reid's property, it agreed in June 2004 to lease the Joppenbergh property instead, for a period of 10 years, at a rate of $3,500 each year. One member of the town board opposed the deal because it would not secure the land beyond the 10-year term. The lease allowed the town to create a park by the municipal lot, Willow Kiln Park, which contains several defunct <a href="cement%20kiln">cement kiln</a>s. Willow Kiln Park has served as the setting of an art show and, following a <a href="zombie">zombie</a>-themed street festival, a concert.

Though the JMC had been unwilling to sell its land in 2004, by December 2009 the entire mountain was put up for sale, for $500,000. Before 2009, the assessed value of the property was only about $50,000. In early March 2011, the <a href="Open%20Space%20Institute">Open Space Institute</a> (OSI) offered to purchase the propertywhich had, by that time, been reassessed at $240,000for $185,000, and sell it to the town for $85,000. The deal would create an <a href="easement">easement</a> with the town, allowing only noncommercial use of the mountain while preserving the municipal parking lot at its base. While some government officials viewed such an acquisition as a permanent solution to the hamlet's parking problems, other officials viewed the loss of tax revenue from the privately owned property to be undesirable.

More than 175 people showed up for a rancorous public hearing over the purchase on April¬†6, 2011. During the hearing, members of the Rosendale town board determined that the tax income from the entire property was much less than the cost of renting part of it for parking. Residents brought up several issues, such as the liability the town would assume from falling rocks, and <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s. Other issues discussed were the lack of road access to the parking lot, and whether the property should be used commercially. An individual living adjacent to the property, Brett Hansen, expressed a strong desire to buy it and build additional parking lots, as well as an <a href="Amphitheatre">amphitheater</a>. Proponents of the purchase described how ownership of Joppenbergh would allow Rosendale to connect the <a href="Wallkill%20Valley%20Rail%20Trail">Wallkill Valley Rail Trail</a> with Main Street, and how property values near the mountain would increase. The town board agreed to the purchase in a 3‚Äì2 vote on April¬†13.
Although a 17-page petition with 298 signatures in favor of a public <a href="referendum">referendum</a> was presented at the meeting, the board felt that OSI funds would not be available by the proposed November referendum. Opponents of the board's decision protested it by placing signs near the mountain deriding the purchase as an unwise expenditure. The town was not legally obligated to hold a referendum, regardless of public sentiment, because the money budgeted for the purchase was not borrowed; board members planned to tap a $340,000 surplus fund, generated by the 2010 sale of town land to the OSI, which intended to allow <a href="bouldering">bouldering</a> on the property. The $340,000 fund was originally intended for capital improvements, specifically the construction of a new town hall, but a June 2011 audit of the town's 2010 budget found that a large part of the surplus had already been used to offset budget and tax shortfalls; only $79,000 remained available.

Several local businesses considered contributing money to the mountain's purchase. Such funding would be considered surplus, and would not be subject to referendum. Owners of businesses on Main Street expressed concern at the June¬†1 town board meeting that the cost of parking would increase if the property was purchased by a third party. One board member estimated that without paying rent, the town would recoup the cost of the property within 12 years. <a href="Ulster%20County%20Area%20Transit">Ulster County Area Transit</a> expressed a desire to route its buses through the property, creating a connection to the <a href="Mohonk%20Preserve">Mohonk Preserve</a>. A nonprofit organization, the Joppenbergh Mountain Preservation Association, was created in June 2011 to raise funding to purchase the mountain, the parking lot, and Willow Kiln Park.

In an effort to reduce the purchase price, the town board asked the mountain's current owners to discount the final four years of rent on the parking lot, a cost of $32,000. The town considered buying only the parking lot and Willow Kiln Park, but the JMC's lawyer indicated that the property would not be divided. Ultimately, the OSI bought Joppenbergh without any financial assistance from the town, gaining ownership of the property in October 2011, although the sale was not completed until December¬†20, 2011. By that time, most of the JMC's stockholders had died, and ownership of the property generated so little income that it served "no further business purpose". Joppenbergh was a point of contention during the town's November 2011 elections, with Republicans criticizing the affair as "reflect[ing] poorly on town Democrats' fiscal management skills". The town of Rosendale approached the OSI in January 2012 to renew its lease of the parking lot, which was set to expire at the end of 2013.

In 2012 the OSI transferred ownership of the property to a local conservancy, the Wallkill Valley Land Trust (WVLT). An informal association of businesses, the Joppenbergh Mountain Advisory Group (JMAG), began working with the WVLT to create a <a href="Land-use%20planning">land use policy</a>. The WVLT began having monthly meetings with the JMAG, and with town and state departments; its stated goal was to combine Joppenbergh's development with the rehabilitation of the adjacent railroad trestle and subsequent expansion of the rail trail. In late September 2012, the WVLT held a hearing on a proposed land use plan that would allow <a href="deer%20hunting">deer hunting</a> on the property beginning in 2013, and would prohibit entry into several caves on the mountain.

Murder of Joanna Yeates

Joanna Clare Yeates (19 April 1985¬†‚Äì 17 December 2010) was a <a href="landscape%20architect">landscape architect</a> from <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England, who went <a href="missing%20person">missing</a> on 17 December 2010 in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> after an evening out with colleagues. Following a highly publicised appeal for information on her whereabouts and intensive police enquiries, her body was discovered on 25 December 2010 in <a href="Failand">Failand</a>, <a href="North%20Somerset">North Somerset</a>. A <a href="Autopsy">post-mortem examination</a> determined that she had been <a href="strangling">strangled</a>.

The murder inquiry, codenamed Operation Braid, was one of the largest police investigations ever undertaken in the Bristol area. The case dominated news coverage in the United Kingdom around the Christmas period as Yeates' family sought assistance from the public through <a href="social%20networking%20service">social networking service</a>s and press conferences. Rewards amounting to ¬£60,000 were offered for information leading to those responsible for Yeates' death. The police initially suspected and arrested Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord, who lived in a flat in the same building. He was subsequently released without charge.

Vincent Tabak, a 32-year-old engineer and neighbour of Yeates, was arrested on 20 January 2011. Media attention at the time centred on the filming of a re-enactment of her disappearance for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s programme, "<a href="Crimewatch">Crimewatch</a>". After two days of questioning, Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with Yeates' murder. On 5 May 2011, he pleaded guilty to Yeates' <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, but denied murdering her. His trial started on 4 October 2011; he was found guilty of murder on 28 October 2011, and sentenced to <a href="Life%20imprisonment%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">life imprisonment</a> with a minimum term of 20 years.

The nature of press reporting on aspects of the case led to legal proceedings against several UK newspapers. <a href="Defamation">Libel</a> action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest, resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages. The "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" were found guilty of <a href="Contempt%20of%20court%23England">contempt of court</a> for reporting information that could prejudice a trial.

A memorial service was held for Yeates at the parish church in the Bristol suburb where she lived; her funeral took place near the family home in Hampshire. Several memorials were planned, including one in a garden she had been designing for a new hospital in Bristol.

Joanna Clare Yeates was born on 19 April 1985 to David and Teresa Yeates in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>, England. She was <a href="Private%20school%23United%20Kingdom">privately educated</a> at <a href="Hampshire%20Collegiate%20School">Embley Park</a> near <a href="Romsey">Romsey</a>. Yeates studied for her <a href="GCE%20Advanced%20Level">A-levels</a> at <a href="Peter%20Symonds%20College">Peter Symonds College</a> and graduated with a degree in <a href="landscape%20architecture">landscape architecture</a> from <a href="Writtle%20College">Writtle College</a>. She received her <a href="postgraduate%20diploma">postgraduate diploma</a> in landscape architecture from the <a href="University%20of%20Gloucestershire">University of Gloucestershire</a>.

In December 2008, Yeates met then-25-year-old architect Greg Reardon at the firm Hyland Edgar Driver in <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>. The couple moved in together in 2009, and settled in Bristol when the company moved there. Yeates later changed jobs to work at the <a href="Building%20Design%20Partnership">Building Design Partnership</a> in Bristol. Yeates and Reardon moved into a flat at 44 Canynge Road in the city's <a href="Clifton%2C%20Bristol">Clifton</a> suburb in October 2010.
At approximately 8:00¬†pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon returned home from a weekend visit to <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon had been trying to contact her by <a href="Telephone">phone</a> and <a href="SMS">text</a>, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that her purse and keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.

Investigators determined Yeates had spent the evening of 17 December 2010 with colleagues at the Bristol Ram pub on <a href="Park%20Street%2C%20Bristol">Park Street</a>, leaving at around 8:00¬†pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues that she was not looking forward to spending the weekend alone as it would be her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on <a href="closed-circuit%20television">closed-circuit television</a> (CCTV) at around 8:10¬†pm leaving a <a href="Waitrose">Waitrose</a> supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30¬†pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of <a href="Tesco%20Express">Tesco Express</a> at around 8:40¬†pm. She had also bought two small bottles of cider at a nearby <a href="off-licence">off-licence</a>, <a href="Bargain%20Booze">Bargain Booze</a>.

Reardon and Yeates' friends set up a website and used social networking services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by <a href="Sky%20News">Sky News</a> and <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I have no idea of the circumstances of the abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a <a href="receipt">receipt</a> for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its <a href="packaging">packaging</a>. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As there was no <a href="evidence">evidence</a> of <a href="forced%20entry">forced entry</a> or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.
On 25 December 2010, a fully clothed body was found in the snow by a couple walking their dogs along Longwood Lane near a <a href="golf%20course">golf course</a> and next to the entrance of a <a href="quarry">quarry</a> in <a href="Failand">Failand</a>, approximately from her home. The body was identified by police as that of Yeates. Reardon and the Yeates family visited the site of the discovery on 27 December 2010. David Yeates said that the family "had been told to prepare for the worst" and expressed relief that his daughter's body had been recovered. Funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators retained the body. The <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a> Dr Nat Carey consented to the release of the body on 31 January 2011.

The investigation, called "Operation Braid", comprised 80 <a href="detective">detective</a>s and civilian staff under the direction of Detective <a href="Chief%20Inspector">Chief Inspector</a> Phil Jones, a senior officer with <a href="Avon%20and%20Somerset%20Constabulary">Avon and Somerset Constabulary's</a> major crime investigation unit. It became one of the largest police operations in the Constabulary's history. Jones urged the public to come forward with any information to help catch the killer, especially potential witnesses who were in the vicinity of Longwood Lane in Failand in the period before Yeates' body was discovered. He stated that the investigation was seeking the driver of a "light-coloured <a href="Sport%20utility%20vehicle">4x4 vehicle</a>" for questioning.

Jones said that officers had been "inundated with thousands of calls" and were "exhausting every lead and avenue that [they were] provided with." Police examined over 100 hours of surveillance footage along with of rubbish seized from the area around Yeates' flat. <a href="Crime%20Stoppers">Crime Stoppers</a> offered a <a href="pound%20sterling">¬£</a>10,000 <a href="bounty%20%28reward%29">reward</a> for information leading to the arrest and conviction of her murderer, while "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" newspaper offered ¬£50,000. Authorities advised people living in the area to secure their homes, and warned women not to walk alone after dark. Speaking on 29 December about the murder investigation Yeates' father said, "I fear that whoever has done this will never hand themselves in, but we live in hope that the police will catch who is responsible."

Following the discovery of Yeates' body, detectives from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary issued an appeal for anyone with information about the death to come forward, and investigated similarities with other unsolved cases. Of particular interest to them were those of 20-year-old <a href="List%20of%20unsolved%20murders%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%231970s">Glenis Carruthers</a> who was strangled in 1974, <a href="murder%20of%20Melanie%20Hall">Melanie Hall</a>, aged 25, who disappeared in 1996 and whose body was discovered thirteen years later, and 35-year-old <a href="disappearance%20of%20Claudia%20Lawrence">Claudia Lawrence</a> who went missing in 2009. Investigators identified "striking similarities" between the Yeates and Hall cases, notably their age and appearance, and that they had disappeared after returning home from meeting friends, but the possibility of such connections was later downplayed by authorities. The police gathered surveillance video from <a href="Clifton%20Suspension%20Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>, which forms part of the most direct route from the crime scene to the Clifton suburb where Yeates was last seen alive. The footage was of poor quality, making it impossible to clearly distinguish individuals or car registration numbers. Investigators were aware that the perpetrator could have used an alternative bridge across the <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">River Avon</a> less than a mile to the south to avoid CCTV coverage.

A <a href="Autopsy">post mortem examination</a> began on 26 December 2010, though results were delayed due to the frozen condition of the body. Police initially thought it possible that Yeates froze to death because her body showed no visible signs of injury. Investigators announced on 28 December 2010 that the case had become a murder inquiry as the pathologist who performed her autopsy determined that Yeates had died as a result of strangulation. The post mortem indicated that she had died "... several days before being discovered" on 25 December 2010. The examination also confirmed that Yeates did not eat the pizza she had purchased. Detective Chief Inspector Jones stated that the investigation found "... no evidence to suggest that Joanna was sexually assaulted". The police searched Reardon's laptop computer and mobile phone as part of standard procedure. Reardon was ruled out as a suspect and treated as a witness.

A young woman attending a party at a neighbouring house on Canynge Road on the night of Yeates' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00¬†pm coming from the direction of Yeates' flat. Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates' home said that he heard a woman's voice scream "Help me", although he could not recall exactly when the incident had occurred. Officers removed the front door to Yeates' flat to check for clothing fibres and <a href="DNA">DNA</a> evidence, with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home.

Senior officers from the investigation asked for assistance from the <a href="National%20Policing%20Improvement%20Agency">National Policing Improvement Agency</a>, which provides expertise for difficult cases. On 4 January 2011, a clinical <a href="forensic%20psychology">forensic psychologist</a>, who had previously been involved as a <a href="offender%20profiling">criminal profiler</a> in other high-profile murder cases, joined the investigation to help narrow down the number of potential suspects. Jones stated that his officers had established over 1,000 lines of inquiry. Jones said, "I can assure you, we are determined to solve this crime and bring Jo's killers to justice." On 5 January, Detective Chief Inspector Jones announced that one of Yeates' socks was missing when she was found dead and that it had not been found at the crime scene or in her home.

Police launched a national <a href="advertising%20campaign">advertising campaign</a> to appeal for witnesses through <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>. The page, established on 4 January, had been viewed nearly 250,000 times by the following day, while CCTV footage of Yeates had been viewed 120,000 times on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> by 5 January.

On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP <a href="Kerry%20McCarthy">Kerry McCarthy</a> gave her support to the idea of a public DNA screening process if the police found it useful. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of Louise Smith. McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton to the wider Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential <a href="DNA%20profiling">profile</a>. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred <a href="registered%20sex%20offender">registered sex offender</a>s living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.

Shortly after 7:00 am on 30 December 2010, Christopher Jefferies, Yeates' landlord who lived in the same building, was arrested on suspicion of her murder. He was taken to a local police station for questioning while forensic investigators inspected his flat. On 31 December, a senior police officer granted investigators a 12-hour extension to the arrest, enabling them to hold him in custody for additional questioning. Police subsequently applied to magistrates for further extensions which were granted on 31 December and 1 January. Investigators were able to <a href="Powers%20of%20the%20police%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">detain him as a suspect</a> for up to 96 hours, but released Jefferies on bail after two days. He retained the legal services of the law firm Stokoe Partnership to act on his behalf. On 4 March 2011, police released him from bail and stated he was no longer a suspect. He subsequently won an undisclosed sum in <a href="libel">libel</a> damages for defamatory news articles published following his arrest, and received an apology from Avon and Somerset Police for any distress caused to him during the investigation.

In January 2011, a <a href="crime%20reconstruction">reconstruction</a> of the case was filmed on location in Bristol for broadcast in the 26 January edition of the BBC television programme "Crimewatch". <a href="Snow%20Business%20%28company%29">Snow Business</a>, a Gloucestershire-based firm that had been involved in the production of the <a href="Harry%20Potter%20%28film%20series%29">"Harry Potter" films</a> was contracted to reproduce the snowy conditions at the time of Yeates' disappearance. The reconstruction of Yeates' last movements was filmed on 18 January, and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production, over 300 people contacted the police. A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates' body might have been transported in a large <a href="holdall">holdall</a> or suitcase.

On the morning of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old engineer Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the suspect was being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on "Crimewatch". Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was believed to have been staying, about a mile away. Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands.

Following Tabak's arrest, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> cancelled its plans to air the Yeates re-enactment on "Crimewatch". On 31 January, previously unseen photos of Yeates were released through the programme's website.

DNA tests were carried out by <a href="LGC%20Forensics">LGC Forensics</a>, a private company which undertakes forensic analysis for criminal investigations. Lindsey Lennen, a body fluids and DNA specialist member of the team that analysed DNA samples from Yeates' body, said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak, they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated. The team deployed a method known as DNA SenCE, which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration: "We couldn't say whether the DNA was from saliva, or semen, or even touch. But we could say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion."

After questioning during 96 hours of detention, Tabak was charged on 22 January 2011 with the murder of Joanna Yeates. He made a brief appearance at Bristol's <a href="Magistrates%27%20Court%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Magistrates' Court</a> on 24 January and was remanded in custody. Tabak, legally represented by Paul Cook, declined to request bail during a hearing the following day. Tabak was moved from <a href="Bristol%20%28HM%20Prison%29">Bristol Prison</a> because of fears for his safety, and was placed under <a href="suicide%20watch">suicide watch</a> at <a href="Long%20Lartin%20%28HM%20Prison%29">Long Lartin Prison</a> near <a href="Evesham">Evesham</a>. Tabak's family and friends in the Netherlands started to raise funds for his court defence.

Tabak initially maintained he was not responsible for Joanna Yeates' death, claiming that DNA evidence linking him to the crime had been fabricated by corrupt officials. However, on 8 February, he told Peter Brotherton, a <a href="Prison%20religion">prison chaplain</a>, that he had killed her and intended to plead guilty.

On 5 May 2011, Vincent Tabak pleaded guilty to the <a href="Manslaughter%20in%20English%20law">manslaughter</a> of Yeates, but denied murdering her. His plea of guilty to manslaughter was rejected by the <a href="Crown%20Prosecution%20Service">Crown Prosecution Service</a>. On 20 September, Tabak appeared in person at a pre-trial hearing at <a href="Bristol%20Crown%20Court">Bristol Crown Court</a>. Appearances at previous hearings had been made via videolink from prison.

Vincent Tabak (born 10 February 1978) was a Dutch engineer who had lived and worked in the United Kingdom since 2007. The youngest of five siblings, he was raised in <a href="Uden">Uden</a>, 21 miles (34¬†km) north of <a href="Eindhoven">Eindhoven</a>. Tabak's childhood next-door neighbour, John Massoeurs, described him after the trial as an intelligent "introverted" loner. Tabak studied at <a href="Eindhoven%20University%20of%20Technology">Eindhoven University of Technology</a> beginning in 1996, graduating with an <a href="Master%20of%20Science">MSc</a> in architecture, building and planning in 2003, then began a <a href="PhD">PhD</a> in which his thesis was a study of how people use space in office buildings and public areas. The paper was published in 2008.

Leaving university in 2007, he moved to the United Kingdom after taking a job at the headquarters of <a href="Buro%20Happold">Buro Happold</a>, an engineering consultancy firm in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, and settled in a flat in the town. He worked as a "people flow analyst", a role which required him to examine how people move around public spaces such as schools, airports and sports stadia. While living in Bath he established a relationship with a woman he first met through "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s online dating website "Soulmates". She was later described by the newspaper as his first serious girlfriend; he paid tribute to her in the acknowledgements of his thesis: "I am very happy she entered my life." The couple moved to a flat in Canynge Road, Bristol, in June 2009. Although Joanna Yeates and her partner moved into the neighbouring flat in Canynge Road in late 2010, she and Tabak did not meet prior to 17 December.

After killing Yeates, Tabak attempted to cast suspicion for the murder onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with relatives in the Netherlands. He contacted Avon and Somerset Police to tell them that Jefferies had been using his car on the night of 17 December, and a CID officer, DC Karen Thomas, was sent to Amsterdam to talk to him. They met at <a href="Amsterdam%20Schiphol%20Airport">Amsterdam Schiphol Airport</a> on 31 December, where Tabak elaborated on his story, but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic work being carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a previous statement.

In the months leading up to Yeates' death, Tabak had used his computer to research escort agencies during business trips in the United Kingdom and United States, and contacted several sex workers by phone. He also viewed violent <a href="internet%20pornography">internet pornography</a> that depicted women being controlled by men, showing images of them being bound and gagged, held by the neck and choked. During the murder investigation, police found images of a woman who bore a striking resemblance to Yeates. In one scene she was shown pulling up a pink top to expose her bra and breasts. When Yeates was discovered, she was wearing a similarly arranged pink top.

At Tabak's trial, prosecuting barrister Nigel Lickley QC, argued that the evidence of Tabak's activities should be provided to the jury: "It might shed light on the need to hold a woman for long enough and the need to squeeze hard enough to take her life." Details of Tabak's viewing of pornography were not included in the prosecution's case since the judge believed it did not prove that Tabak had acted with <a href="Premeditated%20murder">premeditation</a>.

After the trial it emerged that <a href="child%20pornography">pornographic images of children</a> had been found on Tabak's laptop. In December 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that he would be prosecuted for possessing the images. On 2 March 2015, Tabak pleaded guilty to possessing more than 100 indecent images of children, and was sentenced to 10 months in prison, to run concurrently with his existing life sentence for murder.

The trial of Vincent Tabak started on 4 October 2011 at the Crown Court at Bristol before Mr Justice Field and a jury. His counsel in the trial was William Clegg <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a> and the prosecutor was Nigel Lickley QC. Tabak pleaded guilty to <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>, but denied murder.

The prosecution case was that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat within minutes of her arrival home on 17 December 2010, using "sufficient force" to kill her. The prosecutors stated that Tabak ‚Äì around a foot (30¬†cm) taller than Yeates ‚Äì had used his height and build to overpower her, pinning her to the floor by the wrists, and that she had suffered 43 separate injuries to her head, neck, torso and arms during the struggle. The injuries included cuts, bruises, and a fractured nose. Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy, and her death would have been slow and painful. However, he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak's initial attack on Yeates.

Evidence was presented that Tabak had then tried to conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard that DNA swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated she may have been held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.

In his defence, Tabak claimed that the killing had not been sexually motivated, and told the court that he had killed Yeates while trying to silence her after she screamed when he tried to kiss her. He claimed that Yeates had made a "flirty comment" and invited him to drink with her. He said that after she screamed he held his hands over her mouth and around her neck to silence her. He denied suggestions of a struggle, claiming to have held Yeates by the neck with only minimal force, and "... for about 20 seconds". He told the court that after dumping the body he was "... in a state of panic".

The jury was sent out to deliberate on 26 October, and returned with a verdict two days later. On 28 October 2011, Tabak was found guilty of Joanna Yeates' murder by a 10 to 2 majority verdict. He was <a href="life%20sentence">jailed for life</a>, with a minimum term of 20 years. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Field referred to a "sexual element" to the killing.

The manner in which certain aspects of the case were reported by the British media led to television broadcaster <a href="ITN">ITN</a> being temporarily banned from attending press conferences, and the instigation of legal proceedings against several newspapers by both Yeates' former landlord, and the Attorney General.

Following a television news report on 4 January 2011 that criticised the handling of the investigation, ITN reporters were banned by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary from attending a press conference convened to give updates on the murder case. The item, presented by journalist <a href="Geraint%20Vincent">Geraint Vincent</a>, claimed police had made little progress with their investigation, and questioned whether they were following correct procedural methods. A former murder squad detective told the report that "certain routine inquiries" such as looking for fresh evidence at the crime scene were not being carried out. ITN accused the police of attempting "to censor what information we can broadcast" while the constabulary filed a complaint with the <a href="Ofcom">Office of Communications</a>, calling the broadcast "unfair, na√Øve and irresponsible reporting". The police subsequently lifted the sanctions against ITN, but said that they would "not hesitate to adopt similar tactics in the future." Legal action was also considered over a <a href="Twitter">tweet</a> revealing that Tabak had viewed internet pornography showing <a href="erotic%20asphyxiation">erotic asphyxiation</a> and <a href="Bondage%20%28sexual%29">bondage</a>. The contempt of court charges were dropped after the tweet was removed.

Writing in London's "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" on 5 January 2011, media commentator <a href="Roy%20Greenslade">Roy Greenslade</a> expressed concern over a number of negative articles that had appeared in newspapers concerning Yeates' landlord, Jefferies, following his arrest, describing the coverage as "character assassination on a large scale". He cited several examples of headlines and stories that had been published, including a headline in "The Sun" describing Jefferies¬†‚Äì a former schoolmaster at <a href="Clifton%20College">Clifton College</a>¬†‚Äì as weird, posh, lewd and creepy; a story from the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" quoting unnamed former pupils referring to him as "... a sort of Nutty Professor" who made them feel "creeped out" by his "strange" behaviour; and an article from the "Daily Telegraph", which reported Jefferies "has been described by pupils at Clifton College ... as a fan of dark and violent <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> films". Jefferies launched legal action against six newspapers on 21 April¬†‚Äì "The Sun", the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>", the "<a href="Daily%20Star%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Daily Star</a>", the "Daily Express", the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" and the "<a href="Daily%20Record%20%28Scotland%29">Daily Record</a>"¬†‚Äì seeking damages for libel. It was held that the media were quick to jump to conclusions regarding Jefferies' arrest. Being a retired English teacher who lived alone, whose physical appearance and "eccentrically unkempt white hair," made him stand out, led people to believe that he looked the type. Stephen Moss wrote in "The Guardian": "The unspoken assumption was that no one could look that odd and be innocent."

He was represented by Louis Charalambous of the law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton, who in 2008 had successfully acted for Robert Murat after he became a suspect during the investigation into the <a href="disappearance%20of%20Madeleine%20McCann">disappearance of Madeleine McCann</a> and had faced similar media scrutiny. On 29 July Jefferies accepted "substantial" <a href="damages">damages</a> for <a href="English%20defamation%20law">defamation</a> from "The Sun", the "Daily Mirror", the "<a href="Sunday%20Mirror">Sunday Mirror</a>", the "Daily Record", the "Daily Mail", the "Daily Express", the "Daily Star" and "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>" in connection with their coverage of his arrest. In an interview following Tabak's conviction, Jefferies commented: "It has taken up a whole year virtually of my life, that period of time has meant that everything else that I would normally be doing has been in abeyance." He criticised the government's plans to change the law on <a href="legal%20aid">legal aid</a>, which he said would prevent people with limited means from taking action against newspapers.

<a href="Dominic%20Grieve">Dominic Grieve</a>, the <a href="Attorney%20General%20for%20England%20and%20Wales">Attorney General for England and Wales</a>, stated on 31 December 2010 that he was considering action under the <a href="Contempt%20of%20court%23England">Contempt of Court Act 1981</a> to enforce the obligation of the media not to prejudice a possible future trial. <a href="Criminology">Criminology</a> professor <a href="David%20Wilson%20%28criminologist%29">David Wilson</a> commented on the resonance of the murder case with the national news media: "The British public loves a whodunnit ... It's a particularly British thing. We were the first nation to use murder stories to sell newspapers and that culture is more ingrained here than elsewhere." Wilson called Yeates, a <a href="missing%20white%20woman%20syndrome">white female professional</a>, an "ideal victim" for the media. On 1 January, Yeates' boyfriend Greg Reardon commented on the media coverage surrounding the arrest of Jefferies: "Jo's life was cut short tragically but the finger-pointing and character assassination by social and news media of as yet innocent men has been shameful."

On 12 May 2011, the <a href="Administrative%20Court%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Administrative Court</a> granted the Attorney General permission to move a motion for committal for contempt of court against "The Sun" and the "Daily Mirror" for the way they had reported the arrest of Jefferies. On 29 July, the court (<a href="Igor%20Judge%2C%20Baron%20Judge">Lord Judge</a> <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">CJ</a>, <a href="John%20Thomas%2C%20Baron%20Thomas%20of%20Cwmgiedd">Thomas LJ</a> and <a href="Robert%20Owen%20%28judge%29">Owen J</a>) ruled that both newspapers had been in contempt of court, and fined the "Daily Mirror" ¬£50,000 and "The Sun" ¬£18,000. The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Judge, stated that "in our judgment, as a matter of principle, the vilification of a suspect under arrest is a potential impediment to the course of justice." The publishers of "The Sun" and the "Daily Mirror" subsequently appealed their fines, but the "Mirror" case was rejected by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Supreme Court of England and Wales</a> on 9 March 2012, whilst "The Sun" withdrew its appeal.

The Yeates case was mentioned during a Parliamentary debate on a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> that would have imposed a sentence of six-months imprisonment on any journalist who names an uncharged suspect. The proposed legislation was introduced into the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">House of Commons</a> in June 2010, by <a href="Anna%20Soubry">Anna Soubry</a>, the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MP for <a href="Broxtowe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Broxtowe</a>, a former journalist and criminal law barrister. In a debate on 4 February 2011 Soubry told the House: "What we saw in Bristol was, in effect, a feeding frenzy and vilification. Much of the coverage was not only completely irrelevant, but there was a <a href="homophobic">homophobic</a> tone to it which I found deeply offensive. The slurs on the man were out of order." She withdrew the proposal after encountering opposition from the <a href="Cameron%E2%80%93Clegg%20coalition">Conservative-led coalition government</a>.

Jefferies gave evidence to the <a href="Leveson%20Inquiry">Leveson Inquiry</a>, established by Prime Minister <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> to investigate the ethics and behaviour of the British media following the <a href="News%20International%20phone%20hacking%20scandal">"News of the World" phone hacking affair</a>. Jefferies told the inquiry that reporters had "besieged" him after he was questioned by the police; he said: "It was clear that the tabloid press had decided that I was guilty of Miss Yeates' murder and seemed determined to persuade the public of my guilt. They embarked on a frenzied campaign to blacken my character by publishing a series of very serious allegations about me which were completely untrue." Appearing before the same inquiry on 16 January 2012, the "Daily Mirror" editor, <a href="Richard%20Wallace%20%28journalist%29">Richard Wallace</a>, described the newspaper's coverage of Jefferies' arrest as a "black mark" on his editing record.

Associate <a href="vicar">vicar</a> Dan Clark led a memorial service for Yeates at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Clifton%20Down">Christ Church</a> in Clifton on 2 January 2011. Prayers for her were also said at the church on 17 December 2011, the first anniversary of her death, while visitors left tributes and messages of condolence for her family. Greg Reardon started a charity website in Yeates' memory to raise funds on behalf of families of missing people. Yeates' friends and family planted a memorial garden at the <a href="Sir%20Harold%20Hillier%20Gardens">Sir Harold Hillier Gardens</a> in Romsey where she had worked as a student. Building Design Partnership and the local <a href="NHS%20trust">NHS trust</a> announced plans to commemorate her with a memorial in a garden she had been designing for a new ¬£430 million hospital in <a href="Southmead">Southmead</a>, Bristol.

Other plans for memorials included a garden of remembrance at the BDP firm's studio in Bristol, a published anthology of Yeates' work and an annual landscape design prize named after her for students of the University of Gloucestershire. BDP announced it would dedicate a charity cycle ride between its offices on its 50th anniversary, with proceeds to go to charities selected by her family. Yeates left behind an estate valued at ¬£47,000, which included money set aside to purchase a home with Reardon. As she had <a href="intestacy">not written</a> a <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a>, the sum was inherited by her parents.

Following the release of her body on 31 January 2011, Yeates' family arranged to hold her funeral at St Mark's of <a href="Ampfield">Ampfield</a>, Hampshire, and have her interred in the churchyard. Yeates was buried on 11 February; approximately 300 people attended the service, which was led by vicar Peter Gilks.

In 2013, <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> commissioned a drama about Jefferies' arrest. Filming of the two-part series, starring <a href="Jason%20Watkins%20%28actor%29">Jason Watkins</a> in the leading role, began in November. The "<a href="Bristol%20Post">Bristol Post</a>" reported that Jefferies had read and approved the script, and supported the project. The drama, titled "The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies", aired on 10 and 11 December 2014. In May 2015, it won two awards at the <a href="2015%20British%20Academy%20Television%20Awards">2015 British Academy Television Awards</a>‚Äîbest mini-series for the programme itself, and best actor for Watkins' portrayal of Jefferies. On 26 March 2015, the case was the subject of an episode of the <a href="Channel%205%20%28UK%29">Channel 5</a> documentary series "Countdown to Murder", titled "The Killer Next Door: The Last Hours of Joanna Yeates".
Jefferies has since given his account of what happened, and described to the press in 2014 the mental strain the investigation had on his life for over two months. Jefferies said: "At the time it felt as if the police were deliberately playing a game - promising the ordeal would soon be over and then finding it necessary to prolong the wait. It was a form of psychological torture. At such times the mind plays tricks, and one starts to believe that perhaps one is a criminal without knowing it and that, as in some Kafkaesque nightmare, guilt has been pre-ordained and the sentence is inescapable."

The following locations were pertinent to the investigation:

Singapore strategy

The Singapore strategy was a naval defence policy of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> that evolved in a series of <a href="Military%20operation%20plan">war plans</a> from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Empire of Japan</a> by providing for a base for a fleet of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base; <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, at the eastern end of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a>, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defences over the next two decades.

The planners envisaged that a war with Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the <a href="Japanese%20home%20islands">Japanese home islands</a> to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware of the impact of a blockade on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.

The Singapore strategy was the cornerstone of British Imperial defence policy in the Far East during the 1920s and 1930s. By 1937, according to <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Stephen%20Roskill">Stephen Roskill</a>, "the concept of the 'Main Fleet to Singapore' had, perhaps through constant repetition, assumed something of the inviolability of Holy Writ". A combination of financial, political and practical difficulties ensured that it could not be successfully implemented. During the 1930s, the strategy came under sustained criticism in Britain and abroad, particularly in Australia, where the Singapore strategy was used as an excuse for parsimonious defence policies. The strategy ultimately led to the despatch of <a href="Force%20Z">Force Z</a> to Singapore and the <a href="sinking%20of%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20and%20Repulse">sinking of the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse"</a> by Japanese air attack on 10 December 1941. The subsequent ignominious <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">fall of Singapore</a> was described by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> as "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history".

After the First World War, the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>'s <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> that had challenged the Royal Navy for supremacy was <a href="Scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">scuttled in Scapa Flow</a>, but the Royal Navy was already facing serious challenges to its position as the world's most powerful fleet from the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. The United States' determination to create what <a href="Admiral%20of%20the%20Navy">Admiral of the Navy</a> <a href="George%20Dewey">George Dewey</a> called "a navy second to none" presaged a new maritime <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a>.

The <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> was smaller than the Royal Navy in 1919, but ships laid down under its wartime construction program were still being launched, and their more recent construction gave the American ships a technological edge. The "<a href="Two-Power%20Standard">two-power standard</a>" of 1889 called for a Royal Navy strong enough to take on any two other powers. In 1909, this was scaled back to a policy of 60% superiority in <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s. Rising tensions over the U.S. Navy's building program led to heated arguments between the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Rosslyn%20Wemyss">Rosslyn Wemyss</a>, and the <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Benson">William S. Benson</a> in March and April 1919, although, as far back as 1909, the government directed that the United States was not to be regarded as a potential enemy. This decision was reaffirmed by <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> in August 1919 in order to preclude the U.S. Navy's building program from becoming a justification for the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> initiating one of its own. In 1920, the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a> Sir <a href="Walter%20Long%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Long">Walter Long</a> announced a "one-power standard", under which the policy was to maintain a navy "not¬†... inferior in strength to the Navy of any other power". The one-power standard became official when it was publicly announced at the <a href="1921%20Imperial%20Conference">1921 Imperial Conference</a>. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 reinforced this policy.

The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s met at the 1921 Imperial Conference to determine a unified international policy, particularly the relationship with the United States and Japan. The most urgent issue was that of whether or not to renew the <a href="Anglo-Japanese%20Alliance">Anglo-Japanese Alliance</a>, which was due to expire on 13 July 1921. On one side were the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a> <a href="Billy%20Hughes">Billy Hughes</a> and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Prime Minister of New Zealand</a> <a href="Bill%20Massey">Bill Massey</a>, who strongly favoured its renewal. Neither wanted their countries to be caught up in a war between the United States and Japan, and contrasted the generous assistance that Japan rendered during the First World War with the United States' disengagement from international affairs in its aftermath. "The British Empire", declared Hughes, "must have a reliable friend in the Pacific". They were opposed by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Meighen">Arthur Meighen</a>, on the grounds that the alliance would adversely affect the relationship with the United States, which Canada depended upon for its security. As a result, no decision to renew was reached, and the alliance was allowed to expire.

The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> in 1922 provided for a 5:5:3 ratio of capital ships of the British, United States and Japanese navies. Throughout the 1920s, the Royal Navy remained the world's largest navy, with a comfortable margin of superiority over Japan, which was regarded as the most likely adversary. The Washington Naval Treaty also prohibited the fortification of islands in the Pacific, but Singapore was specifically excluded. The provisions of the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaty</a> of 1930, however, restricted naval construction, resulting in a serious decline in the British shipbuilding industry. Germany's willingness to limit the size of its navy led to the <a href="Anglo-German%20Naval%20Agreement">Anglo-German Naval Agreement</a> of 1935. This was seen as signalling a sincere desire to avoid conflict with Britain. In 1934, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir <a href="Ernle%20Chatfield%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chatfield">Ernle Chatfield</a>, began to press for a new naval build-up sufficient to fight both Japan and the strongest European power. He intended to accelerate construction to the maximum capacity of the shipyards, but the Treasury soon became alarmed at the potential cost of the program, which was costed at between ¬£88 and ¬£104 million. By 1938, the Treasury was losing its fight to stop <a href="Rearmament%20%28UK%2C%201930s%29">rearmament</a>; politicians and the public were more afraid of being caught unprepared for war with Germany and Japan than of a major financial crisis in the more distant future.

The Singapore strategy was a series of war plans that evolved over a twenty-year period in which the basing of a fleet at Singapore was a common but not a defining aspect. Plans were crafted for different contingencies, both defensive and offensive. Some were designed to defeat Japan, while others were merely to deter aggression.

In November 1918, the Australian <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29%23Ministers%20for%20the%20Navy">Minister for the Navy</a>, Sir <a href="Joseph%20Cook">Joseph Cook</a>, had asked Admiral <a href="John%20Rushworth%20Jellicoe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Jellicoe">Lord Jellicoe</a> to draw up a scheme for the Empire's naval defence. Jellicoe set out on a tour of the Empire in the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> in February 1919. He presented his report to the Australian government in August 1919. In a section of the report classified as secret, he advised that the interests of the British Empire and Japan would inevitably clash. He called for the creation of a British Pacific Fleet strong enough to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy, which he believed would require 8 battleships, 8 battlecruisers, 4 <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s, 10 <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, 40 <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, 36 <a href="submarines">submarines</a> and supporting auxiliaries.

Although he did not specify a location, Jellicoe noted that the fleet would require a major dockyard somewhere in the Far East. A paper entitled "The Naval Situation in the Far East" was considered by the <a href="Committee%20of%20Imperial%20Defence">Committee of Imperial Defence</a> in October 1919. In this paper the naval staff pointed out that maintaining the Anglo-Japanese Alliance might lead to war between the British Empire and the United States. In 1920, the Admiralty issued "War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920", a series of instructions in the event of a war with Japan. In it, the defence of Singapore was described as "absolutely essential". The strategy was presented to the Dominions at the <a href="1923%20Imperial%20Conference">1923 Imperial Conference</a>.

The authors of "War Memorandum (Eastern) 1920" divided a war with Japan into three phases. In the first phase, the garrison of Singapore would defend the fortress while the fleet made its way from home waters to Singapore. Next, the fleet would sail from Singapore and relieve or recapture Hong Kong. The final phase would see the fleet blockade Japan and force it to accept terms.

Most planning focused on the first phase, which was seen as the most critical. This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a <a href="Drydock%23Graving">graving dock</a> capable of taking battleships at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of <a href="Malta">Malta</a>. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific in case of a war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.
The estimate of how long it would take for the fleet to reach Singapore after the outbreak of hostilities varied. It had to include the time required to assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days.

To facilitate this movement, a series of oil storage facilities were constructed at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, Malta, <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a>, <a href="Port%20Sudan">Port Sudan</a>, <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, <a href="Rangoon">Rangoon</a>, Singapore, and Hong Kong. A complicating factor was that the battleships could not traverse the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> fully laden, so they would have to refuel on the other side. Singapore was to have storage for of oil. Secret bases were established at <a href="Kamaran">Kamaran Bay</a>, <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a> and <a href="Nancowry%20Island">Nancowry</a>. It was estimated that the fleet would require of oil per month, which would be transported in 60 <a href="Tanker%20%28ship%29">tankers</a>. Oil would be shipped in from the <a href="oil%20refinery">refineries</a> at <a href="Abadan%20Refinery">Abadan</a> and Rangoon, supplemented by buying up the entire output of the Netherlands East Indies.

The third phase received the least consideration, but naval planners were aware that Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of <a href="Manila">Manila</a> being used as a forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire, and felt that economic pressure would suffice.
Japan's vulnerability to blockade was studied. Using information supplied by the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> and the <a href="naval%20attach%C3%A9">naval attach√©</a> in Tokyo, the planners estimated that the British Empire accounted for around 27 per cent of Japan's imports. In most cases these imports could be replaced from sources in China and the United States. However, certain critical materials for which Japan relied heavily on imports were identified, including metals, machinery, chemicals, oil and rubber, and many of the best sources of these were under British control. Japan's access to neutral shipping could be restricted by refusing insurance to ships trading with Japan, and chartering ships to reduce the number available.

The problem with enforcing a close blockade with ships was that warships loitering off the coast of Japan would be vulnerable to attack by aircraft and submarines. Blockading Japanese ports with small ships was a possibility, but this would first require the destruction or neutralisation of the Japanese fleet, and it was far from certain that the Japanese fleet would place itself in a position where it could be destroyed. A plan was adopted for a more distant blockade, whereby ships bound for Japan would be intercepted as they passed through the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a> or the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. This would not cut off Japan's trade with China or Korea, and probably not with the United States either. The effectiveness of such a blockade was therefore questionable.

Rear Admiral Sir <a href="Herbert%20Richmond">Herbert Richmond</a>, the Commander in Chief, <a href="East%20Indies%20Station">East Indies Station</a>, noted that the logic was suspiciously circular:

The 1919 plans incorporated a Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation (MNBDO) which could develop and defend a forward base. The MNBDO had a strength of 7,000 and included a <a href="brigade">brigade</a> of <a href="antiaircraft%20artillery">antiaircraft artillery</a>, a brigade of <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> and a <a href="battalion">battalion</a> of infantry, all drawn from the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>. In one paper exercise, the Royal Marines occupied <a href="Nakagusuku%20Bay">Nakagusuku Bay</a> unopposed and the MNBDO developed a major base there from which the fleet blockaded Japan. Actual fleet exercises were conducted in the Mediterranean in the 1920s to test the MNBDO concept. However, the Royal Marines were not greatly interested in <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious warfare</a>, and lacking organisational backing, the techniques and tactics of amphibious warfare began to atrophy. By the 1930s the Admiralty was concerned that the United States and Japan were well ahead of Britain in this field and persuaded the Army and RAF to join with it in establishing the <a href="Inter-Service%20Training%20and%20Development%20Centre">Inter-Service Training and Development Centre</a>, which opened in July 1938. Under its first commandant, Captain <a href="Loben%20Edward%20Harold%20Maund">Loben Edward Harold Maund</a>, it began investigating the problems of amphibious warfare, including the design of <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a>.

Nor was this the only field in which the Royal Navy was lagging in the 1930s. In the 1920s, Colonel the <a href="Master%20of%20Sempill">Master of Sempill</a> led the semi-official <a href="Sempill%20Mission">Sempill Mission</a> to Japan to help the Imperial Japanese Navy establish an air arm. At the time the Royal Navy was the world leader in naval aviation. The Sempill mission taught advanced techniques such as carrier deck landing, conducted training with modern aircraft, and provided engines, ordnance and technical equipment. Within a decade, Japan had overtaken Britain. The Royal Navy pioneered the armoured flight deck, which enabled carriers to absorb damage, but resulted in limiting the number of aircraft that a carrier could operate. The Royal Navy had great faith in the ability of ships' antiaircraft batteries, and so saw little need for high performance fighters. To maximise the benefit of the small numbers of aircraft that could be carried, the Royal Navy developed multi-role aircraft such as the <a href="Blackburn%20Roc">Blackburn Roc</a>, <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a>, <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a>, <a href="Blackburn%20Skua">Blackburn Skua</a> and <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a>. As a result, the Royal Navy's aircraft were no match for their Japanese counterparts.

The possibility of Japan taking advantage of a war in Europe was foreseen. In June 1939, the <a href="Tientsin%20Incident">Tientsin Incident</a> demonstrated another possibility: that Germany might attempt to take advantage of a war in the Far East. In the event of a worst-case scenario of simultaneous war with Germany, Italy and Japan, two approaches were considered. The first was to reduce the war to one against Germany and Japan only by knocking Italy out of the conflict as quickly as possible. The former First Sea Lord, Sir <a href="Reginald%20Drax">Reginald Drax</a>, who was brought out of retirement to advise on strategy, called for a "flying squadron" of four or five battleships, along with an aircraft carrier, some cruisers and destroyers, to be sent to Singapore. Such a force would be too small to fight the Japanese main fleet, but could protect British trade in the Indian Ocean against <a href="commerce%20raiders">commerce raiders</a>. Drax argued that a small, fast force would be better in this role than a large, slow one. When more ships became available, it could become the nucleus of a full-sized battle fleet. Chatfield, now <a href="Minister%20for%20Coordination%20of%20Defence">Minister for Coordination of Defence</a>, disagreed with this concept. He felt that the flying squadron would become nothing more than a target for the Japanese fleet. Instead, he put forward a second approach, namely that the Mediterranean be abandoned and the fleet sent to Singapore.

Following surveys, a site at <a href="Sembawang">Sembawang</a> was chosen for a naval base. The <a href="Straits%20Settlements">Straits Settlements</a> made a free gift of of land for the site, and a sum of ¬£250,000 for construction of the base was donated by Hong Kong in 1925. That exceeded the United Kingdom's contribution that year of ¬£204,000 towards the floating dock. Another ¬£2,000,000 was paid by the <a href="Federated%20Malay%20States">Federated Malay States</a>, while New Zealand donated another ¬£1,000,000. The contract for construction of the naval dockyard was awarded to the lowest bidder, Sir John Jackson Limited, for ¬£3,700,000. Some of earth were moved to level the ground, and of marsh was filled in. The floating dock was constructed in England and towed to Singapore by Dutch tugboats. It was long and wide, making it one of the largest in the world. There would be of deep water quays, and supporting infrastructure including warehouses, workshops and hospitals.

To defend the naval base, heavy <a href="BL%2015%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">15-inch naval guns</a> (381.0¬†mm) were stationed at <a href="Johore%20battery">Johore battery</a>, <a href="Changi">Changi</a>, and at <a href="Buona%20Vista">Buona Vista</a> to deal with battleships. Medium <a href="BL%209.2%20inch%20gun%20Mk%20IX%E2%80%93X">BL 9.2 inch guns</a> (233.7¬†mm) were provided for dealing with smaller attackers. Batteries of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns and guns for dealing with raids were located at <a href="Fort%20Siloso">Fort Siloso</a>, <a href="Fort%20Canning">Fort Canning</a> and <a href="Fort%20Pasir%20Panjang">Labrador</a>. The five 15-inch guns were all surplus Navy guns, manufactured between 1903 and 1919. Part of their cost was met from a gift of ¬£500,000 from <a href="Sultan%20Ibrahim%20of%20Johor">Sultan Ibrahim of Johor</a> for the Silver Jubilee of the coronation <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a>. Three of the guns were given an all-round (360¬∞) traverse and subterranean magazines.

Aviation was not neglected. Plans called for an air force of 18 <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s, 18 reconnaissance <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, 18 <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s and 18 single-seat fighters to protect them. <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> airfields were established at <a href="RAF%20Tengah">RAF Tengah</a> and <a href="RAF%20Sembawang">RAF Sembawang</a>. The <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Air%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> <a href="Lord%20Trenchard">Lord Trenchard</a>, argued that 30 torpedo bombers could replace the 15-inch guns. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">Lord Beatty</a>, did not agree. A compromise was reached whereby the guns would be installed, but the issue was reconsidered when better torpedo planes became available. Test firings of 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns at Malta and <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> in 1926 indicated that greatly improved shells were required if the guns were to have a chance of hitting a battleship.

The King George VI dry dock was formally opened by the <a href="List%20of%20British%20Governors%20of%20the%20Straits%20Settlements">Governor of the Straits Settlements</a>, Sir <a href="Shenton%20Thomas">Shenton Thomas</a>, on 14 February 1938. Two squadrons of the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> provided a <a href="flypast">flypast</a>. The 42 vessels in attendance included three US Navy cruisers. The presence of this fleet gave an opportunity to conduct a series of naval, air and military exercises. The aircraft carrier was able to sail undetected to within of Singapore and launch a series of surprise raids on the RAF airfields. The local air commander, <a href="Air%20Vice-Marshal">Air Vice-Marshal</a> <a href="Arthur%20William%20Tedder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tedder">Arthur Tedder</a>, was greatly embarrassed. The local land commander, <a href="Major-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major-General</a> Sir <a href="William%20Dobbie">William Dobbie</a>, was no less disappointed by the performance of the anti-aircraft defences. Reports recommended the installation of <a href="radar">radar</a> on the island, but this was not done until 1941. The naval defences worked better, but a landing party from was still able to capture the <a href="Raffles%20Hotel">Raffles Hotel</a>. What most concerned Dobbie and Tedder was the possibility of the fleet being bypassed entirely by an overland invasion of <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a> from <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. Dobbie conducted an exercise in southern Malaya which demonstrated that the jungle was far from impassable. The <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> concluded that the Japanese would most likely land on the east coast of Malaya and advance on Singapore from the north.

In Australia the conservative <a href="Nationalist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Nationalist Party</a> government of <a href="Stanley%20Bruce">Stanley Bruce</a> latched onto the Singapore strategy, which called for reliance on the British navy, supported by a naval squadron as strong as Australia could afford. Between 1923 and 1929, ¬£20,000,000 was spent on the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN), while the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> and the munitions industry received only ¬£10,000,000 and the fledgling <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) just ¬£2,400,000. The policy had the advantage of pushing responsibility for Australian defence onto Britain. Unlike New Zealand, Australia declined to contribute to the cost of the base at Singapore. In petitioning a parsimonious government for more funds, the Australian Army had to refute the Singapore strategy, "an apparently well-argued and well-founded strategic doctrine that had been endorsed at the highest levels of imperial decision-making".

An alternative policy was put forward in 1923 by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a>, which was in <a href="Opposition%20%28parliamentary%29">opposition</a> for all but two years of the 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20Freeland%20Fullam">William Freeland Fullam</a>, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s and <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. The Labor Party's <a href="Albert%20Green%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Albert Green</a> noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost ¬£7,000,000 while an aircraft cost ¬£2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.

In September 1926, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Henry%20Wynter">Henry Wynter</a> gave a lecture to the <a href="Royal%20United%20Services%20Institute">United Services Institute</a> of Victoria entitled "The Strategical Inter-relationship of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force: an Australian View", which was published in the April 1927 edition of "British Army Quarterly". In this article Wynter argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe, which would prevent Britain from sending sufficient resources to Singapore. He contended that Singapore was vulnerable, especially to attack from the land and the air, and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN. "Henceforward", wrote Australian official historian Lionel Wigmore, "the attitude of the leading thinkers in the Australian Army towards British assurances that an adequate fleet would be sent to Singapore at the critical time was (bluntly stated): 'We do not doubt that you are sincere in your beliefs but, frankly, we do not think you will be able to do it.

<a href="Frederick%20Shedden">Frederick Shedden</a> wrote a paper putting the case for the Singapore strategy as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel <a href="John%20Lavarack">John Lavarack</a>, who had attended the <a href="Imperial%20Defence%20College">Imperial Defence College</a> class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure. When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in "British Army Quarterly" in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal. In 1936, the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Leaders%20of%20the%20Opposition">leader of the opposition</a> <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> read an article by Wynter in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post. Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General <a href="Ernest%20Squires">Ernest Squires</a>, to replace Lavarack as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>. Within months, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> was replaced with a British officer as well.

Successive New Zealand governments‚Äîthe <a href="Reform%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">Reform Government</a> of 1912‚Äì1928, <a href="United%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">United Government</a> in 1928‚Äì1931, <a href="United%E2%80%93Reform%20coalition%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">United-Reform Coalition Government</a> of 1931‚Äì1935, and the <a href="First%20Labour%20Government%20of%20New%20Zealand">First Labour Government</a> in 1935‚Äì1949‚Äîall supported the Singapore Strategy. The New Zealand financial contribution was eight annual payments of ¬£125,000, a million pounds in total, rather than the ¬£225,000 annually proposed by the Admiralty. Expansion of the New Zealand <a href="Devonport%20Naval%20Base">Devonport Naval Base</a> was also proposed, and in 1926 the alternative of a third cruiser was considered. Labour, on coming to power in 1935, gave more importance to a local air force, though later <a href="Walter%20Nash">Walter Nash</a> accepted the need to keep sea lanes open. There was little liaison with Australia; in 1938 New Zealand Chiefs of Staff papers were sent to London but not Australia. But by 1936 New Zealand military confidence in the Singapore Strategy was waning; with the possibility of Italy as well as Germany and Japan as enemies, in seemed likely that Britain would also be committed in the Mediterranean.

With war with Germany now a reality, Menzies sent <a href="Richard%20Casey%2C%20Baron%20Casey">Richard Casey</a> to London to seek reassurances about the defence of Australia in the event that Australian forces were sent to Europe or the Middle East. In November 1939, Australia and New Zealand were given reassurances that Singapore would not be allowed to fall, and that in the event of war with Japan, the defence of the Far East would take priority over the Mediterranean. This seemed possible as the <a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>, the German navy, was relatively small and France was an ally. Bruce, now <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20High%20Commissioners%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom</a>, and Casey met with British Cabinet ministers on 20 November and left with the impression that, despite the reassurances, the Royal Navy was not strong enough to deal with simultaneous crises in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Far East.

During 1940, the situation slowly but inexorably slid towards a worst-case scenario. In June, Italy joined the war on Germany's side and France was knocked out. The Chiefs of Staff Committee now reported:
There remained the prospect of American assistance. In secret talks in Washington, D.C., in June 1939, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral <a href="William%20D.%20Leahy">William D. Leahy</a> raised the possibility of an American fleet being sent to Singapore. In April 1940, the American naval attach√© in London, <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">Captain</a> <a href="Alan%20Kirk">Alan Kirk</a>, approached the <a href="List%20of%20senior%20officers%20of%20the%20Royal%20Navy%23Vice%20Chiefs%20of%20the%20Naval%20Staff">Vice Chief of the Naval Staff</a>, <a href="Vice%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Vice-Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Phillips%20%28Naval%20officer%29">Thomas Phillips</a>, to ask if, in the event of the <a href="United%20States%20Fleet">United States Fleet</a> being sent to the Far East, the docking facilities at Singapore could be made available, as those at <a href="Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> were inadequate. He received full assurances that they would be. Hopes for American assistance were dashed at the <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93British%20Staff%20Conference%20%28ABC%E2%80%931%29">staff conference</a> in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. The U.S. Navy was primarily focused on the Atlantic. The American chiefs envisaged relieving British warships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean so a British fleet could be sent to the Far East.

In July 1941, the Japanese occupied <a href="Cam%20Ranh%20Bay">Cam Ranh Bay</a>, which the British fleet had hoped to use on its northward drive. This put the Japanese uncomfortably close to Singapore. As diplomatic relations with Japan worsened, in August 1941, the Admiralty and the Chiefs of Staff began considering what ships could be sent. The Chiefs of Staff decided to recommend sending to the Far East from the Mediterranean, followed by four s that were refitting at home and in the United States, but "Barham" was sunk by a German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> in November 1941. Three weeks later the remaining two battleships at Alexandria, and were <a href="Raid%20on%20Alexandria%20%281941%29">seriously damaged by Italian human torpedoes</a>. While no more destroyers or cruisers were available, the Admiralty decided that an aircraft carrier, the small HMS "Eagle" could be sent.

<a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, now the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, noted that since the <a href="German%20battleship%20Tirpitz">German battleship "Tirpitz"</a> was tying up a superior British fleet, a small British fleet at Singapore might have a similar disproportionate effect on the Japanese. The <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> expressed the opinion that the presence of modern battleships at Singapore might deter Japan from entering the war. In October 1941, the Admiralty therefore ordered to depart for Singapore, where it would be joined by . The carrier was to join them, but it ran aground off <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> on 3 November, and no other carrier was available.

In August 1940, the Chiefs of Staff Committee reported that the force necessary to hold Malaya and Singapore in the absence of a fleet was 336 first-line aircraft and a garrison of nine brigades. Churchill then sent reassurances to the prime ministers of Australia and New Zealand that, if they were attacked, their defence would be a priority second only to that of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. A defence conference was held in Singapore in October 1940. Representatives from all three services attended, including Vice-Admiral Sir <a href="Geoffrey%20Layton">Geoffrey Layton</a> (Commander in Chief, <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>); the General Officer Commanding <a href="Malaya%20Command">Malaya Command</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="Lionel%20Bond">Lionel Bond</a>; and Air Officer Commanding the RAF in the Far East, Air Marshal <a href="John%20Tremayne%20Babington">John Tremayne Babington</a>. Australia was represented by its three deputy service chiefs, Captain <a href="Joseph%20Burnett">Joseph Burnett</a>, Major General <a href="John%20Northcott">John Northcott</a> and Air Commodore <a href="William%20Bostock">William Bostock</a>. Over ten days, they discussed the situation in the Far East. They estimated that the air defence of Burma and Malaya would require a minimum of 582 aircraft. By 7 December 1941, there were only 164 first-line aircraft on hand in Malaya and Singapore, and all the fighters were the obsolete <a href="Brewster%20F2A%20Buffalo">Brewster F2A Buffalo</a>. The land forces situation was not much better. There were only 31 battalions of infantry of the 48 required, and instead of two tank regiments, there were no tanks at all. Moreover, many of the units on hand were poorly trained and equipped. Yet during 1941 Britain had sent 676 aircraft and 446 tanks to the Soviet Union.

The Japanese were aware of the state of the Singapore defences. There were spies in Singapore, such as <a href="Captain%20%28Land%29">Captain</a> <a href="Patrick%20Stanley%20Vaughan%20Heenan">Patrick Heenan</a>, and a copy of the Chiefs of Staff's August 1940 appreciation was among the secret documents captured by the German <a href="Merchant%20raider">surface raider</a> "<a href="German%20auxiliary%20cruiser%20Atlantis">Atlantis</a>" from the on 11 November 1940. The report was handed over to the Japanese, and the detailed knowledge of Singapore's defences thus obtained may have encouraged the Japanese to attack.

On 8 December 1941, the Japanese occupied the <a href="Shanghai%20International%20Settlement">Shanghai International Settlement</a>. A couple of hours later, landings began at <a href="Kota%20Bharu">Kota Bharu</a> in Malaya. An hour after that, the Imperial Japanese Navy <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attacked Pearl Harbor</a>. On 10 December, "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse", sailing to meet the Malaya invasion force, <a href="Sinking%20of%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20and%20Repulse">were sunk by Japanese air attack</a>. After the disastrous <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malayan Campaign</a>, Singapore surrendered on 15 February 1942. During the final stages of the campaign, the 15-inch and 9.2-inch guns had bombarded targets at <a href="Johore%20Bahru">Johore Bahru</a>, <a href="RAF%20Tengah">RAF Tengah</a> and <a href="Bukit%20Timah">Bukit Timah</a>.

The <a href="fall%20of%20Singapore">fall of Singapore</a> was described by Winston Churchill as "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history". It was a profound blow to the prestige and morale of the British Empire. The promised fleet had not been sent, and the fortress that had been declared "impregnable" had been quickly captured. Nearly 139,000 troops were lost, of whom about 130,000 were captured. The 38,000 British casualties included most of the <a href="18th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 18th Infantry Division</a>, which had been ordered to Malaya in January. There were also 18,000 Australian casualties, including most of the <a href="8th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">Australian 8th Division</a>, and 14,000 local troops; but the majority of the defenders‚Äîsome 67,000 of them‚Äîwere from <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. About 40,000 of the Indian prisoners of war subsequently joined the Japanese-sponsored <a href="Indian%20National%20Army">Indian National Army</a>.

Richmond, in a 1942 article in "<a href="The%20Fortnightly%20Review">The Fortnightly Review</a>", charged that the loss of Singapore illustrated "the folly of not providing adequately for the command of the sea in a two-ocean war". He now argued that the Singapore strategy had been totally unrealistic. Privately he blamed politicians who had allowed Britain's sea power to be run down. The resources provided for the defence of Malaya were inadequate to hold Singapore, and the manner in which those resources were employed was frequently wasteful, inefficient and ineffective.

The disaster had both political and military dimensions. In Parliament, Churchill suggested that an official inquiry into the disaster should be held after the war. When this wartime speech was published in 1946, the Australian government asked if the British government still intended to conduct the inquiry. The Joint Planning Staff considered the matter, and recommended that no inquiry be held, as it would not be possible to restrict its focus to the events surrounding the fall of Singapore, and it would inevitably have to examine the political, diplomatic and military circumstances of the Singapore strategy over a period of many years. Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> accepted this advice, and no inquiry was ever held.

In Australia and New Zealand, after years of reassurances, there was a sense of betrayal. According to one historian, "In the end, no matter how you cut it, the British let them down". The defeat would affect politics for decades. In a speech in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">Australian House of Representatives</a> in 1992, Prime Minister <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a> cited the sense of betrayal:

A fleet was necessary for the defeat of Japan, and eventually a sizeable one, the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>, did go to the Far East, where it fought alongside the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>. The closer relations that developed between the two navies prior to the outbreak of war with Japan, and the alliance that developed from it afterwards, became the most positive and enduring strategic legacy of the Singapore strategy.

The Singapore Naval Base suffered little damage in the fighting and became the Imperial Japanese Navy's most important facility outside of the Japanese home islands. The 15-inch guns were sabotaged by the British before the fall of Singapore, and four of them were deemed beyond repair and scrapped by the Japanese. The floating dry dock was scuttled by the British, but raised by the Japanese. It was damaged beyond repair by a raid by <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a>es in February 1945, and ultimately towed out to sea and dumped in 1946. The Royal Navy retook possession of the Singapore base in 1945.

In 1958, the Singapore strategy was revived in the form of <a href="Operation%20Mastodon">Operation Mastodon</a>, a plan to deploy <a href="V%20bomber">V bomber</a>s of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a> equipped with <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s to Singapore as part of Britain's contribution to the defence of the region under <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO). Once again, there were formidable logistical problems. As the V¬†bombers could not fly all the way to Singapore, a new staging base was developed at <a href="RAF%20Gan">RAF Gan</a> in the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a>. RAF Tengah's runway was too short for V¬†bombers, so <a href="RAF%20Butterworth">RAF Butterworth</a> had to be used until it could be lengthened. The basing of nuclear armed aircraft, and the stockpiling of nuclear weapons without consultation with the local authorities soon ran into political complications.

Mastodon called for the deployment of two squadrons of eight <a href="Handley%20Page%20Victor">Handley Page Victor</a>s to Tengah and one of eight <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a>s to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, most of which were of the old <a href="Blue%20Danube%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Blue Danube</a> type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter <a href="Red%20Beard%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">Red Beard tactical nuclear weapons</a> to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each V¬†bomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the V¬†bomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.

In the meantime, the Royal Navy deployed the aircraft carrier with Red Beards and nuclear-capable <a href="Supermarine%20Scimitar">Supermarine Scimitar</a>s to the Far East in 1960. As with the original Singapore strategy, there were doubts as to whether 24 V¬†bombers could be spared in the event of a crisis dire enough to require them, especially after China's acquisition of nuclear weapons in 1964. As the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation</a> heated up in 1963, Bomber Command sent detachments of Victors and Vulcans to the Far East. Over the next three years, four V¬†bombers were permanently stationed there, with squadrons in the United Kingdom rotating detachments. In April 1965, <a href="No.%2035%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 35 Squadron RAF</a> carried out a rapid deployment of its eight Vulcans to RAAF Butterworth and RAF Tengah. Air Chief Marshal Sir <a href="John%20Grandy">John Grandy</a> reported that the V¬†bombers "provided a valuable <a href="Deterrence%20theory">deterrent</a> to confrontation being conducted on a large scale".

In 1965, racial, political, and personal tensions led to <a href="Singapore%20in%20Malaysia">Singapore seceding from Malaysia</a> and becoming an independent country. With the end of the confrontation, the last V¬†bombers were withdrawn in 1966. The following year, the British government announced its intention to withdraw its forces from <a href="East%20of%20Suez">East of Suez</a>. The Singapore Naval Base was handed over to the <a href="government%20of%20Singapore">government of Singapore</a> on 8 December 1968, and <a href="SembCorp%20Marine">Sembawang Shipyard</a> subsequently became the basis of a successful ship repair industry. The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.

Alcathoe bat

The Alcathoe bat ("Myotis alcathoe") is a European <a href="bat">bat</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Mouse-eared%20bat">Myotis</a>". Known only from Greece and Hungary when it was first described in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the <a href="whiskered%20bat">whiskered bat</a> ("Myotis mystacinus") and other <a href="species">species</a> and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> and <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to <a href="Geoffroy%27s%20bat">Geoffroy's bat</a> ("Myotis emarginatus"), other analyses do not support a close relationship between "M.¬†alcathoe" and any other species.

With a forearm length of and body mass of , "Myotis alcathoe" is a small bat. The fur is usually reddish-brown on the upperparts and brown below, but more grayish in juveniles. The <a href="tragus%20%28anatomy%29">tragus</a> (a projection on the inner side of the ear) is short, as is the ear itself, and the inner side of the ear is pale at the base. The <a href="Bat%23Wings">wings</a> are brown and the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) is short and broad. "M.¬†alcathoe" has a very high-pitched <a href="animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> call, with a frequency that falls from 120¬†<a href="kilohertz">kHz</a> at the beginning of the call to about 43¬†kHz at the end.

Usually found in <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth</a> <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a> near water, "Myotis alcathoe" forages high in the <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> and above water and mostly <a href="insectivore">eats flies</a>. The animal roosts in cavities high in trees. Although there are some winter records from caves, it may also spend the winter in tree cavities. Several <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> have been recorded on "M.¬†alcathoe". The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> assesses "Myotis alcathoe" as "<a href="data%20deficient">data deficient</a>", but it is considered <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> in several areas because of its rarity and vulnerability to <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a>.

The <a href="whiskered%20bat">whiskered bat</a> ("Myotis mystacinus") and similar species in Eurasia (collectively known as "whiskered bats") are difficult to distinguish from each other; for example, the distantly related <a href="Brandt%27s%20bat">Brandt's bat</a> ("Myotis brandtii") was not recognized as distinct from "M.¬†mystacinus" until the 1970s. Small, unusual "M.¬†mystacinus"-like bats were first recorded in Greece in the 1970s, but it was not until the advent of genetic studies that these bats could be confirmed as representing a distinct species, named "Myotis alcathoe". In 2001, the species was described by German zoologists Otto von Helversen and Klaus-Gerhard Heller on the basis of specimens from Greece and Hungary. Although it also differs from other whiskered bats by <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> characters, "Myotis alcathoe" is most clearly distinct in its genetics, including <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s and the location of the <a href="nucleolus%20organizer%20region">nucleolus organizer region</a>s. Two studies used microsatellite markers on European whiskered bats: the first one used western European samples and recovered three well-defined species clusters for "M. alcathoe", "M. brandtii" and "M. mystacinus"; the other one, conducted in Poland, suggesting a high level of <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a> with other whiskered bats that would further complicate attempts to identify "M.¬†alcathoe" morphologically.

Von Helversen and Heller argued that none of the old names now considered <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a> of "M.¬†mystacinus" could apply to "M.¬†alcathoe", because these names all have their <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type localities</a> in western or central Europe. However, the more recent discovery of "M.¬†alcathoe" further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered. In addition, Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name "caucasicus" Tsytsulina, 2000 (originally proposed for a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "M.¬†mystacinus" from the Caucasus) may prove to be applicable to "M. alcathoe"; in that case, the species would be renamed "Myotis caucasicus". The species may have remained undetected in Germany for so long because bat researchers did not sample its preferred habitats and would dismiss unusual-looking whiskered bats as being abnormal "M.¬†mystacinus" or "M.¬†brandtii".

On the basis of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequence analysis, "Myotis alcathoe" first appeared close to <a href="Geoffroy%27s%20bat">Geoffroy's bat</a> ("Myotis emarginatus") of southern Europe, North Africa, and southwestern Asia. However, a study of the mitochondrial <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> gene incorporating many "Myotis" species did not support this relationship, and could not place "M.¬†alcathoe" securely at a specific position among Eurasian "Myotis". Two groups with slightly divergent mitochondrial DNA sequences (separated by 1.3 to 1.4% sequence divergence) are distinguishable within the species, which probably correspond to different <a href="refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">glacial refugia</a> where "M.¬†alcathoe" populations survived the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. One, known as the "Hungarian" group, has been recorded from Spain, France, Austria, Hungary, and Slovakia, and probably corresponds to a refugium in Iberia; the other, the "Greek" group, is known only from Greece and Slovakia.

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "alcathoe", refers to <a href="Alcathoe">Alcathoe</a>, a figure from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> who was turned into a bat when she refused the advances of the god <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. She was associated with gorges and small streams, the preferred habitat of "Myotis alcathoe" in Greece. In their original description, von Helversen and colleagues described her as a <a href="nymph">nymph</a>, and the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "nymph bat" has therefore been used for this species. However, none of the classical sources speak of Alcathoe as a nymph; instead, she was a princess, the daughter of King <a href="Minyas%20%28mythology%29">Minyas</a> of <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Boeotia%29">Orchomenos</a>. Therefore, Petr Benda recommended in 2008 that the common name "Alcathoe bat" or "Alcathoe myotis" be used instead. Other common names include "Alcathoe's bat" and "Alcathoe whiskered bat".

"Myotis alcathoe" is the smallest European "Myotis" species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult "M.¬†alcathoe" from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified on the basis of morphology. "M.¬†alcathoe" is similar to <a href="Daubenton%27s%20bat">Daubenton's bat</a> ("Myotis daubentonii") and "M.¬†emarginatus" in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8¬†mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.

The face and the upper lips are reddish to pink, not dark brown to black as in "M.¬†mystacinus". Although most of the face is hairy, the area around the eyes is bare. The nostrils are heart-shaped, and their back end is broad, as in "M.¬†brandtii", not narrow as in "M.¬†mystacinus". Several <a href="gland">gland</a>s are present on the muzzle, most prominently in reproductively active males. The ears are brown and are lighter on the inside than the outside. There is a notch at the edge of the ear, and the pointed <a href="tragus%20%28anatomy%29">tragus</a> (a projection inside the ear that is present in some bats) extends up to this notch; the tragus is longer, extending beyond the notch, in both "M.¬†brandtii" and "M.¬†mystacinus". The base of the inner side of the ear is white; it is much darker in "M.¬†mystacinus". The feet and the thumbs are very small. The small size of the ear, tragus, feet, and thumb distinguishes "M.¬†alcathoe" from the slightly larger "M.¬†mystacinus" and "M.¬†brandtii", but the feet are relatively larger than in "M.¬†mystacinus".

The wings are brown, but lighter than those of "M.¬†mystacinus". The <a href="plagiopatagium">plagiopatagium</a> (the portion of the wing between the last digit and the hindlegs) is attached to the fifth toe. The tail extends only about 1¬†mm beyond the back margin of the <a href="uropatagium">uropatagium</a> (the portion of the wing membrane between the hindlegs). The <a href="calcar">calcar</a>, a cartilaginous spur supporting the uropatagium, is slender. With a width around 1.3¬†mm, the penis is narrow, and it lacks a broadened tip (except in one Croatian specimen). The <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) is about 0.5¬†mm long. The short and broad shape of this bone distinguishes "M.¬†alcathoe" from "M.¬†brandtii" as well as "<a href="Myotis%20ikonnikovi">M.¬†ikonnikovi</a>".

The skull is similar in shape to that of "M.¬†mystacinus" and "M.¬†brandtii", but the front part of the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is higher. The second and third upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a> (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less well-developed than in "M.¬†mystacinus". There is a clear <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusp</a> present on the side of the P4. The accessory cusp known as the <a href="protoconule">protoconule</a> is present on each of the upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>s when they are unworn. "M.¬†mystacinus" lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but "M.¬†brandtii" has an even larger cusp on P4.

As usual in "Myotis" species, "M. alcathoe" has a <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> consisting of 44 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, with the <a href="fundamental%20number">fundamental number</a> of chromosomal arms equal to 52. However, a 1987 study already found that "M.¬†alcathoe" (then called ""Myotis" sp. B") differs from both "M.¬†mystacinus" and "M.¬†brandtii" in the pattern of active nucleolus organizer regions on the chromosomes. "M.¬†alcathoe" also differs from other "Myotis" species in the sequences of the mitochondrial genes <a href="12S%20rRNA">12S rRNA</a> and <a href="NADH%20dehydrogenase">NADH dehydrogenase</a> subunit 1 by at least 5% and 13%, respectively.

"M. alcathoe" has the highest-frequency <a href="animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> call of any European "Myotis". In open terrain, the call has an average duration of 2.5¬†<a href="millisecond">ms</a>, but it may be up to 4¬†ms long. At the beginning, its frequency is around 120¬†<a href="kilohertz">kHz</a>, but it then falls fast, subsequently falls slightly slower, and at the end falls faster again. The call reaches its highest amplitude at around 53¬†kHz. It terminates at around 43 to 46¬†kHz; this characteristic is especially distinctive. In different experiments, the time between calls was found to be around 85 and 66¬†ms, respectively. The high-pitched call may be an adaptation to the animal's occurrence in dense vegetation.

Head and body length is about and wingspan is around . Forearm length is , <a href="tibia">tibia</a> length is , hindfoot length is , and body mass is .

Although "Myotis alcathoe" was initially known only from Greece and Hungary and was thought to be restricted to <a href="southeast%20Europe">southeast Europe</a>, records since then have greatly expanded its range, and it is now known from Spain and England to Sweden and European Turkey. In several European countries, focused searches were conducted to detect its occurrence. Its habitat generally consists of moist, deciduous, mature forest near streams, for example in ravines or in <a href="alluvial%20forest">alluvial forest</a> (forest near a river), where there are many decaying trees that the bat can use as roosting sites. In Germany, its preferred habitat consists of mixed deciduous forest. In the south of the continent, it usually occurs in mountain ranges, but the factors affecting its distribution in the north are less well known. Its range appears to be similar in shape to those of the <a href="greater%20horseshoe%20bat">greater</a> and <a href="lesser%20horseshoe%20bat">lesser horseshoe bat</a>s ("Rhinolophus ferrumequinum" and "R. hipposideros") and "Myotis emarginatus". It may yet be found in other European countries, such as the <a href="Benelux">Benelux</a> countries, Ireland, and Moldova. Although there are abundant records from some areas, such as France and Hungary, the species appears to be rare in most of its range.

Known records are as follows:
The species is also known from Montenegro and possibly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Early records of "Myotis ikonnikovi"‚Äînow known to be an eastern Asian species‚Äîfrom Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania may also pertain to this species. Because whiskered bats in many cases cannot easily be distinguished from each other without the use of genetic methods, some listings do not differentiate between them; records of "M.¬†alcathoe" and/or "M.¬†mystacinus" and/or (in some cases) "M.¬†brandtii" have been reported from Bulgaria, Belgium, and Montenegro.

"Myotis alcathoe" is a rare species with narrow ecological requirements. According to a study in the Czech Republic, the diet of "Myotis alcathoe" mostly consists of <a href="nematocera">nematocera</a>n flies, but <a href="caddisfly">caddisflies</a>, <a href="spider">spider</a>s, small <a href="lepidoptera">lepidoptera</a>ns, and <a href="neuroptera">neuroptera</a>ns are also taken. The presence of spiders in the diet suggests that the species gleans prey from foliage. It forages mainly high in the canopy and over water, and is often found in dense vegetation. The parasitic mite "<a href="Spinturnix%20mystacina">Spinturnix mystacina</a>" has been found on "M.¬†alcathoe", and the mites on "M.¬†alcathoe", "M.¬†brandtii", and "M.¬†mystacinus" are genetically closely related. The <a href="bat%20fly">bat fly</a> "<a href="Basilia%20mongolensis%20nudior">Basilia mongolensis nudior</a>" has been recorded on "M.¬†alcathoe" in Thuringia and the <a href="tick">tick</a> "<a href="Ixodes%20vespertilionis">Ixodes vespertilionis</a>" in Romania. When caught, individuals of "M.¬†alcathoe" are much calmer than "M.¬†mystacinus" or "M.¬†brandtii".

"M. alcathoe" lives in small groups. In Greece, a maternity colony, containing three females and two juveniles, has been found in a <a href="Platanus">plane tree</a>. Additional roosts were found high in <a href="oak">oak</a> trees in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Saxony-Anhalt. Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was in a concrete pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks ("<a href="Quercus%20robur">Quercus robur</a>"); others were in <a href="Tilia">limes</a> ("<a href="Tilia%20cordata">Tilia cordata</a>"), <a href="birch">birch</a>es ("<a href="Betula%20pendula">Betula pendula</a>"), and various other species. Its strong preference for roosting sites in trees is unusual among European bats. Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy, and are often in old trees. In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups. "M.¬†alcathoe" <a href="swarming">swarms</a> from late July to mid-September in southern Poland.

In <a href="Saxony-Anhalt">Saxony-Anhalt</a>, the species forages deep in valleys when temperatures are above , but on warmer slopes or rocky areas when it is colder. There, "M.¬†alcathoe" is relatively easy to capture in August, because "M.¬†brandtii" and "M.¬†mystacinus" already start swarming in late July. Although there are some records of "M.¬†alcathoe" in caves during the winter, it is also possible that animals spend the winter in tree cavities, and whether swarming behavior occurs in "M.¬†alcathoe" is unclear. An animal found in a cave in Saxony-Anhalt in January was not sleeping deeply. Reproduction may also take place in caves, but pregnant females have been found as late as June. Relatively many juveniles are caught between July and September. In England, one individual of "M.¬†alcathoe" was captured in 2003 (and identified at the time as "M.¬†brandtii") and again in 2009. Three individuals that were <a href="telemetry">telemetrically</a> tracked (in eastern France, Thuringia, and Baden-W√ºrttemberg, respectively) moved only , , and from their night quarters; "M.¬†brandtii" and "M.¬†mystacinus" tend to move over longer distances. A study in Poland suggested frequent hybridization among "M.¬†alcathoe", "M.¬†brandtii", and "M.¬†mystacinus" sharing the same swarming sites, probably attributable to male-biased sex ratios (1.7:1 in "M.¬†alcathoe"), a polygynous mating system, and the high number of bats at swarming sites. "M.¬†alcathoe" showed a particularly high proportion of hybrids, perhaps because it occurs at lower densities than the other two species.

Because "Myotis alcathoe" remains poorly known, it is assessed as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. However, it may be endangered because of its narrow ecological preferences. Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites where it has been recorded have already been destroyed. Forest loss is another possible threat, and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats. Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats. The species is protected by national and international measures, but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal. In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.

In <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, the species is listed as "Endangered" in view of its apparent rarity there. The Red List of Germany's Endangered Vertebrates lists "M.¬†alcathoe" as "Critically Endangered" as of 2009. In the Genevan region, the species is also listed as "Critically Endangered" as of 2015. In Hungary, where the species is probably not uncommon in suitable habitat, it has been protected since 2005. However, the species is declining there and is threatened by <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a> and disturbance of caves.

Gymnopilus maritimus

Gymnopilus maritimus is a fungus species of the family <a href="Cortinariaceae">Cortinariaceae</a> first collected in northern <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, Italy, in 2006. The species produces moderately sized, sturdy <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s of a reddish-orange colour. The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, which can measure up to across, is covered in orange <a href="fibril">fibril</a>s, and sometimes has small scales. The yellowish <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> measures up to in length by in width, and sometimes shows remnants of the <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>. The mushrooms have thick <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> of a variable colour, ranging from yellow to rust but staining darker, and the yellow <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> has a mild taste. The mushrooms leave a rusty-brown <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>, while the spores themselves measure from in length. The species is most similar in appearance to "<a href="Gymnopilus%20arenophilus">G.¬†arenophilus</a>" and "<a href="Gymnopilus%20fulgens">G.¬†fulgens</a>", but can be differentiated from both <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a>. Despite the similarities, it is not closely related to either, suggesting <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. Instead, within the genus "<a href="Gymnopilus">Gymnopilus</a>", it is most closely related to the "spectabilis‚Äìimperialis" <a href="cladistics">clade</a>. However, it is not particularly similar to any of its closest relatives.

The species has been found only on coastal <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s near <a href="Olbia">Olbia</a>, in Sardinia, where it was observed growing at the base of "<a href="Juncus%20maritimus">Juncus maritimus</a>" (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe. Mushrooms were seen growing from both the sandy soil and decaying plants; however, as a <a href="saprotrophic%20nutrition">saprotrophic feeder</a>, it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a>. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts.

"Gymnopilus maritimus" was first described by mycologists Laura Guzm√°n-D√°valos (a specialist in "<a href="Gymnopilus">Gymnopilus</a>"), Antonio Ortega, Marco Contu and Alfredo Vizzini in 2009 in an article in the journal "<a href="Mycological%20Progress">Mycological Progress</a>". The description was based on several specimens collected during field work by Contu in Sardinia between January 2006 and January 2007; the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> was collected on 15 January 2006. The discovery has contributed to Sardinia's reputation as an area of mycological significance. The description was later published in Italian by Contu and Vizzini in the journal "Micologia e Vegetazione Mediterranea", along with the description of "<a href="Gymnopilus%20purpureosquamulosus">G. purpuresquamulosus</a>", because the original descriptions of both of these species were in English, and difficult for non-specialists to obtain. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "<a href="wikt%3Amaritimus">maritimus</a>" refers to the typical habitat of coastal <a href="sand%20dune">sand dune</a>s, on sandy soil or decomposing "<a href="Juncus%20maritimus">Juncus maritimus</a>". The holotype has been deposited in the <a href="University%20of%20Granada">University of Granada</a>'s herbarium.

Within the genus "Gymnopilus", it is located in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Gymnopilus" and <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Macrospori". The subgenus "Gymnopilus" was proposed by <a href="Henri%20Romagnesi">Henri Romagnesi</a> as "Cortinatae" (while the genus was known as "Fulvidula") in 1942, though the name "Gymnopilus" was given later by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no <a href="partial%20veil">veils</a>, or veils that do not form <a href="Annulus%20%28mycology%29">rings</a>. The section "Macrospori", proposed by Guzm√°n-D√°valos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular analysis</a> revealed that "G.¬†maritimus" forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate <a href="most%20recent%20common%20ancestor">common ancestor</a> with) the "spectabilis‚Äìimperialis" <a href="cladistics">clade</a>, a clade that includes "<a href="Gymnopilus%20imperialis">G.¬†imperialis</a>", "<a href="Gymnopilus%20spectabilis">G.¬†spectabilis</a>", "<a href="Gymnopilus%20junonius">G.¬†junonius</a>" (often considered <a href="taxonomic%20synonym">synonymous</a> with "G.¬†spectabilis"), "<a href="Gymnopilus%20pampeanus">G.¬†pampeanus</a>", and others. "G. maritimus" forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of "spectabilis‚Äìimperialis"; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> or <a href="Lugol%27s%20iodine">Lugol's iodine</a>.

"Gymnopilus maritimus" mushrooms have a <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of between in width that is convex to flattened-convex in shape. There is sometimes a broad <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a>, and in older specimens, the cap is depressed in the centre. The margin of the cap is somewhat wavey. The cap surface is dry and dull, coloured red to red-orange, and yellow towards the margin. It is covered in fibrils of an orange colour, and sometimes has minute scales. The dried cap turns blackish-red when <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> is applied. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is in length by in width. It is attached centrally to the cap, and is either completely cylindrical, with equal thickness throughout its length, or slightly narrower towards the base, where whitish or cream <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> are sometimes visible. It is dry, with fibres and furrows. It is a yellowish colour, bruising reddish brown. Traces of the <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> are sometimes visible on the stem, though it does not form a ring. The yellow (brown at the bottom of the stem) <a href="Trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> can be up to thick in the cap and does not bruise. It dries dark brown. There is no distinctive odour, and the taste is mild or slightly bitter. The thick <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> can be adnate (connected to the stem by the entire depth of the gill) or sinuate (wavy, with the gills becoming shallower than deeper). They are subdistant (neither close nor distant) and swollen in the middle. In colour, they are yellow in the youngest mushrooms, turning an ochre-orange, while the oldest mushrooms they are <a href="Rust%20%28color%29">rust</a>. The gill edges are paler than the faces, and the gills stain orange-brown or darker. No reference is made in the original description to the <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of the mushrooms.

"Gymnopilus maritimus" leaves a rusty-brown <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>. The <a href="basidiospore">basidiospore</a>s can measure in length, though the typical range is . In width, they typically measure , but they can be up to 8¬†Œºm wide. In shape, they are <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> or sometimes broadly ellipsoid. The top of the spore (the side where it was once attached to the <a href="sterigma">sterigma</a>, the connection between the basidium and the spore) is rounded and blunt. The spores are covered with fairly large warts, measuring from from the main spore in height. There is no <a href="germ%20pore">germ pore</a> or <a href="Plage%20%28mycology%29">plage</a>, and there is no clear depression around the hilum (the area where the spore was attached to the sterigma). The spores turn an orange-yellow to orange-brown colour in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, and turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent and in Lugol's iodine, but they are not <a href="metachromatic">metachromatic</a>.

The four-spored <a href="basidia">basidia</a> typically measure in length by in width, but can be as much as 10.5¬†Œºm wide. They are club-shaped, but narrower in the middle. They are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) and yellow to yellowish brown. The sterigmata are between 1.6 and 7¬†Œºm long. The cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the edge of the gill) are typically 30 to 42 (though sometimes as much as 50)¬†Œºm long by wide. They are shaped like a <a href="hip-flask">flask</a> or <a href="wine-skin">wine-skin</a>. The top of the cell suddenly widens, and the cell as a whole is thin-<a href="cell%20wall">walled</a>, hyaline and yellowish, and sometimes appears to contain small grains. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) can be found in tufts at the top of the stem, and measure from by . They are cylindrical, or narrowly flask-shaped, sometimes with a long neck. They are, again, yellow and hyaline.

The yellowish <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a> are between 15 and 13.5¬†Œºm wide with a wall of variable thickness. There are <a href="clamp%20connections">clamp connections</a> at the <a href="septum">septa</a> (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and is made up of yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20¬†Œºm wide. The <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>, the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a <a href="Trichoderm%23Cutis">cutis</a>, and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a <a href="Trichoderm%23Trichoderm">trichoderm</a>.

There are five species similar in appearance to "G.¬†maritimus": "<a href="Gymnopilus%20arenophilus">G.¬†arenophilus</a>", "<a href="Gymnopilus%20decipiens">G.¬†decipiens</a>", "<a href="Gymnopilus%20flavus">G.¬†flavus</a>", "<a href="Gymnopilus%20fulgens">G.¬†fulgens</a>" and "<a href="Gymnopilus%20pseudofulgens">G.¬†pseudofulgens</a>". "G.¬†arenophilus" and particularly "G.¬†fulgens" are the most similar. Though "G.¬†maritimus" and "G.¬†arenophilus" show similarities in their <a href="biogeography">biogeography</a> and <a href="ecology">ecology</a>, the typically slightly smaller "G.¬†arenophilus" differs from "G.¬†maritimus" <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a>. While "G.¬†maritimus" has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, "G.¬†arenophilus" can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with "G.¬†maritimus" typically displaying larger warts. Like "G.¬†maritimus", "G.¬†fulgens" has been recorded growing on sand-dune <a href="heathland">heathland</a>; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of "G.¬†maritimus". However, "G.¬†fulgens" requires soil rich in <a href="peat">peat</a> and must grow among moss. Moreover, there are a number of morphological differences; "G.¬†maritimus" mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on "G.¬†fulgens" stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on "G.¬†maritimus". "G.¬†fulgens" <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">var.</a> "luteicystis" is even more distinct from "G.¬†maritimus" than the nominate variety. Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different <a href="cladistics">clades</a> within "Gymnopilus", suggesting ecological <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergence</a> between "G.¬†arenophilus" and "G.¬†maritimus", and morphological convergence between "G.¬†fulgens" and "G.¬†maritimus".

"Gymnopilus flavus", despite also appearing on land near the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, can be differentiated from "G.¬†maritimus" as it lives among grass, especially "<a href="Dactylis%20glomerata">Dactylis glomerata</a>", and it has distinctly smaller spores, typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2¬†Œºm. "G.¬†pseudofulgens", also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts. "G.¬†decipiens", another species that grows on sandy soil, again has spores that are markedly different. The American species "<a href="Gymnopilus%20arenicola">G. arenicola</a>" also favours sandy soil, but has significantly smaller spores than "G.¬†maritimus". Two other species of "Gymnopilus" found around the Mediterranean are "<a href="Gymnopilus%20corsicus">G.¬†corsicus</a>" and "<a href="Gymnopilus%20spadiceus">G.¬†spadiceus</a>". "G.¬†corsicus" has no veil remnants on the stem, and spores that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from "G.¬†maritimus". "G.¬†spadiceus" shows several similarities to "G.¬†maritimus", but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores.

"Gymnopils maritimus" is clearly a different species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; in the case of "G.¬†junonius" and "G.¬†spectabilis" (often considered synonymous), as well as "G.¬†pampeanus", they are narrower, and in the case of "G.¬†imperialis", they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only "G.¬†junonius" and "G.¬†spectabilis" also grow in Europe.

"Gymnopilus maritimus" is known only from a single site in <a href="Pittulongu">Pittulongu</a>, an area of <a href="Olbia">Olbia</a>, in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, Italy, which is the <a href="Type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a>. There, mushrooms were found growing in close groups and tufts on coastal <a href="sand%20dunes">sand dunes</a> around from the <a href="high%20tide">high tide</a> line. They were observed at the base of live "<a href="Juncus%20maritimus">Juncus maritimus</a>" (sea rush) plants, growing on sandy soil or decaying plants, where they were feeding as <a href="Saprotrophic%20nutrition">saprotrophs</a>. As such, it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a>. They were observed growing from autumn to winter, between the end of October and January. In addition to the collections in Sardinia, Contu and Vizzini speculate that reports of "G. fulgens" growing in "sand-dune heaths" on Great Britain, an unusual habitat for that species, may in fact show the presence of "G. maritimus" on the island.

The Man in the Moone

The Man in the Moone is a book by the English <a href="Divine%20%28noun%29">divine</a> and <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> bishop <a href="Francis%20Godwin">Francis Godwin</a> (1562‚Äì1633), describing a "voyage of utopian discovery". Long considered to be one of his early works, it is now generally thought to have been written in the late 1620s. It was first published posthumously in 1638 under the pseudonym of Domingo Gonsales. The work is notable for its role in what was called the "new astronomy", the branch of <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a> influenced especially by <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>. Although Copernicus is the only astronomer mentioned by name, the book also draws on the theories of <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> and <a href="William%20Gilbert%20%28astronomer%29">William Gilbert</a>. Godwin's astronomical theories were greatly influenced by <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>'s "<a href="Sidereus%20Nuncius">Sidereus Nuncius</a>" (1610), but unlike Galileo, Godwin proposes that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many parallels with Kepler's "<a href="Somnium%20%28novel%29">Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunari</a>" of 1634.

Gonsales is a Spaniard forced to flee the country after killing a man in a duel. Having made his fortune in the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a>, he decides to return to Spain, but falls ill on the voyage home and is set off on the island of <a href="St%20Helena">St Helena</a> to recover. There he discovers the gansa, a species of wild swan able to carry substantial loads, and contrives a device that allows him to harness many of them together and fly around the island. Once fully recovered, Gonsales resumes his journey home, but his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a>. He uses his flying machine to escape to the shore, but once safely landed he is approached by hostile natives and is forced to take off again. This time his birds fly higher and higher, towards the Moon, which they reach after a journey of twelve days. There Gonsales encounters the Lunars, a tall Christian people inhabiting what appears to be a utopian paradise. After six months of living among them, Gonsales becomes homesick and concerned for the condition of his birds, and sets off to return to Earth. He lands in China, where he is immediately arrested as a magician, but after learning the language manages to win the trust of the local <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin</a>. The story ends with Gonsales meeting a group of <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> missionaries, who arrange to have a written account of his adventures sent back to Spain.

Some critics consider "The Man in the Moone", along with Kepler's "Somnium", to be one of the first works of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by <a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a> and <a href="Aphra%20Behn">Aphra Behn</a>, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.

Godwin, the son of <a href="Thomas%20Godwin%20%28bishop%29">Thomas Godwin</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bishop of Bath and Wells</a>, was elected a student of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, in 1578, from where he received his Bachelor of Arts (1581) and Master of Arts degrees (1584); after entering the church he gained his Bachelor (1594) and Doctor of Divinity (1596) degrees. He gained prominence (even internationally) in 1601 by publishing his "Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the Christian Religion in this Island", which enabled his rapid rise in the church hierarchy. During his life, he was known as a historian.

Godwin's book appeared in a time of great interest in the Moon and astronomical phenomena, and of important developments in celestial observation, mathematics and <a href="mechanics">mechanics</a>. The influence particularly of <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> led to what was called the "new astronomy"; Copernicus is the only astronomer Godwin mentions by name, but the theories of <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a> and <a href="William%20Gilbert%20%28astronomer%29">William Gilbert</a> are also discernible. <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>'s 1610 publication "<a href="Sidereus%20Nuncius">Sidereus Nuncius</a>" (usually translated as "The Sidereal Messenger") had a great influence on Godwin's astronomical theories, although Godwin proposes (unlike Galileo) that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many similarities between "The Man in the Moone" and Kepler's "<a href="Somnium%20%28novel%29">Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunaris</a>" of 1634 ("The Dream, or Posthumous Work on Lunar Astronomy").

Speculation on lunar habitation was nothing new in Western thought, but it intensified in England during the early 17th century: <a href="Philemon%20Holland">Philemon Holland</a>'s 1603 translation of <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "<a href="Moralia">Moralia</a>" introduced Greco-Roman speculation to the English vernacular, and poets including <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a> proposed that other worlds, including the Moon, could be inhabited. Such speculation was prompted also by the expanding geographical view of the world. The 1630s saw the publication of a translation of <a href="Lucian">Lucian</a>'s "<a href="True%20History">True History</a>" (1634), containing two accounts of trips to the Moon, and a new edition of <a href="Ariosto">Ariosto</a>'s "<a href="Orlando%20Furioso">Orlando Furioso</a>", likewise featuring an ascent to the Moon. In both books the Moon is inhabited, and this theme was given an explicit religious importance by writers such as <a href="John%20Donne">John Donne</a>, who in "<a href="Ignatius%20His%20Conclave">Ignatius His Conclave</a>" (1611, with new editions in 1634 and 1635) satirised a "lunatic church" on the Moon founded by <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> and the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuits</a>. Lunar speculation reached an acme at the end of the decade, with the publication of Godwin's "The Man in the Moone" (1638) and <a href="John%20Wilkins">John Wilkins</a>'s "The Discovery of a World in the Moone" (also 1638, and revised in 1640).

Until Grant McColley, a historian of early Modern English literature, published his "The Date of Godwin's "Domingo Gonsales"" in 1937, it was thought that Godwin wrote "The Man in the Moone" relatively early in his life¬†‚Äì perhaps during his time at Christ Church from 1578 to 1584, or maybe even as late as 1603. But McColley proposed a much later date of 1627 or 1628, based on internal and biographical evidence. A number of ideas about the physical properties of the Earth and the Moon, including claims about "a secret property that operates in a manner similar to that of a loadstone attracting iron", did not appear until after 1620. And Godwin seems to borrow the concept of using a flock of strong, trained birds to fly Gonsales to the Moon from <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>'s "Sylva sylvarum" ("Natural History"), published in July 1626. All this evidence supports McColley's dating of "1626‚Äì29, with the probable years of composition 1627‚Äì28", which is now generally accepted.

William Poole, in his 2009 edition of "The Man in the Moone", provides additional evidence for a later dating. Godwin, he argues, most likely got his knowledge of the Jesuit mission in China (founded in 1601) from a 1625 edition of <a href="Samuel%20Purchas">Samuel Purchas</a>s "Purchas his Pilgrimage". This book contains a redaction from <a href="Nicolas%20Trigault">Nicolas Trigault</a>'s "<a href="De%20Christiana%20expeditione%20apud%20Sinas">De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu</a>" (1615) ("Concerning the Christian expedition to China undertaken by the Society of Jesus"), itself the redaction of a manuscript by the Jesuit priest <a href="Matteo%20Ricci">Matteo Ricci</a>. Poole also sees the influence of <a href="Robert%20Burton%20%28scholar%29">Robert Burton</a>, who in the second volume of "<a href="The%20Anatomy%20of%20Melancholy">The Anatomy of Melancholy</a>" had speculated on gaining astronomical knowledge through telescopic observation (citing Galileo) or from space travel (Lucian). Appearing for the first time in the 1628 edition of the "Anatomy" is a section on <a href="Orbital%20period">planetary periods</a>, which gives a period for Mars of three years¬†‚Äì had Godwin used William Gilbert's "<a href="De%20Magnete">De Magnete</a>" (1600) for this detail he would have found a Martian period of two years. Finally, Poole points to what he calls a "genetic debt": while details on for instance the Martian period could have come from a few other sources, Burton and Godwin are the only two writers of the time to combine an interest in alien life with the <a href="green%20children%20of%20Woolpit">green children of Woolpit</a>, from a 12th-century account of two mysterious green children found in Suffolk.

One of Godwin's "major intellectual debts" is to Gilbert's "De Magnete", in which Gilbert argued that the Earth was magnetic, though he may have used a derivative account by <a href="Mark%20Ridley%20%28physician%29">Mark Ridley</a> or a geographical textbook by <a href="Nathanael%20Carpenter">Nathanael Carpenter</a>. It is unlikely that Godwin could have gathered first-hand evidence used in narrating the events in his book (such as the details of Gonsales's journey back from the East, especially a description of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> and its importance as a resting place for sick mariners), and more likely that he relied on travel adventures and other books. He used Trigault's "De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas" (1615), based on a manuscript by Matteo Ricci, the founder of the Jesuit mission in Beijing in 1601, for information about that mission. Details pertaining to the sea voyage and Saint Helena likely came from <a href="Thomas%20Cavendish">Thomas Cavendish</a>'s account of his first circumnavigation of the world, available in <a href="Richard%20Hakluyt">Richard Hakluyt</a>'s "Principal Navigations" (1599‚Äì1600) and in "Purchas His Pilgrimage", first published in 1613. Information on the <a href="Dutch%20Revolt">Dutch Revolt</a>, the historical setting for the early part of Gonsales' career, likely came from the annals of <a href="Emanuel%20van%20Meteren">Emanuel van Meteren</a>, a Dutch historian working in London.

McColley knew of only one surviving copy of the first edition, held at the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> (now <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> C.56.c.2), which was the basis for his 1937 edition of "The Man in the Moone" and "Nuncius Inanimatus", an edition criticised by literary critic Kathleen Tillotson as lacking in textual care and consistency. H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France">Biblioth√®que nationale de France</a>, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson.

For the text of his 2009 edition, William Poole collated a copy in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> Oxford (Ashm. 940(1)) with that in the British Library. The printer of the first edition of "The Man in the Moone" is identified on the title page as John Norton, and the book was sold by Joshua Kirton and Thomas Warren. It also includes an <a href="epistle">epistle</a> introducing the work and attributed to "E. M.", perhaps the fictitious Edward Mahon identified in the <a href="Stationers%27%20Register">Stationers' Register</a> as the translator from the original Spanish. Poole speculates that this Edward Mahon might be Thomas or Morgan Godwin, two of the bishop's sons who had worked with their father on <a href="telegraphy">telegraphy</a>, but adds that Godwin's third son, Paul, might be involved as well. The partial revision of the manuscript (the first half has dates according to the <a href="Gregorian%20calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, the second half still follows the superseded <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>) indicates an unfinished manuscript, which Paul might have acquired after his father's death and passed on to his former colleague Joshua Kirton: Paul Godwin and Kirton were apprenticed to the same printer, John Bill, and worked there together for seven years. Paul may have simply continued the "E. M." hoax unknowingly, and/or may have been responsible for partial revision of the manuscript. To the second edition, published in 1657, was added Godwin's "Nuncius Inanimatus" (in English and Latin; first published in 1629). The third edition was published in 1768; its text was abridged, and a description of <a href="St%20Helena">St Helena</a> (by printer <a href="Nathaniel%20Crouch">Nathaniel Crouch</a>) functioned as an introduction.

A French translation by <a href="Jean%20Baudoin%20%28translator%29">Jean Baudoin</a>, "L'Homme dans la Lune", was published in 1648, and republished four more times. This French version excised the narrative's sections on Lunar Christianity, as so do the many translations based on it, including the German translation incorrectly ascribed to <a href="Hans%20Jakob%20Christoffel%20von%20Grimmelshausen">Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen</a>, "Der fliegende Wandersmann nach dem Mond", 1659. <a href="Johan%20van%20Brosterhuysen">Johan van Brosterhuysen</a> (c. 1594‚Äì1650) translated the book into Dutch, and a Dutch translation¬†‚Äì possibly Brosterhuysen's, although the attribution is uncertain¬†‚Äì went through seven printings in the Netherlands between 1645 and 1718. The second edition of 1651 and subsequent editions include a continuation of unknown authorship relating Gonsales' further adventures.

The story is written as a <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person narrative</a> from the perspective of Domingo Gonsales, the book's fictional author. In his opening address to the reader the equally fictional translator "E. M." promises "an essay of "Fancy", where "Invention" is shewed with "Judgment"". Gonsales is a citizen of Spain, forced to flee to the <a href="East%20Indies">East Indies</a> after killing a man in a <a href="duel">duel</a>. There he prospers by trading in jewels, and having made his fortune decides to return to Spain. On his voyage home he becomes seriously ill, and he and a negro servant Diego are put ashore on St Helena, a remote island with a reputation for "temperate and healthful" air. A scarcity of food forces Gonsales and Diego to live some miles apart, but Gonsales devises a variety of systems to allow them to communicate. Eventually he comes to rely on a species of bird he describes as some kind of wild swan, a gansa, to carry messages and provisions between himself and Diego. Gonsales gradually comes to realise that these birds are able to carry substantial burdens, and resolves to construct a device by which a number of them harnessed together might be able to support the weight of a man, allowing him to move around the island more conveniently. Following a successful test flight he determines to resume his voyage home, hoping that he might "fill the world with the Fame of [his] Glory and Renown". But on his way back to Spain, accompanied by his birds and the device he calls his Engine, his ship is attacked by an English fleet off the coast of <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> and he is forced to escape by taking to the air.

After setting down briefly on Tenerife, Gonsales is forced to take off again by the imminent approach of hostile natives. But rather than flying to a place of safety among the Spanish inhabitants of the island the gansas fly higher and higher. On the first day of his flight Gonsales encounters "illusions of 'Devils and Wicked Spirits in the shape of men and women, some of whom he is able to converse with. They provide him with food and drink for his journey and promise to set him down safely in Spain if only he will join their "Fraternity", and "enter into such Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Master, whom they would not name". Gonsales declines their offer, and after a journey of 12 days reaches the Moon. Suddenly feeling very hungry he opens the provisions he was given en route, only to find nothing but dry leaves, goat's hair and animal dung, and that his wine "stunk like Horse-piss". He is soon discovered by the inhabitants of the Moon, the Lunars, whom he finds to be tall Christian people enjoying a happy and carefree life in a kind of pastoral paradise. Gonsales discovers that order is maintained in this apparently utopian state by swapping delinquent children with terrestrial children.

The Lunars speak a language consisting "not so much of words and letters as tunes and strange sounds", which Gonsales succeeds in gaining some fluency in after a couple of months. Six months or so after his arrival Gonsales becomes concerned about the condition of his gansas, three of whom have died. Fearing that he may never be able to return to Earth and see his children again if he delays further, he decides to take leave of his hosts, carrying with him a gift of precious stones from the supreme monarch of the Moon, Irdonozur. The stones are of three different sorts: Poleastis, which can store and generate great quantities of heat; Macbrus, which generates great quantities of light; and Ebelus, which when one side of the stone is clasped to the skin renders a man weightless, or half as heavy again if the other side is touched.

Gonsales harnesses his gansas to his Engine and leaves the Moon on 29 March 1601. He lands in China about nine days later, without re-encountering the illusions of men and women he had seen on his outward journey and with the help of his Ebelus, which helps the birds to avoid plummeting to Earth as the weight of Gonsales and his Engine threatens to become too much for them. He is quickly arrested and taken before the local <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin</a>, accused of being a magician, and as a result is confined in the mandarin's palace. He learns to speak the local dialect of Chinese, and after some months of confinement is summoned before the mandarin to give an account of himself and his arrival in China, which gains him the mandarin's trust and favour. Gonsales hears of a group of <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a>s, and is granted permission to visit them. He writes an account of his adventures, which the Jesuits arrange to have sent back to Spain. The story ends with Gonsales's fervent wish that he may one day be allowed to return to Spain, and "that by enriching my country with the knowledge of these hidden mysteries, I may at least reap the glory of my fortunate misfortunes".

The story is set during the reign of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, a period of religious conflict in England. Not only was there the threat of a <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> resurgence but there were also disputes within the <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> Church. When Gonsales first encounters the Lunars he exclaims ""Jesu Maria"", at which the Lunars fall to their knees, but although they revere the name of Jesus they are unfamiliar with the name Maria, suggesting that they are Protestants rather than Catholics; Poole is of the same opinion: "their lack of reaction to the name of Mary suggests that they have not fallen into the errors of the Catholic Church, despite some otherwise rather Catholic-looking institutions on the moon". Beginning in the 1580s, when Godwin was a student at Oxford University, many publications criticising the governance of the established <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> circulated widely, until in 1586 censorship was introduced, resulting in the <a href="Martin%20Marprelate">Martin Marprelate</a> controversy. Martin Marprelate was the name used by the anonymous author or authors of the illegal tracts attacking the Church published between 1588 and 1589. A number of commentators, including Grant McColley, have suggested that Godwin strongly objected to the imposition of censorship, expressed in Gonsales's hope that the publication of his account may not prove "prejudicial to the Catholic faith". John Clark has suggested that the Martin Marprelate controversy may have inspired Godwin to give the name Martin to the Lunars' god, but as a bishop of the Church of England it is perhaps unlikely that he was generally sympathetic to the Martin Marprelate position. Critics do not agree on the precise denomination of Godwin's Lunars. In contrast with Clark and Poole, <a href="David%20Cressy">David Cressy</a> argues that the Lunars falling to their knees after Gonsales's exclamation (a similar ritual takes place at the court of Irdonozur) is evidence of "a fairly mechanical form of religion (as most of Godwin's Protestant contemporaries judged Roman Catholicism)".

By the time "The Man in the Moone" was published, discussion on the <a href="Cosmic%20pluralism">plurality of worlds</a> had begun to favour the possibility of extraterrestrial life. For Christian thinkers such a plurality is intimately connected to Christ and his redemption of man: if there are other worlds, do they share a similar history, and does Christ also redeem them in his sacrifice? According to <a href="Philipp%20Melanchthon">Philipp Melanchthon</a>, a 16th-century theologian who worked closely with <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, "It must not be imagined that there are many worlds, because it must not be imagined that Christ died or was resurrected more often, nor must it be thought that in any other world without the knowledge of the son of God, that men would be restored to eternal life". Similar comments were made by <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> theologian <a href="Lambert%20Daneau">Lambert Daneau</a>. Midway through the 17th century the matter appears to have been settled in favour of a possible plurality, which was accepted by <a href="Henry%20More">Henry More</a> and <a href="Aphra%20Behn">Aphra Behn</a> among others; "by 1650, the Elizabethan Oxford examination question "an sint plures mundi?" ('can these be many worlds?'¬†‚Äì to which the correct Aristotelian answer was 'no') had been replaced by the disputation thesis "quod Luna sit habitabilis" ('that the moon could be habitable'¬†‚Äì which might be answered 'probably' if not 'yes')".

Godwin had a lifelong interest in language and communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), and this was the topic of his "Nuncius inanimatus" (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on <a href="Tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone</a>. <a href="Invented%20languages">Invented languages</a> were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a>'s "<a href="Utopia%20%28book%29">Utopia</a>", <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais">Fran√ßois Rabelais</a>'s "<a href="Gargantua%20and%20Pantagruel">Gargantua and Pantagruel</a>" and <a href="Joseph%20Hall%20%28bishop%29">Joseph Hall</a>'s "<a href="Mundus%20Alter%20et%20Idem">Mundus Alter et Idem</a>", all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>'s <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a>. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a>.

One of Godwin's sources for his Lunar language was Trigault's "De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas". Gonsales provides two examples of spoken phrases, written down in a <a href="cipher">cipher</a> later explained by John Wilkins in "Mercury, or The Secret and Swift Messenger" (1641). Trigault's account of the Chinese language gave Godwin the idea of assigning tonality to the Lunar language, and of appreciating it in the language spoken by the Chinese mandarins Gonsales encounters after his return to Earth. Gonsales claims that in contrast to the multitude of languages in China (making their speakers mutually unintelligible), the mandarins' language is universal by virtue of tonality (he suppresses it in the other <a href="varieties%20of%20Chinese">varieties of Chinese</a>). Thus the mandarins are able to maintain a cultural and spiritual superiority resembling that of the Lunar upper class, which is to be placed in contrast with the variety of languages spoken in a fractured and morally degenerate Europe and elsewhere. Knowlson argues that using the term "language" is overstating the case, and that cipher is the proper term: "In spite of Godwin's claims, this musical 'language' is not in fact a language at all, but simply a cipher in which the letters of an existing language may be transcribed". He suggests Godwin's source may have been a book by <a href="Joan%20Baptista%20Porta">Joan Baptista Porta</a>, whose "De occultis literarum notis" (1606) contains "an exact description of the method he was to adopt".

The book's genre has been variously categorised. When it was first published the literary genre of <a href="Utopian%20and%20dystopian%20fiction">utopian fantasy</a> was in its infancy, and critics have recognised how Godwin used a utopian setting to criticise the institutions of his time: the Moon was "the ideal perspective from which to view the earth" and its "moral attitudes and social institutions," according to Maurice Bennett. Other critics have referred to the book as "utopia", "Renaissance utopia" or "picaresque adventure". While some critics claim it as one of the first works of science fiction, there is no general agreement that it is even "proto-science-fiction".

Early commentators recognised that the book is a kind of <a href="picaresque%20novel">picaresque novel</a>, and comparisons with "<a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>" were being made as early as 1638. In structure as well as content "The Man in the Moone" somewhat resembles the anonymous Spanish novella "<a href="Lazarillo%20de%20Tormes">Lazarillo de Tormes</a>" (1554); both books begin with a genealogy and start out in Salamanca, featuring a man who travels from master to master seeking his fortune. But most critics agree that the picaresque mode is not sustained throughout, and that Godwin intentionally achieves a "generic transformation".

Godwin's book follows a venerable tradition of travel literature that blends the excitement of journeys to foreign places with utopian reflection; More's "Utopia" is cited as a forerunner, as is the account of <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a>. Godwin could fall back on an extensive body of work describing the voyages undertaken by his protagonist, including books by Hakluyt and <a href="Jan%20Huyghen%20van%20Linschoten">Jan Huyghen van Linschoten</a>, and the narratives deriving from the Jesuit mission in Beijing.

"The Man in the Moone" was published five months after "The Discovery of a World in the Moone" by John Wilkins, later bishop of Chester. Wilkins refers to Godwin once, in a discussion of spots in the Moon, but not to Godwin's book. In the third edition of "The Discovery" (1640), however, Wilkins provides a summary of Godwin's book, and later in "Mercury" (1641) he comments on "The Man in the Moone" and "Nuncius Inanimatus", saying that "the former text could be used to unlock the secrets of the latter". "The Man in the Moone" quickly became an international "source of humour and parody": <a href="Cyrano%20de%20Bergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a>, using Baudoin's 1648 translation, parodied it in "<a href="Comical%20History%20of%20the%20States%20and%20Empires%20of%20the%20Moon">L'Autre Monde: o√π les √âtats et Empires de la Lune</a>" (1657); Cyrano's traveller actually meets Gonsales, who is still on the Moon, "degraded to the status of pet monkey". It was one of the inspirations for what has been called the first science fiction text in the Americas, "Syzygies and Lunar Quadratures Aligned to the Meridian of M√©rida of the Yucat√°n by an Anctitone or Inhabitant of the Moon¬†..." by <a href="Manuel%20Antonio%20de%20Rivas">Manuel Antonio de Rivas</a> (1775). The <a href="Laputa">Laputan language</a> of <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>, who was a distant relation of Godwin's, may have been influenced by "The Man in the Moone", either directly or through Cyrano de Bergerac.

"The Man in the Moone" became a popular source for "often extravagantly staged comic drama and opera", including Aphra Behn's "The Emperor of the Moon", a 1687 play "inspired by¬†... the third edition of ["The Man in the Moone"], and the English translation of Cyrano's work", and <a href="Elkanah%20Settle">Elkanah Settle</a>s "The World in the Moon" (1697). <a href="Thomas%20D%27Urfey">Thomas D'Urfey</a>s "Wonders in the Sun, or the Kingdom of the Birds" (1706) was "really a sequel, starring Domingo and Diego". Its popularity was not limited to English; a Dutch farce, "Don Domingo Gonzales of de Man in de maan", formerly considered to have been written by <a href="Maria%20de%20Wilde">Maria de Wilde</a>, was published in 1755.

The book's influence continued into the 19th century. <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> in an appendix to "<a href="The%20Unparalleled%20Adventure%20of%20One%20Hans%20Pfaall">The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall</a>" called it "a singular and somewhat ingenious little book". Poe assumed the author to be French, an assumption also made by <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a> in his "<a href="From%20the%20Earth%20to%20the%20Moon">From the Earth to the Moon</a>" (1865), suggesting that they may have been using Baudoin's translation. <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>'s "<a href="The%20First%20Men%20in%20the%20Moon">The First Men in the Moon</a>" (1901) has several parallels with Godwin's fantasy, including the use of a stone to induce weightlessness. But "The Man in the Moone" has nevertheless been given only "lukewarm consideration in different histories of English literature", and its importance is downplayed in studies of Utopian literature. Frank E. Manuel and Fritzie P. Manuel's "Utopian Thought in the Western World" (winner of the 1979 <a href="National%20Book%20Award%20for%20Nonfiction">National Book Award for Nonfiction</a>) mentions it only in passing, saying that Godwin "treats primarily of the mechanics of flight with the aid of a crew of birds", and that "The Man in the Moone", like Bergerac's and Wilkins's books, lacks "high seriousness and unified moral purpose".

Gonsales's load-carrying birds have also left their mark. The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>"s entry for "gansa" reads "One of the birds (called elsewhere 'wild swans') which drew Domingo Gonsales to the Moon in the romance by Bp. F. Godwin". For the etymology it suggests "ganz√¶", found in Philemon Holland's 1601 translation of <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>s "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>". <a href="Michael%20van%20Langren">Michael van Langren</a> ("Langrenus"), the 17th-century Dutch astronomer and cartographer, named one of the lunar craters for them, "Gansii", later renamed <a href="Halley%20%28lunar%20crater%29">Halley</a>.

Lady Saig≈ç

Lady Saig≈ç ( or ', 1552¬†‚Äì 1 July 1589), also known as Oai"', was the first <a href="wikt%3Aconsort">consort</a> and trusted confidante of <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, the <a href="samurai">samurai</a> lord who unified <a href="Japan">Japan</a> at the end of the sixteenth century and then ruled as "<a href="sh%C5%8Dgun">sh≈çgun</a>". She was also the mother of the second Tokugawa "sh≈çgun", <a href="Tokugawa%20Hidetada">Tokugawa Hidetada</a>.

During their relationship, Lady Saig≈ç influenced Ieyasu's philosophies, choice of allies, and policies as he rose to power during the late <a href="Sengoku%20period">Sengoku period</a>, and she thus had an indirect effect on the organization and composition of the <a href="Tokugawa%20shogunate">Tokugawa shogunate</a>. Although less is known of her than some other figures of the era, she is generally regarded as the "power behind the throne", and her life has been compared to a "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a> story" of <a href="feudal%20Japan">feudal Japan</a>. Her contributions were considered so significant that she was posthumously inducted to the <a href="List%20of%20Japanese%20court%20ranks%2C%20positions%20and%20hereditary%20titles%23Upper%20ranks">Senior First Rank of the Imperial Court</a>, the highest honor that could be conferred by the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor of Japan</a>.

Once she was in a respected and secure position as first consort and mother to Ieyasu's heir, Lady Saig≈ç used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes. A devout Buddhist, she donated money to temples in <a href="Suruga%20Province">Suruga Province</a>, where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu, first in <a href="Hamamatsu%20Castle">Hamamatsu Castle</a> and later in <a href="Sunpu%20Castle">Sunpu Castle</a>. As she was quite <a href="near-sighted">near-sighted</a>, she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support. Lady Saig≈ç died at a fairly young age, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Although murder was suspected, no culprit was identified.

Lady Saig≈ç bore four children: she had a son and a daughter (Saig≈ç Katsutada and Tokuhime) while married, and she later bore two sons as the consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu: Tokugawa Hidetada and Matsudaira Tadayoshi. Among the descendants of Lady Saig≈ç was the <a href="Empress%20Meish%C5%8D">Empress Meish≈ç</a> (1624‚Äì1696), one of very few women to accede to the <a href="Chrysanthemum%20Throne">Chrysanthemum Throne</a> as <a href="empress%20regnant">empress regnant</a>.

The term "Saig≈ç-no-Tsubone", used in most historical texts, is an official title rather than a name. As an adult she was adopted into the Saig≈ç clan, so she was permitted to use the surname. Later, when she was named first consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the title "tsubone" (pronounced ) was appended to the surname. The title was one of several titular <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es conferred on high-ranking women (others include "-kata" and "-dono"). The bestowal of a title depended on social class and the relationship with her samurai lord, such as whether she was a legitimate wife or a concubine, and whether or not she had had children by him. The word "tsubone" indicates the living quarters reserved for ladies of a court, and it became the title for those who had been granted private quarters, such as high-ranking concubines with children. This title, "tsubone", was in use for concubines from the <a href="Heian%20period">Heian period</a> until the <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji period</a> (from the eighth century to the early twentieth century), and is commonly translated to the English title "Lady".

Though Lady Saig≈ç's <a href="given%20name">given name</a> does not appear in surviving documents from the time, there is good evidence it was Masako (), but this name is very rarely used. Her most commonly used name was Oai ( or , meaning "love") and most sources agree this was a nickname she gained as a child. Intimate friends and family would call her Oai throughout her life, and it is the name most often used in modern popular cultural references. Following death, she was bestowed with a Buddhist <a href="posthumous%20name">posthumous name</a>, and an abbreviation of that name, H≈çdai-in (), is sometimes used out of pious respect.

The Saig≈ç family was one branch of the distinguished <a href="Kikuchi%20clan">Kikuchi clan</a> of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> that had migrated northward to <a href="Mikawa%20Province">Mikawa Province</a> in the fifteenth¬†century. In 1524, the forces of <a href="Matsudaira%20Kiyoyasu">Matsudaira Kiyoyasu</a> (1511‚Äì1536), the grandfather of <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, stormed and took the Saig≈ç clan's headquarters at Yamanaka Castle during his conquest of the Mikawa region. Shortly after the battle, Saig≈ç Nobusada, the third head of the Saig≈ç, submitted to the <a href="Matsudaira%20clan">Matsudaira clan</a>. Following the untimely death of Kiyoyasu in 1536, and the ineffectual leadership and early death of <a href="Matsudaira%20Hirotada">Matsudaira Hirotada</a> (1526‚Äì1549), the leaderless Matsudaira clan finally submitted to <a href="Imagawa%20Yoshimoto">Imagawa Yoshimoto</a> (1519‚Äì1560) of <a href="Suruga%20Province">Suruga Province</a>, east of Mikawa. When the Matsudaira fell to the Imagawa, the clans of their retainers, which included the Saig≈ç, likewise submitted to the Imagawa. Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okehazama">Battle of Okehazama</a> (1560), Saig≈ç Masakatsu attempted to re-assert the independence of the clan while yielding some land concessions to the Imagawa. In response, <a href="Imagawa%20Ujizane">Imagawa Ujizane</a> arrested thirteen Saig≈ç men, and had them vertically <a href="impalement">impaled</a> near <a href="Yoshida%20Castle">Yoshida Castle</a>. The executions did not deter the Saig≈ç, and in 1562 the Imagawa launched punitive invasions of east Mikawa and attacked the two main Saig≈ç castles. Masakatsu was killed in the battle of Gohonmatsu Castle; his eldest son Motomasa was killed during the battle for Wachigaya Castle. Clan leadership passed to Masakatsu's son, Saig≈ç Kiyokazu (1533‚Äì1594), who pledged his loyalty to the Matsudaira clan, under the leadership of Tokugawa Ieyasu, in their mutual struggle against the Imagawa. In 1569, the power of the Imagawa ended with the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kakegawa">Siege of Kakegawa Castle</a>.

Neither the name of Lady Saig≈ç's mother nor her dates of birth or death are recorded in any existing documents, although it is known that she was the elder sister of Saig≈ç Kiyokazu. Lady Saig≈ç's father was Tozuka Tadaharu of <a href="T%C5%8Dt%C5%8Dmi%20Province">T≈çt≈çmi Province</a>, under direct control of the Imagawa clan. The marriage between Tadaharu and his wife was very likely arranged by the Imagawa clan.

Lady Saig≈ç was born in 1552 at <a href="Nishikawa%20Castle">Nishikawa Castle</a>, a branch castle of the Saig≈ç clan, and very likely given the name of Masako soon after birth. Japanese marriages are not usually <a href="matrilocal">matrilocal</a>, but Tadaharu may have been assigned to Nishikawa Castle as an agent of the Imagawa. Masako spent her childhood with her two siblings in <a href="bucolic">bucolic</a> eastern Mikawa Province, and at some point gained the nickname Oai. In 1554, her father Tadaharu died in the Battle of Enshu-Omori, between the Imagawa and the <a href="Late%20H%C5%8Dj%C5%8D%20clan">H≈çj≈ç clan</a>. Two years later her mother married Hattori Masanao; the union resulted in four children, though only two survived to adulthood.

Some sources state that upon reaching "adulthood" Oai married, but was widowed soon afterward. The husband's name is not mentioned and there were apparently no children. Other sources do not mention the marriage, or suggest that there never was an earlier "first" marriage. It is known with certainty that in 1567, Oai married Saig≈ç Yoshikatsu, her cousin and the son of Motomasa, who had already had two children by his late wife. Oai bore two children by Yoshikatsu: their son, Saig≈ç Katsutada, was born about 1570; they also had a daughter, possibly named Tokuhime.

In 1571, Saig≈ç Yoshikatsu was killed at the Battle of Takehiro, fighting the invading forces of the <a href="Takeda%20clan">Takeda clan</a> led by <a href="Akiyama%20Nobutomo">Akiyama Nobutomo</a>. Soon after Yoshikatsu's death, Oai was formally adopted by her uncle, Saig≈ç Kiyokazu, then the head of the Saig≈ç clan, though she chose to live with her mother in the house of her stepfather.

Oai first met Tokugawa Ieyasu at about the age of 17 or 18, when he visited the Saig≈ç family and Oai served him tea. It is believed she caught his eye on that occasion, but as she was still married, nothing came of it at the time. Later, during the 1570s, it is believed that friendship and genuine affection developed between the two. This view contradicts a common impression which maintains that Ieyasu was a ruthless leader who treated all the women in his life, and all of his offspring, as commodities to be used as needed to serve the clan or his own ambitions. However, it is also known that he valued personal merit over bloodlines. During this time, Ieyasu had a house built in eastern Mikawa, far from the residence of his wife, the <a href="Lady%20Tsukiyama">Lady Tsukiyama</a>, in <a href="Okazaki%2C%20Aichi">Okazaki</a>. The marriage between Ieyasu and Lady Tsukiyama had been arranged by her uncle, Imagawa Yoshimoto, ostensibly to help cement ties between the two clans, though Ieyasu found it difficult to live with his wife's jealousy, tempestuous moods, and eccentric habits.

Starting around the time of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mikatagahara">Battle of Mikatagahara</a> (1573), perhaps in its aftermath, Ieyasu began to confide in Oai and sought her counsel on various matters. It may have been during this period that the two commenced an amorous relationship. Oai is credited with advising Ieyasu as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nagashino">Battle of Nagashino</a> (1575) approached, a major turning point in both Ieyasu's career and the history of Japan. It is also thought that Ieyasu continued to seek her advice concerning other battles and alliances, even as late as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Komaki%20and%20Nagakute">Komaki-Nagakute Campaign</a> (1584).

In the spring of 1578, Oai moved to <a href="Hamamatsu%20Castle">Hamamatsu Castle</a>, where she took over management of the kitchen. She became very popular with the unit of warriors from her native province, who not only admired her beauty, but regarded her as a gentle and virtuous example of the women of Mikawa. While her manners and gentility were exemplary, she could, when the occasion warranted, be outspoken or sarcastic in speech, the probable result of growing up around rustic warriors in a remote castle outpost. With her move to the court of Ieyasu, Oai entered a bitter arena where prospective concubines schemed and competed with each other for a chance to bear Ieyasu's child. Bearing the child of a powerful samurai, especially a son, was one way an ambitious young woman of the period could elevate her status, ensure a comfortable life, and guarantee the prosperity of her family. These women usually relied on their physical attributes and sexual prowess to keep their lord's attention, and some resorted to the use of aphrodisiacs. Unlike these courtesans, Oai already had the attention of Ieyasu, which would have undermined the ambitions of some and very likely made her a target of resentment, hostility, and the intrigues that were common in Japanese harems.
While Ieyasu's marriage was arranged for political reasons, and many of his later concubines were chosen in the same spirit, it is thought that he chose his relationship with Lady Saig≈ç. Despite the image of Ieyasu as a calculating and stoic warlord, there was no new political advantage to the match, as the Saig≈ç were already loyal vassals, and thus texts about Lady Saig≈ç refer to her as the "most beloved" of Ieyasu's women. Moreover, Ieyasu valued her for her intelligence and sound advice and it is believed that he enjoyed her company and calm demeanor as well as their common background in Mikawa province. On May¬†2, 1579, Oai gave birth to Ieyasu's third son, who would become known as <a href="Tokugawa%20Hidetada">Tokugawa Hidetada</a>. The news was probably a shock to all who had an interest in Ieyasu, but with the event, Oai's position became more secure and she was accepted as the first consort of Ieyasu. Based on this relationship, and out of respect for her gentle manner and devotion to Ieyasu, she became known by the respectful title of "Saig≈ç-no-Tsubone", or Lady Saig≈ç.

In the same year, Oda Nobunaga was informed that Lady Tsukiyama had conspired against him with the Takeda clan. Although evidence was weak, Ieyasu re-assured his ally by having his wife executed by the shore of Lake Sanaru in Hamamatsu. <a href="Tokugawa%20Nobuyasu">Tokugawa Nobuyasu</a>, Ieyasu's first son by Lady Tsukiyama, was held in confinement until Ieyasu ordered him to commit "<a href="seppuku">seppuku</a>". With their deaths, Lady Saig≈ç's position at court was unassailable. With the death of Nobuyasu, Hidetada became Ieyasu's heir apparent.

Ieyasu's fourth son, the second by Lady Saig≈ç, was born on October¬†18, 1580. He would become known as Matsudaira Tadayoshi, after he was adopted by <a href="Matsudaira%20Ietada%20%28Fuk%C5%8Dzu%29">Matsudaira Ietada</a>, the head of the <a href="Matsudaira%20clan%23Branches%20of%20the%20Matsudaira%20clan">Fuk≈çzu branch</a> of the <a href="Matsudaira%20clan">Matsudaira clan</a>. In the same year, Lady Saig≈ç had a temple founded in her mother's memory, indicating she had died by that point. In 1586, Lady Saig≈ç was at the side of Ieyasu when he entered the newly reconstructed <a href="Sunpu%20Castle">Sunpu Castle</a> in triumph. This was a highly symbolic celebration of his victories over his enemies and the subjugation of the region, but it was also a visible and symbolic gesture to Lady Saig≈ç, a way that Ieyasu could credit her for her assistance, and publicly demonstrate the esteem in which he regarded her.

While at Sunpu Castle, Lady Saig≈ç worshipped at a <a href="Buddhist%20temples%20in%20Japan">Buddhist temple</a> called Ry≈´sen-ji (). She became devoted to the teachings of the <a href="J%C5%8Ddo%20sh%C5%AB">Pure Land sect</a> and was known for her piety and charity. Because she suffered a high degree of <a href="myopia">myopia</a>, she often donated money, clothing, food, and other necessities to blind women and organizations that assisted them. She eventually founded a co-operative school with living quarters near Ry≈´sen-ji that assisted indigent blind women by teaching them how to play the "<a href="shamisen">shamisen</a>" (traditional stringed instrument) as a vocation, and helped them to find employment. These women were known as "<a href="goze">goze</a>", and were akin to traveling <a href="minstrel">minstrel</a>s in Edo period Japan. The women were granted membership to the <a href="guild">guild</a>-like organization, and musicians with apprentices were dispatched to various destinations. They played pieces from a sanctioned <a href="repertoire">repertoire</a>, and operated under a strict code of rules on behavior and permissible business transactions intended to maintain an upstanding reputation. On her deathbed, Lady Saig≈ç wrote a letter pleading for the continued maintenance of the organization.

Within a short time after taking up residence in Sunpu Castle, Lady Saig≈ç's health began to deteriorate. It was said that "physical and emotional hardships" were taking their toll on her health, but nothing could be done to help her. Lady Saig≈ç died on July¬†1, 1589, at the age of 37. The cause of her early death was never determined, and while murder was suspected at the time, no culprit was identified. There were later rumors that she was poisoned by a maidservant devoted to Ieyasu's late wife, the Lady Tsukiyama.

By the time of her death, Lady Saig≈ç was treated as Ieyasu's wife in deed if not in word. The remains of Lady Saig≈ç were interred at Ry≈´sen-ji. At her death, a number of blind women reportedly gathered in front of the temple and prayed.

Tokugawa Ieyasu continued his campaigns allied with <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>. After their victory at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Odawara%20%281590%29">Siege of Odawara Castle</a> in 1590, Ieyasu agreed to relinquish all of his domains to Hideyoshi in exchange for the <a href="Kant%C5%8D%20region">Kant≈ç region</a> to the east. Hideyoshi died in 1598. By 1603, Ieyasu had recovered Sunpu Castle and completed his unification of Japan, and had been named "sh≈çgun" by the Emperor. The following year, he had Ry≈´sen-ji moved from Yunoki to K≈çyamachi near Sunpu Castle and attended Buddhist funeral rites conducted in honor of the late Lady Saig≈ç on the anniversary of her death. To mark the occasion, Ieyasu presented the temple priests with the "<a href="katana">katana</a>" he inherited from his father, and a portrait of himself as he looked at the time. These items can still be viewed at the temple in <a href="Shizuoka%2C%20Shizuoka">Shizuoka city</a>.

In 1628, Tokugawa Hidetada, by then the retired second "sh≈çgun", attended ceremonies conducted in honor of his late mother on the anniversary of her death. These ceremonies were meant to help her spirit achieve <a href="Buddhahood">buddha status</a>. He also saw to it that she was made the honored <a href="Tutelary%20deity">tutelary patron</a> of the temple by having her posthumous name changed and the first three characters appended to the name of the temple. Today, the temple Ry≈´sen-ji is known mainly by that appellation, H≈çdai-in (). At the same time, the <a href="Emperor%20Go-Mizunoo">Emperor Go-Mizunoo</a> conferred the name Minamoto Masako () upon Lady Saig≈ç, in effect posthumously adopting her into the <a href="Minamoto%20clan">Minamoto clan</a>, the extended family of the Imperial line. The new name was then inducted into the Lower First Rank of the Imperial Court. Her status was later upgraded to Senior First Rank, the highest and most prominent award, then or now, bestowed by the Emperor to a few subjects outside the Imperial family who had significantly and positively affected the history of Japan.

In 1938, the mausoleum of Lady Saig≈ç at H≈çdai-in, which consisted of a <a href="Gorint%C5%8D">five-tiered stupa</a> over her grave and a sanctuary for the veneration of her spirit, was designated an <a href="Important%20Cultural%20Property%20%28Japan%29">Important Cultural Property</a>. The designation was rescinded after the entire temple complex was destroyed in the Great Shizuoka Fire on January¬†15, 1940. The stupa remains, though evidence of the damage suffered when it toppled over is plainly visible. Many of the treasures of the temple, including a portrait of Lady Saig≈ç and the sword and portrait bequeathed by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1604, were saved by the priests who flung the objects out of windows and doorways before fleeing the burning temple. The temple was rebuilt using steel-reinforced concrete in 1970. Historical artifacts saved from the fire of 1940 are on display at the new H≈çdai-in temple in Shizuoka city.

Lady Saig≈ç was the ancestral mother to the line of "sh≈çguns" that began with the second <a href="Edo%20period">Edo-period</a> "sh≈çgun", Tokugawa Hidetada, and ended with the seventh, <a href="Tokugawa%20Ietsugu">Tokugawa Ietsugu</a> (1709‚Äì1716). Aside from this, Lady Saig≈ç also became connected to the Imperial line. In 1620, Hidetada's daughter, <a href="Tokugawa%20Masako">Tokugawa Masako</a> (1607‚Äì1678), married Emperor Go-Mizunoo and entered the Imperial palace. As <a href="empress%20consort">empress consort</a>, Masako helped maintain the Imperial Court, supported the arts, and significantly influenced the next three monarchs: the first was her daughter, and the two that followed, <a href="Emperor%20Go-K%C5%8Dmy%C5%8D">Emperors Go-K≈çmy≈ç</a> and <a href="Emperor%20Go-Sai">Go-Sai</a>, were sons of Emperor Go-Mizunoo by different concubines. The daughter of Masako, and thus great-granddaughter of Lady Saig≈ç, was Princess Okiko (1624‚Äì1696), who acceded to the <a href="Chrysanthemum%20Throne">Chrysanthemum Throne</a> in 1629 as <a href="Empress%20Meish%C5%8D">Empress Meish≈ç</a>. She reigned for fifteen years as the 109th¬†monarch of Japan, the seventh of only eight <a href="empress%20regnant">empresses regnant</a> in the history of Japan, until she abdicated in 1643.

SMS "Oldenburg" was the fourth vessel of the of <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>. "Oldenburg"s keel was laid in October 1908 at the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> dockyard in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>. She was launched on 30 September 1909 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 May 1912. The ship was equipped with twelve guns in six twin <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a>, and had a top speed of . "Oldenburg" was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for the majority of her career, including <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Along with her three sister ships, , , and , "Oldenburg" participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> against the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May and 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. The ship also saw action in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> against the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a>. She was present during the unsuccessful <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">first incursion into the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915, though she saw no combat during the operation.

After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned <a href="scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">and then scuttled</a> in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> during the peace negotiations. The four "Helgoland"-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany but eventually ceded to the victorious <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied powers</a> as <a href="war%20reparations">war reparations</a>; "Oldenburg" was given to Japan, which sold the vessel to a British ship-breaking firm in 1920. She was broken up for scrap in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a> in 1921.

"Oldenburg" was ordered by the German Imperial Navy ("Kaiserliche Marine") under the provisional name "Ersatz Frithjof", as a replacement for the old <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> . The contract for the ship was awarded to the <a href="Schichau-Werke">Schichau-Werke</a> shipyard in <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a> under construction number 828. Her three <a href="Helgoland-class%20battleship">sisters</a> had been ordered for 1908, but because of budget constraints, "Oldenburg" order was delayed to 1909. Admiral <a href="Alfred%20von%20Tirpitz">Alfred von Tirpitz</a>, the State Secretary of the Navy, gave the contract to Schichau before the 1909 budget had been approved, and the shipbuilder began stockpiling materials to build the ship. This gave the impression that Germany was building more battleships than publicly admitted, which prompted a naval scare in Britain. The British public demanded "we want eight [new battleships] and we won't wait", and in the span of a year eight new battleships had been laid down in Britain, a major escalation in the <a href="Anglo-German%20naval%20arms%20race">international naval arms race</a>. Work began on 1 March 1909 with the laying of her keel, and the ship was launched a little more than a year later on 30 June 1910. Duchess <a href="Duchess%20Sophia%20Charlotte%20of%20Oldenburg">Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg</a> christened her, and <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20II%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Oldenburg">Friedrich August</a>, the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, gave the speech. After launching, the incomplete ship was transferred to <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a> for <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a>, including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament, until August 1911. Named for the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Oldenburg">Duchy of Oldenburg</a> in northern Germany, the ship was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 May 1912, just over three years after work commenced, at a cost of 45.801¬†million <a href="German%20gold%20mark">gold marks</a>.

The ship was long, had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of , and <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at full load. She was powered by three <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple expansion steam engines</a> and fifteen <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. The engines were rated at and were capable of producing a top speed of . "Oldenburg" stored up to of coal, allowing her to steam for at a speed of . After 1915 the boilers were modified to burn oil, which would be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate; the ship could carry up to . "Oldenburg" had a crew of 42¬†officers and 1,027¬†enlisted men.

"Oldenburg" was armed with a main battery of twelve <a href="30.5%20cm%20SK%20L/50%20gun">SK L/50</a> guns in six twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, with one turret fore, one aft, and two on each flank of the ship. The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 guns and fourteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45</a> guns. After 1914, two of the 8.8¬†cm guns were removed and replaced by 8.8¬†cm anti-aircraft guns; later, an additional two 8.8¬†cm guns were replaced with anti-aircraft guns. This brought the total number of 8.8¬†cm SK L/45 guns to ten, and the number of 8.8¬†cm anti-aircraft guns to four. "Oldenburg" was also armed with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. She was protected a <a href="belt%20armor">main belt</a> that was thick, with the same thickness of armor on her main battery turrets. She had a deck that was thick.

After her commissioning on 1 May 1912, "Oldenburg" conducted <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s in the Baltic. On 17 July, she was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, alongside her sisters. After individual ship training exercises, she joined I Squadron maneuvers and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic, in order to keep the fleet closer to Germany. "Oldenburg" and the rest of the fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peace-time training.

The annual summer cruise to Norway began on 14 July 1914, despite the rising international tensions following the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria</a>. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills in the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany due to Austria-Hungary's <a href="July%20Ultimatum">ultimatum to Serbia</a>. On 27 July, the entire fleet assembled off <a href="Skudenes">Cape Skudenes</a> before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July "Oldenburg" and the rest of I Squadron were back in Wilhelmshaven.

"Oldenburg" was present during the first sortie by German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral von Ingenohl intended to use the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of "<a href="Counter%20admiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> to raid British coastal towns in order to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a>. That evening, the German battle fleet of eight pre-dreadnoughts and twelve dreadnoughts, including "Oldenburg" and her three <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a>, came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, so von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany, under orders from <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>, in which Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty's</a> <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st</a> and <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons</a> ambushed the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, occurred on 24 January 1915. "Oldenburg" and the rest of I Squadron were sortied to reinforce the outnumbered German battlecruisers; I Squadron left port at 12:33¬†<a href="Central%20European%20Time">CET</a>, along with the <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>s of II Squadron. They were too late, however, and they failed to locate any British forces. By 19:05, the fleet had returned to the <a href="Schillig%20Roads">Schillig Roads</a> outside Wilhelmshaven. In the meantime, the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> had been overwhelmed by concentrated British fire and sunk, while the battlecruiser was severely damaged by an ammunition fire. As a result, Kaiser Wilhelm II removed von Ingenohl from his post and replaced him with Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> on 2 February.

From 22 February to 13 March 1915, I Squadron was in the Baltic for unit training. Following their return to the North Sea, the ships participated in a series of uneventful fleet sorties on 29‚Äì30 March, 17‚Äì18 April, 21‚Äì22 April, 17‚Äì18 May, and 29‚Äì30 May. The fleet was largely inactive until 4 August, when I Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of training maneuvers. From there, the squadron was attached to the naval force that attempted to sweep the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> of Russian naval forces in August 1915. The assault force included the eight I Squadron battleships, the battlecruisers , , and "Seydlitz", several <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, 32 destroyers and 13 <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a>. The plan called for channels in Russian minefields to be swept so that the Russian naval presence, which included the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a> , could be eliminated. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the Gulf. "Oldenburg" and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the Gulf for the entirety of <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">the operation</a>, to prevent possible intervention by the Russian fleet outside the Gulf. The dreadnoughts and were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy "Slava", though they failed to sink the old battleship. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the Gulf the following day. By 26 August, I Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven.

On 23‚Äì24 October, the High Seas Fleet undertook its last major offensive operation under the command of Admiral von Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. Weakened by <a href="hepatic%20cancer">hepatic cancer</a> and unable to carry out his duties, he was replaced by Vice Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5‚Äì7 March, followed by two more on 21‚Äì22 March and 25‚Äì26 March. During his next operation, "Oldenburg" supported <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">a raid on the English coast</a> on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the <a href="Jade%20Estuary">Jade Estuary</a> at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser "Seydlitz" struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a>. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the I¬†Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.

"Oldenburg" was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, "Oldenburg" was the fourth ship in the I Division of I Squadron and the twelfth ship in the line, directly astern of her sister ship "Helgoland" and ahead of "Posen". At the center of the German line was I Squadron, behind the eight - and s of III Squadron. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation.

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, "K√∂nig", spotted both the I¬†Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">two-point</a> turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.

At first, "Oldenburg" was too far away to effectively engage any British ships. Shortly before 18:30, the German line came across the British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement. Naval historian John Campbell states that ""Th√ºringen" and "Helgoland", and possibly "Oldenburg" and "Posen", fired turret guns", as well as secondary weapons, at "Nestor". The ship was destroyed by several large explosions and sank at 18:35; most of her crew was rescued by German torpedo boats. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought came into range; she was the first major warship "Oldenburg" could engage. She fired her 30.5¬†cm guns briefly during the 180-degree turn ordered by Scheer to disengage from the British fleet. "Oldenburg" claimed to have straddled "Warspite" once, though her gunners had difficulty discerning the British battleship in the growing haze.

At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. "Oldenburg" was now the fifth ship, stationed toward the front of the 24-ship line. At around 01:10, the German line encountered the six destroyers of the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. "Oldenburg" fired on several of the destroyers at close range, including and . "Fortune" scored a single hit on "Oldenburg" with her 4-inch guns. The shell struck a forward searchlight above the bridge and caused serious casualties. The officer responsible for directing the 8.8¬†cm guns was killed, along with three other officers on the bridge. The helmsman was incapacitated and the ship's commander, Captain H√∂pfner, was wounded. "Oldenburg" was briefly steaming unsteered, and was in danger of ramming "Posen" and "Helgoland" until Captain H√∂pfner managed to reach the wheel and take control of the ship. "Oldenburg" and several other battleships then took under fire; the destroyer was reduced to a flaming wreck. In the darkness, "Fortune" and "Ardent" were sunk and the remaining four ships were scattered.

Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> by 4:00 on 1¬†June. A few hours later, the fleet arrived in the Jade; "Th√ºringen", "Helgoland", "Nassau", and took up defensive positions in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> and , , , and anchored just outside the entrance locks to Wilhelmshaven. "Oldenburg" and the other seven remaining dreadnoughts entered port, where those that were still in fighting condition restocked ammunition and fuel. In the course of the battle, "Oldenburg" fired fifty-three 30.5¬†cm, eighty-eight 15¬†cm, and thirty 8.8¬†cm shells. The hit from "Fortune" was the only damage the ship incurred from enemy action, though a misfire occurred in the Number 4 port-side 15¬†cm gun. In total, "Oldenburg"s crew suffered eight men killed and fourteen wounded.

After Jutland, "Oldenburg" was assigned to guard duties in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. The damage incurred at Jutland was quickly repaired in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> from 30 June to 15 July. On 18 August, Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation. "Moltke" and "Von der Tann", the two serviceable German battlecruisers, were supported by three dreadnoughts in a mission to bombard the coastal town of <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including "Oldenburg", would trail behind and provide cover. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north and aborted the bombardment after receiving a false report from a <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> about a British unit in the area. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

On 25‚Äì26 September, "Oldenburg" and the rest of I Squadron covered an advance conducted by the II "F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote" (Leader of Torpedo Boats) to the <a href="Terschelling">Terschelling</a> Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18‚Äì20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank, though again they failed to find British forces. For the majority of 1917, "Oldenburg" was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, "Oldenburg" and her three sisters were moved to the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a> to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in <a href="Bay%20of%20Puck">Putzig Wiek</a>, and from there steamed to <a href="Kuressaare">Arensburg</a> on 29 October. On 2 November the operation was completed and "Oldenburg" and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23‚Äì24 April 1918. Scheer had intended to intercept a British convoy to Norway and destroy the escorting battleships. During the operation, the battlecruiser "Moltke" suffered mechanical problems and had to be towed back to port. "Oldenburg" took the ship in tow, and the main body of the fleet turned back to Germany while Hipper searched in vain for the convoy. German intelligence had incorrectly placed the date for the scheduled convoy on 24 April, and after several hours of fruitless steaming, Hipper turned for port as well. By 18:37, the fleet was outside the Jade and "Moltke" had been repaired enough to allow her to enter port under her own power.

"Oldenburg" and her three sisters were to have taken part in a <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">final fleet action</a> at the end of October 1918, days before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. Scheer‚Äîby now the <a href="Grand%20Admiral">Grand Admiral</a> ("Gro√üadmiral") of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on "Th√ºringen" and then on several other battleships <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated "I no longer have a navy".

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the most modern capital ships of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, were interned in the British naval base in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, but "Oldenburg", commanded by <a href="Hermann%20Bauer">Hermann Bauer</a>, and the rest of I Squadron remained in Germany. On the morning of 21 June 1919, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and in their absence Reuter ordered the crews to <a href="scuttling">scuttle</a> the ten battleships and five battlecruisers interned at Scapa Flow. "Oldenburg" was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919 and placed out of commission. The fate of the eight remaining German battleships was determined in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which stated that the ships were to be disarmed and surrendered to the governments of the principal Allied powers. She was surrendered to Japan as ""M"" on 13 May 1920. The Japanese Navy had no need for the ship; she was sold to a British ship-breaking firm in June 1920 and broken up for scrap the following year in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a>.

SMS "Th√ºringen" was the third vessel of the of <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s of the German <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">Imperial Navy</a>. "Th√ºringen"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid in November 1908 at the <a href="AG%20Weser">AG Weser</a> dockyard in <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a>. She was launched on 27 November 1909 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1911. The ship was equipped with twelve guns in six twin <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a>, and had a top speed of . "Th√ºringen" was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for the majority of her career, including <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Along with her three <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a>s, , , and , "Th√ºringen" participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> against the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>. This included the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May and 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. "Th√ºringen" was involved in the heavy night fighting at Jutland, including the destruction of the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> . The ship also saw action against the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, where she participated in the unsuccessful <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">first incursion into the Gulf of Riga</a> in August 1915.

After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> during the peace negotiations. The four "Helgoland"-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany and were therefore spared the <a href="scuttling%20of%20the%20German%20fleet%20in%20Scapa%20Flow">destruction of the fleet in Scapa Flow</a>. "Th√ºringen" and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied powers</a> as <a href="war%20reparations">war reparations</a>; "Th√ºringen" was transferred to France in April 1920 and used as a target ship for the French Navy. She was sunk off <a href="Gavres">Gavres</a> and broken up <a href="wikt%3Ain%20situ">"in situ"</a> in 1923‚Äì1933, though some sections of the ship remain.

"Th√ºringen" was ordered by the German Imperial Navy ("Kaiserliche Marine") under the provisional name "Ersatz Beowulf", as a replacement for the old <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a> . The contract for the ship was awarded to the <a href="AG%20Weser">AG Weser</a> dockyard in <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> under construction number 166. Work began on 2 November 1908 with the laying of her <a href="keel">keel</a>, and the ship was launched a year later on 27 November 1909. She was christened by Duchess <a href="Adelheid%20von%20Sachsen-Altenburg">Adelheid von Sachsen-Altenburg</a>, and Grand Duke <a href="William%20Ernest%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach">Wilhelm Ernst</a> gave the speech. <a href="Fitting-out">Fitting-out</a>, including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament, lasted until June 1911. Following her completion, six pontoon barges were attached to the new battleship to reduce her draft to allow her to be towed down the <a href="Weser%20River">Weser River</a> to the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. "Th√ºringen", named for <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, a state in central Germany, was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 June 1911, less than three years after work commenced, at a cost of 46.314¬†million <a href="German%20gold%20mark">gold marks</a>, the most expensive unit of her class.

The ship was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, had a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draft</a> of , and <a href="displacement%20%28ship%29">displaced</a> at full load. She was powered by three <a href="Marine%20steam%20engine%23Triple%20or%20multiple%20expansion">vertical triple expansion steam engines</a> and fifteen <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. The engines were rated at and were capable of producing a top speed of . "Th√ºringen" stored up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . After 1915, the boilers were modified to spray oil on the coal to increase its burn rate; the ship could carry up to of fuel oil.

"Th√ºringen" was armed with a main battery of twelve <a href="30.5%20cm%20SK%20L/50%20gun">SK L/50</a> guns in six twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, with one turret fore, one aft, and two on each flank of the ship. The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen <a href="15%20cm%20SK%20L/45">SK L/45</a> guns and fourteen <a href="8.8%20cm%20SK%20L/45%20naval%20gun">SK L/45</a> guns. After 1914, two of the 8.8¬†cm guns were removed and replaced by 8.8¬†cm anti-aircraft guns. "Th√ºringen" was also armed with six submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and two on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. Her <a href="belt%20armor">main belt</a> of armor was thick, with the same thickness of armor on her main battery turrets. Her deck was thick.

After her commissioning on 1 July 1911, "Th√ºringen" conducted <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s, which were completed by 10 September. On 19 September, she was assigned to the I Battle Squadron of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>, alongside her sisters. She then went on to conduct individual ship training exercises, which were followed by I Squadron exercises and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a>. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic. "Th√ºringen" and the rest of the fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years. In October 1913, <a href="William%20Michaelis">William Michaelis</a> became the ship's commanding officer; he held the post until February 1915.

On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off <a href="Skagen">Skagen</a> before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's <a href="July%20Ultimatum">ultimatum to Serbia</a>. On 27 July, the entire fleet assembled off <a href="Skudenes">Cape Skudenes</a> before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and within a week all the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July "Th√ºringen" and the rest of I Squadron were back in <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a>. During the first year of the war, the future anti-Nazi <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> pastor <a href="Martin%20Niem%C3%B6ller">Martin Niem√∂ller</a> served aboard the ship as an officer.

"Th√ºringen" was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral <a href="Friedrich%20von%20Ingenohl">Friedrich von Ingenohl</a>, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral von Ingenohl intended to use the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s of "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Franz%20von%20Hipper">Franz von Hipper</a>'s <a href="I%20Scouting%20Group">I Scouting Group</a> to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby</a> on the English coast. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding "Th√ºringen" and her three <a href="sister%20ship">sisters</a>‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>, in which Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty's</a> <a href="1st%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st</a> and <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons</a> ambushed the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, occurred on 24 January 1915. "Th√ºringen" and the rest of I Squadron were sortied to reinforce the outnumbered German battlecruisers; I Squadron left port at 12:33¬†<a href="Central%20European%20Time">CET</a>, along with the <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>s of II Squadron. The High Seas Fleet was too late, so it failed to locate any British forces. By 19:05, the fleet had returned to the <a href="Schillig%20Roads">Schillig Roads</a> outside Wilhelmshaven. In the meantime, the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> had been overwhelmed by concentrated British fire and sunk, while the battlecruiser was severely damaged by an ammunition fire. As a result, Wilhelm II removed von Ingenohl from his post and replaced him with Admiral <a href="Hugo%20von%20Pohl">Hugo von Pohl</a> on 2 February.
The eight I Squadron ships went into the Baltic on 22 February 1915 for unit training, which lasted until 13 March. Following their return to the North Sea, the ships participated in a series of uneventful fleet sorties on 29‚Äì30 March, 17‚Äì18 April, 21‚Äì22 April, 17‚Äì18 May, and 29‚Äì30 May. "Th√ºringen" and the rest of the fleet then remained in port until 4 August, when the I Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of training maneuvers. From there, the squadron was attached to the naval force that attempted to sweep the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> of Russian naval forces in August 1915. The assault force included the eight I Squadron battleships, the battlecruisers , , and "Seydlitz", several <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, 32 destroyers and 13 <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a>. The plan called for channels to be swept in Russian minefields so that the Russian naval presence, which included the pre-dreadnought , could be eliminated. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the Gulf. "Th√ºringen" and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the Gulf for the entirety of <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Gulf%20of%20Riga">the operation</a>. The dreadnoughts and were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy "Slava", though they failed to sink the old battleship. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August; reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the Gulf the following day. By 26 August, the I Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven.

On 23‚Äì24 October, the High Seas Fleet undertook its last major offensive operation under the command of von Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. By January 1916 <a href="hepatic%20cancer">hepatic cancer</a> had weakened von Pohl to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties, and he was replaced by Vice Admiral <a href="Reinhard%20Scheer">Reinhard Scheer</a> in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5‚Äì7 March, followed by two more on 21‚Äì22 March and 25‚Äì26 March. During Scheer's next operation, "Th√ºringen" supported <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Yarmouth%20and%20Lowestoft">a raid on the English coast</a> on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the <a href="Jade%20Estuary">Jade Estuary</a> at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser "Seydlitz" struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a>. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the I¬†Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.

"Th√ºringen" was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, "Th√ºringen" was the second ship in the I Division of I Squadron and the tenth ship in the line, directly astern of the squadron flagship "Ostfriesland" and ahead of another sister "Helgoland". The I Squadron was the center of the German line, behind the eight - and s of III Squadron. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of the III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation.

Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, "K√∂nig", spotted both the I¬†Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a <a href="Boxing%20the%20compass">two-point</a> turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given.

While the leading battleships engaged the British battlecruiser squadron, "Th√ºringen" and ten other battleships, too far out of range to attack the British battlecruisers, fired on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. "Th√ºringen" and engaged the cruiser , though both ships failed to score a hit. "Th√ºringen" fired for eight minutes at ranges of , expending twenty-nine 30.5¬†cm shells. The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, laid directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. "Th√ºringen" and three other battleships destroyed "Nestor" with their primary and secondary guns while several III Squadron battleships sank "Nomad". Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought came into range; "Th√ºringen" opened fire at 19:25 with her main and secondary battery guns, at ranges of . The ship fired twenty-one 30.5¬†cm and thirty-seven 15¬†cm shells in the span of five or six minutes, after which "Th√ºringen"s gunners lost sight of "Warspite", without scoring any hits. They then shifted fire to . "Th√ºringen" fired twenty main battery rounds at "Malaya", also unsuccessfully, over seven minutes at a range of before conforming to a 180¬†degree turn ordered by Scheer to disengage from the British fleet.

At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night-cruising formation. "Th√ºringen" was the seventh ship, stationed toward the front of the 24-ship line. An hour later, the leading units of the German line encountered British light forces and a violent firefight at close range ensued. Sometime around 01:10, the armored cruiser stumbled into the German line. "Th√ºringen" illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30.5¬†cm rounds into the ship at point-blank range. The first salvo struck near "Black Prince"s rear gun turret, which appears to have been blown overboard. "Th√ºringen" fired a total of ten 30.5¬†cm, twenty-seven 15¬†cm, and twenty-four 8.8¬†cm shells. She was joined by three other battleships, and "Black Prince" was soon destroyed by a huge ammunition explosion. Around a half an hour later, "Th√ºringen" spotted what appeared to be a <a href="Town-class%20cruiser%20%281910%29%23Birkenhead%20class">"Birkenhead"-class cruiser</a>. She fired a <a href="starshell">starshell</a> to illuminate the British cruiser and opened fire with her secondary guns. The ship was actually the destroyer . "Th√ºringen" fired eighteen 15¬†cm and six 8.8¬†cm shells before launching another starshell. "Turbulent" appeared to be capsized to starboard, though she remained afloat and was dispatched later by the cruiser and the destroyers and .

Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached <a href="Horns%20Reef">Horns Reef</a> by 04:00 on 1¬†June. A few hours later, the fleet arrived in the Jade; "Th√ºringen", "Helgoland", "Nassau", and took up defensive positions in the outer <a href="roadstead">roadstead</a> and four undamaged III Squadron ships anchored just outside the entrance locks to Wilhelmshaven. The remaining eight dreadnoughts entered port, where those that were still in fighting condition restocked ammunition and fuel. In the course of the engagement, "Th√ºringen" had fired one-hundred and seven 30.5¬†cm, one-hundred and fifteen 15¬†cm, and twenty-two 8.8¬†cm shells, while she and her crew emerged from the battle unscathed.

On 18 August, Admiral Scheer attempted to repeat the 31 May operation. The two serviceable German battlecruisers ("Moltke" and "Von der Tann"), supported by three dreadnoughts, would bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including "Th√ºringen", would trail behind and provide cover. British signals intelligence informed Jellicoe of the German departure later in the day, and he sent the Grand Fleet out to intercept the Germans. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35 on 19 August, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.

On 25‚Äì26 September, "Th√ºringen" and the rest of I Squadron covered an advance conducted by the second commander of the torpedo-boat flotillas (II "F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote") to the <a href="Terschelling">Terschelling</a> Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18‚Äì20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank, though rudder damage prevented "Th√ºringen" from participating. For the majority of 1917, "Th√ºringen" was assigned to guard duty in the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a>. During <a href="Operation%20Albion">Operation Albion</a>, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, "Th√ºringen" and her three sisters were moved to the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a> to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in <a href="Bay%20of%20Puck">Putzig Wiek</a>, and from there steamed to <a href="Kuressaare">Arensburg</a> on the 29th. On 2 November the operation was completed and "Th√ºringen" and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23‚Äì24 April 1918. "Th√ºringen", "Ostfriesland", and "Nassau" were formed into a special unit for Operation "Schlu√üstein", a planned occupation of <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd.

"Th√ºringen" and her three sisters were to have taken part in a <a href="Naval%20order%20of%2024%20October%201918">final fleet action</a> at the end of October 1918, days before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the <a href="Grand%20Admiral">Grand Admiral</a> ("Gro√üadmiral") of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on "Th√ºringen" and then on several other battleships <a href="Wilhelmshaven%20mutiny">mutinied</a>. Stokers turned off the boilers and refused to work. The following day, the torpedo boats and came alongside and the <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> pointed her guns at the ship. A significant portion of the crew, 314 sailors and 124 stokers, were arrested and taken off the ship. This was not enough to stop the mutiny, which quickly spread throughout the fleet. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated "I no longer have a navy".

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral <a href="Ludwig%20von%20Reuter">Ludwig von Reuter</a>, was interned in the British naval base in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. "Th√ºringen" and her three sisters, along with the four "Nassau"-class battleships, were permitted to remain in Germany during the peace negotiations. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and in their absence Reuter ordered the crews to <a href="scuttling">scuttle</a> the ten battleships and five battlecruisers interned at Scapa Flow. "Th√ºringen" was decommissioned on 16 December 1918 and used as a barracks ship while she remained in Germany. She was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919 and placed out of commission. The fate of the eight remaining German battleships was determined in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which stated that the ships were to be disarmed and surrendered to the governments of the principal Allied powers. "Th√ºringen" was surrendered to the French Navy on 29 April 1920 under the name ""L"". A skeleton crew took the ship to <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> for the official transfer. "Th√ºringen" was briefly used as a target ship by the French Navy before sinking off <a href="Gavres">Gavres</a>. The ship was partially broken up <a href="wikt%3Ain%20situ">"in situ"</a> in 1923‚Äì1933, though significant portions of the ship remain off the French coast.

Malagasy mountain mouse

The Malagasy mountain mouse or Koopman's montane voalavo "(Monticolomys koopmani)" is a rodent within the subfamily <a href="Nesomyinae">Nesomyinae</a> of the family <a href="Nesomyidae">Nesomyidae</a>. It is monotypic within the genus "Monticolomys", and is closely related to the <a href="big-footed%20mouse">big-footed mouse</a> "(Macrotarsomys)". It is found in the highlands of eastern <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a>. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof.

First collected in 1929, the Malagasy mountain mouse was not formally described until 1996, but it is now known to have a broad distribution. Active during the night, it occurs in both <a href="Madagascar%20subhumid%20forests">montane forest</a> and human-disturbed grasslands and feeds on fruits and seeds. A <a href="scansorial">scansorial</a> animal, it climbs trees but also lives on the ground. Although <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> may pose a threat, it is classified as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

A <a href="Biological%20specimen">specimen</a> was captured in 1929 during the Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Am√©ricaine to Madagascar, but the rodents obtained by the expedition were never studied in detail. It was not until the 1970s that <a href="Karl%20Koopman">Karl Koopman</a> and <a href="Guy%20Musser">Guy Musser</a> recognized that the animal‚Äîwhose skin had landed at the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York, while the skull was at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27histoire%20naturelle">Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle</a> in Paris‚Äîrepresented an otherwise unknown species. However, they never published their results. In 1993, <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> rediscovered the species on Madagascar and in 1996 he and Michael Carleton finally published a formal description. They named the animal "Monticolomys koopmani", as the sole member of a new <a href="genus">genus</a>. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a> "Monticolomys" means "mountain-dwelling mouse" and refers to the animal's montane habitat, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "koopmani" honors Karl Koopman for his many contributions to mammalian systematics. <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s in use for the animal also include "Koopman's montane voalavo" and "Malagasy mountain mouse".

The indigenous rodents of Madagascar, the <a href="Nesomyinae">Nesomyinae</a>, prior to the discovery of "Monticolomys" comprised seven very distinctive genera‚Äîso distinct from each other that some have found it difficult to accept that they are closely related. "Monticolomys", however, does not follow this pattern, in that it is similar and closely related to the <a href="gerbil">gerbil</a>-like genus "<a href="Macrotarsomys">Macrotarsomys</a>" of western Madagascar. This relationship was originally proposed by Goodman and Carleton based on morphology, and was strongly supported by a <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> analysis (based on the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> gene) published in 1999. While this study provided some weak support for a relationship between the "Macrotarsomys‚ÄìMonticolomys" <a href="clade">clade</a> and the giant jumping rat, "<a href="Hypogeomys">Hypogeomys</a>", a later study based on the <a href="RBP3">IRBP</a> gene instead placed "Macrotarsomys‚ÄìMonticolomys" sister to a clade containing four other nesomyine genera‚Äî"<a href="Eliurus">Eliurus</a>", "<a href="Voalavo">Voalavo</a>", "<a href="Gymnuromys">Gymnuromys</a>", and "<a href="Brachytarsomys">Brachytarsomys</a>".

The Malagasy mountain mouse is a small, mouse-like rodent, and quite different in appearance from most other nesomyines. It has a thick, soft fur, which appears dark brown on the upperparts. The cover hairs (which comprise most of the fur) are tricolored: for the basal two-thirds of their length, they are <a href="wikt%3Aplumbeous">plumbeous</a> gray; the middle is <a href="wikt%3Aochraceous">ochraceous</a>; and the tip is dark brown to black. The longer <a href="guard%20hair">guard hair</a>s, which are most common towards the middle of the back, are completely black. The fur of the underparts appears dark gray and is not sharply demarcated from the upperparts. There, the hairs are also plumbeous at the bases, but the tips range from white to yellowish-brown. The <a href="mystacial%20vibrissae">mystacial vibrissae</a>‚Äîwhiskers above the mouth‚Äîare medium-sized. The short, rounded ears are densely covered with grayish hairs. "Monticolomys" has broad hindfeet bearing prominent <a href="Paw%23Common%20characteristics">pads</a> and long outer digits. There are white hairs on the upper sides of the <a href="metapodial">metapodial</a>s and digits, and long <a href="ungual%20tuft">ungual tuft</a>s‚Äîtufts of hair surrounding the bases of the claws‚Äîare present. The thumb of the forefeet bears a nail, but claws are present on the other digits. The long tail is covered with small scales and light brown hairs. The tail lacks a distinct tuft at the tip, as is present in "Eliurus" and "Macrotarsomys". Females have six <a href="mammae">mammae</a>. Head and body length is , tail length is , hindfoot length is , ear length is , and body mass is .

The skull is small and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and relatively long. The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a>s are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>‚Äîa bony plate at the side of the skull‚Äîis narrow and extends back to the front margin of the first upper <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> (M1). The <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a>s constitute much of the thin <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones). The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a>, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the <a href="braincase">braincase</a>. The <a href="incisive%20foramina">incisive foramina</a>, openings in the front part of the <a href="palate">palate</a>, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a>, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 <a href="thoracic%20vertebra">thoracic</a> (chest), 7 <a href="lumbar%20vertebra">lumbar</a> (abdomen), 4 <a href="sacral%20vertebra">sacral</a> (hip), and 38 <a href="caudal%20vertebra">caudal</a> (tail) vertebrae.

The upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s have orange <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a> and are <a href="opisthodont">opisthodont</a>, with the cutting edge of the tooth inclined backwards. The root of the lower incisors extends though the <a href="mandible%20%28anatomy%29">mandible</a> (lower jaw) to a low <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a> at the back of the jawbone. The molars are <a href="brachyodont">brachyodont</a> (low-crowned) and bear distinct <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusps</a>. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are quite similar to those of "Macrotarsomys", and differ only in minor details.

The species' range is now known to extend across the mountain ranges of eastern Madagascar from the <a href="Tsaratanana%20Massif">Tsaratanana Massif</a> south to <a href="Andohahela">Andohahela</a>, at above sea level. It occurs in <a href="montane%20forest">montane forest</a>, but also in degraded grassland, where it is among the first species to return after fires. At <a href="Ankaratra">Ankaratra</a>, where the species was recorded in 1929, it occurred in such grassland, where the nesomyine "<a href="Brachyuromys%20betsileoensis">Brachyuromys betsileoensis</a>" was also found. The animal was again recorded at Ankaratra in 1996, this time in a heavily disturbed forest, where it occurred with "<a href="Eliurus%20minor">Eliurus minor</a>" and the introduced <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"). At <a href="Andringitra%20Massif">Andringitra</a>, the animal was recorded in high montane forest together with six other nesomyines‚Äî"<a href="Brachyuromys%20ramirohitra">Brachyuromys ramirohitra</a>", "Eliurus minor", "<a href="Eliurus%20tanala">Eliurus tanala</a>", "<a href="Eliurus%20webbi">Eliurus webbi</a>", "<a href="Gymnuromys%20roberti">Gymnuromys roberti</a>", and "<a href="Nesomys%20rufus">Nesomys rufus</a>"‚Äîas well as the black rat. At Andohahela, "Monticolomys" was found at an altitude of in <a href="sclerophyllous">sclerophyllous</a> forest. Its distribution corresponds to the <a href="High%20Mountain%20Domain">High Mountain Domain</a>, a region defined on the basis of plant distributions. This region is now discontinuous, but the High Mountain Domain habitat was continuous from mountain to mountain as recently as the early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> remains have been found in <a href="Mahajanga%20Province">Mahajanga Province</a> (northwestern Madagascar). Malagasy mountain mouse is morphologically uniform across its wide distribution.

The Malagasy mountain mouse is nocturnal and solitary and produces litters of up to three offspring. It is <a href="scansorial">scansorial</a>, spending time on the ground but also climbing in vegetation. In Andringitra, two specimens were captured on a <a href="liana">liana</a> over the ground, and a third was caught on the ground together with two shrew tenrecs ("<a href="Microgale%20taiva">Microgale taiva</a>"). All five specimens from Andohahela were trapped on the ground, as was the specimen caught in Ankaratra in 1996. Its diet includes fruits and seeds; in captivity, it eats "<a href="Agauria">Agauria</a>" fruits.

As Malagasy mountain mouse is now known to be a widespread, common species occurring in at least one <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a> (<a href="Andringitra%20National%20Park">Andringitra National Park</a>; it may also occur in <a href="Ankarana%20Special%20Reserve">Ankarana Special Reserve</a>), it is listed on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as "<a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>". However, fires pose a threat in montane forest and, at lower elevations, its habitat is being converted into agricultural land.

Thomcord

Thomcord is a <a href="Seedless%20fruit">seedless</a> <a href="table%20grape">table grape</a> variety and a <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a> of the popular Thompson Seedless or <a href="Sultana%20%28grape%29">Sultanina</a> grape (a "<a href="Vitis%20vinifera">Vitis vinifera</a>" variety) and <a href="Concord%20%28grape%29">Concord grape</a> (a "<a href="Vitis%20labrusca">Vitis labrusca</a>" variety). Thomcord was developed in 1983 by Californian grape breeders working for the <a href="Agricultural%20Research%20Service">Agricultural Research Service</a> (ARS), an agency of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA), as part of a test to better understand a new seedless grape breeding procedure.

Its aromatic, "<a href="Vitis%20labrusca">labrusca</a>" flavor is similar to that of Concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from Thompson Seedless. Thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late July and mid-August, and tolerates <a href="Uncinula%20necator">powdery mildew</a>. It is a productive variety, yielding an average of of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as per vine in grower trials. The berries weigh between and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike Concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily. The <a href="Seedless%20fruit">aborted seeds</a> in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in Thompson Seedless.

The plant is not <a href="Plant%20quarantine">restricted</a> for propagation and distribution. Virus-free propagation material is available from the Foundation Plant Services (FPS) at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a>, and its genetic material is archived at the <a href="National%20Plant%20Germplasm%20System">National Plant Germplasm System</a>. After 17¬†years of testing, it was declared ready for use in 2003. It is currently available in supermarkets.

Thomcord grape is a hybrid of Thompson Seedless grape ("<a href="Vitis%20vinifera">Vitis vinifera</a>", or Sultanina), which is popular in supermarkets during the summer, and seeded Concord grape ("<a href="Vitis%20labrusca">Vitis labrusca</a>"), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless <a href="table%20grape">table grape</a> and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("<a href="Vitis%20labrusca">labrusca</a>"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.

Thomcord is suitable for hot, dry growing conditions, more so than Concord and other Concord seedless types. Its adaptability to hot dry climates was derived from Thompson Seedless. It grows well in <a href="Wine%20Country%20%28California%29">California's vineyards</a>, particularly the <a href="San%20Joaquin%20Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a>, just like Thompson Seedless. The plant is tolerant of (but not resistant to) <a href="Uncinula%20necator">powdery mildew</a>, and is less susceptible to the <a href="fungus">fungus</a> than <a href="Ruby%20Seedless%20%28grape%29">Ruby Seedless</a>, but more susceptible than <a href="Mars%20%28grape%29">Mars</a>, <a href="Venus%20%28grape%29">Venus</a>, <a href="Niabell%20%28grape%29">Niabell</a>, and <a href="Cayuga%20White">Cayuga White</a> varieties. The fungus can affect its <a href="Leaf">leaves</a>, <a href="Plant%20stem">stems</a>, <a href="rachis">rachis</a> (stem of the grape cluster), and <a href="Berry%20%28botany%29">berries</a>. The grape ripens in the summer (mid-season), between late July and mid-August.

Thomcord is a productive variety, with a yield comparable to Thompson Seedless. When two <a href="Canopy%20%28grape%29%23Cordon">cordons</a> (arms) of the vines are <a href="Vine%20training">trained</a> horizontally on wires ("<a href="Vine%20training%23Components%20of%20a%20grapevine">bilateral-trained</a>") and are pruned to remove most of the previous year's growth ("<a href="Vine%20training%23Components%20of%20a%20grapevine">spur-pruned</a>") during the winter, it can produce up to per vine, or an average of . In 2002, cane-pruned vines of Thomcord were significantly more productive than <a href="Coronation%20%28grape%29">Sovereign Coronation</a> and were comparable to the Venus variety, averaging per vine. Unlike Thompson Seedless, which has its cluster size thinned as a normal production practice, Thomcord's is not thinned because of its smaller cluster size. The grape clusters range in weight between and average , have <a href="Grape%20cluster%20description">medium to slightly loose tightness</a> (or are "well-filled", meaning the individual <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">pedicel</a>s are not easily visible), and have a conical shape with a small wing.

Compared with Thompson Seedless, the berry weight and diameter of Thomcord are larger, but cluster tightness is similar. The berry length ranged between and the diameter ranged from in tests between 2001 and 2002. The berries weigh between , averaging in 2002, which is on par with Venus, but heavier than Sovereign Coronation, and even more so than Thompson Seedless. The fruit's size has not been shown to increase appreciably by <a href="girdling">girdling</a> the vines or by applying <a href="gibberellic%20acid">gibberellic acid</a> when the berries set.

The aborted seeds of Thomcord are small, but in some years they can become sclerified (a thickening and <a href="Lignin">lignification</a> of the walls of plant cells and the subsequent dying off of the <a href="protoplast">protoplast</a>s), making them more noticeable inside the medium-soft flesh. There are usually two aborted seeds per berry, which averaged between 14 and 22.3¬†mg in 2001 and 2002. This varied in comparison to Venus depending on the year and location, was comparable to the Sovereign Coronation, and was significantly smaller than the <a href="Sovereign%20Rose%20%28grape%29">Sovereign Rose</a> and <a href="Saturn%20%28grape%29">Saturn</a> varieties. However, as with the other <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s, it was consistently larger than Thompson Seedless, which had the smallest aborted seeds.

The mature leaves on the vine have three lobes with open upper lateral <a href="Sinus%20%28botany%29">sinuses</a> (spaces between the lobes) of medium depth. The main vein is slightly longer than the <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petiole</a> (stalk attaching the leaf blade to the stem), and the petiole sinus opens widely. Between the veins on the underside of both the mature and young leaf there are dense hairs that lie flat against the surface. The teeth on the edge of the leaf blade are convex on both sides, medium in size, and short relative to their width. Young leaf blades are dark copper red on the upper surface.

The <a href="shoot">shoot</a>s have at least three consecutive <a href="tendril">tendril</a>s. Young shoots are fully open and have very dense hairs of medium <a href="anthocyanin">anthocyanin</a> coloration that lie flat against the tip. The <a href="Plant%20stem">internode</a> of the young shoot is green with red stripes on the front (dorsal) side and solid green on the back (ventral) side.

In 1983, research horticulturist David W. Ramming and technician Ronald L. Tarailo‚ÄîCalifornian grape breeders working for the ARS, the chief scientific research agency of the USDA‚Äîcrossed Thompson Seedless and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior seedless grapes. The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (zygotic) instead of the maternal tissue (somatic). From 1231¬†<a href="emasculation">emasculation</a>s (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of Thompson Seedless, the researchers produced 130¬†<a href="ovule">ovule</a>s using <a href="embryo%20rescue%20procedure">embryo rescue procedure</a>s. From these, 40¬†<a href="embryo">embryo</a>s developed and three <a href="seedling">seedling</a>s were planted. The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Fresno">California State University, Fresno</a>. It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and Tarailo and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29-67, and was introduced as "Thomcord."

The new hybrid was tested and scrutinized for 17¬†years before it was declared ready for growers and gardeners and was released on . Around 2008, trials outside of California were just beginning. Thomcord quickly became a hit at <a href="farmers%27%20market">farmers' market</a>s while it was being tested, and it has appeared in the fresh-fruit section at supermarkets. This continued the long-standing success of the ARS' grape-breeding research in California, which has developed some of the most popular seedless grapes on the market as well as red, white, and black grapes varieties for hobbyists and professional growers since 1923.

Although it has been called a "sentimental favorite" at farmers' markets, it is not expected to become a major commercial variety because its flavor is not as neutral as more popular grapes, such as Thompson Seedless, <a href="Crimson%20Seedless">Crimson Seedless</a>, or <a href="Flame%20Seedless">Flame Seedless</a>. However, Ramming predicted that it would become a specialty item, much like the <a href="Muscat%20%28grape%20and%20wine%29">Muscat varieties</a>, due to its distinctive, Concord-like flavor. Because of its strong reception at farmers' markets, it could compete with Concord and Niabell varieties in eastern markets, according to Ramming.

The Foundation Plant Services (FPS) at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a> indexed Thomcord and found it to be free of known viruses. The FPS offers certified virus-free propagation material. The FPS also deposited genetic material in the <a href="National%20Plant%20Germplasm%20System">National Plant Germplasm System</a>, which offers material for research, including development and commercialization of new cultivars. The ARS does not offer Thomcord plants for distribution.

Thomcord is a public variety and is not <a href="Plant%20quarantine">restricted</a> in its propagation and distribution.

Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories

The Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories consisted of the <a href="military%20occupation">military occupation</a>, then <a href="annexation">annexation</a>, of the <a href="Ba%C4%8Dka">Baƒçka</a>, <a href="Baranja">Baranja</a>, <a href="Me%C4%91imurje">Meƒëimurje</a> and <a href="Prekmurje">Prekmurje</a> regions of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary%20%281920%E2%80%931946%29">Kingdom of Hungary</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. These territories had all been under <a href="Lands%20of%20the%20Crown%20of%20Saint%20Stephen">Hungarian rule</a> prior to 1920, and had been transferred to Yugoslavia as part of the post-<a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> <a href="Treaty%20of%20Trianon">Treaty of Trianon</a>. They now form part of several states: Yugoslav Baƒçka is now part of <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a>, an autonomous province of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, Yugoslav Baranja and Meƒëimurje are part of modern-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>. The occupation began on 11 April 1941 when 80,000 Hungarian troops crossed the Yugoslav border in support of the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>-led <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> that had commenced five days earlier. There was some resistance to the Hungarian forces from <a href="Serbs%20in%20Vojvodina">Serb</a> <a href="Chetnik">Chetnik</a> irregulars, but the defences of the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Army">Royal Yugoslav Army</a> had collapsed by this time. The Hungarian forces were indirectly aided by the local "<a href="Volksdeutsche">Volksdeutsche</a>", the <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">German minority</a>, which had formed a militia and disarmed around 90,000 Yugoslav troops. Despite only sporadic resistance, Hungarian troops killed many civilians during these initial operations, including some "Volksdeutsche". The government of the newly formed Axis <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a>, the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>, subsequently consented to the Hungarian annexation of the Meƒëimurje area, which dismayed the Croat population of the region.

The occupation authorities immediately classified the population of Baƒçka and Baranja into those that had lived in those regions when they had last been under Hungarian rule in 1920 and the mostly Serb settlers who had arrived since the areas had been part of Yugoslavia. They then began herding thousands of local Serbs into <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s and expelled them to the Independent State of Croatia, <a href="Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro">Italian-occupied Montenegro</a>, and the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a>. Ultimately, tens of thousands of Serbs were deported from the occupied territories. This was followed by the implementation of a policy of "<a href="magyarisation">magyarisation</a>" of the political, social and economic life of the occupied territories, which included the re-settlement of Hungarians and <a href="Sz%C3%A9kelys%20of%20Bukovina">Sz√©kelys</a> from other parts of Hungary. "Magyarisation" did not impact the "Volksdeutsche", who received special status under Hungarian rule, and in Prekmurje the Hungarian authorities were more permissive towards ethnic Slovenes.

Small-scale armed resistance to the Hungarian occupation commenced in the latter half of 1941 and was answered with harsh measures, including summary executions, expulsions and internment. The insurgency was mainly concentrated in the ethnic-Serb area of southern Baƒçka in the <a href="%C5%A0ajka%C5%A1ka">≈†ajka≈°ka</a> region, where Hungarian forces avenged their losses. In August 1941 a civilian administration took over the government of the "Recovered Southern Territories" (), and they were formally annexed to Hungary in December. In January 1942 the Hungarian military conducted raids during which they killed over 3,300 people, mostly Serbs and Jews.

In March 1944, when Hungary realised that it was on the losing side in the war and began to negotiate with the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a>, Germany took control of the country, including the annexed territories, during <a href="Operation%20Margarethe">Operation Margarethe I</a>. This was followed by the collection and transport of the remaining Jews in the occupied territories to <a href="extermination%20camp">extermination camp</a>s, resulting in the deaths of 85 per cent of the Jews in the occupied territories. Prior to their withdrawal from the Balkans in the face of the advance of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>, the Germans evacuated 60,000‚Äì70,000 "Volksdeutsche" from Baƒçka and Baranja to <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. Baƒçka and Baranja were restored to Yugoslav control when the Germans were pushed out of the region by the Red Army in late 1944. Meƒëimurje and Prekmurje remained occupied until the last weeks of the war.

At the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a> following the conclusion of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the <a href="Entente%20Powers">Entente Powers</a> signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Trianon">Treaty of Trianon</a> with Hungary after the breakup of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>. Among other things, the treaty defined the border between Hungary and the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (KSCS, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929). It divided the previously Hungarian-ruled regions of Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja between Hungary, the KSCS, and Romania, and transferred the Meƒëimurje region and about two thirds of the Prekmurje region from Hungary to the KSCS. Sizable numbers of Hungarians and "Volksdeutsche" remained in the areas incorporated into the KSCS. Between 1918 and 1924, 44,903 Hungarians (including 8,511 government employees) were deported to Hungary from the territories transferred to Yugoslavia, and approximately 10,000 Yugoslav military settlers (, lit. <a href="Salonika%20front">Salonika</a> volunteers), mainly <a href="Serbs">Serbs</a>, were settled in Baƒçka and Baranja by the Yugoslav government. During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a> Hungary agitated for a revision of the borders agreed in the Treaty of Trianon, and relations between the two countries were difficult. On 22 August 1938, <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a> and Yugoslavia agreed to a <a href="Bled%20agreement%20%281938%29">revision of Trianon</a> that allowed Hungary to re-arm itself.

Prior to the occupation, the most recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931. This census used language as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of <a href="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a> as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, <a href="Croat">Croat</a>, <a href="Bosniak">Bosnian Muslim</a>, <a href="Macedonians%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Macedonian</a> and <a href="Montenegrins">Montenegrin</a> nationalities. Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data has been used by scholars to determine approximate numbers of Serbs and Croats in the 1931 census, by counting those of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> denomination as Croats.

According to the 1931 census, the territories of Baƒçka and Baranja had a combined population of 837,742. This included between 275,014 and 283,114 Hungarians, and between 185,458 and 194,908 "Volksdeutsche". Hungarians therefore made up around one-third of the population of these territories, with the "Volksdeutsche" comprising slightly less than one-quarter. According to the historian Dr. <a href="Kriszti%C3%A1n%20Ungv%C3%A1ry">Kriszti√°n Ungv√°ry</a>, the 1931 census showed that the population of Baƒçka and Baranja included 150,301 Serbs and 3,099 Croats. This corresponds to a Serb population of about 18 per cent. These figures vary considerably from the combined Serb and Croat population of 305,917 provided by Professor <a href="Jozo%20Tomasevich">Jozo Tomasevich</a>, corresponding to 36.5 per cent of the population. The 1931 census figures for Meƒëimurje and Prekmurje show a total population of 193,640, of which 101,467 (52.2 per cent) were Croats, 75,064 (38.7 per cent) were <a href="Slovenes">Slovenes</a>, and 15,308 (8 per cent) were Hungarians.
Between 1938 and 1940, following <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a>‚Äì<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> mediation in the <a href="First%20Vienna%20Award">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Vienna%20Award">Second Vienna Award</a>s, and the Hungarian invasion of <a href="Carpatho-Ukraine">Carpatho-Ukraine</a>, Hungary enlarged its territory. It absorbed parts of southern Czechoslovakia, <a href="Carpathian%20Ruthenia">Carpathian Ruthenia</a> and the <a href="Northern%20Transylvania">northern part of Transylvania</a>, which the Kingdom of Romania ceded. One of the ethno-cultural areas that changed hands between Romania and Hungary at this time was the <a href="Sz%C3%A9kely%20Land">Sz√©kely Land</a>. The support that Hungary received from Germany for these border revisions meant that the relationship between the two countries became even closer. On 20 November 1940, Hungary formally joined the Axis <a href="Tripartite%20Pact">Tripartite Pact</a>. On 12 December 1940, at the initiative of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Hungary">Prime Minister</a>, Count <a href="P%C3%A1l%20Teleki">P√°l Teleki</a>, Hungary concluded a friendship and non-aggression treaty with Yugoslavia. Although the concept had received support from both Germany and Italy, the actual signing of the treaty did not, as Germany's planned invasion of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Greece">Greece</a> would be simplified if Yugoslavia could be neutralised. After the <a href="Yugoslav%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">Yugoslav military coup of 27 March 1941</a>, when the Germans asked the <a href="Regent%20of%20Hungary">Hungarian Regent</a>, <a href="Mikl%C3%B3s%20Horthy">Mikl√≥s Horthy</a>, for clearance to launch one of their armoured thrusts using Hungarian territory, Teleki was unable to dissuade the Regent. Concluding that Hungary had disgraced itself irrevocably by siding with the Germans against the Yugoslavs, Teleki shot himself. Horthy informed Hitler that evening that Hungary would abide by the friendship treaty with Yugoslavia, though it would likely cease to apply should Croatia secede and Yugoslavia cease to exist.

On 10 April 1941, the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (, NDH) was established in Zagreb by the <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Usta≈°e</a>. That day Horthy and the new Prime Minister of Hungary <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20B%C3%A1rdossy">L√°szl√≥ B√°rdossy</a> issued a joint declaration that Yugoslavia had ceased to exist, releasing Hungary from its obligations under the non-aggression pact and the Treaty of Trianon. According to the declaration Hungarian troops would act to "protect the Hungarians who live in the south parts from the anarchy" of the <a href="April%20War">April War</a> which had begun there several days earlier when Italian and German troops invaded. The following day the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28Hungary%29">Hungarian 3rd Army</a> began occupying those regions of Yugoslavia using the Mobile, IV and V Corps, with I and VII Corps in reserve. That day (11 April), the headquarters of the 3rd Army informed that of the <a href="2nd%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 2nd Army</a> that Hungarian forces had crossed the frontier north of <a href="Osijek">Osijek</a> and near <a href="Subotica">Subotica</a>.

The German army's rapid manoeuvres during the invasion had forced the tactical withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing <a href="Royal%20Hungarian%20Army">Hungarian army</a> units and there was no significant fighting between the two armies. The Hungarian forces advanced south to the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> between <a href="Vukovar">Vukovar</a> and the confluence with the <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a> without any real military resistance. <a href="Serbs%20in%20Vojvodina">Serb</a> <a href="Chetnik">Chetnik</a> irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition.

On 12 April, the Hungarian 1st Parachute Battalion captured canal bridges at <a href="Vrbas%20%28town%29">Vrbas</a> and <a href="Srbobran">Srbobran</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="Sombor">Sombor</a> was captured against determined Chetnik resistance, and Subotica was also captured. This, the first airborne operation in Hungarian history, was not without incident. The battalion's aircraft consisted of five Italian-made <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.75">Savoia-Marchetti SM.75</a> transport aircraft formerly with the civilian airline <a href="MALERT">MALERT</a>, but pressed into service with the <a href="Royal%20Hungarian%20Air%20Force">Royal Hungarian Air Force</a> (, MKHL) at the start of the European war. Shortly after takeoff from the airport at <a href="Veszpr%C3%A9m">Veszpr√©m-Jutas</a> on the afternoon of 12 April, the command plane, code E-101, crashed with the loss of 20 or 23 lives, including 19 paratroopers. This was the heaviest single loss suffered by the Hungarians during the Yugoslav campaign.

On 13 April, the 1st and 2nd Motorized Brigades occupied <a href="Novi%20Sad">Novi Sad</a>, then pushed south across the Danube into the northern part of Croatian <a href="Syrmia">Syrmia</a> capturing <a href="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a> and Vukovar on 18 April. These brigades then drove southeast to capture the western Serbian town of <a href="Valjevo">Valjevo</a> a day later. Other Hungarian forces occupied the Yugoslavian regions of <a href="Prekmurje">Prekmurje</a> and <a href="Me%C4%91imurje%20County">Meƒëimurje</a>. A later American assessment concluded that German forces had to take the brunt of the fighting, observing that Hungarian forces had "displayed great reluctance to attack until the enemy had been soundly beaten and thoroughly disorganized by the Germans." When a Yugoslav delegation signed an armistice with German and Italian representatives at <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> on 17 April, the Hungarians were represented by a liaison officer, but he did not sign the document because Hungary was "not at war with Yugoslavia." The armistice came into effect at noon the next day. News of the success of the Hungarian armed forces in Yugoslavia was welcomed in the Hungarian Parliament. German forces occupied a narrow slice of northeastern Prekmurje along the German‚ÄìYugoslav border, which included four "Volksdeutsche" villages. In mid-June 1941, this area was absorbed into "<a href="Reichsgau%20Steiermark">Reichsgau Steiermark</a>".

Hungarian troops suffered 126 dead and 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some "Volksdeutsche". Many civilians were arrested and tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, probably as a warning to others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy insisted that he had not wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Baƒçka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.

The Hungarian-occupied territory of Baƒçka consisted of that part of the <a href="Danube%20Banovina">Danube Banovina</a> bounded by the former Hungarian‚ÄìYugoslav border to the north, the Danube to the south and west, and the Tisza to the east. The occupied territory of Baranja had also been part of the Danube Banovina, but was that area bounded by the former Hungarian-Yugoslav border to the north and west, the <a href="Drava">Drava</a> to the west and south, and the Danube to the east. The territory of Meƒëimurje was part of the <a href="Banovina%20of%20Croatia">Banovina of Croatia</a> prior to the invasion, and was bounded by the <a href="Mur%20%28river%29">Mura</a> river to the north and the Drava river to the south. Prekmurje consisted of that part of the pre-war <a href="Drava%20Banovina">Drava Banovina</a> that lay north of the Mura. Most of the Hungarian-occupied territories consisted of flat, largely agricultural land of the <a href="Pannonian%20Plain">Pannonian Plain</a>, except for some hilly country in the northwest of the Meƒëimurje region and in the north of the Prekmurje region. The total area of the Yugoslav territories occupied by Hungary was , consisting of in Baƒçka, in Baranja, and in the Meƒëimurje and Prekmurje regions.

At first, the occupied territories were placed under military administration. The international legal scholar, Professor <a href="Raphael%20Lemkin">Raphael Lemkin</a>, who coined the word "<a href="genocide">genocide</a>" as meaning the "destruction of a nation or of an ethnic group", described the policies implemented by the Hungarian authorities in the occupied territories as "genocidal". Lemkin asserted that "genocidal" policies were those that were aimed at destroying the political, social, cultural, religious, and economic existence and language of those living in occupied territories. In the first two weeks of Hungarian rule, 10,000 Serbs were expelled to the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a>, the NDH, or <a href="Italian%20governorate%20of%20Montenegro">Italian-ruled Montenegro</a>. On 1 May 1941, the Germans estimated that the population of the territories occupied by Hungary was 1,145,000. On 9 July 1941, the military governor of the town of <a href="%C4%8Cakovec">ƒåakovec</a> in Meƒëimurje, Colonel Zsigmond Tim√°r, issued a declaration that the following day Meƒëimurje was to be placed permanently under military administration and Hungarian rule. According to Professor <a href="Sabrina%20Ramet">Sabrina Ramet</a>, the government of the NDH consented to Hungarian annexation of the Meƒëimurje area on 10 July, but according to Davor Kovaƒçiƒá and Marica Karaka≈° Obradov of the Croatian Institute of History, the Hungarian declaration was made without consulting with the NDH government, and was never recognised by it. The Croat population of the region were unhappy with the decision, and military rule remained in place until 16 August 1941, after which civil administration was introduced. On 12 July, the <a href="Yugoslav%20dinar">Yugoslav dinar</a> ceased to be <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> in the occupied territories, and was replaced by the <a href="Hungarian%20peng%C5%91">Hungarian peng≈ë</a>. A census of the occupied Yugoslav territories was conducted by the Hungarian authorities in 1941, which counted a total population of 1,030,027. In this census, the ethnic proportions in these territories combined were 37 per cent Hungarian, 19 per cent "Volksdeutsche", 18 per cent Croats and 16 per cent Serbs, and the population of Prekmurje was 102,867.

On 14 December, these regions, referred to by Hungary as the "Recovered Southern Territories" (), were formally incorporated into Hungary and were given full representation in the Hungarian Parliament, although representatives were to be nominated by the Parliament rather than elected. Although plans to deport 150,000 Serbs (including colonists from the interwar period, but also native inhabitants) to the German-occupied territory of Serbia were opposed by the German command in Belgrade, the Hungarian occupational regime managed to expel between 25,000 and 60,000 of them, mostly to Serbia. During the war, the Hungarian government resettled some of its pre-war population in Baƒçka and Baranja, primarily <a href="Sz%C3%A9kelys%20of%20Bukovina">Sz√©kelys</a> from areas of Transylvania ceded to Hungary by Romania in 1940. Between 15,000 and 18,000 were reportedly resettled in Baƒçka and Baranja.

The Hungarian authorities established <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s for Serbs from which they were eventually expelled to the German-occupied territory of Serbia. As part of the "systematic <a href="magyarisation">magyarisation</a>" of these territories, Hungarian political parties and patriotic organisations were encouraged to be active in Baƒçka and Baranja, which resulted in discrimination against "less-desirable elements" of the population such as Serbs, Croats and Jews. Discrimination extended to education and communication, where Hungarian and German were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools, and books, newspapers and periodicals in the Serbo-Croat language were virtually banned. Well-educated Serbs and Croats were precluded from undertaking work commensurate with their education. Despite this, Serbs and Croats that had lived in the territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians, and some lower-level non-Hungarian public employees were retained in their jobs. One former Serb senator and one former Croat parliamentary deputy sat in the Hungarian Parliament. In Prekmurje, the Hungarian authorities were more permissive, making no attempt to deport Slovenes in large numbers, and allowing the Slovene language to be used in public. Likewise, the Hungarians curried favour with the <a href="Bunjevci">Bunjevci</a> minority in order to persuade them that they were neither Serbs nor Croats, nor even Slavs at all: they were "Hungarians of Bunyevac mother-tongue".

The "Volksdeutsche" of the occupied territories were an important part of the economies of the occupied territories, and by 1941, they were entirely in the thrall of the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a>. Relations between the occupation authorities and the "Volksdeutsche" were strained by the killing of ethnic Germans during the invasion, to the extent that <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> became aware of the issue. The "Volksdeutsche" were not active in the Hungarian military or civil administration, but were represented in the Hungarian Parliament, and from 1942 were permitted to conscript their members into the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>. The official organisation of the "Volksdeutsche" in Hungary, the "Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn" (National League of Germans in Hungary), was essentially autonomous during the war, including within the occupied territories.

Baƒçka and Baranja had both been part of the Danube Banovina of Yugoslavia before the war. Meƒëimurje had been part of the Banovina of Croatia, and Prekmurje had been part of the Drava Banovina. The Hungarian authorities referred to the occupied territories by the following names: B√°cska for Baƒçka, Baranya for Baranja, Murak√∂z for Meƒëimurje, and Muravid√©k for Prekmurje. Following the occupation, the Hungarian authorities divided the occupied territories between the counties that corresponded with the administrative divisions that had existed when the area had formed part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> prior to 1920. These were the <a href="B%C3%A1cs-Bodrog%20County">B√°cs-Bodrog</a>, <a href="Baranya%20County%20%28former%29">Baranya</a>, <a href="Vas%20County%20%28former%29">Vas</a> and <a href="Zala%20County%20%28former%29">Zala Counties</a>. The officials in these territories were appointed rather than elected. The counties were further divided into districts, and the authorities reverted many districts, cities and towns to the names used prior to 1920, and in some cases to names which had no historical precedent. Some examples of the name changes in each county are shown below:

B√°cs-Bodrog County:

Baranya County:

Vas County:

Zala County:

In April 1941, about 23 per cent of Yugoslav Jews (about 16,680 people) lived in the territories occupied by Hungary. These included around 15,405 in Baƒçka and Baranja, about 425 in Meƒëimurje, and approximately 850 in Prekmurje.

The Hungarian government had passed <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> laws in 1939, and these were applied to the occupied and annexed territories. Initially the laws were applied selectively due to the transfer of the territories from military to civilian administration. Some Jews that had settled in the occupied territories were sent to the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were placed in the <a href="Banjica%20concentration%20camp">Banjica concentration camp</a> in Belgrade and subsequently killed. Others were expelled to the NDH where they met the same fate, but it is unknown how many deported Jews died in this way. After the violence of the initial occupation, no further massacres of Jews occurred during the remainder of 1941.

The Jews of the occupied territories were subjected to forced labour by the Hungarian authorities, with about 4,000 Baƒçka and Baranja Jews being sent to hard labour camps within Hungary, 1,500 Baƒçka Jews being among the 10,000 Hungarian Jews sent to perform labour tasks for the Hungarian Army on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> in September 1942, and about 600 Baƒçka Jews sent to work in the <a href="Bor%2C%20Serbia">Bor</a> copper mine in the German-occupied territory of Serbia in July 1943. Only 2 per cent of those sent to the Eastern Front survived the war.

In Baƒçka and Baranja, the "Volksdeutsche" and Hungarian authorities killed significant numbers of Serbs. After small-scale armed resistance broke out in Hungarian-occupied Baƒçka and Baranja in the second half of 1941, the Hungarian military reacted with heavy repressive measures. In September 1941 alone the Hungarian occupation forces summarily executed 313 people. Measures included the establishment of temporary concentration camps at <a href="Ada%2C%20Serbia">Ada</a>, <a href="Ba%C4%8Dka%20Topola">Baƒçka Topola</a>, <a href="Bege%C4%8D">Begeƒç</a>, <a href="Od%C5%BEaci">Od≈æaci</a>, <a href="Be%C4%8Dej">Beƒçej</a> and Subotica, as well as at Novi Sad, <a href="P%C3%A9cs">Pechuj</a> and <a href="Baja%2C%20Hungary">Baja</a>. According to Professor Paul Mojzes, some 2,000 Jews and a large number of Serbs were detained in these camps for periods from two weeks to two months, with Jews that had not been interned being employed as forced labourers. Several thousand people remained in camps until the end of the war. Some of the Jews that had migrated to Baƒçka and Baranja during the inter-war period were expelled to the NDH or the German-occupied territory of Serbia where they were killed. The <a href="League%20of%20Communists%20of%20Yugoslavia">communist</a>-led <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisan</a> resistance movement of <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> was never strong in Baƒçka and Baranja because the flat terrain of the region did not lend itself to <a href="guerilla%20warfare">guerilla warfare</a>, and because <a href="South%20Slavs">South Slavs</a>, from which the Partisans drew their recruits, only made up one-third of the regional population. Some Partisan units raised in the occupied territories were sent to the NDH to reinforce Partisan formations operating there. Despite their initial resistance, the Chetnik movement was largely inactive during the occupation, maintaining some covert activity only. The Partisans and their regional committee had largely been destroyed by the end of 1941.

In January 1942, the Hungarian army and gendarmerie undertook <a href="Novi%20Sad%20raid">a major raid in southern Baƒçka</a>, during which they massacred 2,550 Serbs, 743 Jews and 47 other people in places such as Beƒçej, Srbobran and Novi Sad, under the pretext that they were searching for Partisans. Other sources place the number of Serbs and Jews massacred in Novi Sad as being much lower, at around 879. Raids were carried out in <a href="%C5%A0ajka%C5%A1">≈†ajka≈°</a> (Sajk√°svid√©k) over 4‚Äì19 January; in Novi Sad (√öjvid√©k) over 21‚Äì23 January; and in Beƒçej (√ìbecse) over 25‚Äì29 January. Over the period 4‚Äì24 January, massacres were carried out by the Hungarian <a href="15th%20Light%20Division%20%28Hungary%29">15th Light Division</a> commanded by <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="J%C3%B3zsef%20Grassy">J√≥zsef Grassy</a> and units of the Royal Gendarmerie. The operations were ordered by Grassy, <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Ferenc%20Feketehalmy-Czeydner">Ferenc Feketehalmy-Czeydner</a>, <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20De%C3%A1k">L√°szl√≥ De√°k</a>, and Royal Gendarmerie <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">Captain</a> Dr. <a href="M%C3%A1rton%20Z%C3%B6ldi">M√°rton Z√∂ldi</a>. In addition to Serbs and Jews, members of other ethnicities were also victims: <a href="Romani%20people">Roma</a> people, a small number of <a href="White%20%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">Russian refugees</a> who had fled <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">Russia</a> after the <a href="October%20Revolution">Bolshevik Revolution</a>, and some local Hungarians. In mid-1942, the <a href="Yugoslav%20government-in-exile">Yugoslav government-in-exile</a> reported that churches had been looted and destroyed, and that <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian Orthodox</a> holy days had been prohibited by the Hungarian administration. These reports stated that the a camp in Novi Sad held 13,000 Serb and Jewish men, women and children.

Under pressure from the Hungarian <a href="Opposition%20%28politics%29">political opposition</a>, the Hungarian government charged 14 Hungarian officers with <a href="high%20treason">high treason</a> in relation to the massacres, including Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, De√°k and Z√∂ldi. A military trial was held in <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> between 23 December 1943 and January 1944, and those that were convicted were sentenced to between 10 and 15 years imprisonment for their part in the massacres. Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, De√°k and Z√∂ldi were not sentenced as they could not be located, and had fled to Germany. It is apparent from the trial proceedings that Z√∂ldi was present during some of the trial. Professor Lajƒço Klajn has stated that those most responsible for the massacre were not tried before this military court, and that they included Prime Minister B√°rdossy and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Interior%20%28Hungary%29">Minister for Interior Affairs</a> Dr. <a href="Ferenc%20Keresztes-Fischer">Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer</a>, both of whom appeared only as witnesses. Klajn also states that the Chief of the General Staff, <a href="Ferenc%20Szombathelyi">Ferenc Szombathelyi</a> and the Minister of Defence should also have been examined by the court, that the "genocide had been planned by the highest military and political circles in Hungary for a long time in advance", and had been intended to convince the <a href="Minister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Germany%29">German Foreign Minister</a> <a href="Joachim%20von%20Ribbentrop">Joachim von Ribbentrop</a> that Hungarian troops were needed on its territory instead of the Eastern Front. In mid-1944, Partisan activity increased in Baƒçka to such an extent that special regulations similar to the "Special Administrative Regulations" that applied to the operational zones of the Hungarian Army were extended to Baƒçka: curfews were imposed and political activities were forbidden. A self-defence organization, the Pandurs, was created.

The occupation of Baƒçka and Baranja lasted until 1944. Fearing that Hungary might conclude a separate peace with the Allies, Hitler launched <a href="Operation%20Margarethe">Operation Margarethe I</a> on 15 March 1944, and ordered German troops to occupy Hungary. In the meantime, some of those that had escaped prosecution for the 1942 massacres had joined various German military and police organisations. Feketehalmy-Czeydner had become the highest-ranking foreign officer in the "<a href="Allgemeine%20SS">Allgemeine SS</a>", being promoted to SS-"<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">Obergruppenf√ºhrer</a>" (lieutenant general). Grassy became a SS-"<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">Gruppenf√ºhrer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS</a>" (major general) and was appointed to command the <a href="25th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Hunyadi%20%281st%20Hungarian%29">25th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Hunyadi (1st Hungarian)</a>, and Z√∂ldi joined the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>. The case against them was re-opened after the German occupation, and in this second trial they were all found not guilty.

After Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal policies of the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and <a href="Death%20marches%20%28Holocaust%29">death marches</a>, and those that had remained in the occupied territories were transported to <a href="extermination%20camp">extermination camp</a>s. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Baƒçka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Baƒçka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and <a href="B%C3%A1csalm%C3%A1s">B√°csalm√°s</a> then transported to <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a> where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to extermination camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.

Such was the extent of the Holocaust in the occupied territories that by the end of the war, nearly 85 per cent of the Jews that had been living in the Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav territories in April 1941 had been killed. This figure comprised about 13,500 Jews from Baƒçka and Baranja, and about 1,300 from Meƒëimurje and Prekmurje.

In September 1944, the Hungarian authorities began evacuating the Sz√©kelys settled in the occupied territories since 1941 to <a href="Transdanubia">Transdanubia</a>. Several days after the Soviet <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> entered the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%931944%29">Banat</a> on 1 October 1944, the Germans began the <a href="Flight%20and%20evacuation%20of%20German%20civilians%20during%20the%20end%20of%20World%20War%20II">evacuation of Baƒçka</a>, including the local "Volksdeutsche". With the advance of the Partisans and the Red Army, some of the "Volksdeutsche" left the region while some others stayed, despite the situation.

In October 1944, the Banat and Baƒçka were captured by Soviet troops. Subotica was captured on the 12 October. After a few weeks, they withdrew and ceded full control of the region to the Partisans, who established a military administration in the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja on 17 October 1944. In the first few weeks after Baƒçka returned to Yugoslav control, about 16,800 Hungarians were killed by Serbs in revenge for killings during the Hungarian occupation. In November 1944, Tito declared that the "Volksdeutsche" of Yugoslavia were hostile to the nation, and ordered the internment of those living in areas under Partisan control. About 60,000‚Äì70,000 "Volksdeutsche" had been evacuated from Baƒçka; while an additional 30,000‚Äì60,000 from Baƒçka were serving in the Wehrmacht at the time.

On 15 February 1945, the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja were transferred from military to civilian administration with a <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Committee%20%28Yugoslavia%29">people's liberation committee</a> (, NOO) taking control. Until early 1945, the Yugoslav communist administration was characterized by persecution of some elements of the local population, with mass executions, internments and abuses. Approximately 110,000 "Volksdeutsche" were interned, with around 46,000 dying in captivity due to poor conditions in the camps and the hard labour they were subjected to. Victims of the communist regime were of various ethnic backgrounds and included some members of the <a href="Hungarians%20in%20Vojvodina">Hungarian</a> and "Volksdeutsche" population, as well as Serbs. The Hungarian writer <a href="Tibor%20Cseres">Tibor Cseres</a> has described in detail the crimes he claims the Yugoslav communists committed against Hungarians. An estimated 5,000 Hungarians were killed following the return of the occupied territories to Yugoslav control. About 40,000 Hungarians left the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja after the war. In late 1946, there were 84,800 refugees from Yugoslavia living in Hungary.

After these territories returned to Yugoslav control, the military and national courts in Baƒçka prosecuted collaborators who had killed about 10,000‚Äì20,000 civilians. The Security Service of Vojvodina captured the majority of these people. Meanwhile, some of those who were responsible for the 1942 massacres in southern Baƒçka were captured in, and extradited from, the newly formed <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Hungary">People's Republic of Hungary</a>. In his book "Maƒëari u Vojvodini: 1941‚Äì1946" ("Hungarians in Vojvodina: 1941‚Äì1946"; Novi Sad, 1996), Professor <a href="S%C3%A1ndor%20Kasz%C3%A1s">S√°ndor Kasz√°s</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Novi%20Sad">University of Novi Sad</a> listed a total of 1,686 executed war criminals by name, of whom around 1,000 were Hungarian.

In a third trial in early 1946, the National Court of Hungary in Budapest found Szombathelyi, Feketehalmy-Czeydner, Grassy, De√°k, and Z√∂ldi guilty of involvement in the massacres in the occupied territories, and in carrying out the deportation of Jews to extermination camps. In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.

Of the approximately 500,000 "Volksdeutsche" living in Yugoslavia before the war, about half were evacuated, 50,000 died in Yugoslav concentration camps, 15,000 were killed by the Partisans and about 150,000 were deported to the Soviet Union as forced labourers. They were also stripped of their property. By 1948, only 55,337 "Volksdeutsche" remained in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav Baƒçka is now part of <a href="Vojvodina">Vojvodina</a>, an autonomous province of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, Yugoslav Baranja and Meƒëimurje are part of modern-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, and Yugoslav Prekmurje is part of modern-day <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>.

In 2013, the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Serbia%29">National Assembly</a> of Serbia adopted a declaration condemning the atrocities which were committed against Hungarian civilians between 1944 and 1945. On 26 June 2013, Hungarian <a href="President%20of%20Hungary">President</a> <a href="J%C3%A1nos%20%C3%81der">J√°nos √Åder</a> visited Serbia and formally apologised for war crimes committed against Serbian civilians by Hungarian forces during World War II.

Petter's big-footed mouse

Petter's big-footed mouse ("Macrotarsomys petteri"), is a <a href="Madagascar">Madagascan</a> <a href="rodent">rodent</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Macrotarsomys">Macrotarsomys</a>". With a head and body length of 150¬†mm (5.9¬†in) and body mass of 105¬†g (3.7¬†oz), It is the largest <a href="species">species</a> of its genus. The upperparts are brown, darkest in the middle of the back, and the underparts are white to yellowish. The animal has long <a href="whiskers">whiskers</a>, short forelimbs, and long hindfeet. The tail ends in a prominent tuft of long, light hairs. The skull is robust and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are low-crowned and <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cuspidate</a>.

Petter's big-footed mouse is now <a href="endemism">found only</a> in the <a href="Mikea%20Forest">Mikea Forest</a> of southwestern Madagascar, but <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> records indicate that it used to be more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> may have led to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, is <a href="habitat%20destruction">threatened</a> by human development.

During a 2003 biological inventory of the <a href="Mikea%20Forest">Mikea Forest</a>, a forest region of southwestern Madagascar, a single specimen of the rodent genus "<a href="Macrotarsomys">Macrotarsomys</a>" was collected. This animal turned out to be distinct from both previously known species of the genus‚Äî"<a href="bastard%20big-footed%20mouse">bastard big-footed mouse</a>", which is widespread in western Madagascar, and the larger "<a href="greater%20big-footed%20mouse">greater big-footed mouse</a>", known only from the <a href="Ankarafantsika%20National%20Park">Ankarafantsika National Park</a>. Accordingly, <a href="Steven%20Goodman">Steven Goodman</a> and Voahangy Soarimalala named it in 2005 as a new species, "Macrotarsomys petteri". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "petteri", honors French zoologist <a href="Francis%20Petter">Francis Petter</a> for his contributions to the study of Malagasy rodents. Petter's big-footed mouse, the largest species in the genus, is most similar to greater big-footed mouse, which may be its closest relative.

Petter's big-footed mouse is a <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> rodent with short forelimbs and long hindfeet. With a head and body length of 150¬†mm (5.9¬†in) and body mass of 105¬†g (3.7¬†oz) in the only known complete specimen, it is much larger than "M.¬†bastardi", and its measurements fall at or above the upper end of the known range of variation in "M.¬†ingens". The upperparts are covered with soft and short, brown fur. Most cover hairs (the main part of the fur) are dark brown for the two-thirds closest to the base, then light brown, with a short dark brown tip. The middle of the back appears darker, because the cover hairs there are entirely dark brown. The hairs are 6 to 8¬†mm (0.2 to 0.3¬†in) long on the shoulders and 7 to 9¬†mm (0.3 to 0.4¬†in) on the back. The <a href="guard%20hair">guard hair</a>s are gray. Because the flanks lack entirely dark cover hairs, they are slightly lighter than the rest of the upperparts. They are sharply separated in color from the underparts, which are entirely white to buffish. The <a href="mystacial%20vibrissae">mystacial vibrissae</a> (whiskers above the mouth) are long, up to 60¬†mm (2.4¬†in), and white or black in color. The <a href="pinna%20%28anatomy%29">pinnae</a> (external ears) are dark brown and covered with fine gray hairs, and ear length is 32¬†mm (1.3¬†in).

Hindfoot length is 37¬†mm (1.5¬†in). The upper sides of the feet are covered with grayish white fur, which extends around the claws to form <a href="ungual%20tufts">ungual tufts</a>. On the hindfeet, the fifth digit is relatively short at 6¬†mm (0.2¬†in); the hallux (first digit) is 8¬†mm (0.3¬†in) long, and the other digits 11 to 12¬†mm (0.4 to 0.5¬†in). The tail is 238¬†mm (9.4¬†in) long and naked in part. At the base, it is dark brown both above and below, but slightly lighter below. The upper side remains dark brown for much of its length, though the color does become lighter towards the tip. The lower side becomes mottled at about 55¬†mm (2.2¬†in) from the tip and then whitish at about 65¬†mm (2.6¬†in). It has a well-developed tuft at its tail tip, consisting of whitish and occasional light brown hairs. This tuft commences at about 130¬†mm (5.1¬†in) from the base with fairly short hairs and becomes more pronounced at 180¬†mm (7.1¬†in). In contrast, the greater big-footed mouse has a weaker, dark brown tuft.

Petter's big-footed mouse has a large and robust skull with well-developed <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones). The <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> of the skull (between the eyes) is smooth, as in greater big-footed mouse, and lacks the shelves characteristic of the bastard big-footed mouse. The <a href="palate">palate</a> is broad and the <a href="incisive%20foramina">incisive foramina</a> (openings in the front portion of the palate) are long and broad. In the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw), the root of the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a> is housed in a distinct <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>, a protuberance at the back of the jawbone. The lower <a href="masseteric%20ridge">masseteric ridge</a> (a crest on the outer side of the mandible) is prominent. As is typical of "Macrotarsomys", the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a> are <a href="cusp%20%28anatomy%29">cuspidate</a> and low-crowned.

The single known living specimen, a young adult male, was collected at 80¬†m (260¬†ft) altitude in the Andaladomo forest (part of the Mikea Forest) in 2003. The Andaladomo forest is different in vegetation from the rest of the Mikea Forest, and is similar to forests further to the north on Madagascar. The animal was found in an isolated fragment of dry deciduous forest amid land cleared for <a href="maize">maize</a> cultivation. The trap was set at the foot of a tree surrounded by bushes and succulent plants. Other small mammals known from the Mikea Forest include the bastard big-footed mouse, the introduced <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"), several species of <a href="tenrec">tenrec</a>s, and the shrew "<a href="Suncus%20madagascariensis">Suncus madagascariensis</a>". Although only a single individual of Petter's big-footed mouse was caught during Goodman and Soarimalala's survey, which accrued 3100¬†trap-nights, they argue that this does not necessarily mean the species is rare, since trapping rates for rodents in the dry forests of Madagascar are often variable depending on year and season. Nothing is known of its behavior, but the animal's morphology suggests it lives on the ground.

Subsequent to its discovery at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse was also found as a <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> in cave deposits at <a href="Andrahomana">Andrahomana</a> in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus"), as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were <a href="radiocarbon%20dated">radiocarbon dated</a> to 790‚Äì410¬†BCE and 150‚Äì390¬†CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. "Macrotarsomys" species are thought to burrow in sandy ground and would not be expected to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.

In 2009, it was also recorded from the cave of <a href="Ankilitelo">Ankilitelo</a> in southwestern Madagascar. Remains of a large "Macrotarsomys" had previously been reported from other southern Madagascar sites, and at least some of these may be "M.¬†petteri". A <a href="karst">karst</a>ic deposit near <a href="Lake%20Tsimanampetsotsa">Lake Tsimanampetsotsa</a> (dated to the Late <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> or Early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> on unclear grounds) contained three species of "Macrotarsomys", including a very large one that may well be "M.¬†petteri". Remains identified as greater big-footed mouse have been reported from a cave at <a href="Ankazoabo">Ankazoabo</a> in southern Madagascar; these may also be Petter's big-footed mouse.

The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> assesses Petter's big-footed mouse as "<a href="Data%20Deficient">Data Deficient</a>", but notes that the species will very probably qualify as <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> if its current distribution turns out to be restricted to primary forest in the Mikea Forest. The Mikea Forest is one of the largest remaining forests of southwestern Madagascar, but it is not protected and is threatened by logging, pasture, and conversion to agricultural land.

Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II

During the last weeks of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, warships of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a> bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these <a href="bombardments">bombardments</a> were conducted by <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, and caused heavy damage to several of the targeted factories, as well as nearby <a href="civilian">civilian</a> areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese did not attempt to attack the Allied bombardment forces, and none of the involved warships suffered any damage.

The major bombardments began on 14 and 15 July 1945, when US Navy warships attacked the cities of <a href="Kamaishi%2C%20Iwate">Kamaishi</a> and <a href="Muroran%2C%20Hokkaido">Muroran</a>. The next attack was made by a joint American and British force against the city of <a href="Hitachi%2C%20Ibaraki">Hitachi</a> during the night of 17/18 July. Groups of cruisers and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s subsequently shelled the Nojima Saki area on 18 July, and Shionomisaki on the night of 24/25 July. On 29 July, American and British warships attacked <a href="Hamamatsu">Hamamatsu</a>, and on the night of 30/31 several American destroyers shelled <a href="Shimizu-ku%2C%20Shizuoka">Shimizu</a>. The final bombardment took place on 9 August, when Kamaishi was attacked again by American, British and New Zealand warships. Two US Navy submarines conducted small-scale attacks during June and July 1945; one of the submarines also landed a small raiding party.

The Allied naval bombardments disrupted industrial production in the cities targeted, and convinced many Japanese civilians that the war was lost. Up to 1,739 Japanese were killed in the attacks, and about 1,497 were wounded. The only Allied casualties were 32 Allied <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> killed in the bombardments of Kamaishi.

By mid-1945, during the last weeks of World War II, cities and industrial facilities in the Japanese <a href="Japanese%20archipelago">home islands</a> were <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Japan">under sustained attack</a> from <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">B-29 Superfortress</a> heavy bombers based in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>. Attacks by <a href="Allied%20submarines%20in%20the%20Pacific%20War">Allied submarines</a> and surface ships had also cut most of the country's trade routes, and US Navy aircraft carrier task groups had raided locations in the home islands on several occasions. Shortages of fuel had confined most of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>'s surviving ships to port and forced them and the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Air%20Service">Imperial Japanese Army Air Service</a> to hold its air units in reserve against the <a href="Operation%20Downfall">Allied invasion</a> that was expected late in the year. Prior to the war, the Japanese military had assessed that <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a> was no longer suited to the country's circumstances. As a result, only a few strategic ports were protected by artillery capable of engaging enemy warships, and most of these guns were of relatively small <a href="Caliber%20%28artillery%29">caliber</a>.

During the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, the US Navy's <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>s had mainly been used to escort the groups of <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s that formed the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>'s main striking force. They had also occasionally bombarded Japanese positions near the shore and had fought some actions with Japanese warships.

Allied naval commanders decided to use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945. It was hoped that the Japanese military would respond to these bombardments by attacking the Allied forces with the aircraft that were being held in reserve to respond to the planned invasion of Japan, thereby exposing these aircraft to destruction by Allied fighter aircraft. However, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.

On 1 July 1945, the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">United States Third Fleet</a> sortied from <a href="Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> in the Philippines under the command of Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William Halsey</a> to attack the Japanese home islands. Halsey's plans included the use of battleships and <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s to bombard military facilities and factories. To prepare for these attacks, US Navy <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s sailed into Japan's inshore waters to search for <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s. USAAF B-29 Superfortress and <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> aircraft also conducted photo reconnaissance flights over much of Japan in search of airfields and facilities which could be attacked by the Third Fleet.

The Third Fleet's main component, <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">Task Force 38</a> (TF¬†38), began striking targets in Japan on 10 July under the command of Vice Admiral <a href="John%20S.%20McCain%20Sr.">John S. McCain</a>. On this day, aircraft flying from the Task Force's aircraft carriers attacked facilities around Tokyo. Task Force 38 sailed north, and on 14 July began raids on <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and northern <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>. These areas were outside the range of the B-29 Superfortress bombers, and had at that point not been attacked in the war. The American aircraft met little opposition, and sank 11 warships and 20 merchant ships. A further eight warships and 21 merchant ships were damaged, and the carrier aviators claimed to have destroyed 25 Japanese aircraft.
The first Allied bombardment of a Japanese coastal town was conducted on 14 July in conjunction with the air attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu. A bombardment group commanded by Rear Admiral John F. Shafroth designated Task Unit 34.8.1 (TU¬†34.8.1) was detached from TF¬†38 to attack the ironworks at <a href="Kamaishi%2C%20Iwate">Kamaishi</a> in northern Honshu. At the time the city had a population of 40,000 and the ironworks was among the largest in Japan. However, due to shortages of <a href="Coke%20%28fuel%29">coking coal</a> and other raw materials, the ironworks was running at less than half its capacity. Allied <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> had been assigned to work at the Nippon Steel Company, and were housed in two camps in Kamaishi. TU¬†34.8.1 comprised the battleships , and as well as the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and and nine <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s.

The bombardment group opened fire on the ironworks at 12:10p.m. from a range of . The ships then moved closer to the city, but did not cross the 100-<a href="fathom">fathom</a> line as no <a href="minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a> were available to clear the area of mines. The bombardment lasted for over two hours, during which time the force made six passes across the mouth of Kamaishi's harbor and fired 802 shells, 728 shells and 825 shells. While most of the shells landed within the grounds of the ironworks, the concussion from their explosions caused kitchen fires to break out across Kamaishi. The resulting smoke prevented US Navy aircraft from being able to support or spot for the warships, which continued to fire accurately on predetermined targets. No Japanese aircraft or coastal guns responded to this bombardment. Allied aircraft photographed the ironworks following the attack, but photo interpreters underestimated the extent to which they had been damaged. This was one of the first times that the Americans had used aerial photography to assess damage from a naval bombardment, and the interpreters placed too much weight on the fact that none of the ironworks' buildings had been destroyed. The Allies learned after the war that the ironworks had been extensively damaged and forced to cease production for a period. This resulted in a loss of the equivalent of four weeks of <a href="pig%20iron">pig iron</a> production and two-and-a-half months of coke production. Five Allied prisoners of war were killed by the bombardment.

On the night of 14/15 July, another bombardment unit‚ÄîTU 34.8.2‚Äîwas detached from TF 38 to attack <a href="Muroran%2C%20Hokkaid%C5%8D">Muroran</a> on the south-east coast of Hokkaido. TU 34.8.2 was commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="Oscar%20C.%20Badger%20II">Oscar C. Badger</a> and comprised the battleships , and , the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s and , and eight destroyers. Admiral Halsey accompanied this force on board "Missouri". The targets of this attack were the <a href="Japan%20Steel%20Works">Japan Steel Company</a>'s facilities and the Wanishi Iron Works. Also that night, a force of four cruisers and six destroyers cruised along the east coast of Honshu seeking to attack Japanese shipping, but did not locate any targets.

TU¬†34.8.2's bombardment began at dawn on 15 July. The three battleships fired 860 shells at the city from a range of . Aerial observation and spotting of damage was made difficult by hazy conditions, and only 170 shells landed within the grounds of the two plants. Nevertheless, considerable damage was inflicted on the industrial facilities, resulting in the loss of two-and-a-half months of coke production and slightly less pig iron production. Damage to buildings across the city was also extensive. As with the bombardment of Kamaishi, photo interpreters underestimated the scale of the damage. TU¬†34.8.2 was highly vulnerable to air attack throughout the more than six hour period in which it was visible from the shore of Hokkaido, and Halsey later wrote that these were the longest hours of his life. The failure of the Japanese to attack his ships convinced Halsey that they were preserving aircraft for use against the Allied invasion force. On 15 July, aircraft flying from TF¬†38's aircraft carriers struck again at Hokkaido and northern Honshu, devastating the fleet of ships that carried coal between the two islands.

The attacks on Hokkaido and northern Honshu ended on 15 July, and TF 38 sailed away from the Japanese coast to refuel and rendezvous with the main body of the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>, which was designated Task Force 37 (TF 37). On the morning of 17 July, the British and American carriers attacked targets to the north of Tokyo. Later that day, TU 34.8.2 detached from the carrier force to bombard targets around the city of <a href="Hitachi%2C%20Ibaraki">Hitachi</a>, about northeast of Tokyo. This force was commanded by Rear Admiral Badger and comprised the battleships "Iowa", "Missouri", "Wisconsin", , , and , light cruisers "Atlanta" and "Dayton", and eight American and two British destroyers. "King George V" and her two escorts sailed astern of the American force, and operated independently. Halsey again accompanied this force on board "Missouri".

The bombardment of the Hitachi area took place on the night of 17/18 July. Rain and fog made locating the targets difficult and prevented spotting aircraft from flying, but several carrier aircraft flew protective patrols over the bombardment force. The Allied warships opened fire at 11:10p.m., and aimed at their targets using radar and <a href="LORAN">LORAN</a>. The attackers targeted nine industrial facilities, and "King George V" was assigned similar targets to those engaged by the American battleships. By the time the bombardment ceased at about 1:10a.m., the American battleships had fired 1,238 shells, and the British battleship 267 shells. The two light cruisers also fired 292 shells at radar and electronics installations south of Hitachi. All firing was conducted at a range of .

The attack on Hitachi had mixed results. Only three of the bombardment's nine targets were hit, and the overall damage to the city's industrial area was assessed as "slight". However, the attack inflicted considerable damage on the city's urban area and essential services. This damage was greatly increased by a B-29 raid on Hitachi on the night of 18/19 July that destroyed or damaged 79 percent of the city's urban area. The <a href="official%20history">official history</a> of the US Navy in World War II states that "individual Japanese" considered the naval bombardment to have been more terrifying than the air attack.

On 18 July TFs 37 and 38 conducted further air strikes in the Tokyo area, with the American force's main effort being <a href="Attack%20on%20Yokosuka">an attempt to sink</a> the Japanese battleship at <a href="Yokosuka%20Naval%20District">Yokosuka Naval Base</a>. That night, Cruiser Division 17 (CruDiv 17), which comprised the light cruisers , , , and and six destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral J. Cary Jones, fired 240 shells at a radar station on <a href="Cape%20Nojima">Cape Nojima</a> over a five-minute period, but did not hit it.

After completing its strikes on the Tokyo region, the Allied fleet conducted an at-sea replenishment from 21 to 23 July before attacking <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kure%20%28July%201945%29">Kure and the Inland Sea</a> from the 24th to the 28th of the month. On the night of 24‚Äì25 July, CruDiv¬†17 patrolled the <a href="Kii%20Channel">Kii Channel</a> and bombarded the naval <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> base at <a href="Kushimoto%2C%20Wakayama">Kushimoto</a>, a landing field near <a href="Cape%20Shionomisaki">Cape Shionomisaki</a>, and a radio station. This attack lasted for only four minutes and caused little damage.

On 29 July, a group of warships was detached from the main body of the Allied fleet to bombard the city of <a href="Hamamatsu">Hamamatsu</a>, which lies on the south coast of Honshu between <a href="Nagoya">Nagoya</a> and Tokyo. This force comprised the same ships which had attacked Kamaishi on 14 July with the addition of "King George V" and the destroyers , and ; the four British ships were designated Task Unit 37.1.2 (TU¬†37.1.2). The city had previously suffered extensive damage from air attacks.

The British and American ships engaged their targets independently. "King George V" opened fire at the Japan Musical Instrument Company's Plant No. 2 (which was being used to manufacture aircraft propellers) at 11:19¬†p.m. from a range of . The battleship fired 265 rounds at the plant in 27 minutes and was able to make use of artillery spotting aircraft, with visibility being good. Even so, little damage was inflicted on the facility. "Massachusetts" fired at Plant No. 1 but scored only a few hits. Despite the limited physical damage, the shelling caused increased labor absenteeism and disruption to vital services that caused the factory to cease production. The American ships also shelled the <a href="Japanese%20Government%20Railways">Imperial Government Railway</a> locomotive works and three other industrial facilities.

Of these targets, the locomotive works ceased operations for about three months due to damage, but two of the other facilities had almost ceased production before the attack and the third was not damaged. Two bridges on the important <a href="T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D%20Main%20Line">T≈çkaid≈ç Main Line</a> were fired upon but not hit, though damage to rail infrastructure in Hamamatsu closed the line for 66 hours. During the bombardment "Undine" twice opened fire on small groups of ships that were probably fishing boats. No Japanese aircraft or shore batteries responded to the Allied attack. The bombardment of Hamamatsu was the last time a British battleship <a href="wikt%3Afire%20in%20anger">fired its guns in anger</a>.

The next bombardment of Japan took place on the night of 30/31 July. On that night Destroyer Squadron 25 (DesRon¬†25), which was commanded by Captain J.W. Ludewig aboard , searched the <a href="Suruga%20Bay">Suruga Gulf</a> for Japanese shipping to attack. No ships were located, and in the early hours of 31 July the squadron sailed deep into the gulf and fired 1,100 rounds of shells during seven minutes at a railway yard and aluminum plant in <a href="Shimizu-ku%2C%20Shizuoka">Shimizu</a>. The aluminum plant was hit, but this was of little importance as it had almost ceased production due to a shortage of raw materials. No damage was caused to the rail yard.

During the last days of July and into early August, the Allied fleet sailed away from the Japanese coast to avoid a <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> and allow the ships to replenish their stocks of fuel and ammunition. The fleet then sailed north and, on both 9 and 10 August, the carrier aircraft attacked a large concentration of Japanese aircraft on airfields in northern Honshu. The carrier pilots claimed the destruction of 720 Japanese aircraft in this operation.

As part of these operations off northern Japan, Kamaishi was bombarded again on 9 August in the mistaken belief that the ironworks had not been badly damaged. TU¬†34.8.1 conducted this attack, and comprised the ships that had bombarded the city in July with the addition of the heavy cruisers and , British light cruiser , <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a> light cruiser <a href="HMS%20Gambia%20%2848%29">HMNZS "Gambia"</a>, and destroyers , , and . "King George V" did not participate in this action as mechanical problems affecting two of her propeller shafts meant that she was unable to sail at the speed specified for the bombardment force.

The Allied ships opened fire on the ironworks and docks in Kamaishi at 12:54p.m. The bombardment was conducted from an average range of and lasted for almost two hours. During this time, the ships made 4 passes across Kamaishi harbor and fired 803 shells, 1,383 shells, and 733 shells. "Gambia" fired the final shots of the attack. During the bombardment, several Japanese aircraft approached the Allied ships and two were shot down by Allied naval fighters. This bombardment caused more damage than the attack conducted in July, and large quantities of pig iron were destroyed. The sounds of this bombardment were broadcast live on radio in the United States via a radio relay on board "Iowa". One of the prisoner of war camps in Kamaishi was destroyed by the Allied attack, resulting in the deaths of 27 Allied prisoners.

A further bombardment by "King George V", three light cruisers, and escorting destroyers was planned to be conducted against an unspecified Japanese target on 13 August. This attack was cancelled for both the battleship's mechanical problems and the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>. The Allied fleet did not conduct any other bombardments, as Japan surrendered on 15 August.

Two US Navy submarines attacked locations in the Japanese home islands during June and July 1945. On 20 June arrived off Japan's northern islands under the command of Commander <a href="Eugene%20B.%20Fluckey">Gene Fluckey</a>. For this patrol the submarine had been fitted with an experimental rocket launcher intended for shore bombardments. Shortly after midnight on 22 June the submarine fired 12 rockets at <a href="Shari%2C%20Hokkaido">Shari</a> in north-east Hokkaido. "Barb" then proceeded north, and on 2 July bombarded <a href="Kaiyo">Kaiyo</a> in south-east <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> with its <a href="deck%20gun">deck gun</a>. This attack destroyed three <a href="sampan">sampan</a>s docked in the town, damaged a seal rookery and caused several fires to break out. The next day the submarine fired more rockets at <a href="Poronaysk">Shisuka</a>. A party of eight men from "Barb" was landed on the east coast of Sakhalin on 23 July and planted demolition charges on a railroad track. Shortly after the men began rowing back to the submarine the charges were triggered by a passing train; 150 people, including civilians, were killed. On 24 July, "Barb" fired 32 rockets at <a href="Shiritori">Shiritori</a> and 12 rockets at <a href="Kashiho">Kashiho</a>. As the submarine returned to base it shelled Chiri on 25 July and <a href="Shibertoro">Shibertoro</a> the next day. The attack on Shibertoro targeted a shipyard building sampans, and destroyed 35 newly built vessels.

The other submarine bombardment took place during the morning of 24 June, when fired some shells at the island of <a href="Hirado%2C%20Nagasaki">Hirado Shima</a> in the <a href="Tsushima%20Strait">Tsushima Strait</a> between Japan and Korea. This attack sought to convince the Japanese that a force of American submarines that had been operating in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a> would attempt to depart via the Tsushima Strait, instead of their actual route far to the north through the <a href="La%20P%C3%A9rouse%20Strait">La P√©rouse Strait</a> between Hokkaido and Sakhalin.

Although the naval bombardments did not result in the reaction the Allies were hoping for from the Japanese military, they disrupted the country's steel industry. While several of the factories attacked were operating at reduced capacity, the important Kamaishi and Wanishi Iron Works suffered heavy damage when they were bombarded in July and August. During both these attacks, the Allied gunnery was accurate and focused on the factories' coke batteries, which were critical to continued production. Post-war assessments found that the damage caused to industrial buildings by even the approximately naval shells was less than that which could be inflicted by the and <a href="general-purpose%20bomb">general-purpose bomb</a>s that were used by Allied naval aircraft. While this supported a view put forward by Vice Admiral McCain that the aircraft assigned to protect the bombardment forces could have caused more damage than the ships themselves, the post-war <a href="United%20States%20Strategic%20Bombing%20Survey">United States Strategic Bombing Survey</a> judged that the naval bombardments were justified as there had been little risk to the ships involved.

The bombardments also affected Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks to be more terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity. This was not the case for all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers in two of the bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes did not contribute to bringing the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">decision to surrender</a>.

In 1949, the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency calculated that the Allied naval bombardments and other forms of attack other than bombing had caused 3,282 casualties, representing 0.5 percent of all casualties inflicted by the Allies in the Japanese home islands. The casualties attributed to naval bombardments and other causes included 1,739 fatalities, 46 persons who were still classified as missing and 1,497 people who were wounded.

Fortress of Mimoyecques

The Fortress of Mimoyecques is the modern name for a <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> underground military complex built by the forces of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> between 1943 and 1944. It was intended to house a <a href="Artillery%20battery">battery</a> of <a href="V-3%20cannon">V-3 cannon</a>s aimed at London, away. Originally codenamed Wiese ("Meadow") or Bauvorhaben 711 ("Construction Project 711"), it is located in the <a href="Communes%20of%20France">commune</a> of <a href="Landrethun-le-Nord">Landrethun-le-Nord</a> in the <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> region of northern France, near the hamlet of <a href="Mimoyecques">Mimoyecques</a> () about from <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a>. It was constructed by a mostly German workforce recruited from major engineering and mining concerns, augmented by prisoner-of-war slave labour.

The complex consists of a network of tunnels dug under a chalk hill, linked to five inclined shafts in which 25 V-3 guns would have been installed, all targeted on <a href="London">London</a>. The guns would have been able to fire ten dart-like explosive projectiles a minute¬†‚Äì 600 rounds every hour¬†‚Äì into the British capital, which <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> later commented would have constituted "the most devastating attack of all". The Allies knew nothing about the V-3 but identified the site as a possible launching base for <a href="V-2">V-2</a> ballistic missiles, based on reconnaissance photographs and fragmentary intelligence from French sources.

Mimoyecques was targeted for intensive bombardment by the Allied air forces from late 1943 onwards. Construction work was seriously disrupted, forcing the Germans to abandon work on part of the complex. The rest was partly destroyed on 6 July 1944 by <a href="No.%20617%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 617 Squadron RAF</a>, which used ground-penetrating "<a href="Tallboy%20%28bomb%29">Tallboy</a>" <a href="earthquake%20bomb">earthquake bomb</a>s to collapse tunnels and shafts, entombing hundreds of slave workers underground.

The Germans halted construction work at Mimoyecques as the Allies advanced up the coast following the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. It fell to the <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">Canadian 3rd Infantry Division</a> on 5 September 1944 without resistance, a few days after the Germans withdrew from the area.

The complex was partly demolished just after the war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen as a threat to the United Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 to serve as a <a href="mushroom%20farm">mushroom farm</a> and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and <a href="La%20Coupole">La Coupole</a>, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near <a href="Saint-Omer">Saint-Omer</a>, took over its management. It continues to be open to the public as a vast underground museum complex.

In May 1943 <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a>, the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production, informed <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> of work that was being carried out to produce a <a href="supergun">supergun</a> capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances. The newly designed gun, codenamed the "Hochdruckpumpe" ("High Pressure Pump", HDP for short) and later designated as the <a href="V-3%20cannon">V-3</a>, was one of the <a href="V-weapons">V-weapons</a>¬†‚Äì "Vergeltungswaffen" ("retaliation weapons")¬†‚Äì developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets. Long-range guns were not a new development, but the high-pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons, including the <a href="Paris%20gun">Paris gun</a>, rapidly wore out their barrels.

In 1942, <a href="August%20Coenders">August Coenders</a>, inspired by previous designs of multi-chamber guns, suggested that the gradual acceleration of the shell by a series of small charges spread over the length of the barrel might be the solution to the problem of designing very long-range guns. Coenders proposed the use of electrically activated charges to eliminate the problem of the premature ignition of the subsidiary charges experienced by previous multi-chamber guns. The HDP would have a smooth barrel over long, along which a finned shell (known as the "Sprenggranate 4481") would be accelerated by numerous small low-pressure detonations from charges in branches off the barrel, each fired electrically in sequence. Each barrel would be in diameter.

The gun was still in its prototype stages, but Hitler was an enthusiastic supporter of the idea and ordered that maximum support be given to its development and deployment. In August 1943 he approved the construction of a battery of HDP guns in France to supplement the planned <a href="V-1%20%28flying%20bomb%29">V-1</a> and <a href="V-2">V-2</a> missile campaigns against London and the south-east of England. Speer noted afterwards:

To reach England, the weapon needed barrels long, so it could not be moved; it would have to be deployed from a fixed site. A study carried out in early 1943 had shown that the optimal location for its deployment would be within a hill with a rock core into which inclined <a href="Drift%20mining">drifts</a> could be tunneled to support the barrels.

The site was identified by a fortification expert, Major Bock of the "Festungs-Pionier-Stab 27" of the <a href="15th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">Fifteenth Army</a> <a href="LVII%20Corps">LVII Corps</a> based in the <a href="Dieppe%2C%20Seine-Maritime">Dieppe</a> area. A limestone hill near the hamlet of <a href="Mimoyecques">Mimoyecques</a>, high and from London, was chosen to house the gun. It had been selected with care; the hill in which the facility was built is primarily chalk with very little topsoil cover, and the chalk layer extends several hundred metres below the surface, providing a deep but easily tunnelled rock layer. The chalk is easy to excavate and strong enough to dig tunnels without using timber supports. Although the site's road links were poor, it was only a few kilometres west of the main railway line between <a href="Calais">Calais</a> and <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a>.

The area was already heavily militarised; as well as the fortifications of the <a href="Atlantic%20Wall">Atlantic Wall</a> on the cliffs of <a href="Cap%20Gris%20Nez">Cap Gris Nez</a> to the northwest, there was a firing base for at least one conventional <a href="Krupp%20K5">Krupp K5</a> <a href="railway%20gun">railway gun</a> about to the south in the nearby quarries of <a href="Rinxent">Hidrequent-Rinxent</a>.

Construction began in September 1943 with the building of railway lines to support the work, and excavation of the gun shafts began in October. The initial layout comprised two parallel complexes approximately apart, each with five drifts which were to hold a stacked cluster of five HDP gun tubes, for a total of 25 guns. The <a href="smoothbore">smoothbore</a> design of the HDP would enable a much higher rate of fire than was possible with conventional guns. The entire battery would be able to fire up to 10 shots a minute, capable in theory of hitting London with 600 projectiles every hour. Both facilities were to be served by an underground railway tunnel of standard gauge, connected to the Calais-Boulogne main line, and underground ammunition storage galleries which were tunneled at a depth of about . The western site was abandoned at an early stage after being disrupted by Allied bombing, and only the eastern complex was built.

The drifts were angled at 50 degrees, reaching a depth of . Owing to technical problems with the gun prototype, the scope of the project was reduced; drifts I and II were abandoned at an early date and only III, IV and V were taken forward. They came to the surface at a concrete slab or "Platte" wide and thick, in which there were narrow openings to allow the projectiles to pass through. The openings in the slab were protected by large steel plates, and the railway tunnel entrances were further protected by armoured steel doors. Each drift was oriented on a bearing of 299¬∞, to the nearest degree ‚Äì a direct line on <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a>. Although the elevation and direction of the guns could not be changed, it would have been possible to alter the range by varying the amount of propellant used in each shot. This would have brought much of London within range.

The railway tunnel ran in a straight line for a distance of about . Along its west side was an unloading platform which gave access to ten cross galleries (numbered 3‚Äì13 by the Germans), driven at right angles to the main tunnel at intervals of . Each gallery was fitted with a gauge railway track. On the east side of the tunnel were chambers intended to be used as store rooms, offices and quarters for the garrison. Trains would have entered the facility and unloaded shells and propellant for the guns.

Galleries 6‚Äì10, the central group, gave access to the guns, while galleries 3‚Äì5 and 11‚Äì13 were intended for use as access tunnels and perhaps also storage areas. They were all connected by Gallery No. 2, which ran parallel to the main railway tunnel at a distance of . Galleries 6‚Äì10 were additionally connected by a second passageway, designated Gallery No. 1, running parallel to the main tunnel at a distance of . Further workings existed at depths of , and , each serving different purposes associated with the drifts and the guns. The 62 m workings were constructed to facilitate the removal of spoil from the drifts, while those at 47 m were connected with the handling of exhaust gases from the guns and those at 30 m gave access to the breeches of the guns. The lower levels of the workings were accessed via lift shafts, and mining cages were used during construction.

The construction work was carried out by over 5,000 workers, mostly German engineers drafted in from several companies including <a href="Mannesmann">Mannesmann</a>, <a href="MAN%20SE">Gute Hoffnungsh√ºtte</a>, <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a> and the <a href="Vereinigte%20Stahlwerke">Vereinigte Stahlwerke</a>, supplemented by 430 miners recruited from the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr</a> and Soviet prisoners of war who were used as slave labourers. The intensive Allied bombing campaign caused delays, but construction work continued nonetheless at a high pace underground. The original plans had envisaged having the first battery of five guns ready by March 1944 and the full complement of 25 guns by 1 October 1944, but these target dates were not met.

In 1943 French agents reported that the Germans were planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk in the ground and served by rail links. The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the <a href="RAF%20Medmenham">Allied Central Interpretation Unit</a> in September 1943, when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites. Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large-scale activity around the tunnels.

An analyst named Andr√© Kenny discovered a series of shafts when he saw from a reconnaissance photograph that a haystack concealing one of them had disintegrated, perhaps through the effects of a gale, revealing the entrance, a <a href="windlass">windlass</a> and <a href="pulley">pulley</a>. The purpose of the site was unclear, but it was thought to be some kind of shelter for launching rockets or flying bombs. An <a href="MI6">MI6</a> agent reported that "a concrete chamber was to be built near one of the tunnels for the installation of a tube, 40 to 50 metres long, which he referred to as a 'rocket launching cannon. The shafts were interpreted as "air holes to allow for the expansion of the gases released by the explosion of the launching charge."

The Allies were unaware of the HDP gun and therefore of the Mimoyecques site's true purpose. Allied intelligence believed at the time that the V-2 rocket had to be launched from tubes or "projectors", so it was assumed that the inclined shafts at Mimoyecques were intended to house such devices.

The lack of intelligence on Mimoyecques was frustrating for those involved in <a href="Operation%20Crossbow">Operation Crossbow</a>, the Allied effort to counter the V-weapons. On 21 March 1944 the British <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff</a> discussed the shortage of intelligence but were told by <a href="Reginald%20Victor%20Jones">Reginald Victor Jones</a>, one of the "Crossbow Committee" members, that little information was leaking out because the workforce was predominantly German. The Committee's head, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, pressed for greater efforts and proposed that the <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a> be tasked to kidnap a German technician who could be interrogated for information. The suggestion was approved, but was never put into effect.

In the end the Chiefs of Staff instructed General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> to begin intensive attacks on the so-called "Heavy Crossbow" sites, including Mimoyecques, which was still believed to be intended for use as a rocket-launching site.

The Allied air forces carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage. The bombing disrupted the construction project and the initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed for about a month. The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site, where work had not progressed very far, and concentrated on the eastern site. On 6 July 1944 the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> began bombing the site with ground-penetrating <a href="Tallboy%20bomb">Tallboy bomb</a>s. One Tallboy hit the concrete slab on top of Drift IV, collapsing the drift. Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility, causing several of the galleries to collapse in places.

Around 300 Germans and forced labourers were buried alive by the collapses. Adding to the Germans' difficulties, major technical problems were discovered with the HDP gun projectiles. They had been designed to exit the barrels at a speed of about per second, but the Germans found that a design fault caused the projectiles to begin "tumbling" in flight at speeds above per second, causing them to fall well short of the target. This was not discovered until over 20,000 projectiles had already been manufactured.

After the devastating raid of 6 July, the Germans held a high-level meeting on the site's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site's development. On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to be installed in a single drift. The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, reamed out to a smooth bore with a diameter of , which were to use a new type of long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of <a href="Rheinbote">Rheinbote</a> missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.

The Allies were unaware of this and mounted further attacks on the site as part of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> experimental <a href="Operation%20Aphrodite">Operation Aphrodite</a>, involving radio-controlled <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a>s packed with explosives. Two such attacks were mounted but failed; in the second such attack, on 12 August, Lt <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Kennedy%2C%20Jr.">Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.</a>¬†‚Äì the elder brother of future US President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>¬†‚Äì was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely. By the end of the bombing campaign, over 4,100 tons of bombs had been dropped on Mimoyecques, more than on any other V-weapons site.

The Mimoyecques site was never formally abandoned, but German forces left it at the start of September 1944 as the Allies advanced northeast from <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> towards the Pas de Calais. It was captured on 5 September by the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division.

In September 1944, Duncan Sandys ordered the constitution of a Technical Inter-Services Mission under Colonel <a href="Terence%20Sanders">T.R.B. Sanders</a>. It was given the task of investigating the V-weapons sites at Mimoyecques, <a href="Siracourt%20V-1%20bunker">Siracourt</a>, <a href="Blockhaus%20d%27%C3%89perlecques">Watten</a>, and <a href="La%20Coupole">Wizernes</a>, collectively known to the Allies as the "Heavy Crossbow" sites. Sanders' report was submitted to the War Cabinet on 19 March 1945.

Even at this stage the true purpose of the site was unclear. Claims that it had been intended to be used for "electro-magnetic projectors" (<a href="railguns">railguns</a>), firing huge shells at London, were debunked by <a href="Frederick%20Lindemann%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cherwell">Lord Cherwell</a>, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s scientific adviser, who calculated that it would take sixty times the output of <a href="Battersea%20Power%20Station">Battersea Power Station</a> to fire a one-ton shell. Sanders' investigation brought to light the V-3 project for the first time, to the alarm of the British government. He concluded that although the site had been damaged it "could be completed or adapted for offensive action against this country at some future date, and [its] destruction is a matter of importance." Sandys brought the matter to the attention of Churchill and advised: "Since this installation constitutes a potential threat to London, it would be wise to ensure that it is demolished whilst our forces are still in France." Churchill later commented that the V-3 installation at Mimoyecques "might well have launched the most devastating attack of all on London."

The discovery of the site's true purpose produced some recriminations in London, as ‚Äì unlike the V-1 and V-2 projects ‚Äì the V-3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence before the war's end. The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that "techniques that had been used against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP [V-3], and there had to be a reason. Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem, and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage (although we sometimes achieved this) as in the development stage ‚Äì which usually meant when trials were showing promise." He concluded at the time, in April 1945, that the intelligence failure had not made much practical difference given the fact that the Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon: "there was little warning; [but] there was little danger."

Following the recommendation that the site should be destroyed, the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> stacked ten tons of British bombs and captured German plastic explosive in the tunnels at Mimoyecques and detonated them on 9 May. This failed to achieve the desired effect, and on 14 May, a further 25 tons of explosives were used to bring down the north and south entrances to the railway tunnel into the site. A subsequent investigation by the British Bombing Research Mission concluded that the entrances had been heavily blocked and that it would be a very difficult and lengthy engineering task to reinstate them. The British action was taken without informing the French beforehand and infuriated <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a>, who considered it a violation of France's national sovereignty.

After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the equipment left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by the manager of the Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.

Despite the closure of the railway tunnel entrances it was still possible for many years to get into the complex by climbing down one of the inclined drifts. In 1969, Marie-Madeleine Vasseur, a farmer from Landrethun, had the southern entrance excavated so that the tunnels could be used as a mushroom farm. of the southern tunnel had to be removed to clear the blockage; the entrance now visible is not the original one built by the Germans. The southern entrance had been bricked up again by the 1970s. Moved to discover this forgotten construction, Vasseur, helped by family and friends, cleared the tunnels and installed an electricity supply. The "<a href="soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20%C3%A0%20responsabilit%C3%A9%20limit%C3%A9e">soci√©t√© √† responsabilit√© limit√©e</a> "La Forteresse de Mimoyecques"" was constituted in 1984 to operate the site as a museum under the name of "Forteresse de Mimoyecques¬†‚Äî Un M√©morial International".

The museum closed at the end of the 2008 season when the owner retired. Subsequently, the <a href="nonprofit%20organisation">nonprofit organisation</a> "Conservatoire d'espaces naturels du Nord et Pas-de-Calais" (Conservatory of natural sites of the Nord and Pas-de-Calais) purchased it at a cost of <a href="euro">‚Ç¨</a>330,000, with funding provided by the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional council, the European Union and a private benefactor. The Conservatory's interest was due to the presence on the site of a large bat colony that included rare species, such as the <a href="Greater%20Horseshoe%20Bat">Greater Horseshoe Bat</a>, <a href="Geoffroy%27s%20Bat">Geoffroy's Bat</a> and the <a href="Pond%20Bat">Pond Bat</a>.

The <a href="Communes%20of%20France">intercommunality</a> of the <a href="Communaut%C3%A9%20de%20communes%20de%20la%20Terre%20des%20Deux%20Caps">Terre des Deux Caps</a> and the authorities in nearly Landrethun set up a partnership to operate the site under the management of the existing museum of La Coupole near Saint-Omer. The director of the latter, historian Yves le Maner, designed the contents of a new museum that was constructed at a cost of ‚Ç¨360,000.

The site reopened to the public on 1 July 2010. As well as presenting a history of the V-weapons and of the site, the museum enables visitors to see some of the tunnels and a mock-up of the HDP gun. The tunnels also house memorials to Joseph Kennedy, the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site, and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction. In 2011, the museum had about 11,000 visitors, of whom 53% were French, 18% Belgian and 16% British.

Warkworth Castle

Warkworth Castle is a ruined medieval building in the <a href="Warkworth%2C%20Northumberland">village of the same name</a> in the English county of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. The village and <a href="castle">castle</a> occupy a loop of the <a href="River%20Coquet">River Coquet</a>, less than a mile from England's north-east coast. When the castle was founded is uncertain: traditionally its construction has been ascribed to <a href="Henry%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Prince Henry of Scotland</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earl of Northumbria</a>, in the mid-12th¬†century, but it may have been built by <a href="King%20Henry%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20England">King Henry¬†II of England</a> when he took control of England's northern counties. Warkworth Castle was first documented in a charter of 1157‚Äì1164 when Henry¬†II granted it to Roger fitz Richard. The timber castle was considered "feeble", and was left undefended when the Scots invaded in 1173.

Roger's son Robert inherited and improved the castle. Robert was a favourite of <a href="John%2C%20King%20of%20England">King John</a>, and hosted him at Warkworth Castle in 1213. The castle remained in the family line, with periods of guardianship when heirs were too young to control their estates. <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">King Edward¬†I</a> stayed overnight in 1292 and John de Clavering, descendant of Roger fitz Richard, made <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a> his inheritor. With the outbreak of the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Anglo-Scottish Wars</a>, <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward¬†II</a> invested in castles including Warkworth where he funded the strengthening of the garrison in 1319. Twice in 1327 the Scots besieged the castle without success.

John de Clavering died in 1332 and his widow in 1345, at which point <a href="Henry%20de%20Percy%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Percy">The 2nd Baron Percy of Alnwick</a> took control of Warkworth Castle, having been promised Clavering's property by <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward¬†III</a>. <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland</a>, added the imposing keep overlooking the village of Warkworth in the late 14th century. The <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">fourth earl</a> remodelled the buildings in the bailey and began the construction of a <a href="collegiate%20church">collegiate church</a> within the castle, but work on the latter was abandoned after his death. Although <a href="Algernon%20Percy%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">The 10th Earl of Northumberland</a> supported Parliament during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, the castle was damaged during the conflict. The last Percy earl died in 1670. In the mid-18th century the castle found its way into the hands of <a href="Hugh%20Percy%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">Hugh Smithson</a>, who married the indirect <a href="Percy%20family">Percy heiress</a>. He adopted the surname "Percy" and founded the dynasty of the <a href="Dukes%20of%20Northumberland">Dukes of Northumberland</a>, through whom possession of the castle descended.

In the late 19th¬†century, the dukes refurbished Warkworth Castle and <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> was commissioned to restore the keep. <a href="Alan%20Percy%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">The 8th Duke of Northumberland</a> gave custody of the castle to the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a> in 1922. Since 1984 <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> has cared for the site, which is a Grade¬†I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> and a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>.

Although the settlement of <a href="Warkworth%2C%20Northumberland">Warkworth</a> in Northumberland dates back to at least the 8th century, the first castle was not built until after the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a>. The town and its castle occupied a loop of the River Coquet. The castle was built at the south end of the town, guarding the narrow neck of the loop. A fortified bridge also defended the approach to the town. The surrounding lowland countryside was favourable for agriculture. When the castle was founded and by whom is uncertain, though traditionally <a href="Henry%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Prince Henry of Scotland</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a>, has been thought responsible. With <a href="The%20Anarchy">civil war</a> in <a href="south-west%20England">south-west England</a>, <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">King Stephen of England</a> needed to ensure northern England was secure. To this end, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Durham%20%281139%29">Treaty of Durham</a> in 1139 between Scotland and England ensured peace. Under the treaty Henry of Scotland became <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earl of Northumbria</a> in exchange for ceding control of the castles at <a href="Bamburgh%20Castle">Bamburgh</a> and <a href="The%20Castle%2C%20Newcastle">Newcastle</a> to the English. Without them Henry would have needed a new seat from which to exercise his authority, and a new castle at Warkworth may have met the requirement. However, charters show that Henry still controlled Bamburgh Castle after the treaty, and as Warkworth was a modest castle by contemporary standards it may be have been founded by someone else. Henry died in 1152 and his son, <a href="Malcolm%20IV%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm</a> (crowned King of Scotland in 1153), inherited his lands. In 1157 Malcolm travelled to <a href="Peveril%20Castle">Peveril Castle</a> in Derbyshire, where he paid homage to the new King of England, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry¬†II</a>. Malcolm surrendered England's northern counties to Henry, including the castles of Bamburgh, <a href="Carlisle%20Castle">Carlisle</a>, and Newcastle, and probably <a href="Appleby%20Castle">Appleby</a>, <a href="Brough%20Castle">Brough</a>, <a href="Wark%20on%20Tweed">Wark</a>, and Warkworth, though it is possible that Henry¬†II founded Warkworth Castle in 1157 to secure his lands in Northumberland; other contemporary castles in the area were built for this purpose, for instance the one at <a href="Harbottle%20Castle">Harbottle</a>.
The first mention of Warkworth Castle occurs in a charter of 1157‚Äì1164 from Henry¬†II granting the castle and surrounding <a href="manorialism">manor</a> to Roger fitz Richard, a member of a noble Norman family. It has been suggested that this charter may have used the term castle to describe a high-status residence on the site, possibly dating from the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon period</a>, meaning Roger may have built the castle. He owned lands across a wide area, and Warkworth may have been of little significance in the context of his other holdings. When the Scots invaded Northumberland in 1173, although Roger fitz Richard was in the county Warkworth Castle was not defended by its garrison. Its defences at the time were described as "feeble". In 1174 <a href="Donnchad%20II%2C%20Earl%20of%20Fife">Duncan¬†II, Earl of Fife</a>, raided Warkworth. The contemporary record does not mention the castle, and instead notes that Warkworth's inhabitants sought refuge in the church. When Roger fitz Richard died in 1178 his son and heir, Robert fitz Roger, was still a child. A guardian looked after the family estates until Robert came of age in 1191. He paid the Crown 300¬†<a href="mark%20%28money%29">marks</a> in 1199 for confirmation of his ownership of Warkworth, including the castle. Substantial building work at Warkworth Castle is attributed to Robert. A favourite of King <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>, Robert hosted him at Warkworth Castle in 1213.

Warkworth Castle continued to descend through the family line when Robert fitz Roger was succeeded by his son John in 1214, who was succeeded by his son Roger in 1240. Roger died in 1249 when his son Robert was one year old, and a guardian was appointed to care for the family's estates: <a href="William%20de%20Valence%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Pembroke">William de Valence</a>, half-brother of King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry¬†III</a>. The castle,
characterised by this time by the chronicler <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> as "noble", remained under the guardianship of Valence until 1268, when it reverted to Robert fitz John. King <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20England">Edward¬†I of England</a> stayed at Warkworth Castle for a night in 1292. The English king was asked to mediate in a dispute over the Scottish throne and laid his own claim, leading to the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Anglo-Scottish Wars</a>. After the Scottish victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stirling%20Bridge">Battle of Stirling Bridge</a> in 1297, Robert and his son, John de Clavering, were captured. They were subsequently released and in 1310 John assumed control of the family estates. A year later, John made arrangements so that on his death the king would receive all of his property. Between roughly 1310 and 1330 the English struggled to deal with Scottish raids in northern England. Such was the importance of large castles during the Scottish Wars that the Crown subsidised their maintenance and even construction. In 1319, King <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward¬†II</a> paid for a garrison for the castle of four <a href="man-at-arms">men-at-arms</a> and eight <a href="hobilar">hobilar</a>s to enhance the existing force of twelve men-at-arms. <a href="Ralph%20Neville%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Neville%20de%20Raby">Ralph Neville</a> was the keeper of Warkworth Castle in 1322. As he was married to John's daughter, Euphemia, Ralph may have hoped to inherit the Clavering estates, but that did not happen. Twice in 1327 Scottish forces besieged the castle without success.

Around this time, the <a href="House%20of%20Percy">Percy family</a> was becoming Northumberland's most powerful dynasty. <a href="Henry%20de%20Percy%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Percy">Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy</a>, was in the service of <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward¬†III</a> and was paid 500¬†marks a year in perpetuity in return for leading a company of men-at-arms. In exchange for the annual fee, in 1328 Percy was promised the rights to the Clavering estates. <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> declared such contracts illegal in 1331, but after initially relinquishing his claim Percy was granted special permission to inherit. John de Clavering died in 1332 and his widow in 1345, at which point the family's estates became the property of the Percys. While the Percys owned <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a>, which was considered more prestigious, Warkworth was the family's preferred home. Under the Percys a park was created nearby for hunting, and within the castle two residential blocks were created, described by historian <a href="John%20Goodall%20%28author%29">John Goodall</a> as "of unparalleled quality and sophistication in Northumberland". The second baron died at Warkworth in 1352.
In 1377 the fourth Baron Percy, also named <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry</a>, was made the first <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a> (becoming the first family from northern England to be granted an earldom) in recognition of his extensive power in the <a href="Scottish%20Marches">march areas</a> along the <a href="Anglo-Scottish%20border">Anglo-Scottish border</a>. With a network of contacts and dependencies, the Percys were the pre-eminent family in northern England in the 14th¬†century "for they have the hertes of the people by north and ever had", in the words of contemporaneous chronicler <a href="John%20Hardyng">John Hardyng</a>. Henry Percy commissioned the building of the distinctive keep shortly after he was made Earl of Northumberland. Percy may have enhanced his main castle to compete with <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a>, who rebuilt the nearby <a href="Dunstanburgh%20Castle">Dunstanburgh Castle</a>, or with the <a href="House%20of%20Neville">House of Neville</a>, a family becoming increasingly powerful in northern England and who undertook a programme of building at the castles of <a href="Brancepeth%20Castle">Brancepeth</a>, <a href="Raby%20Castle">Raby</a>, <a href="Bamburgh%20Castle">Bamburgh</a>, <a href="Middleham%20Castle">Middleham</a>, and <a href="Sheriff%20Hutton%20Castle">Sheriff Hutton</a>. Architectural similarities between Warkworth's keep, <a href="Bolton%20Castle">Bolton Castle</a>, and the domestic buildings at Bamburgh Castle suggest that <a href="John%20Lewyn">John Lewyn</a> was the master mason responsible for building Warkworth's keep. Earl Henry helped dethrone <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard¬†II</a> and replace him with <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry¬†IV</a>. The earl and his eldest son <a href="Henry%20Hotspur%20Percy">Henry "Hotspur" Percy</a> fell out with the new king, and eventually rebelled. After Hotspur was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shrewsbury">Battle of Shrewsbury</a> in 1403, his father fled to Warkworth. The earl eventually went to <a href="York">York</a> to submit to the king. He was arrested and the king attempted to install his own men at the castles of Alnwick, <a href="Langley%20Castle">Langley Castle</a>, <a href="Prudhoe%20Castle">Prudhoe</a>, and Warkworth. The earl's 14-year-old son claimed that he was loyal to the king but was not empowered to formally surrender the castle, and it remained under control of the Percys. Henry was pardoned in 1404.

Earl Henry rebelled again in 1405, this time joining the unsuccessful revolt of Archbishop <a href="Richard%20le%20Scrope">Scrope</a>. While Henry was fleeing north after the failed rebellion, his castles offered some resistance before submitting to royal forces. Warkworth itself was well-provisioned and the garrison initially refused to surrender. However, according to a letter written by Henry¬†IV from Warkworth after its fall, after just seven shots from his cannon the defenders capitulated. The castle was forfeited to the Crown, and was used by one of the King's sons, <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">John, Duke of Bedford</a>, who was appointed to rule the area. It remained in the ownership of the Crown until <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry¬†V</a> restored it to the Percy family in 1416, and at the same time made the son of "Hotspur" Henry, another <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy</a>, second Earl of Northumberland. It is known that the second earl resided at Warkworth and undertook building work there, but it is now unclear for which parts he was responsible.

The Percys supported the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a> during the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>, and the second earl and his successor¬†‚Äì <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland</a>¬†‚Äì were killed at the battles of <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20St%20Albans">St¬†Albans</a> in 1455 and <a href="Battle%20of%20Towton">Towton</a> in 1461 respectively. The new king, <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">Edward¬†IV</a>, issued an <a href="attainder">attainder</a> against the family and their property was confiscated. On 1 August 1464, as a result of suppressing Lancastrian rebellions in the north for the previous three years, the title of Earl of Northumberland was given to <a href="John%20Neville%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Montagu">The 1st Marquess of Montagu</a>, a <a href="House%20of%20York">Yorkist</a>, and with it, the castle. During his tenure, he constructed a twenty-five-foot tall rectangular tower, built for defence, "with <a href="Arrowslit">[arrow] slits</a> in the three outer walls;" this is known as 'Montagu's Tower' to this day. His brother, <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">The 16th Earl of Warwick</a>, used Warkworth as a base from which the Lancastrian-held castles of Northumberland¬†‚Äì Alnwick, Bamburgh, and Dunstanburgh¬†‚Äì were attacked and their sieges co-ordinated. In 1470 Edward¬†IV returned the Percys' estates to the eldest son of the third earl, who was also called <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy</a>. A year later Henry was granted the earldom of Northumberland. Some time after 1472 Henry remodelled the building of the bailey. He also planned to build a <a href="collegiate%20church">collegiate church</a> within the castle, but the work was abandoned after his death. When the fourth earl was murdered in 1489, his son, <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Algernon</a>, inherited and maintained the castle. In the early 16th¬†century <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland</a>, was responsible for clearing the collegiate church founded by his grandfather, but left incomplete by the fifth earl. Thomas Percy, brother of the sixth earl, was executed for his role in the <a href="Pilgrimage%20of%20Grace">Pilgrimage of Grace</a> in 1536. When Henry Percy died the next year without any sons, the family's property passed to the Crown. Although royal officers still used the castle, by 1550 it had fallen into disrepair. In 1557 the Percy estates were restored to the descendants of Thomas, and the nephew of the sixth earl, another <a href="Thomas%20Percy%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Thomas Percy</a>, was given the earldom. He began a programme of repairs at the castle, and in the process dismantled "the hall and other houses of office".
The <a href="Rising%20of%20the%20North">Rising of the North</a> in 1569 saw Catholic nobles in northern England rebel against the Protestant Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth¬†I</a>. The Catholic Thomas Percy joined the rebellion and supporters congregated at the castles of Alnwick and Warkworth. <a href="Sir%20John%20Forster">Sir John Forster</a>, Warden of the March, ordered those inside to leave and the castles were surrendered to his control. During the conflict that followed, Warkworth remained under royal control. Forster pillaged the castle, stripping it of its timbers and furnishings. The keep at least did not share in this fate, but in April 1572 <a href="Henry%20Carey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hunsdon">Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon</a>, bemoaned the treatment meted out to the Percy castles, writing to the queen's chief minister, "It is a great pity to see how Alnwick Castle and Warkworth are spoiled by him¬†... I am creditably informed that he means utterly to deface them both." An <a href="attainder">attainder</a> was issued against Thomas Percy so that when he came into English custody he was executed without trial on 22 August. As a result, Percy's son was passed over, but under the terms of the attainder his brother was allowed to inherit. In 1574, Elizabeth granted <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy</a> permission to inherit the family's property and assume the title of 8th¬†Earl of Northumberland.

The castle formed the backdrop for several scenes in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV, Part 1</a>" and "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%202">Part 2</a>". Another <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%209th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Henry Percy</a> inherited the family estates in 1585 and assumed the title of 9th¬†Earl of Northumberland. After the failed <a href="Gunpowder%20Plot">Gunpowder Plot</a> of 1605, the earl was imprisoned for his connection with <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28Gunpowder%20Plot%29">Thomas Percy</a>, one of the plotters. Shortly before he was sentenced (he was fined ¬£30,000 and held in the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a>), the earl leased Warkworth Castle to Sir Ralph Gray, who owned <a href="Chillingham%20Castle">Chillingham Castle</a> in Northumberland. Gray neglected the earl's building and allowed it to fall further into disrepair. The lead from the buildings in the bailey was sold in 1607 to alleviate the earl's financial problems. When <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James¬†I</a> visited in 1617 en route to Scotland, his entourage was angered by the sorry state of the castle. With the <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Crowns">unification of England and Scotland</a> under a single ruler, the earls of Northumberland had no need for two great castles near the Anglo-Scottish border; they maintained Alnwick at the expense of Warkworth. In the first quarter of the 17th¬†century, the keep was used to hold manor courts and for the laying out of oats.

The details surrounding Warkworth Castle's role in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> are unclear, but the conflict resulted in further damage to the structure. Initially held by <a href="Cavalier">Royalist forces</a>, the castle was still important enough that when the Scots invaded in 1644 they forced its surrender. <a href="Algernon%20Percy%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland</a>, supported Parliament, which may have prevented the Scots from doing much damage to the castle. <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a> forces took over the castle in 1648; when they withdrew they removed the castle's doors and iron so that it could not be reused by the enemy. They may also have <a href="slighting">partially demolished</a> some of the castle, and may be responsible for its present state. Algernon Percy unsuccessfully applied for compensation in 1649 for the damage.

<a href="Josceline%20Percy%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">The 11th Earl of Northumberland</a>, the last Percy earl, died in 1670. Two years later his widow allowed the keep's materials to be reused to build <a href="Chirton%20Hall">Chirton Hall</a>. A total of 272¬†cart-loads were taken from the keep. Lord Northumberland's property passed to <a href="Algernon%20Seymour%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">The 7th Duke of Somerset</a> through marriage. In 1698, the owners decided not to renovate Warkworth Castle after the estimate to add battlements, floors and new windows came in at ¬£1,600. <a href="Elizabeth%20Percy%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Northumberland">Lady Elizabeth Seymour</a> inherited the property from her father in 1750. Her husband, <a href="Hugh%20Percy%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">Hugh Smithson</a>, changed his name to Hugh Percy, and the castle then descended through the <a href="Dukes%20of%20Northumberland">Dukes of Northumberland</a>, a dynasty he founded.

During the 18th¬†century the castle was allowed to languish. The south-west tower was falling apart and around 1752 part of the curtain wall east of the gatehouse was demolished (it was rebuilt towards the end of the century). The town and its historic ruins were by now attracting interest as a tourist destination, largely due to Bishop <a href="Thomas%20Percy%20%28Bishop%20of%20Dromore%29">Thomas Percy's</a> poem, "The Hermit of Warkworth". In the mid 19th¬†century, <a href="Hugh%20Percy%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">The 3rd Duke of Northumberland</a> undertook some preservation work. His successor, <a href="Algernon%20Percy%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">The 4th Duke of Northumberland</a>, contracted <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> to restore the keep. The work undertaken between 1853 and 1858 was not as extensive as Salvin had planned, and was limited to partially refacing the exterior and adding new floors and roofs to two chambers, which became known as the Duke's Chambers, on the second floor. The <a href="Duke">Duke</a> occasionally used the chambers for picnics when he visited from <a href="Alnwick%20Castle">Alnwick Castle</a>. The 4th Duke funded excavations at the castle in the 1850s which uncovered the remains of the collegiate church within the bailey.

In 1922, <a href="Alan%20Percy%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">The 8th Duke of Northumberland</a> granted custodianship of the castle to the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a> which had been made accountable for the guardianship of ancient monuments. The Duke's Chambers remained under the direct control of the Percys. The Office of Works undertook excavations in the moat in 1924 and removed the custodian from the gatehouse. <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>, who now manage and maintain the site, succeeded as the castle's custodians in 1984, and three years later the Duke's Chambers were given over to their care. The castle is a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>, a "nationally important" historic building and <a href="archaeological%20site">archaeological site</a> which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade¬†I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> (first listed in 1985) and recognised as an internationally important structure. The castle continues to be officially owned by the <a href="Percy%20family">Percy family</a>, currently being owned by <a href="His%20Grace">His Grace</a> <a href="Ralph%20Percy%2C%2012th%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">The 12th Duke of Northumberland</a>.

Warkworth Castle is an irregular enclosure. The keep is at the north end, overlooking the town, with the bailey to the south. The current keep was built on an earlier mound, known as a motte. The <a href="Curtain%20wall%20%28fortification%29">curtain wall</a> of the bailey dates from the early 13th¬†century. There are four towers: Carrickfergus Tower in the south-west corner, Montagu Tower in the south-east, a <a href="postern">postern</a> tower in the west wall (north of the kitchen), and Grey Mare's Tail Tower attached to the east wall. Against the east curtain wall was a stable. In the northern half of the bailey, aligned east‚Äìwest, was an unfinished 15th-century collegiate church; it was cleared away in the early 16th¬†century. Immediately west of the church was the kitchen, situated in the angle of the curtain wall as it changes from its north‚Äìsouth alignment and turns towards the keep. Along the west curtain wall, south of the kitchen, were the pantry, <a href="great%20hall">great hall</a>, and withdrawing chambers. In the south-west was a chapel. Apart from the north side, the castle was surrounded by a <a href="moat">moat</a>.

The gatehouse in the centre of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13th¬†century. It was originally accessed via a <a href="drawbridge">drawbridge</a> and visitors had to pass through two gates, one at either end of the passage, and a <a href="portcullis">portcullis</a>. The semi-octagonal projections on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the projections and above the gate were <a href="machicolations">machicolations</a>, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20th¬†centuries when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.

The range along the western curtain wall dates from about 1480, when the fourth earl remodelled the bailey. The great hall was the social hub of the castle, where the household gathered to eat. The now-ruined 15th-century building replaced an earlier hall on the same site, dating from about 1200, although some of the stone dates from the mid 12th¬†century. The earl would have entered from the south from his connecting private chambers, and people of lower status through the Lion Tower. Internally, it was split into two aisles of differing width. Both halls were heated by open hearths, two of which survive from the earlier hall. Opposite ends of the hall were for opposite ends of the social scale within the castle. The high end (next to the withdrawing chamber) was for the earl and his family, and the low end (next to the kitchen and other service rooms) for the rest of the household. In the medieval period, the great hall was richly decorated with tapestries.

The Lion Tower was the entrance to the north end of the great hall. Above the archway through the tower were displayed heraldic items, symbolic of the Percy earls' power. The lion at the bottom was the emblem of the earls. Though now much damaged, above the lion were the ancient arms of the family and the arms of the Lucy family, whose property the Percys had inherited in the 1380s. As the tower was entered from the bailey, on the right was a doorway leading to the incomplete collegiate church. To the left was the great hall, and beyond that, withdrawing chambers; to the right were the buttery, pantry, larder, and kitchen. Immediately north of the kitchen was a postern tower. Built around 1200, its upper floors were later reused for accommodation. An entrance of lesser status than the main gatehouse, the gate's position next to the kitchen suggests it was a tradesmen's entrance, used for conveying supplies to the castle.
The square Little Stair Tower was the entrance from the bailey to the withdrawing rooms south of the great hall. At ground floor level there was a doorway in each of the tower's faces. Directly south of the east side of the tower was the castle's chapel. The northern door led to the great hall, and the western door to a cellar under the great chamber. There are only fragmentary remains of the spiral staircase. Above the passageway was a single room, of uncertain purpose: it may have been used as another chapel, a guest room, or an antechamber where guests would wait before being admitted into the earl's presence.

South of the great hall was a two-storey building containing withdrawing chambers, dating from around 1200. Narrow windows opening onto the bailey were original but have since been filled in. The first floor was entirely occupied by the <a href="great%20chamber">great chamber</a>, furnished with a fireplace. In the south-west corner of the room was a door to a small room which was perhaps used as a safe. The ground floor was used as a cellar, through which the Carrickfergus Tower could be accessed. The polygonal tower was also accessible through the great chamber at first floor level. Fitted with latrines and a fireplace, it was an extension of the lordly accommodation provided by the great chamber.

Montagu Tower in the south-east corner was probably built by John Neville, Lord Montagu, in the 15th¬†century. Fitted with latrines and fireplaces, the upper floors provided accommodation, most likely for the more important members of the household. By the 16th¬†century, the ground floor was used as a stable. The buildings against the south curtain wall between Montagu Tower and the gatehouse are of unknown purpose. North of Montagu Tower, against the east curtain wall, are the ruins of stables which stood two storeys high. West of the stables was a wellhouse containing a stone-lined well some deep. The Grey Mare's Tail Tower, probably built in the 1290s, has a slit in each of its five faces, offering views along the curtain wall.

Goodall described Warkworth's keep as "a masterpiece of medieval English architecture". Built in the last quarter of the 14th¬†century, it was probably designed by <a href="John%20Lewyn">John Lewyn</a>. It was laid out in the form of a <a href="Greek%20cross">Greek cross</a> and originally it was crested with a battlement, and perhaps decorative statues. Around the top of the building survive carvings of angels carrying shields. A large lion representing the Percy's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> overlooked the town from the north side of the keep. The lion and sculptures were probably originally painted and would have stood out from the rest of the building. Archaeologist Oliver Creighton suggests that the rebuilding of the keep and other reconstruction work were meant to suggest the enduring lordship of the owners. On top of the keep is a lookout tower, which would have been less prominent before the keep's roof was removed.

Goodall suggests that the keep was used only for short periods, and the west range, including the great hall, was the lord's preferred residence for prolonged visits to Warkworth Castle. The ground floor was used predominantly for storage of food and wine, but there was also a room with access to a basement chamber roughly square. This has variously been interpreted as an accounting room with a floor safe, or guardroom with a dungeon dug into the floor. In the keep's west wall was a <a href="postern">postern</a> through which stores would pass into the building. Kitchens occupied the west side of the first floor and were connected via staircases to the stores immediately below. In the south-east corner was a great hall, originally heated by a central hearth and spanning the height of the first and second floors. A chapel off the great hall led to a large formal room where the lord would meet guests. The second floor was entirely domestic in nature, with bedrooms and withdrawing chambers. In the 19th¬†century, while the rest of Warkworth Castle was in ruins, the rooms of the second floor were re-roofed and occasionally used by the duke on visits. At the centre of the keep was a <a href="lightwell">lightwell</a> with interior windows; at its foot was a tank for <a href="rainwater%20harvesting%20in%20the%20UK">collecting rainwater</a> used for cleaning.

Xeromphalina setulipes

Xeromphalina setulipes is a species of fungus of the family <a href="Mycenaceae">Mycenaceae</a>. First collected in 2005, it was described and <a href="Validly%20published%20name%20%28botany%29">named</a> in 2010 by Fernando Esteve-Ravent√≥s and Gabriel Moreno, and is known only from <a href="oak">oak</a> forests in <a href="Ciudad%20Real%20Province">Ciudad Real Province</a>, Spain. The species produces <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s with dark reddish-brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> up to across, dark purplish-brown <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> up to in height and distinctive, arched, brown <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>. The mushrooms were found growing directly from the <a href="acidic%20soil">acidic soil</a> of the <a href="forest%20floor">forest floor</a>, surrounded by <a href="detritus">plant waste</a>, during November.

<a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">Morphologically</a>, the dark colour of the gills and stem, lack of a strong taste, and characters of the <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> (large <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> found on the mushrooms) are the most distinguishing characteristics of "X.¬†setulipes". These features allow the species to be readily distinguished from other, similar species, including "<a href="Xeromphalina%20cauticinalis">X.¬†cauticinalis</a>" and "<a href="Xeromphalina%20brunneola">X.¬†brunneola</a>". Its ecology and habitat are also distinct, but it is unclear whether they can serve as certain identifying characteristics. Within the genus "<a href="Xeromphalina">Xeromphalina</a>", "X.¬†setulipes" is classified in the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Mutabiles", along with several other species. It seems most closely related to "<a href="Xeromphalina%20fraxinophila">X.¬†fraxinophila</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20cornui">X.¬†cornui</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20campanelloides">X.¬†campanelloides</a>" and "X.¬†cauticinalis", but, according to Esteve-Ravent√≥s and colleagues, further analysis is required to accurately judge the relationships between the species of "Xeromphalina".

"Xeromphalina setulipes" was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 2010 in an article in "<a href="Mycological%20Progress">Mycological Progress</a>" by Fernando Esteve-Ravent√≥s and Gabriel Moreno, both of the <a href="University%20of%20Alcal%C3%A1">University of Alcal√°</a>. The description was based on specimens collected during 2005 field work in <a href="Ciudad%20Real%20Province">Ciudad Real Province</a>, Spain. The <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was collected on 17 November, and was found above sea level. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "setulipes" is from the Latin "<a href="wikt%3Asetula">setula</a>", meaning "stiff hair", and "<a href="wikt%3Apes">pes</a>", meaning "foot", in reference to the bristly hairs that cover the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>.

Within "Xeromphalina", "X.¬†setulipes" is part of the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Mutabiles", which also contains "<a href="Xeromphalina%20campanelloides">X.¬†campanelloides</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20cauticinalis">X.¬†cauticinalis</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20cirris">X.¬†cirris</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20cornui">X.¬†cornui</a>", and "<a href="Xeromphalina%20fraxinophila">X.¬†fraxinophila</a>". <a href="phylogenetics">Phylogenetic analysis</a> performed by Esteve-Ravent√≥s and colleagues concluded that "X.¬†setulipes" appears to be most closely related to "X.¬†fraxinophila", "X.¬†cornui", "X.¬†campanelloides" and "X.¬†cauticinalis", the five of which are clearly separate from the group containing "<a href="Xeromphalina%20campanella">X.¬†campanella</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20kauffmanii">X.¬†kauffmanii</a>", "<a href="Xeromphalina%20brunneola">X.¬†brunneola</a>", and, possibly, "<a href="Xeromphalina%20junipericola">X.¬†junipericola</a>". Data from the large subunit (<a href="Eukaryotic%20Large%20Ribosomal%20Subunit%20%2860S%29">60S</a>) of the nuclear <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> gene suggests that the species is most closely related to "X.¬†campanelloides", while <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> (ITS) data place it closest to a <a href="clade">clade</a> containing "X.¬†cauticinalis" and "X."¬†<a href="aff.">aff.</a>¬†"parvibulbosa" (an unidentified species similar, but not identical, to "X.¬†parvibulbosa"). Further research, analysing the ITS or <a href="RPB2">RPB2</a> <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">loci</a>, could serve to help clarify the precise relationships of species and positions of clades within the genus.

"Xeromphalina setulipes" produces <a href="basidiocarp">basidiocarp</a>s in the form of <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s. Each mushroom has a flattened-convex <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of between in diameter with a depressed centre. It is not particularly <a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a> (it does not change color as it loses or absorbs water), and, unlike the caps of related species, is neither grooved nor translucent at the margin. The cap is dark brown, sometimes with reddish colouration. It becomes paler, turning <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>-brown, when it dries; this change is more noticeable at the cap margin. The caps of young mushrooms are smooth and hairless, but they wrinkle as they age; however, fine, soft hairs are sometimes visible towards the margin (which is rolled inwards) when the cap is dry. The margin is typically not smooth; instead, it undulates.

The cylindrical stem measures between in length by in width, though it is slightly thicker at the very bottom. It is stiff, but can be somewhat flexible. The colour is a dark brown, sometimes approaching black, with purplish hints. It appears smooth, but is actually covered in minute tufts. The hairs at the base of the stem are somewhat more visible, and are an amber colour. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are subdistant (neither close to, nor distant from, one another) and are of a distinctive shape; they are decurrent, that is, they extend down the stem, and are noticeably arched. The gills can be up to thick, and sometimes split into two. The gills are a tobacco-brown no matter the age of the mushroom, though the edges can be paler (sometimes whitish) and <a href="wiktionary%3Acrenulate">crenulate</a>. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is firm but flexible, and the same colour as the surface. It has an indistinct smell, and a taste that is not bitter.

"Xeromphalina setulipes" has smooth, <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> to somewhat <a href="cylindrical">cylindrical</a> spores that measure from 5.0 to 7.3 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s (Œºm) by 2.9 to 3.7¬†Œºm. They are <a href="Amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>, meaning that they <a href="staining">stain</a> a dark colour in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> or <a href="Lugol%27s%20solution">Lugol's solution</a>, and have thin <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>s. The four-spored (occasionally two-spored) <a href="basidia">basidia</a> are shaped like narrow clubs, sometimes approaching cylindrical, and measure between 21 and 30¬†Œºm long by 4.5 to 5.5¬†Œºm wide. The <a href="sterigma">sterigma</a>ta, the narrow prongs that connect the spores to the basidia, can measure up to 3¬†Œºm in length. The edge of the gill is primarily made up of cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the gill edge) but there are also some basidia. The <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) cheilocystidia have an irregular, sometimes vaguely cylindrical shape, and measure between 30 and 80¬†Œºm by 3 to 7¬†Œºm. They are packed together, extending outwards from the gill in a manner reminiscent of <a href="coral">coral</a>, as is sometimes seen in members of the genus "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>". The abundant caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) project prominently, and are visible to the naked eye as the minute hairs on the stem. They measure between 30 and 60¬†Œºm by 5 to 10¬†Œºm. They are swollen in the middle, tapering at each end, but are irregular in shape and are often curved. The particularly thick cell walls can be as much as 2.5¬†Œºm wide. The caulocystidia are yellowish-brown. There are a large number of circumcystidia (cystidia found on the margin of the cap), which are similar to the cheilocystidia. They typically have thick cell walls, and numerous projections of various sorts grow from their sides. The circumcystidia form a mass reminiscent of coral.

The flesh in the gills is composed of cylindrical <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e measuring between 4 and 8¬†Œºm thick that run parallel to one another. The hyphae typically have fairly thin, smooth walls, but they can have a small amount of brown <a href="pigment">pigment</a>, which stains orange-brown in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>. The <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>, the uppermost layer of hyphae in the cap, forms a <a href="Pileipellis%23Cutis">cutis</a> made up of cylindrical, slightly thicker-walled hyphae of between 5 and 10¬†Œºm wide. They can be interwoven or primarily extending from the margin to the centre. The pigmentation is yellowish-brown and stains reddish-brown in potassium hydroxide. The hyphae below the pileipellis run parallel to one another and measure between 4 and 8¬†Œºm in width. Their yellowish-brown pigment stains orange-brown in potassium hydroxide. The <a href="stipitipellis">stipitipellis</a>, the uppermost layer of hyphae on the stem, also forms a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae run parallel to one another and have thick cell walls. They have a dark red-brown pigment, which stains darker still in potassium hydroxide. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present.

"Xeromphalina setulipes" shows some similarities to "X.¬†cauticinalis". They share the amber-coloured hair towards the base of the stem and both grow on soil, as opposed to directly onto wood. Further, "X.¬†cauticinalis" can display caulocystidia of the same distinctive shape as those of "X.¬†setulipes" (though these are mixed with the other shapes more typical of the genus). "X.¬†cauticinalis" mushrooms are typically of a different colour; for instance, the area at the top of the stem is paler than the rest, compared to the entirely dark stem of "X.¬†setulipes". Furthermore, "X.¬†cauticinalis" has a very bitter taste. "X.¬†setulipes" shares with "X.¬†brunneola" its dark colouration and some microscopic traits. However, the two clearly differ in the shape of both the cheilocystidia and the pileocystidia, the width of the spores (the spores of "X.¬†brunneola" measure between 2 and 3¬†Œºm in width) and the fact it is found specifically in <a href="softwood">softwood</a> woodland. Furthermore, the two do not appear to be closely related.

Other species within "Mutabiles" include "X.¬†campanelloides", which can be differentiated by the shape of the thin-walled caulocystidia and yellow flesh in the stem. "X.¬†cornui" grows in softwood forests with "<a href="Sphagnum">Sphagnum</a>" moss. Both the cap and the top of stem sport yellow grains. "X.¬†fraxinophila" produces larger mushrooms and has yellow gills. "X.¬†parvibulbosa", while potentially featuring similar caulocystidia to "X.¬†setulipes", has a bitter or sour taste.

"Xeromphalina setulipes" is only known from the <a href="type%20location%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> in the <a href="province%20of%20Ciudad%20Real">province of Ciudad Real</a>, Spain. Members of the <a href="Mycenaceae">Mycenaceae</a> are <a href="saprotrophic">saprotrophic</a>, and "X.¬†setulipes" was found in woodland made up of <a href="Quercus%20suber">cork oak</a> ("Quercus suber") and <a href="Quercus%20faginea">Portuguese oak</a> ("Quercus faginea"), with undergrowth consisting of <a href="gum%20rockrose">gum rockrose</a> ("Cistus ladanifer"), <a href="Juniperus%20oxycedrus">prickly juniper</a> ("Juniperus oxycedrus"), and various <a href="Erica">heathers</a> ("Erica" species). The mushrooms were growing in clusters on the <a href="forest%20floor">forest floor</a> from <a href="acid%20soil">acid soil</a>, surrounded by dead plant matter. The species's ecological patterns may be useful identifying characteristics, distinct from other, similar species. The mushrooms were found in autumn, and collected in November.

2011 U.S. Open Cup Final

The 2011 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final was a <a href="association%20football">soccer</a> match between the <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders FC</a> and the <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20Soccer%20Club">Chicago Fire</a>, played on October 4, 2011, at <a href="CenturyLink%20Field">CenturyLink Field</a> in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington. The match was the culmination of the <a href="2011%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2011 U.S. Open Cup</a>, a tournament open to amateur and professional soccer teams affiliated with the <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a> (U.S. Soccer). This was the 98th edition of the <a href="Lamar%20Hunt%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">U.S. Open Cup</a>, the oldest ongoing competition in American soccer. The Seattle Sounders FC won by defeating the Chicago Fire 2‚Äì0 with goals scored by <a href="Fredy%20Montero">Fredy Montero</a> and <a href="Osvaldo%20Alonso">Osvaldo Alonso</a>. The attendance was 36,615, breaking the record for the final set the previous year when Seattle also won and hosted. Seattle became the first team since 1968 to win three consecutive U.S. Open Cup championships and the fourth team ever to do so in the 98-year history of the tournament.

Sounders FC automatically qualified for the third round of the U.S. Open Cup tournament by finishing among the top six in the <a href="2010%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2010 Major League Soccer season</a>. The Fire did not automatically qualify, and had to play through two <a href="2011%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20qualification">qualification rounds</a> before entering the official tournament. Prior to the final, Chicago and Seattle had met twice in 2011, with Seattle winning one game and the other ending in a draw.

The final was televised live on <a href="Fox%20Soccer">Fox Soccer</a>. This was the second consecutive year the tournament final was played at CenturyLink Field. As the winner of the tournament, Seattle earned a berth in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2012‚Äì13 CONCACAF Champions League</a> and received a $100,000 cash prize. Chicago received a $50,000 prize as the runner-up. Following the final, criticism was raised regarding Seattle winning hosting rights for each round they played. In response, U.S. Soccer announced changes to the rules for determining the host of tournament matches.

The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all U.S. Soccer affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). The 2011 tournament was the 98th edition of the oldest soccer tournament in the United States.

The MLS, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, was allowed to enter eight of its fifteen U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the <a href="2010%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">previous season's</a> league standings qualified automatically for the tournament, while the remaining two spots were determined by <a href="2011%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20qualification">preliminary qualification matches</a>. The eight MLS entries began play in the third round of the tournament. In 2010, Seattle Sounders FC finished among the top six in the MLS overall league standings to qualify for the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup. The Chicago Fire however, did not and therefore had to play a series of qualification matches against fellow MLS teams that finished outside of the top six to qualify for the Open Cup tournament.

Prior to reaching the 2011 final, the Chicago Fire had reached the U.S. Open Cup final five times in their 14-year history, the most of any MLS franchise, winning four out of five of the tournaments‚Äìmost recently in 2006. The Fire began their 2011 Open Cup campaign on March 30, 2011, in the MLS qualification semifinals, hosting the <a href="Colorado%20Rapids">Colorado Rapids</a> at <a href="Shea%20Stadium%20%28Peoria%2C%20Illinois%29">Shea Stadium</a> in <a href="Peoria%2C%20Illinois">Peoria, Illinois</a>. Chicago scored first with a goal from <a href="Gast%C3%B3n%20Puerari">Gast√≥n Puerari</a> right before half time. Just one minute into the second half, the Rapids equalized with a goal from <a href="Andre%20Akpan">Andre Akpan</a>. Following Akpan's goal, the match remained tied for 15 minutes until Chicago's <a href="Jalil%20Anibaba">Jalil Anibaba</a> scored the match-winning goal in the 61st minute of play. Chicago moved on to the next round of qualification with a final score of 2‚Äì1.

The Fire then turned their attention to their second and final qualification match hosted by the <a href="San%20Jose%20Earthquakes">San Jose Earthquakes</a> at <a href="Buck%20Shaw%20Stadium">Buck Shaw Stadium</a> in <a href="Santa%20Clara%2C%20California">Santa Clara, California</a>. Played on May 24, 2011, in front of 4,124 spectators, the hosts took a two-goal lead in the first half with <a href="Ellis%20McLoughlin">Ellis McLoughlin</a> and <a href="Justin%20Morrow">Justin Morrow</a> scoring in the 14th and 43rd minutes, respectively. The Fire halved the deficit in the 61st minute with a goal from <a href="Orr%20Barouch">Orr Barouch</a>. Fifteen minutes later the Fire tied the score with a strike from <a href="Yamith%20Cuesta">Yamith Cuesta</a>. The score remained tied until the end of regulation, leading to <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23Association%20football">extra time</a>, during which Chicago's <a href="Gonzalo%20Segares">Gonzalo Segares</a> was <a href="Foul%20%28association%20football%29%23Red%20card%20.28dismissal.29">ejected</a> for dissent. Despite the Earthquakes' man advantage, the two sides remained tied during overtime, prompting a <a href="penalty%20shootout">penalty shootout</a>. In the fifth round of penalties, with Chicago leading 5‚Äì4, San Jose's <a href="Scott%20Sealy">Scott Sealy</a> missed his shot as it deflected off the crossbar, giving the Fire a second qualifier victory and a berth into the third round of the 2011 U.S. Open Cup tournament.

In the third round, Chicago faced the <a href="Rochester%20Rhinos">Rochester Rhinos</a> of the <a href="USL%20Pro">USL Pro</a> division. Rochester hosted the match on June 28 at the Rhinos' <a href="Marina%20Auto%20Stadium">Sahlen's Stadium</a> in front of a crowd of 5,558. The Fire's <a href="Diego%20Ch%C3%A1ves">Diego Ch√°ves</a> netted the match's only goal in the 37th minute of play, earning the Fire a spot in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2008.

In the quarterfinals, held on July 12, 2011, the Fire hosted MLS <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28MLS%29">Eastern Conference</a> rival the <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a> at <a href="Toyota%20Park%20%28Bridgeview%29">Toyota Park</a> in <a href="Bridgeview%2C%20Illinois">Bridgeview, Illinois</a>. Against mostly <a href="MLS%20Reserve%20League">reserves</a> for New York, the Fire won the match 4‚Äì0 with two goals from Orr Barouch and a goal each scored by <a href="Dominic%20Oduro">Dominic Oduro</a> and <a href="Yamith%20Cuesta">Yamith Cuesta</a>. Due to power outages in the area following a severe thunderstorm, the game's start time was moved up from 7:30¬†pm to 5:00¬†pm local time, resulting in a late-arriving attendance of about 2,000. Following the match, uproar from Red Bull fans prompted coach <a href="Hans%20Backe">Hans Backe</a> to explain that fatigue was the reason for sending only his team's reserve players and an assistant coach to Chicago. New York had lost to DC United in league play just 2 days earlier.

On August 31, 2011, the Fire played host to another USL Pro side, the <a href="Richmond%20Kickers">Richmond Kickers</a>, in the semifinal round. On their way to the semifinals, the Kickers defeated two MLS teams in consecutive rounds. They upset the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a> and <a href="Sporting%20Kansas%20City">Sporting Kansas City</a> in the third round and the quarterfinals, respectively. The semifinal was hosted by the Fire at Toyota Park in front of a crowd of 8,909. In the 32nd minute, the Fire took the lead with a goal from <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Grazzini">Sebasti√°n Grazzini</a>. In the 61st minute, Chicago went up 2‚Äì0 with a goal from Dominic Oduro. Seven minutes later, the Kickers cut the lead in half with a goal from <a href="Yomby%20William">Yomby William</a>. The Fire won 2‚Äì1, earning their sixth trip to the U.S. Open Cup final.

In 2009, Seattle Sounders FC became the second MLS <a href="Expansion%20team">expansion club</a> to win the <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">U.S. Open Cup tournament</a>, after the Chicago Fire in 1998. They defended their title in 2010 to win a second straight championship. Prior to the final, Sounders FC played U.S. Open Cup home games at the <a href="Starfire%20Sports%20Complex">Starfire Sports Complex</a> in <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila, Washington</a>. The facility is smaller than the club's home stadium for league matches, <a href="CenturyLink%20Field">CenturyLink Field</a>, but Sounders FC representatives preferred the atmosphere at Starfire for smaller cup matches.

Sounders FC began the defense of their title on June 28, 2011, when they hosted the <a href="Kitsap%20Pumas">Kitsap Pumas</a> of the <a href="USL%20Premier%20Development%20League">USL Premier Development League</a> from <a href="Bremerton%2C%20Washington">Bremerton, Washington</a>. The match was played at Starfire in front of 3,811 fans. Seattle took the lead in the 39th minute when <a href="Michael%20Fucito">Michael Fucito</a> scored off a headed pass from <a href="Nate%20Jaqua">Nate Jaqua</a>. Early in the second half Fucito doubled the lead by taking a pass from <a href="Mike%20Seamon">Mike Seamon</a> and shooting past several defenders for the goal. Kitsap attempted their comeback in the 71st minute when <a href="Nikolas%20Besagno">Nikolas Besagno</a> scored from a crossing pass from Robert Christner. In the 83rd minute, Kitsap forward Warlen Silva nearly equalized on a breakaway run, but his shot went into the side netting. Seattle was able to hold on for the 2‚Äì1 victory.
Seattle then hosted their quarterfinal match on July 13 against a fellow MLS side, the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Galaxy">Los Angeles Galaxy</a>. The match was again held at Starfire, with an attendance of 4,322. Nate Jaqua scored following a pass from <a href="Pat%20Noonan">Pat Noonan</a> in the 4th minute. In the 25th minute, <a href="Fredy%20Montero">Fredy Montero</a> scored with a left-footed shot from an assist from Jaqua giving Seattle a 2‚Äì0 lead. The Galaxy gained a goal back in the 40th minute when <a href="Adam%20Cristman">Adam Cristman</a> scored on a cross from <a href="Chris%20Birchall">Chris Birchall</a>. In the 74th minute, Seattle midfielder <a href="Lamar%20Neagle">Lamar Neagle</a> scored from a cross by <a href="%C3%81lvaro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">√Ålvaro Fern√°ndez</a>, extending Seattle's lead to 2 goals.

On August 30, 2011, Sounders FC hosted their semifinal opponent, <a href="FC%20Dallas">FC Dallas</a>, in front of 4,593 at Starfire Sports Complex. Both teams started their first team players for the match. Seattle applied offensive pressure for most of the first half and broke through with a goal in the 40th minute. Fredy Montero, who had just missed with a <a href="bicycle%20kick">bicycle kick</a> shot moments earlier, took a curling left-footed shot in front of goal for the score. Dallas nearly equalized in the 49th minute when <a href="Marvin%20Chavez">Marvin Chavez</a> had a shot bounce hard off the <a href="goal%20post">goal post</a>. Dallas continued to attack for most of the second half, and Chavez again had a chance to equalize just before the final whistle, but his shot went high over the goal. With a final score of 1‚Äì0, Seattle secured their third straight appearance in the U.S. Open Cup final match. Following the match, Dallas coach <a href="Schellas%20Hyndman">Schellas Hyndman</a> complained about how hosts are determined for U.S. Open Cup matches saying, "for me, this is one of the best events ‚Äì the Lamar Hunt Open Cup ‚Äì but I'd really like to see it into a structure where it's not a bid system. A bid system is where one team will buy the games because they're bidding higher." He continued, "it could go to the higher seeds, instead of a bid system where you're spending money, or it could be pre-determined. I think that brings out all the fairness to the event."

On August 26, 2011, U.S. Soccer announced the potential sites for the final, depending on the outcome of the semifinals. It was determined through a blind bid process that if Seattle qualified for the final, they would host it at CenturyLink Field regardless of the opponent, for the second straight year. If FC Dallas defeated Sounders FC in the semifinals, they would host the Richmond Kickers at <a href="Pizza%20Hut%20Park">Pizza Hut Park</a> in <a href="Frisco%2C%20Texas">Frisco, Texas</a>, or visit the <a href="Chicago%20Fire%20Soccer%20Club">Chicago Fire</a> at Toyota Park in <a href="Bridgeview%2C%20Illinois">Bridgeview, Illinois</a>, depending on the outcome of the other semifinal match. Seattle defeated Dallas and Chicago defeated Richmond in the semifinals, which resulted in Sounders FC hosting the Fire in the 2011 Open Cup final at CenturyLink Field. Seattle had hosted the previous final, in 2010, drawing a crowd of 31,311 and breaking the 81-year-old attendance record for the event set in <a href="1929%20National%20Challenge%20Cup">1929</a> when <a href="New%20York%20Hakoah">New York Hakoah</a> defeated the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Madison%20Kennel">Madison Kennel Club of St. Louis</a>.

Tickets for the 2011 final went on sale to the public on September 6. By September 19, it was announced that 27,000 tickets had already been sold. Nine days later, ticket sales surpassed 30,000 and it was announced that the "Hawks Nest" <a href="bleacher">bleacher</a> seats in the north end of CenturyLink Field would be made available for the event. In the week leading up to the final, Sounders FC owner and general manager Adrian Hanauer indicated that sections of the stadium would continue to be opened to meet demand. He stated that "no paying customer would be turned away."

With a better MLS regular season record and home field advantage, Sounders FC were the favorites to win the match; however, the Fire had improved throughout the year through better play from their <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29%23Winger">wingers</a> and <a href="midfielders">midfielders</a>.

Seattle and Chicago had met twice in MLS regular season matches in 2011. The first meeting, on April 9, 2011, resulted in a 2‚Äì1 win for Sounders FC in front of their home crowd. It was Seattle's 5th game of the season. The second meeting was hosted by Chicago on June 4, 2011, and resulted in a 0‚Äì0 draw. It was the first game for Chicago coach <a href="Frank%20Klopas">Frank Klopas</a> as he replaced <a href="Carlos%20de%20los%20Cobos">Carlos de los Cobos</a>, who was fired by the club the previous week. As a player, Klopas had scored the winning goal for Chicago in the <a href="1998%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">1998 U.S. Open Cup final</a>. As coach, "ESPNChicago.com" analyst Charlie Corr credited him with the team's successful shift in tactics since previously meeting Seattle.

In the days leading up to the final, Seattle had recently finished a long road trip. Chicago's schedule made the match their third in a week's time. In preparation for the final, the managers fielded weaker sides during their respective league matches two days before the game, allowing them to rest several regular starters. The Sounders were playing well, having already clinched a <a href="2011%20MLS%20Cup%20Playoffs">MLS playoff</a> berth. A victory over the <a href="New%20England%20Revolution">New England Revolution</a> on the weekend prior to the final gave the team a three-game winning streak. The Fire had defeated <a href="Real%20Salt%20Lake">Real Salt Lake</a> on September 28, but their playoff chances were diminished after a tie against the <a href="Houston%20Dynamo">Houston Dynamo</a> on the weekend prior to the final.

The match was televised live on <a href="Fox%20Soccer">Fox Soccer</a> with coverage starting at 7¬†pm <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">PT</a> (02:00¬†<a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>). The attendance of 36,615 was a record crowd for the competition's final. Seattle's <a href="Emerald%20City%20Supporters">Emerald City Supporters</a> unveiled <a href="tifo">tifo</a> before kickoff depicting the <a href="Grim%20Reaper">Grim Reaper</a> over the graves of <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a>, the Columbus Crew, and the Chicago Fire.

Injuries to key players were a concern for both teams in the buildup to the final. For Seattle, midfielder <a href="Mauro%20Rosales">Mauro Rosales</a>'s knee was injured and he did not recover in time for the final. Also, Sounders FC defender <a href="James%20Riley%20%28soccer%29">James Riley</a> was recovering from a concussion. He practiced in the week prior to the final and started in the match. For Chicago, midfielder Sebastian Grazzini was a key player who was questionable before the match. Grazzini began the game on the bench for Chicago.

The match started with a frenetic pace as both teams earned free kick attempts within the opening two minutes. Seattle forward Mike Fucito had the first goal scoring opportunity of the match in the eighth minute as he broke free in the penalty area and took a shot on goal. The shot was kicked away by Fire goalkeeper Sean Johnson. Neither side appeared to gain control as the match progressed through the first 10 minutes. In the 11th minute, Chicago midfielder Marco Pappa slipped between two defenders in the middle of the field and had a long range shot go just wide of the net. Two minutes later Pappa again had a long shot which forced Seattle goalkeeper Kasey Keller to make a save. Pappa was responsible for all five of his team's shots in the first half. In the 26th minute, Patrick Nyarko was shown a <a href="Penalty%20card%23Yellow%20card">yellow card</a> by referee Alex Prus for a hard tackle on Seattle's Osvaldo Alonso near the <a href="touch-line">touch-line</a>.

As the match passed the 30 minute mark, Seattle began to take control as they held possession and created more scoring opportunities. Five minutes before half time Marco Pappa again tested the Seattle goalkeeper as he cut inside a defender and took a shot from 30 yards. The shot forced Kasey Keller to make a diving save. In the 44th minute Seattle striker Mike Fucito rushed onto a poor backpass by the Chicago defense and then backhealed a pass to Alvaro Fernandez who was streaking into the box. His shot was stopped with a reaching save by Chicago goalkeeper Sean Johnson. One minute later, in first half injury time, Seattle striker Fredy Montero nearly scored with a 20-yard shot that flew past the keeper and bounced off the left goal post. The half ended with the score tied 0‚Äì0.

At half time, Seattle midfielder Erik Frieberg was subbed on for Alvaro Fernandez, who had suffered a slight concussion during the first half. Shortly after the second half began, Seattle nearly broke the stalemate. In the 53rd minute, a Sounders FC <a href="throw-in">throw-in</a> was flicked on to Mike Fucito, who lifted a shot up and over the keeper. His shot was chased by several Chicago defenders as it crossed the <a href="Association%20football%20pitch%23Goals">goal mouth</a> and bounced off the far <a href="goal%20post">goal post</a> and back into play. In the 78th minute, Montero broke the deadlock on a <a href="corner%20kick">corner kick</a> taken by Erik Friberg. Sounders FC defender Jeff Parke headed the corner kick on goal and Chicago goalkeeper Sean Johnson saved the shot. The ball <a href="Rebound%20%28sports%29">rebounded</a> to the feet of Fredy Montero, who tapped the ball into the net for in the first goal of the game. Sounders FC now had a 1‚Äì0 lead.

For much of the first half and early second half, Sounders FC's defensive efforts had been focused on closely defending Chicago midfield P√°vel Pardo. With Pardo unable to distribute the ball to Chicago's speedy wingers, Patrick Nyarko and Domonic Oduro, Chicago's offense had been effectively neutralized for much of the match. Fire coach Frank Klopas made two substitutions late in the match, bringing on forward Diego Chaves in the 80th minute and midfielder Sebasti√°n Grazzini in the 85th. Chicago's best chance of the half came in the 90th minute when Dominic Oduro headed a shot toward Kasey Keller, who made the save even though the attempt was ruled offside.
As the match neared its conclusion, Chicago shifted players forward as they searched for an equalizing goal. However, in the sixth minute of <a href="stoppage%20time">stoppage time</a>, Osvaldo Alonso scored Seattle's second goal on a counterattack play as he dribbled around multiple defenders and the goalkeeper and finally tapped the ball into the net. The goal gave Sounders FC a 2‚Äì0 lead and sealed the victory.

Most of the record crowd remained after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying "We talked about making sure their defenders ‚Äì and primarily P√°vel Pardo ‚Äì didn‚Äôt have a chance to lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." Schmid continued, "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he did a very good job of stepping up to P√°vel. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion that he was able to hit a ball behind our defense." Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, "It‚Äôs disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They‚Äôre a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately."

The day after the match, Sounders FC flew a scarf over Seattle and Bellevue in the afternoon and early evening respectively, in celebration of their victory. By winning the final, Sounders FC became the first MLS team to win the competition three times in a row, and the first club to do so in the competition since <a href="Greek%20American%20AA">Greek American Atlas</a> did so in <a href="1968%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">1968</a>, 42 years earlier. Seattle also became the fourth team in the 98-year history of the tournament to win three in a row. As U.S. Open Cup champions, Seattle received the $100,000 cash prize while Chicago was given $50,000 as the runner up. Seattle also earned a berth in the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2012‚Äì13 CONCACAF Champions League</a> with the victory. In the Champions League, Seattle won their group and were eventually knocked out of the tournament in the semifinals by Mexican club <a href="Santos%20Laguna">Santos Laguna</a>.

Sounders FC midfielder Osvaldo Alonso was voted the "player of the round" for the final. Alonso was recognized for his goal scoring effort as well as his record-setting fourth consecutive appearance as a player in the U.S. Open Cup final match. He had appeared first with the <a href="Charleston%20Battery">Charleston Battery</a> in the 2008 final and then 3 times with Seattle from 2009 to 2011. Seattle forward Fredy Montero was recognized as the "player of the tournament" as he scored the game winning goals for Sounders FC in their quarterfinal, semifinal, and final matches. Osvaldo Alonso was one of the four finalists for "player of the tournament" along with Montero and two players from the semifinalist Richmond Kickers‚Äì<a href="Ronnie%20Pascale">Ronnie Pascale</a> and <a href="David%20Bulow">David Bulow</a>.

U.S. Soccer was criticized after the match for the secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights. Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches and the manner in which MLS teams qualified for the tournament were widely criticized. An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder <a href="Daniel%20Hernandez%20%28soccer%29">Daniel Hernandez</a> on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, where he complained about Seattle's <a href="home-field%20advantage">home-field advantage</a> throughout the 2011 tournament. Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, "I don‚Äôt think the bidding process is going to change the profile of the tournament, necessarily. It might make a few people happy, it might make a few people unhappy. But ultimately, I‚Äôm not convinced that‚Äôs what is going to raise the profile."

In January 2012, in preparation for the <a href="2012%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2012 edition</a> of the U.S. Open Cup, U.S. Soccer announced several changes to the tournament format. Included in these changes was the introduction of a new host selection process. Beginning in 2012, for all rounds of the tournament through the quarterfinals, a random host selection process would be used. While in previous years a blind bidding system was used to determine the host of a match, the new process has the host determined by blind draw if both teams' venues meet minimum standards. The blind bidding system for hosting rights remained in effect for the semifinals and final of the 2012 tournament. However, U.S. Soccer announced in 2013 that hosting for all rounds of the tournament would be determined randomly as long as both venues met minimum standards.

December 1969 nor'easter

The December 1969 nor'easter was a strong winter storm that mainly affected the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern United States</a> and southern <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> between December 25 and December 28, 1969. The multi-faceted storm system included a <a href="tornado">tornado</a> outbreak, record snow accumulations, a damaging <a href="ice%20storm">ice storm</a>, and flooding rains.

The storm developed over <a href="Texas">Texas</a> by December 25 and advanced eastward, spawning over a dozen tornadoes in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Upon reaching the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Eastern Seaboard</a>, the cyclone turned northeastward and intensified into a powerful <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a>. On December 26 and 27, the storm's forward movement slowed to a drift, causing very heavy snow over <a href="Upstate%20New%20York">Upstate New York</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, and southern Quebec. Warm onshore winds, caused by a storm track close to the shore, allowed precipitation to change to sleet and rain in central and eastern New England. Where precipitation remained as snow, accumulations reached or more, crippling travel. Drifts up to high blocked roadways, isolating some communities and forcing emergency workers to rely on <a href="snowmobiles">snowmobiles</a> for transportation. At least 20 fatalities were attributed to the storm in New York and New England.

In central New England, a severe freezing rain event occurred along the boundary between cold air to the west and warmer air to the east. Several inches of <a href="glaze%20ice">glaze ice</a>, accompanied by gale-force winds, caused damage comparable to the aftermath of the <a href="1938%20New%20England%20hurricane">1938 New England hurricane</a>. Throughout the region, the snow and ice‚Äîin some cases further weighted by heavy rainfall‚Äîcaused roofs to cave in. <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> received of snow in that city's biggest snowstorm on record at the time; officials blamed the storm for 15 deaths in Quebec. In eastern New England, <a href="ice%20jam">ice jam</a>s, poor drainage, and several inches of rain caused flooding that forced people from their homes and submerged roadways. Wind gusts to and strong waves battered the coastline.

The winter of 1969‚Äì1970 continued a long-term <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Ni√±o</a> from the previous winter, which featured two significant storms in the Northeastern United States, including the <a href="February%201969%20nor%27easter">"Lindsay storm"</a> in February. <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Oscillation">North Atlantic Oscillation</a> (NAO) values ranged from weakly negative to weakly positive in the period leading up to the storm, trending more consistently negative in the days surrounding its genesis. NAO values dropped significantly in the wake of the nor'easter, signaling abnormally cold temperatures during January 1970. December 1969 was a month of active weather throughout the Northeast, with frequent light to moderate snow events preceding the late-month nor'easter. A significant storm on December 22‚Äì23 dropped of snow in eastern New York and northern New England, as well as significant freezing rain in southern and eastern New England. Many of the same areas would be impacted again just days later.

Before the cyclone's arrival, a <a href="high-pressure%20area">high-pressure area</a> situated north of <a href="New%20England">New England</a> funneled very cold air into the region; the air temperature at <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a>, on December 25 still holds the record for the city's coldest December temperature. On December 25 and 26, extensive <a href="cold%20air%20damming">cold air damming</a> and <a href="frontogenesis">frontogenesis</a> occurred along the U.S. East Coast. The high-pressure area slowly retreated as the storm approached.
The nor'easter originated in a weak area of <a href="low-pressure%20area">surface low pressure</a> that formed over northern Texas by December 25. It moved generally eastward over the next day as it crossed the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a>. A southerly <a href="Low%20level%20jet">low-level jet</a> (a localized wind stream in the lower levels of the atmosphere) developed by midday over <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> and <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, and drifted eastward. Precipitation soon blossomed, with heavy snow falling over the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> by late on December 25. The low turned toward the northeast by early on December 26 to follow the temperature gradient along the East Coast, at which time the storm underwent the first of two periods of rapid intensification. In 12 hours, barometric pressure fell 12 hPa to while the nor'easter accelerated from <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to the coast of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. This bout of strengthening occurred as the associated upper-level <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> at the 500-millibar level¬†‚Äì several miles into the atmosphere¬†‚Äì assumed a negative tilt from northwest to southeast. Heavy precipitation overspread the Mid-Atlantic and New England early on December 26.

The low-level jet continued to strengthen and delivered warm air to areas east of the storm center, where precipitation quickly transitioned to rain. The jet ultimately reached extremely high velocities of as it wrapped around the northern side of the low, feeding abundant moisture into areas of heavy precipitation. The storm slowed drastically on December 26, and over the next 24 hours, it moved very slowly from <a href="Cape%20May%2C%20New%20Jersey">Cape May, New Jersey</a>, to near <a href="Boston">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. During this period, exceptionally heavy snow fell over eastern New York, Vermont, and southern Quebec. While located just east of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a> on December 27, the nor'easter began its second phase of rapid strengthening that brought central pressure down to . During this period of intensification, snow propagated around the western side of the system, reaching as far south as Long Island.

With a storm track very close to the shore and a retreating high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A <a href="weather%20front">frontal boundary</a> between the warm Atlantic air and a residual wedge of colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe <a href="ice%20storm">ice storm</a> in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed <a href="cold-core%20low">cold-core low</a>. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.

The developing extratropical cyclone spawned 16 known tornadoes and waterspouts in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, becoming the largest <a href="Christmas%20Day">Christmas Day</a> tornado outbreak on record. A short-lived <a href="Fujita%20scale">F3</a> tornado touched down in <a href="Vermillion%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Vermillion Parish, Louisiana</a>, destroying eight homes near <a href="Kaplan%2C%20Louisiana">Kaplan</a> and damaging 25 more. One woman was killed and eight were injured, three severely enough to require hospitalization. Another damaging tornado moved through several settlements in southern <a href="Iberville%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Iberville Parish</a> just over two hours later; the tornado destroyed seven homes and damaged multiple other buildings, with one injury reported. The tornado was officially classified an F3, though meteorologist <a href="Thomas%20P.%20Grazulis">Thomas P. Grazulis</a> determined it to have caused damage consistent with an F2 rating. A non-tornadic wind gust destroyed a nearby trailer home. Later that day, a tornado skipped along a path through <a href="Catahoula%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Catahoula</a> and <a href="Concordia%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Concordia</a> parishes, touching down three different times. The F2 tornado damaged about 20 trailer homes in <a href="Glade%2C%20Louisiana">Glade</a>, and caused further damage near the end of its track.

A tornado in southern Georgia, about west of <a href="Albany%2C%20Georgia">Albany</a>, damaged or destroyed several small homes, killed three head of cattle, toppled numerous trees, and injured seven people. Elsewhere in the state, there were isolated reports of hail and damaging thunderstorm winds. Several tornadoes in the <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a> caused minor to moderate damage to trees and homes, the most destructive of them occurring in <a href="Quincy%2C%20Florida">Quincy, Florida</a>. That tornado struck an industrial area and unroofed at least three structures. A tornado in <a href="Lee%2C%20Florida">Lee, Florida</a>, destroyed a trailer, damaged farm buildings, and injured one person.

In addition to widespread rain, parts of northern <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> experienced freezing rain that damaged trees and power lines. Freezing rain and sleet fell over the southern <a href="Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29">Piedmont</a> of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, resulting in power outages and dangerous travel conditions. At least one fatal traffic accident was reported. Heavy snow covered the northwest Piedmont and <a href="Western%20North%20Carolina">Mountain Region</a> of the state, accumulating to around at <a href="Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheville</a>; occurring on the heels of another winter storm, this snowfall contributed to depths up to at higher elevations. High winds from the storm left at least 50,000 electric customers in the <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> region without power. In <a href="Carroll%20County%2C%20Virginia">Carroll County</a>, strong winds uprooted trees. Significant snow accumulations occurred throughout the Mid-Atlantic, chiefly away from the coastal plain. Snowfall exceeded in parts of western <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, western <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, and <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>; <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> received of snow.

The cyclone was rated by meteorology researchers <a href="Paul%20Kocin">Kocin</a> and Uccellini (2004) as a high-end Category 3 on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, equating to a "major" winter storm. However, more recent data from the <a href="National%20Climatic%20Data%20Center">National Climatic Data Center</a> classifies the nor'easter as a low-end "crippling" Category 4. By December 30, at least 20 deaths in New York and New England had been attributed to the storm, largely from traffic accidents and physical exhaustion.

Areas of northeastern <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, eastern New York, and Vermont received snowfall in excess of , including at <a href="Burlington%2C%20Vermont">Burlington</a>, at <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>, and at <a href="Binghamton%2C%20New%20York">Binghamton, New York</a>. Accumulations locally exceeded , with measured at <a href="Waitsfield%2C%20Vermont">Waitsfield, Vermont</a> and in the small village of <a href="East%20Wallingford%2C%20Vermont">East Wallingford, Vermont</a>. The storm remains one of the greatest on record in cities like Albany and Burlington, and contributed to high monthly snowfall totals; in Albany, December 1969 stands as the snowiest documented month, with . Throughout the region, the weight of the snow, combined with <a href="Beaufort%20scale">gale-force</a> winds, collapsed roofs and brought down power lines. The winds blew snow from this and previous storms into drifts as high as , blocking roads and leaving some communities isolated. In some areas, travel was only possible with snowmobiles, which were used by emergency workers to deliver emergency supplies as needed. Rescuers also used snowmobiles and aircraft to search for stranded residents and travelers. Many cities and counties throughout the Northeast issued <a href="snow%20emergencies">snow emergencies</a>. Business and industry suffered extensively in the days following the storm.

While major highways were generally cleared by December 29, some local roads reportedly remained covered for up to a month. About of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Thruway">New York State Thruway</a>‚Äînearly half its total length‚Äîwas closed for 27 hours. The snowfall also caused widespread property damage, as the roofs of barns, sheds, and other buildings caved in under the weight of the snow. An airport hangar in <a href="Oneonta%2C%20New%20York">Oneonta</a> collapsed, destroying five aircraft inside. In the aftermath of the storm, many homes sustained water damage from melting snow. "Innumerable" traffic accidents were reported, and many motorists became stranded or were forced to abandon their vehicles. Four people in a stalled automobile died of <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a>. Also in New York, one man froze to death, and three individuals were killed in a building collapse. In the <a href="Capital%20District%2C%20New%20York">Capital District</a>, the snow fell with a high water content, occasionally mixing with freezing rain. As a result, it was much denser than normal and proved difficult to manage. The City of Albany spent a record $2¬†million <a href="USD">USD</a> on snow removal, and the city restricted nearly all traffic except for vehicles necessary to maintain emergency supplies. Governor <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> closed state offices in Albany on December 29 and 30, in an effort to enable efficient snow removal. Mayor <a href="Erastus%20Corning%202nd">Erastus Corning 2nd</a> assessed the situation as a "dire emergency".

Governor <a href="Deane%20C.%20Davis">Deane C. Davis</a> of Vermont declared a state of emergency and ordered the <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues. The storm left some communities without power or telephone service for up to two days, although isolated outages persisted longer. One person died in <a href="Saxtons%20River%2C%20Vermont">Saxtons River</a>. With roads impassable in both New York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.

The influx of warm, moist air over a wedge of cold air near the surface resulted in a severe ice storm across central and northern New England, most notably in the upper <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River Valley</a>. <a href="Glaze%20ice">Glaze ice</a> thicker than , and reportedly up to thick in Vermont, built up on trees and power lines, wreaking "unbelievable" havoc. In the hardest-hit areas, damage from the ice storm was comparable to that caused by the <a href="1938%20New%20England%20hurricane">1938 New England hurricane</a>. The combined load of snow and ice caused significant damage to many residential and industrial buildings, with several factory and warehouse roofs collapsing. Livestock were killed in multiple rural building collapses throughout the area. Southern Maine endured its second damaging ice storm in a week, with many of the same communities losing power on both occasion. Precipitation also transitioned to freezing rain and sleet across interior <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, where the dangerous conditions induced numerous traffic accidents. Due to the abnormally cold temperatures in the wake of the storm, the glaze persisted for up to six weeks, much longer than the typical three days for ice storms in New England.

The changeover to heavy rain in southern and eastern New England swelled frozen rivers, creating ice jams which induced severe flooding. Flooding of roadways and homes was compounded by drainage issues from the dense snowcover. Rising floodwaters forced hundreds of families to leave their homes in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine. Up to of rain fell in the <a href="Boston">Boston</a> region, where thousands of homes were inundated. Rivers had begun to recede by December 29 after cresting well above flood stage. Up to of rain fell over <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> after of snow, with widespread flooding reported in multiple towns. Frequent automobile accidents and large traffic jams were reported in the state. Winds were strongest in <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod, Massachusetts</a>, where gusts peaked near . The gales were particularly damaging to trees laden with snow and ice. The heavy rainfall in eastern Massachusetts added tremendous weigh to the snow that had already fallen, causing roof collapses and making it difficult to clear the snow. In southeastern New Hampshire, the strong winds toppled trees and blew out windows in <a href="Hampton%20Beach%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hampton Beach</a>. Although the coastal plain of New England avoided the heaviest snow accumulations, pounding surf and strong winds battered piers, boats, and other coastal installations, while low-lying areas experienced <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> flooding.

The storm dropped up to of snow in southern <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, where wind gusts up to damaged buildings and brought down power lines. Over a period of 60 hours, of snow fell at <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> in what was then the city's heaviest snowfall on record. Rail, air, and automobile transportation were paralyzed. One individual in <a href="Quebec%20City">Quebec City</a> was struck and killed by a snowplow, and two more died of exposure to cold while <a href="ice%20fishing">ice fishing</a> on the <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20River">St. Lawrence River</a>. Several fires broke out in Montreal during the storm, killing at least six people and leaving 23 families homeless. In total, the storm was connected to at least 15 fatalities in the province.

Mascarene grey parakeet

The Mascarene grey parakeet or Thirioux's grey parrot ("Psittacula bensoni"), is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a> which was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene Islands</a> of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and <a href="R%C3%A9union">R√©union</a> in the western <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. It has been classified as a member of the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Psittaculini">Psittaculini</a>, along with other parrots from the Islands.

<a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> bones of the Mascarene grey parakeet found on Mauritius were first described in 1973 as belonging to a smaller relative of the <a href="broad-billed%20parrot">broad-billed parrot</a> in the genus "Lophopsittacus". Apart from their size, the bones were very similar to those of other Mascarene parrots. The subfossils were later connected with 17th- and 18th-century descriptions of small grey parrots on Mauritius and R√©union, together with a single illustration published in a journal describing a voyage in 1602, and the species was instead reassigned to the genus "<a href="Psittacula">Psittacula</a>".

The Mascarene grey parakeet was grey, had a long tail, and was larger than other species of the genus "Psittacula", which are usually green. The grey parrots were said to be easy to hunt, as the capture of one would result in its to summon the whole flock. They were also considered to be crop <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>, and being such easy prey meant that they were extensively hunted. Coupled with <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, this pushed them into extinction. This had happened by the 1730s on R√©union and by the 1760s on Mauritius.

In 1973, English <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="Daniel%20T.%20Holyoak">Daniel T. Holyoak</a> described some small parrot bones that he had discovered among a collection of broad-billed parrot ("Lophopsittacus mauritianus") <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a>s in the <a href="Zoology%20Museum%20of%20Cambridge%20University">Zoology Museum of Cambridge University</a>. These remains had been collected in the early 20th century by French amateur naturalist Louis Etienne Thirioux, who had found them in a cave on <a href="Le%20Pouce">Le Pouce</a> mountain, on the <a href="Mascarene%20Island">Mascarene Island</a> of <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>. They were placed in the zoology museum by 1908. Apart from their size and robustness, Holyoak did not find the bones to be distinct from those of the Mascarene parrot <a href="Genus">genera</a> "Lophopsittacus", "<a href="Mascarinus">Mascarinus</a>" (the Mascarene parrot), "<a href="Necropsittacus">Necropsittacus</a>" (the Rodrigues parrot), and "Psittacula" (which had two or three other species inhabiting the Mascarene Islands). Because of their similarities, Holyoak considered all these genera to be closely related.

Holyoak provisionally placed the new species in the same genus as the broad-billed parrot, naming it "Lophopsittacus bensoni"; the name honours English ornithologist <a href="Constantine%20W.%20Benson">Constantine W. Benson</a>, for his work on birds from the Indian Ocean, and in classifying bird collections at Cambridge. Holyoak also mentioned the possibility that the remains could represent a small <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "Necropsittacus" or a wide-beaked form of "Mascarinus", but maintained that they were best considered as belonging to a distinct species. The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> specimen is a <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a>, with the specimen number UMZC 577a. Other known remains include <a href="upper%20mandible">upper mandible</a>s, a <a href="palatine%20bone">palatine bone</a>, and <a href="tarsometatarsi">tarsometatarsi</a>. The species has since been excavated from the <a href="Mare%20aux%20Songes">Mare aux Songes</a> swamp on Mauritius, from which subfossils of most of the other endemic bird species have been identified as well.

Old, vague accounts of several different now-extinct Mascarene parrots have created much confusion for the scientists who subsequently examined them. In 1967, American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> speculated that 17th- and 18th-century reports of then-unidentified grey parrots on Mauritius referred to the broad-billed parrot. In 1987, English <a href="ecologist">ecologist</a> Anthony S. Cheke correlated the "L. bensoni" subfossils with the grey parrots reported from Mauritius and <a href="R%C3%A9union">R√©union</a>, which had previously been ignored, or considered references to broad-billed parrots. Further study of contemporary accounts indicates that the broad-billed parrot was not grey, but had multiple colours.

In 2007, the English palaeontologist <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a> reclassified "L. bensoni" as a member of the genus "Psittacula", as he found it to be generically distinct from "Lophopsittacus", but <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> similar to the <a href="Alexandrine%20parakeet">Alexandrine parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eupatria"). Hume also pointed out that an <a href="engraving">engraving</a> accompanying the 1648 published version of Dutch captain Willem van West-Zanen's journal may be the only definite depiction of this species. The engraving shows the killing of <a href="dodo">dodo</a>s (depicted as <a href="penguin">penguin</a>-like), a <a href="dugong">dugong</a>, and parrots on Mauritius in 1602; the depicted method of catching parrots matches that used on Mascarene grey parakeets according to contemporary accounts. Hume coined the new <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "Thirioux's grey parrot" in honour of the original collector. The <a href="IOC%20World%20Bird%20List">IOC World Bird List</a> instead used the common name "Mascarene grey parakeet".

The population of grey parrots described from the island of R√©union (referred to as "Psittacula" <a href="cf.">cf.</a> "bensoni" by Hume) is thought to have been <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> with that on Mauritius. Until subfossils of "P. bensoni" are found on R√©union, it cannot be confirmed whether the grey parrots of the two islands belonged to the same species. In the 1860s, French naturalists <a href="Charles%20Coquerel">Charles Coquerel</a> and <a href="Auguste%20Vinson">Auguste Vinson</a> suggested these could have been parrots of the genus "<a href="Coracopsis">Coracopsis</a>", but fossils of neither that genus nor "Psittacula" have ever been found on R√©union. Whilst "Coracopsis" parrots are known to have been introduced to that island in the 1700s, a population did not become established. While no live or dead Mascarene grey parakeets are known with certainty to have been exported, Hume has suggested that a brown parrot specimen‚Äîonce housed in <a href="Cabinet%20du%20Roi">Cabinet du Roi</a> but now lost‚Äîmay have been a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet, or perhaps a <a href="lesser%20vasa%20parrot">lesser vasa parrot</a> ("Coracopsis nigra"). This specimen was described by French naturalist <a href="Comte%20de%20Buffon">Comte de Buffon</a> in 1779. Cheke and Hume suggested in 2008 that Mascarene grey parakeets did not reach Europe because they were considered unimpressive or had too specialised a diet.

Based on morphological features, the Alexandrine parakeet has been proposed as the <a href="founder%20population">founder population</a> for all "Psittacula" species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this may also be the case for all the parrots there. <a href="Sea%20levels">Sea levels</a> were lower during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.

Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced <a href="Pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral</a> bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> of the Psittaculini <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a>, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that "Psittacula" parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on <a href="hotspot%20island">hotspot island</a>s before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Other members of the "Psittacula" from the Mascarenes include the extant <a href="echo%20parakeet">echo parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eques echo") of Mauritius, as well as the extinct <a href="R%C3%A9union%20parakeet">R√©union parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eques eques"), and <a href="Newton%27s%20parakeet">Newton's parakeet</a> ("Psittacula exsul") of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a>. A 2015 genetic study found the other Mascarene "Psittacula" taxa to group within a <a href="clade">clade</a> of <a href="rose-ringed%20parakeet">rose-ringed parakeet</a> ("Psittacula krameri") subspecies from Asia and Africa.

Contemporary accounts describe the Mascarene grey parakeet as a grey, long-tailed parrot. Subfossils show that its was about 30% longer than that of the <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> echo parakeet, and that it had a comparatively broad beak. Members of the "Psittacula" commonly have large, red beaks, and long feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its <a href="Conspecificity">congeners</a> in other <a href="osteological">osteological</a> details. It was skeletally similar to the Alexandrine parakeet, but some of its bones were larger and more robust. Its colouration also separated it from all other members of "Psittacula", the majority of which are green or partially green.

Based on subfossils, the Mascarene grey parakeet was smaller than the broad-billed parrot and the Rodrigues parrot, but similar in size to the Mascarene parrot, though with a wider beak. The mandibular symphysis (central jaw ridge) was thick along the mid-line, the palatine (part of the <a href="palate">palate</a>) was , and the (bone in the lower leg) was . The grey parrots from R√©union were described as being larger than the sympatric R√©union parakeet.

According to Cheke and Hume, the anatomy of the Mascarene grey parakeet suggests that its habits were largely terrestrial, and it may have eaten the fruits of the <a href="hurricane%20palm">hurricane palm</a> and the <a href="bottle%20palm">bottle palm</a>, due to their abundance. Like the extinct <a href="Mauritian%20duck">Mauritian duck</a> and the <a href="Mascarene%20coot">Mascarene coot</a>, it appears that the Mascarene grey parakeet inhabited both Mauritius and R√©union. Both populations were said to be easy to hunt by capturing one individual and making it call out, which would summon an entire flock.

Van West-Zanen, who visited Mauritius in 1602, was the first to mention grey parrots there, and he also described the hunting methods used:

Dutch sailor <a href="Willem%20Ysbrandtsz.%20Bontekoe">Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe</a> was on R√©union in 1618, and described the same behaviour, in the first account of the grey parrots there:
In 1705, French pilot engineer <a href="Jean%20Feuilley">Jean Feuilley</a> gave a more detailed description of the parrots of R√©union and their ecology:
Many other endemic species of Mauritius and R√©union were lost after the arrival of humans, so that the <a href="ecosystems">ecosystems</a> of these islands are severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, the islands were entirely covered in forests, very little of which remains today, because of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. The surviving endemic <a href="fauna">fauna</a> is still seriously threatened. On Mauritius, the Mascarene grey parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the dodo, the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a>, the broad-billed parrot, the <a href="Mauritius%20blue%20pigeon">Mauritius blue pigeon</a>, the <a href="Mauritius%20owl">Mauritius owl</a>, the Mascarene coot, the <a href="Mauritian%20shelduck">Mauritian shelduck</a>, the Mauritian duck, and the <a href="Mauritius%20night%20heron">Mauritius night heron</a>. On R√©union, it lived alongside the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20ibis">R√©union ibis</a>, the <a href="hoopoe%20starling">hoopoe starling</a>, the Mascarene parrot, the R√©union parakeet, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20swamphen">R√©union swamphen</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20owl">R√©union owl</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20night%20heron">R√©union night heron</a>, and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20pink%20pigeon">R√©union pink pigeon</a>.

To the sailors who visited the Mascarene Islands from 1598 onwards, the fauna was mainly interesting from a culinary standpoint. Of the eight or so parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others likely all vanished due to a combination of extensive hunting and deforestation. Being easily caught, the Mascarene grey parakeet was often hunted in abundance by early visitors to Mauritius and R√©union. As the parrots fattened themselves from June to September, they were particularly sought after at this time of the year. An account by Dutch admiral <a href="Steven%20van%20der%20Hagen">Steven van der Hagen</a> from 1606 even suggests that the grey parrots of Mauritius were sometimes killed for amusement.

In the 1720s, French traveller <a href="Sieur%20Dubois">Sieur Dubois</a> stated that the grey parrots on R√©union were especially sought after during their fat season, and also claimed they were crop-pests:
That these birds were said to damage crops probably contributed to their being hunted. The French settlers began to clear forests using the <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> technique in the 1730s, which in itself would have had a large effect on the population of parrots and other animals that nest in tree cavities.

The grey parrots appear to have been common on Mauritius until the 1750s in spite of the pressure from humans, but since they were last mentioned by French colonist Charpentier de Cossigny in 1759 (published in 1764), they probably became extinct shortly after this time. The grey parrots of R√©union were last mentioned in 1732, also by Cossigny. This final account gives an insight as to how he regarded the culinary quality of parrots from R√©union:

The 1648 engraving possibly depicting this species was captioned with a Dutch poem, here in English naturalist <a href="Hugh%20Strickland">Hugh Strickland</a>'s 1848 translation:

Calabozos

Calabozos is a <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> <a href="caldera">caldera</a> in central <a href="Chile">Chile</a>'s <a href="Maule%20Region">Maule Region</a> (7th Region). Part of the Chilean <a href="Andes">Andes</a>' volcanic segment, it is considered a member of the <a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt%23Southern%20Volcanic%20Zone">Southern Volcanic Zone</a> (SVZ), one of the three distinct volcanic belts of South America. This most active section of the Andes runs along central Chile's western edge, and includes more than 70 of Chile's <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a>es and volcanic fields. Calabozos lies in an extremely remote area of poorly glaciated mountains.

Calabozos and the majority of the Andean volcanoes formed from the <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the oceanic <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> under the continental <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American continental lithosphere</a>. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of <a href="Andesite">andesitic</a> and <a href="Rhyolite">rhyolitic</a> magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and <a href="plutonic">plutonic</a> <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a>.

Calabozos is responsible for the huge Loma Seca <a href="Tuff">Tuff</a>, a body of material to in volume. It accumulated over at least three eruptive periods, beginning 800,000 years ago (0.8 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>) and lasting until 150,000 years ago (0.15 mya).

The caldera's dimensions are by , and it has an <a href="elevation">elevation</a> of . Activity from the caldera has produced many other stratovolcanoes to form a <a href="complex%20volcano">complex volcano</a>.

Calabozos lies in central Chile's <a href="Maule%20Region">Maule Region</a>, near <a href="Curic%C3%B3%2C%20Chile">Curic√≥</a> and <a href="Talca%2C%20Chile">Talca</a>, on the western Andes. This is an area of poorly <a href="glaciated">glaciated</a> mountains that is not permanently populated. There are no roads, and it is only accessible via horse or on foot.

Calabozos is part of the <a href="South%20Volcanic%20Zone">South Volcanic Zone</a>, which runs along the western edge of central Chile and extends south, jumping the border to continue its course in Argentina. This range includes at least nine <a href="volcanic%20field">caldera complexes</a>, more than 70¬†of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in the <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a>, and hundreds of minor eruptive centers. The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year. Its largest historical eruption was at Quizapu Crater, located to from the north side of Cerro Azul's summit, and its most active volcanoes are <a href="Llaima">Llaima</a> and <a href="Villarrica%20%28volcano%29">Villarrica</a>.

Calabozos is a ring-shaped <a href="caldera">caldera</a> by wide, with an elevation of . Volcanoes have been formed by eruptions in the crater. The largest, which is on the southern rim of the caldera, is the Holocene Cerro del Medio complex with an elevation of . It is made mainly of andesite and dacite, and has a volume of to . On the southwestern edge several eruptions have created the Descabezado Chico volcano (elevation: ) which consists of four overlapping <a href="volcanic%20crater">volcanic crater</a>s. The last eruption occurred during Holocene time, and produced a <a href="dacite">dacitic</a> lava flow ( in volume) that extends for . Cerro Colorado, with an elevation of , forms another cone in the complex.

Towards the center of the caldera, <a href="hot%20spring">hot spring</a>s including Cajon Los Calabozos and Ba√±os de Llolli are present. The springs are as old as 0.3 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>, and may have formed directly after Calabozos's second eruption as a result of <a href="Tectonic%20uplift">uplift</a> caused by re-occurring activity in the caldera. The vents occur in two clusters, Colorado and Puesto Calabozos, and are located along the margin of a fault at the southwestern edge of the caldera. Hildreth "et al". (1983) evaluated that Calabozos could potentially be useful for the harvesting of <a href="geothermal%20energy">geothermal energy</a>.

<a href="Subduction">Subduction</a> of the eastern edge of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca Plate</a> under the western edge of the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a> occurs about west of Peru and Chile, at a rate of 9 to per year at <a href="30th%20parallel%20south">30 degrees south</a> latitude. This subduction process has resulted in the formation of the <a href="Peru%E2%80%93Chile%20Trench">Peru‚ÄìChile Trench</a>, an <a href="oceanic%20trench">oceanic trench</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. It also produced the <a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt">Andean Volcanic Belt</a> and the rest of the Andes.

Calabozos is one of 44 Holocene <a href="Geologic%20time%20scale">epoch</a> volcanoes located in central Chile and Argentina. It is included within the Southern Volcanic Zone, the most active section of the Chilean Andes. The date of its last known eruption is not known with precision, though it took place during the Holocene.

Through <a href="K-Ar%20dating">K-Ar dating</a>, geologist Robert Edward Drake established the age of 66 events in central Chile, and divided them into groups based on the time of their origin. In a paper published in 1976, he described the location of each group and the west-east-trending movement of volcanism in the range. 
To the west of the Chilean Andes are an early group of eruptions, dated from the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> and the Early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (33.3‚Äì20.2¬†mya). The scale of the eruptive events that produced these features remains unclear. Further east, in the actual range, are huge numbers of eruptions. Between 15.3 and 6.4¬†mya, widespread volcanism took place, followed by extensive <a href="fold%20%28geology%29">folding</a>; this process then repeated itself from 18.4 to 13.7 mya during the Miocene. Beginning 6.4 mya the Chilean Andes were quiet, though whether or not this quiet period took place throughout all of the Andes remains unknown. Central Chilean volcanoes became active once again around 2.5¬†mya, and have erupted almost continuously since.

Calabozos lies in an area between thick and thin continental crust, and its eruptions are probably fed from a pool of <a href="andesite">andesitic</a> and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of <a href="volcaniclastic">volcaniclastic</a> <a href="sedimentary%20rock">sedimentary rock</a> from the <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era coalesced with <a href="Intrusive%20rock">intrusive</a> and volcanic rocks of <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> age, over a layer of <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a>-<a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later <a href="pluton">pluton</a>s (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and <a href="carbonate%20rock">carbonates</a>.

Calabozos is similar in age to <a href="Cerro%20Azul%20%28Chile%20volcano%29">Cerro Azul</a> and <a href="Descabezado%20Grande">Descabezado Grande</a>, and its eruptions may correspond to past activity at both volcanoes. Eruption products of very similar composition (including <a href="mafic">mafic</a> andesite, agglutinates, and dacite) make up the volcanoes. There is also a similarity in size (all are between 40 and 70 cubic kilometers in volume).

The volcano appears to be part of a north-south trending group of rhyolitic, <a href="silicic">silicic</a> Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, <a href="Laguna%20del%20Maule%20%28volcano%29">Laguna del Maule</a>, and Volc√°n Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fold-and-thrust</a> movement of the nearby Malarg√ºe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.

In comparison to the well-preserved rocks of the dry, central part of the Andes, the record that defines the southern sector is poorly preserved. Remnants of Miocene and Quaternary eruptions within the central part are clearly preserved in the rock record. Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40¬†percent of the area's total erupted material, suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time. By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes, Hildreth "et al." concluded that similar amounts of ash-flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well. Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record, and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted <a href="Deposition%20%28geology%29">deposition</a> of volcaniclastic rock.

While the volcanic history of the area extends back far further, the earliest fully recognizable events in the region are recorded in the <a href="Pyroclastic%20rock">pyroclastic</a> Campanario Formation. This sequence appears to begin at Laguna de la Invernada and ranges from 15 to 6¬†mya. Remnants of magma intrusions as young as 7¬†mya can be found at the lake (Laguna de la Invernada).

The most recent volcanic phase began about 4¬†mya, producing largely andesitic eruptions. A series of eruptions built up a broad <a href="plateau">plateau</a> of lava, and extended over the area where Calabozos now lies. Locally, this plateau was composed of mafic andesite with <a href="olivine">olivine</a>, which over time gathered to form to thick layers. Nearby volcanoes sit on top of two mya lavas that formed during this period, while the Loma Seca Tuff lies atop andesitic deposits from Descabezado Grande.

Calabozos lies between two different types of volcanism‚Äîto its north, andesite and <a href="rhyolite">rhyolite</a> are the primary constituents of <a href="lava">lava</a> while its southern neighbors are composed of more mafic andesite and <a href="basalt">basalt</a>. It is mainly <a href="basaltic%20andesite">basaltic andesite</a> and <a href="rhyodacite">rhyodacite</a> that make up Calabozos, forming a <a href="Calc-alkaline">calcalkilic</a> suite rich with <a href="potassium">potassium</a>. Its lavas are dotted with <a href="phenocryst">phenocryst</a>s, which vary from 2 to 25¬†percent of their mass. These phenocrysts are typically made of <a href="plagioclase">plagioclase</a>, but also contain <a href="clinopyroxene">clinopyroxene</a>, <a href="orthopyroxene">orthopyroxene</a>, <a href="ilmenite">ilmenite</a>, <a href="apatite">apatite</a>, and <a href="titanomagnetite">titanomagnetite</a>.

The area's rainfall averages annually, varying from at its lowest to at its highest. Precipitation between May and August (primarily snow) is normally 20 to 35 centimetres, dropping to below one centimetre during summer. Temperature is also variable, typically registering 25 degrees Celsius during the summer, but dropping below freezing at high elevations (above ).

Vegetation is rare in the area. The 1932 eruption of Cerro Azul's Quizapu Crater reduced much of the land to a pumice desert. Above , vegetation becomes even more sparse.

During the late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, Calabozos erupted <a href="tuff">tuff</a> composed primarily of rhyodacite and dacite. Three distinct eruptions have taken place within the last million years. The sheets of remaining <a href="volcanic%20ash">ash</a> left over from all of the eruptions together range from to in volume and are known as the Loma Seca Tuff.

The first eruption, which took place 0.8¬†mya, was distinct from later eruptions in that its product lacks flattened lenticles (lens-shaped layers of mineral or rock embedded in rock). The tuff is dotted with predominantly plagioclase <a href="phenocrysts">phenocrysts</a>, which make up between less than 5 to approximately 15¬†percent of each particle's mass. After being erupted, the material settled in canyons, where it underwent glaciation. This carved cliffs which drop as much as . The tuff is limited to just a few kilometers around the complex.

Taking place 0.3¬†mya, the second eruption was the most extensive. It was probably between and in volume and extended past the reaches of the caldera, down the adjacent <a href="foothill">foothill</a>s. Beyond the caldera, the eruptive products are poor in phenocrysts (unlike those of the first eruption). They are instead rich in lithic material, which makes up as much as 10¬†percent of the rock in parts (50¬†percent at the base of the caldera). As the first of the ash was deposited, it accumulated in layers that formed quickly and resisted erosion, but only partially melded together. However, except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was devitrified (loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle), the entire sheet is melded together. Inside Calabozos, the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts. Instead, erosion ate away at it, in the form of acid leaching, and broke down much of its <a href="pumice">pumice</a> content. Still, the rock layer here contains five to 30¬†percent phenocrysts, and has high levels of <a href="devitrification">devitrification</a> and lithic content.

The differences between these two deposits can be accounted for by a few factors, including time of eruption and placement. The material inside the caldera must be younger and erupted from a pool of magma that had larger crystals. Its extensive erosion can be explained by the presence of hydrothermal vents, and its high levels of lithics probably originate from either being exposed to the rocks after they were erupted, lying adjacent to them while they underwent <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a>, or is a result of long, slow formation. Any of these reasons would also effectively account for the poor mixing of the lavas.

Activity continued for approximately 150,000 years in the form of quiet andesitic eruptions, as glaciation took place. About 0.15¬†mya (150,000 years ago), a third and final ash flow was erupted. With a volume of to , it was smaller than the second eruption, but acted similarly, and had much more densely welded tuff. The ash was thickest at , at Loma Seca, and the top of the deposit has undergone erosion. It is densely welded in crevasses, but not at thin layers, where much of the material is barely welded or not welded at all.

The first layers of the last deposit were alternating belts of light and dark-colored material, and were densely welded. They appear to have been erupted in pulses, and continue for hundreds of meters. Deposition was continuous except for one interruption, which can be seen at proximity to the caldera, where the layers are replaced by thin, nonwelded sheets of lava. Another zone of nonwelded material, about and near Cajon Los Calabozos, underwent no erosion, suggesting that activity stopped, then began again.

High in <a href="fiamme">fiamme</a>, the third tuff layer differs from the second in that it has even higher phenocryst content, but poor lithics. In the fiamme, phenocrysts constitute between 5 and 15 percent of the rock, increasing to 25 to 30¬†percent near the caldera. In the younger emplacements, clinopyroxene is evident along with an increase in mafic content.

Calabozos is in the South Volcanic Zone, which contains potentially deadly and active volcanoes such as <a href="Mount%20Hudson">Mount Hudson</a>, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima together have more than 80¬†reported episodes of volcanism since 1558, and at least 40¬†South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions.

Its remoteness means that Calabozos poses little threat to humans, but if necessary relief efforts could be orchestrated. The Volcanic Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) formed in response to the <a href="Armero%20tragedy">famous eruption</a> of <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> and saved lives following the 1991 eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile by organizing evacuations. The team's stated aim is to "reduce eruption-caused fatalities and economic losses in developing countries". Made up of various USGS offices such as the <a href="Cascades%20Volcano%20Observatory">Cascades Volcano Observatory</a> (CVO), responsible for monitoring <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a>, the team has equipment to monitor any volcano, allowing the timely prediction of volcanic eruptions and the evacuation of nearby homes.

American Arts Commemorative Series medallions

American Arts Commemorative Series Medallions are a series of ten gold bullion medallions that were produced by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> from 1980 to 1984. They were sold to compete with the South African <a href="Krugerrand">Krugerrand</a> and other bullion coins.

The series was proposed by North Carolina <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> <a href="Jesse%20Helms">Jesse Helms</a> after the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Department of the Treasury</a> began selling portions of the national stockpile of gold. Iowa <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Representative</a> <a href="Jim%20Leach">Jim Leach</a> suggested that the medallions depict notable American artists. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> signed the bill containing the authorizing legislation into law on November 10, 1978, despite objections from Treasury officials.

The medallions were initially sold through mail order; purchasers were required to obtain the day's price by telephone before ordering. Later, the Mint sold them through <a href="telemarketing">telemarketing</a>. Mintage ceased after the ten different medallions approved by Congress were produced. All were struck at the <a href="West%20Point%20Mint">West Point Bullion Depository</a>. The series sold poorly, prompting critics to blame the involved process by which they were first marketed, and the fact that they were medallions rather than coins.

On April 19, 1978, the United States Treasury Department announced that a portion of the national gold stockpile was to be auctioned through the <a href="General%20Services%20Administration">General Services Administration</a> (GSA) beginning on May 23, 1978, in the form of bars. According to the Treasury, the sales were intended to "[reduce] the U.S. <a href="trade%20deficit">trade deficit</a>, either by increasing the exports of gold or by reducing the imports of this commodity", and to "further the U.S. desire to continue progress toward the elimination of the international monetary role of gold". For reasons of bookkeeping, an entire bar was set as the minimum purchase, which placed the gold outside of the reach of most Americans. North Carolina senator <a href="Jesse%20Helms">Jesse Helms</a> was critical of the plan, saying that he was "opposed to the sale of U.S. gold to foreign and international banks and gold dealers" and that medallions should be "produced in small size, suitable for sale to average citizens". On the day of the Treasury announcement, Helms introduced the Gold Medallion Act of 1978. The stated intent was to provide average consumers with affordable, small-sized gold bullion to compete with the South African <a href="Krugerrand">Krugerrand</a> and other world bullion coins, which were becoming increasingly popular with American investors. 1.6 million troy ounces (50,000¬†kg) ounces of gold had been imported into the United States in the form of Krugerrands in 1977 alone. In a hearing on August 25, 1978, before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs</a>, Helms said:

Helms went on to describe the characteristics of the proposed medallions, stating:

Support for the medallions grew in Congress, prompting the introduction of more legislation. Iowa representative <a href="Jim%20Leach">Jim Leach</a> proposed that the series feature designs honoring American artists. During the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs hearing, Leach outlined the reasons for his proposal. He noted that the House Subcommittee on Historic Preservation received many suggestions of individuals worthy to appear on the <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coin</a> that had previously been proposed. Leach felt that a dollar coin was not a suitable way to commemorate the individuals, as it was impossible to honor such a large group on a coin whose design was likely to remain unchanged for a long period of time. He also noted that all United States coinage until then had depicted individuals whose principal contributions had been in government and politics rather than the arts. Leach described the specifics of his proposal, stating:

The subjects designated were painter <a href="Grant%20Wood">Grant Wood</a>, <a href="contralto">contralto</a> singer <a href="Marian%20Anderson">Marian Anderson</a>, authors <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> and <a href="Willa%20Cather">Willa Cather</a>, musician <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, architect <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, poet <a href="Robert%20Frost">Robert Frost</a>, sculptor <a href="Alexander%20Calder">Alexander Calder</a>, actress <a href="Helen%20Hayes">Helen Hayes</a> and author <a href="John%20Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>.

Though the program received widespread support in Congress, Treasury officials opposed it. In a letter, Treasury secretary <a href="W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMichael%20Blumenthal">W.¬†Michael Blumenthal</a> wrote, "I do not believe the U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression to be created that it cannot or will not take the necessary steps to combat inflation and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation." Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions, the public would believe that the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold. Despite these objections, the bill was attached to the bank <a href="omnibus%20bill">omnibus bill</a>, which President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> signed into law on November 10, 1978.

The Treasury lacked money to put the medallions into production, so an appropriations bill was passed giving the department the necessary funding. The GSA was tasked with determining how best to market the new issues. The GSA proposed several sales plans, including the distribution of the medallions to a network of banks for sale to the public. This was rejected in favor of requiring purchasers to make a telephone call to learn the price of the medallions on the day of purchase, after which the purchaser was to go to a post office the same day to make payment. According to the legislation, the issues were to be "sold to the general public at a competitive price equal to the free market value of the gold contained therein plus the cost of manufacture, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses including marketing costs".

Production began in 1980. Struck at the <a href="West%20Point%20Bullion%20Depository">West Point Bullion Depository</a>, the medallions contained 90% gold, and were issued in two sizes: one containing one troy ounce (31 g) of gold and one containing one half-ounce (16 g) of the metal. The first struck were those honoring Grant Wood on the one ounce medallion and Marian Anderson on the half-ounce piece. Both were designed by <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> Chief Engraver <a href="Frank%20Gasparro">Frank Gasparro</a>. Sales were poor, and in September 1980, the Mint announced that a private firm, commodity traders <a href="Goldman%20Sachs%231980%E2%80%931999">J.¬†Aron and Company</a>, would market the medallions. The new plan involved selling the medallions through a network of bullion dealers, banks, brokerage houses and coin dealers, a system similar to that South Africa used to distribute the Krugerrand in the US. In 1981, the second year of production, the composition of the medallions was changed; although the 90% gold purity was retained, the balance was altered to include silver, which was added to change their appearance. That year's medallions depicted Mark Twain and Willa Cather. These were designed by Matthew Poloso and Sherl Winter, respectively. These first four medallions bore no notation of their metallic content or country of origin. This was done to distinguish them from federal coinage. Beginning in 1982, this information and small, toothlike designs, known as "denticles", were added along the inner rim of the medallions, and <a href="reeding">reeding</a> was added to the edge. That year's issues depicted Louis Armstrong, as designed by <a href="John%20Mercanti">John Mercanti</a>, and Frank Lloyd Wright, designed by Edgar Steever. The following year's medallions depicted Robert Frost and Alexander Calder. The former was designed by P.¬†Fowler, while the latter was by Michael Iacocca. The final year of production saw the mintage of medallions with designs by John Mercanti honoring Helen Hayes and John Steinbeck. The Mint terminated the contract with J.¬†Aron and Company in 1984, opting instead to sell the medallions through a telemarketing program. In 1985, Mint director <a href="Donna%20Pope">Donna Pope</a> announced that the medallions would be sold in another telemarketing operation in sets of five of either one each of the one ounce medallions or one each of the half-ounce pieces, beginning in September of that year and ending on December 31, or sooner if all sets sold.

In October 1980, Luis Vigdor, assistant vice-president for bullion and numismatic operations of Manfra, Tordella & Brookes, then one of the largest coin firms in the country, compared the medallions and the efforts to market them unfavorably to the South African Krugerrand. According to Vigdor, they were difficult to market due to their lack of notation of weight, fineness and country of origin. He also criticized the marketing, asserting that people were unlikely to buy gold at the post office, and that the medallions were advertised poorly. Vigdor contrasted the medallions' marketing program with the widespread success of the Krugerrand and the vigorous attempts to market them around the world. Commenting on the poor sale of the medallions, assistant director of marketing for the Mint Francis Frere said in 1984: "it just hasn't worked. They're not selling. We've made a strong effort, but it's not working."

On February 12, 1982, following the poor sales of the medallions, the United States Gold Commission recommended the minting of a gold coin. <a href="Donald%20Regan">Donald Regan</a>, Secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the commission, later told reporters that a gold coin could be easier to sell than medallions, because the suggested coins "could be redeemable in dollars". The Mint issued gold coins for the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Summer Olympics</a> in Los Angeles and for the centennial of the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> in 1986. Both issues were successful, and the Liberty piece sold out on advance sales. As the public was receptive to the gold coins, and President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> had banned the importation of Krugerrands in 1985 over South Africa's <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> policy, Congress authorized the <a href="American%20Gold%20Eagle">American Gold Eagle</a> gold bullion coin, which entered production as legal tender in 1986.

Eastern Area Command (RAAF)

Eastern Area Command was one of several <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based commands</a> raised by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) during . It was formed in May 1942, and controlled units located in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. Headquartered in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Eastern Area Command's responsibilities included <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">air defence</a>, <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a> and protection of the <a href="sea%20lane">sea lane</a>s within its boundaries. Its flying units operated fighters, reconnaissance bombers, and dive bombers, and concentrated on convoy escort, <a href="maritime%20patrol">maritime patrol</a> and <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a>. The size of the area was such that the RAAF twice considered splitting it, but nothing came of this.

The area command continued to function after the war, its headquarters transferring from Sydney to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Glenbrook">Glenbrook</a>, in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a>, in 1949. By this time most of the RAAF's operational units‚Äîincluding fighter, bomber, and transport <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wings</a>‚Äîwere based within Eastern Area's boundaries, and the officer in command was responsible for air defence across all of Australia. In October 1953, the RAAF began reorganising its command-and-control system from one based on geography to one based on function; Eastern Area was re-formed as <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home Command</a>, which was renamed <a href="RAAF%20Operational%20Command">Operational Command</a> in 1959, and <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a> in 1987.

Prior to World War¬†II, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. When war broke out, the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure, commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units. Between March 1940 and May 1941, Australia and <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> were divided into four <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control zones</a>: <a href="Central%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Central Area</a>, <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a>, and <a href="Northern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Northern Area</a>. The roles of the area commands were <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">air defence</a>, protection of adjacent <a href="sea%20lane">sea lane</a>s, and <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a>. Each was led by an <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) who controlled the administration and operations of all air bases and units within his boundary.

Central Area was disbanded in August 1941, and its responsibilities were divided between Southern Area, Northern Area, and the newly formed <a href="No.%202%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">No.¬†2 (Training) Group</a>. The outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> resulted in Northern Area being split in January 1942 into <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western</a> and <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Areas</a>, to counter separate Japanese threats to Northern Australia and New Guinea. Southern Area was also considered appropriate for division owing to its size, so the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> proposed assigning responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area, which would also assume control of units in southern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> from North-Eastern Area.

Headquartered in the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="Edgecliff%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Edgecliff</a>, Eastern Area Command was formed on 15¬†May 1942 under the leadership of Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bill Anderson</a>. Staff numbered 114, including forty-five officers. Training units in New South Wales remained part of No.¬†2 (Training) Group. <a href="No.%205%20Group%20RAAF">No.¬†5 (Maintenance) Group</a> was formed in Sydney on 1¬†June, and took responsibility for all maintenance units initially controlled by Eastern Area Command. In September, the Allied Air Forces commander in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, Major General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, formed the majority of his US flying units into the <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>, and most of their Australian counterparts into <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, led by Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>. Bostock exercised control of Australian air operations through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority, meaning that Bostock and his area commanders were ultimately dependent on the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, for supplies and equipment.
Of geographical necessity, the RAAF's two northerly area commands were mainly responsible for bombing and air defence, while the other commands focussed on <a href="maritime%20patrol">maritime patrol</a> and <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a>. In response to an increase in the number of Japanese submarines <a href="Axis%20naval%20activity%20in%20Australian%20waters">operating in Australian waters</a>, the RAAF conducted intensive patrols along the east coast during January and February 1943. This included more than 400 patrol, anti-submarine, and convoy escort missions by Eastern Area aircraft in January. The submarine threat against Allied shipping was considered serious enough to warrant basing more RAAF squadrons in southern commands than in the north, diverting resources from forward areas like New Guinea. By April, Eastern Area was operating seven combat units: <a href="No.%205%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†5 Squadron</a>, flying <a href="army%20cooperation">army cooperation</a> missions with <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s out of <a href="Kingaroy%2C%20Queensland">Kingaroy</a>, Queensland; <a href="No.%2023%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†23 Squadron</a>, flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from <a href="Lowood%2C%20Queensland">Lowood</a>, Queensland; <a href="No.%2024%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†24 Squadron</a>, flying dive-bombing missions with Wirraways from <a href="Bankstown%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bankstown</a>, New South Wales; <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†32 Squadron</a>, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions with <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s from <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Camden</a>, New South Wales; <a href="No.%2071%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†71 Squadron</a>, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s from Lowood; <a href="No.%2073%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†73 Squadron</a>, flying maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions with Ansons from <a href="Nowra%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Nowra</a>, New South Wales; and <a href="No.%2083%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†83 Squadron</a>, flying fighter missions with Wirraways from <a href="Strathpine%2C%20Queensland">Strathpine</a>, Queensland. Nos. 71 and 73 Squadrons were reserve formations hastily raised to augment the anti-submarine effort, crewed by staff and students from operational training units. 

Japanese submarine activity off the east coast peaked during April and May 1943, leading to a further expansion of the RAAF's convoy escort and patrol efforts. As part of the measures undertaken to increase air coverage during this period, transit flights were ordered to overfly shipping lanes whenever possible. At the end of April, Eastern Area headquarters staff numbered 630, including 105 officers. <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a>s of No.¬†32 Squadron were credited with damaging a Japanese submarine on 19¬†June, but neither the RAAF nor the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> was able to destroy any enemy submarines in coastal waters during 1943. The efforts of the two services within the region Eastern Area covered were hampered by poor liaison and command arrangements, as well as the RAAF placing a relatively low priority on protecting merchant shipping.

Anderson handed over command of Eastern Area to Air Commodore John Summers in July 1943. Group Captain <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a> became senior air staff officer (SASO). On 22¬†October, <a href="Avro%20Lancaster">Avro Lancaster</a> "Q-for-Queenie", piloted by Flight Lieutenant <a href="Peter%20Isaacson">Peter Isaacson</a>, "buzzed" the Eastern Area headquarters building in Edgecliff before flying under the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a>, flouting regulations and becoming the largest aircraft to pull such a stunt. The same month, the Air Board proposed carving a new area command out of Eastern Area, which by then was considered too large to be controlled by one headquarters and therefore ripe for division. The new command, to be known as Central Area, would have been responsible for training and operational units in southern Queensland; the <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a> deferred its decision on the proposal. The concept was raised again in August 1944, and this time Central Area Command was to control maintenance units, as well as training and operations, in southern Queensland; again, nothing came of the proposal.

Air Commodore <a href="Alan%20Charlesworth">Alan Charlesworth</a> was appointed AOC Eastern Area in December 1943. Japanese submarine activity had decreased in the months prior to Charlesworth taking command, and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent. He observed "a general slackening off in procedure; ships are seldom where they should be, and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft". The RAAF's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that an observant submarine captain could easily avoid. Charlesworth relinquished command in September 1944 to take over North-Western Area. In December, aircraft from Eastern Area took part in the search for the German submarine "<a href="German%20submarine%20U-862">U-862</a>", but could not prevent it sinking the <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a> "Robert J. Walker" on <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>; a Beaufort of <a href="No.%2015%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†15 Squadron</a>, based at <a href="Camden%20Airport%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Camden</a>, located the wreck. No.¬†32 Squadron lost a Beaufort with its crew shortly after takeoff from Lowood during the search for "U-862", which was called off in January 1945. That month, Air Commodore <a href="Leon%20Lachal">Leon Lachal</a> became AOC Eastern Area, and held command for the duration of the Pacific War.

On 2 September 1945, following the end of the Pacific War, South West Pacific Area was dissolved and the Air Board again assumed full control of all its operational elements. According to the official history of the post-war Air Force, the AOC Eastern Area was considered "Australia's senior operational airman" and delegated by the Chief of the Air Staff with day-to-day responsibility for the nation's air defence. Most of the RAAF's bases and aircraft employed in operations were situated within Eastern Area's sphere of control in New South Wales and southern Queensland. Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> succeeded Lachal as AOC in December 1945. By the end of the month, headquarters staff numbered 1,122, including 104 officers. <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 (Bomber) Wing</a> came under the control of Eastern Area Command in April 1946, when it moved to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Station Amberley</a>, Queensland; initially operating <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberators</a>, the wing re-equipped with <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>s soon after. By this time Eastern Area headquarters occupied seven mansions in <a href="Point%20Piper">Point Piper</a>, Sydney; it subsequently relocated to <a href="RAAF%20Bradfield%20Park">Bradfield Park</a>. Lukis retired from the Air Force in May, and Charlesworth took over command.

In July‚ÄìAugust 1946, Eastern Area Command oversaw the establishment of <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No.¬†86 (Transport) Wing</a>, operating <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">C-47 Dakotas</a>, at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a>, New South Wales, displacing <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No.¬†78 (Fighter) Wing</a>, which moved to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Station Williamtown</a>, and began operating <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a>s. The following month, Air Vice Marshal Jones proposed reducing the five mainland area commands (North-Western, North-Eastern, Eastern, Southern, and Western Areas) to three: Northern Area, covering Queensland and the Northern Territory; Eastern Area, covering New South Wales; and Southern Area, covering Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The proposal was part of a much larger plan to restructure the post-war RAAF; the Federal government rejected the plan and the wartime area command boundaries largely remained in place. Lachal succeeded Charlesworth as AOC Eastern Area in October, and held command until his retirement from the Air Force in July 1947.
Lachal's successor as AOC Eastern Area, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>, was responsible for preparing the transfer of its headquarters from Bradfield Park to the former Lapstone Hotel at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Glenbrook">Glenbrook</a> in the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Lower Blue Mountains</a>, a process that was completed in 1949. As well as commanding a view of the surrounding countryside, the property was within of the <a href="City%20of%20Penrith">City of Penrith</a> and of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, and incorporated a disused railway tunnel that offered, according to government correspondence, "complete protection from <a href="Nuclear%20weapon">Atom Bomb</a> attack". An adjoining property, "Briarcliffe", was purchased soon afterwards to augment the new headquarters' accommodation facilities. Bladin completed his term as AOC Eastern Area in October 1948. Air Vice Marshal <a href="John%20McCauley">John McCauley</a> was appointed AOC in March the following year. McCauley commanded Eastern Area during the early years of the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>, and oversaw the deployment of to administer RAAF units stationed there‚Äîa Lincoln squadron detached from No.¬†82 Wing and a Dakota squadron from No.¬†86 Wing. Having re-equipped with <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jets, No.¬†78 Wing departed Williamtown for garrison duties with the RAF on Malta in July 1952. In May 1953, Eastern Area's SASO, Group Captain <a href="Frank%20Headlam">Frank Headlam</a>, announced that the Air Force was planning to re-equip No.¬†82 Wing with <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jet bombers, and also procure <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> swept-wing jet fighters.

The Federal government retired Air Marshal Jones in 1952 and replaced him with Air Marshal <a href="Donald%20Hardman">Donald Hardman</a>, RAF, who proceeded to re-organise the RAAF command-and-control system along functional lines, establishing <a href="RAAF%20Home%20Command">Home</a> (operational), <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a> in October 1953. The first was re-formed from Eastern Area Command as it was considered the RAAF's "de facto" operational organisation. The second was re-formed from Southern Area Command, as it was the hub of training services, controlling those in New South Wales and Queensland as well as Victoria and South Australia. The third and last functional command was formed from the extant <a href="Maintenance%20Group%20RAAF">Maintenance Group</a> headquarters in Melbourne. The transition to a functional system was completed in February 1954, when the three new commands assumed control of operations, training and maintenance from Western, North-Western, and North-Eastern Areas.

The functional commands established in 1953‚Äì54 were revised in 1959. Home Command was renamed <a href="RAAF%20Operational%20Command">Operational Command</a>, and Training and Maintenance Commands merged to become <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>. Operational Command was renamed <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Air Command</a> in 1987, and three years later Support Command split into <a href="RAAF%20Logistics%20Command">Logistics Command</a> and Training Command. Throughout the evolution from Home to Operational to Air Command, the headquarters remained at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains. In 1997, logistics management became the responsibility of Support Command (Air Force), the RAAF component of the Defence-wide Support Command Australia (later subsumed by the <a href="Defence%20Materiel%20Organisation">Defence Materiel Organisation</a>). Training Command was re-formed as <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Air Force Training Group</a>, a <a href="Force%20Element%20Group">force element group</a> under Air Command, in 2006. Air Command was then the sole command-level organisation in the RAAF.

As at April 1943, Eastern Area controlled the following squadrons:

As at May 1944, Eastern Area controlled the following squadrons:

Auriscalpium vulgare

Auriscalpium vulgare, commonly known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Auriscalpiaceae">Auriscalpiaceae</a> of the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Russulales">Russulales</a>. It was first described in 1753 by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>, who included it as a member of the <a href="hydnoid%20fungi">tooth fungi</a> genus "<a href="Hydnum">Hydnum</a>", but British mycologist <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus "<a href="Auriscalpium">Auriscalpium</a>" that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and <a href="temperate%20climate">temperate</a> Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the <a href="pine">pine</a> woods where it grows. "A.¬†vulgare" is not generally considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> (mushrooms) grow on conifer <a href="plant%20litter">litter</a> or on <a href="conifer%20cone">conifer cone</a>s that may be partially or completely buried in soil. The dark brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of the small, spoon-shaped mushroom is covered with fine brown hairs, and reaches a diameter of up to . On the underside of the cap are a crowded array of tiny tooth-shaped protrusions ("teeth") up to 3¬†mm long; they are initially whitish to purplish-pink before turning brown in age. The dark brown and hairy <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>, up to long and 2¬†mm thick, attaches to one edge of the cap. The mushroom produces a white <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> out of roughly spherical <a href="spore">spore</a>s.

High levels of humidity are essential for optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by either too much or too little light. Fruit bodies change their <a href="gravitropism">geotropic</a> response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The <a href="pure%20culture">pure culture</a>, <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a> and the <a href="ultrastructure">ultrastructure</a> of "A.¬†vulgare"s <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e and <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> have been studied and described in search of potentially useful <a href="phenotypic%20trait">characters</a> for <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in the scientific literature by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> under the name "Hydnum auriscalpium" in his 1753 "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>". Linnaeus placed three other <a href="hydnoid%20fungi">tooth fungi</a> in the genus "Hydnum": "<a href="Sarcodon%20imbricatus">H.¬†imbricatum</a>", "<a href="Hydnum%20repandum">H.¬†repandum</a>", and "<a href="Phellodon%20tomentosus">H.¬†tomentosum</a>". In 1821, <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> considered "H.¬†auriscalpium" to be sufficiently distinct from the other "Hydnum" species to warrant the creation of a new genus, "<a href="Auriscalpium">Auriscalpium</a>", to contain it. In the process, its name was changed to "Auriscalpium vulgare".

<a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> and <a href="Howard%20James%20Banker">Howard James Banker</a> later independently sought to restore Linnaeus' <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">species name</a>, but the resulting combination ("Auriscalpium auriscalpium") is a <a href="tautonym">tautonym</a> and disallowed under the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">rules for botanical nomenclature</a> (ICBN 2005 rule 23.4), and these combinations are therefore no longer <a href="correct%20name%20%28botany%29">validly</a> published. Other names given to the fungus and now considered <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a> include "Hydnum fechtneri", named by <a href="Josef%20Velenovsk%C3%BD">Josef Velenovsk√Ω</a> in 1922, and later combinations based on this name. "A.¬†vulgare" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the widely distributed genus of eight species that it belongs to.

Despite vast differences in appearance and <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, "A.¬†vulgare" is related to such varied <a href="taxon">taxa</a> as the <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gilled</a> fungi of "<a href="Lentinus">Lentinus</a>", the <a href="polypore">poroid</a> genus "<a href="Albatrellus">Albatrellus</a>", the coral-like "<a href="Clavicorona">Clavicorona</a>", and fellow tooth fungus "<a href="Hericium">Hericium</a>". The relationship of all of these taxa‚Äîmembers of the family <a href="Auriscalpiaceae">Auriscalpiaceae</a> of the order <a href="Russulales">Russulales</a>‚Äîhas been demonstrated through <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>.

"Auriscalpium vulgare" is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "pinecone mushroom", the "cone tooth", "pine cone tooth", or the "ear-pick fungus". Gray called it the "common earpick-stool"; it was also referred to as the "fir-cone Hydnum", when it was still considered to be a member of that genus. The specific epithet "vulgare" means "common". The generic name "Auriscalpium" is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "<a href="ear%20pick">ear pick</a>" and refers to a small, scoop-shaped instrument used to remove foreign matter from the ear.

The fruit body of "A.¬†vulgare" is fibrous when fresh and becomes stiff when dry. It is a small species rarely exceeding in height, with a cap usually smaller than an adult's fingernails: ‚Äîalthough it has been known to reach up to .

"Auriscalpium vulgare" usually has a single <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>, but occasionally several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches to the side of the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> brown. The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> to light brown‚Äìroughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward ("revolute") and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.

The cap <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is composed of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy <a href="cortex%20%28botany%29">cortical</a> layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner <a href="ochre">ochre</a>-colored flesh. A drop of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> applied to the surface of the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.

The mushroom, which has no distinct taste or odor, is generally considered inedible because of its toughness and diminutive size. An 1887 textbook noted, however, that it was "commonly eaten in France and Italy".

<a href="Spore">Spore</a> <a href="spore%20print">deposits</a> are white. Viewed under a <a href="light%20microscopy">light microscope</a>, the spores appear <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), covered with minute wart-like bumps, and are spherical or nearly so, with dimensions of 4.6‚Äì5.5 by 4‚Äì5¬†<a href="micrometre">¬µm</a>. They are <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a> (reacting to <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>) and <a href="cyanophilous">cyanophilous</a> (<a href="staining">staining</a> in <a href="methyl%20blue">methyl blue</a>). The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells of the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) are four-spored with basal clamps, and measure 15‚Äì24 by 3‚Äì4¬†¬µm, and <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> (extensions of the basidia that bear the spores) are swollen at the base and roughly 3¬†¬µm long. The hyphal system is <a href="Hypha%23Classification%20based%20on%20cell%20wall%20and%20overall%20form">dimitic</a>, comprising both generative (undifferentiated) and skeletal (structural) hyphae. The thin-walled generative hyphae are hyaline, and have <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s; the thick-walled skeletal hyphae are thicker overall and lack such connections. The cortex (the tougher outer layer of flesh) is made of parallel unbranched generative hyphae that are brown, thick-walled, clumped together, and frequently clamped. The internal flesh is made of interwoven generative and skeletal hyphae. Gloeoplerous hyphae (containing oily or granular contents) are also present, protruding into the hymenium as club-like or sharp-pointed <a href="wikt%3Agloeocystidium">gloeocystidia</a>.

The hyphae of <a href="Basidiomycota">basidiomycetous</a> fungi are partitioned by cross-walls called <a href="septum">septa</a>, and these septa have pores that permit the passage of <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> or <a href="protoplasm">protoplasm</a> between adjacent hyphal compartments. In an effort to determine <a href="ultrastructure">ultrastructural</a> characters useful for <a href="systematics">systematic</a> and phylogenetic analyses of the <a href="Agaricomycotina">Agaricomycotina</a>, Gail Celio and colleagues used <a href="electron%20microscopy">electron microscopy</a> to examine both the structure of the septal pore, and nuclear division in "A.¬†vulgare". They determined that septa found in hyphae of the hymenium have bell-shaped pore "caps" with multiple perforations. Each cap extends along the length of the septum, along with a zone surrounding the pore that is free of <a href="organelles">organelles</a>. Due to the scarcity of similar data from other Agaricomycotina species, it is unknown whether the extended septal pore cap margins of "A.¬†vulgare" are phylogenetically informative. Regarding nuclear division, the process of <a href="metaphase%20I">metaphase I</a> of <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> is similar to the metaphase of <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>. Spherical <a href="spindle%20apparatus">spindle pole bodies</a> containing electron-opaque <a href="Cytoplasmic%20inclusion">inclusions</a> are set within gaps on opposite ends of the <a href="nuclear%20membrane">nuclear membrane</a>. This membrane has occasional gaps but is largely continuous. Fragments of <a href="endoplasmic%20reticulum">endoplasmic reticulum</a> occur near the spindle pole bodies, but do not form a cap.

"Auriscalpium vulgare" can be grown in <a href="pure%20culture">pure culture</a> on <a href="agar">agar</a>-containing <a href="petri%20dish">plates</a> supplemented with nutrients. The <a href="clonal%20colony">colonies</a> that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six weeks from the initial <a href="inoculation">inoculation</a>. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above the surface of the agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6¬†mm and 15¬†mm from the initial <a href="inoculation">inoculum</a> spot, with each zone roughly 4¬†mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.

The mature mycelium consists of thin-walled, densely packed hyphae that are 1.5‚Äì3.2¬†¬µm in diameter. They are often gnarled or somewhat spiral (subhelicoid), and frequently branched at an angle of about 45¬∞, with a clamp at the base of the branch. They contain amorphous <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granules</a> that appear <a href="refractive">refractive</a> when viewed under <a href="phase%20contrast%20microscopy">phase contrast microscopy</a>, and their walls are often encrusted with tiny granules. Gloeocystidia (thin-walled <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> with <a href="refraction">refractive</a>, frequently granular contents) are common; they measure 50‚Äì85 by 6.5‚Äì8.5¬†¬µm, and are club-shaped (sometimes elongated), thin-walled, and often have one or two lobes with rounded tips. Containing foamy and pale yellow contents, they are a refractive yellow color under phase contrast. Initially they are erect but they soon fall under their own weight to lie on the agar surface. Crystalline deposits are abundant as small, randomly scattered plate-like or star-like crystals.

Fruiting begins about six weeks after the initial inoculation on the agar plate, but only when portions of fruit bodies (spines or stem sections) are used as the inoculum to initiate growth; the use of mycelium as the inoculum precludes subsequent fruiting. Mature fruit bodies grow very close to the initial site of inoculation‚Äîwithin 3¬†mm‚Äîand take about 60 days to mature after they first start to form.

Fruit body <a href="primordia">primordia</a> first appear between the scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48‚Äì72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances on the part of the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.

When grown in favorable conditions of high water availability and humidity, the fruit body can proliferate by growing additional (secondary) fruit bodies on all parts of its upper and lower surfaces. These secondary growths typically number between four and seven; some may be aborted as the nutrients from the pine cone substrate are depleted, resulting in stems lacking caps. In one instance, a complete secondary proliferation was noted (i.e., growing from a primary proliferation) that developed completely so as to produce viable spores. Humidity is a limiting factor for optimum fruit body development. Removal of incompletely mature laboratory-grown specimens from a <a href="relative%20humidity">relative humidity</a> (R.H.) of over 98% to one of 65‚Äì75% causes the fruit bodies to brown and stop growing. When transferred to an even lower R.H. of about 50%, the stems quickly begin to collapse. Light also affects fruit body development: both continuous illumination and complete darkness inhibit growth.
When a stem is developing, the fungus is negatively <a href="geotropism">geotropic</a>, so that if the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic‚Äîthey will grow at right angles to the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.

"Auriscalpium vulgare" is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species. Its mushrooms grow solitary or clustered on fallen <a href="conifer%20cone">pine cones</a>, especially those that are fully or partially buried. It typically favors <a href="Scots%20Pine">Scots Pine</a> ("Pinus sylvestris"), but has also been reported on <a href="spruce">spruce</a> cones, and in <a href="California">California</a> grows primarily on <a href="Douglas-fir">Douglas-fir</a> cones. One author noted finding the mushroom on spruce needles on top of squirrel dens where cone <a href="bract">bract</a>s were present in the <a href="forest%20floor">forest floor</a>. In a study conducted in the <a href="Mount%20Laojun%20%28Yunnan%29">Laojun Mountain</a> region of <a href="Yunnan%20Province">Yunnan Province</a>, China, "A.¬†vulgare" was found to be one of the most dominant species collected from <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a> at an altitude of . A study on the effect of <a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> practices in northeast India showed that the fungus prefers to fruit on burned cones of the <a href="Khasi%20Pine">Khasi Pine</a>, and that the number of fruit bodies on unburned cones increases with cone girth.

The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central and North America, <a href="temperate">temperate</a> Asia, and Turkey. In North America, its range extends from Canada to the <a href="Trans-Mexican%20Volcanic%20Belt">Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt</a> south of <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. The mushroom is common, appearing in the summer and autumn, although it is easily overlooked because of its small size and nondescript coloration.

Final Fantasy XIII-2

Development of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" began around March and April 2010 and lasted about one and a half years. The game was unveiled at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game, and developer <a href="tri-Ace">tri-Ace</a> was hired to help with the game's design, art, and programming. The development team wanted to exceed "Final Fantasy XIII" in every aspect while making the story's tone mysterious and darker than the previous game. The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used in "Final Fantasy XIII" and includes a less linear overall design.

"Final Fantasy XIII-2" received highly positive reviews from Japanese critics and generally positive reviews from Western video game journalists. Though praised for its gameplay, lack of linearity, and graphics, the game's story was criticized as weak and confusing. During the first week of sales in Japan, the game sold 524,000 units, becoming the fifth-best selling game of 2011 in Japan, and sold 3.1 million copies worldwide by January 2013. It was released digitally for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in June 2013 along with a Japan-only re-release including <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a>. A sequel, "", was released in November 2013 in Japan and February 2014 in North America, Europe and Australia. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the "Final Fantasy XIII" series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide. In November, 2018, the series was added to Xbox One backwards compatibility.

The player directly controls the on-screen character through a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game, just as in "Final Fantasy XIII". The player can also turn the camera around the characters, providing a 360¬∞ view. "Final Fantasy XIII-2", which includes normal and easy modes, has a world rendered to scale relative to the characters; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier "Final Fantasy" games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the <a href="overworld">world</a> on foot or by <a href="chocobo">chocobo</a>, large flightless birds that appear regularly in the "Final Fantasy" series. The game world is divided into multiple regions and time periods; the player can visit a region in multiple time periods and multiple regions at the same time period. For example, the region of Oerba can be reached in the years 200 and 400 AF, while the Sunleth Waterscape and Augusta Tower regions can be visited in the year 300 AF. Some regions, because of plot points within the game, have alternate versions of themselves; for example, two versions of the Academia region in the same year can be accessed once the plot has made the second version available. Connecting these regions is the Historia Crux, which the player can access at will. The game's regions are represented as a branching path instead of being accessed linearly. New regions can be unlocked via plot points or by acquiring optional special items and the player may transfer between unlocked regions at any point.

When accessing a previously visited region, the player appears in the location of their last visit. Upon acquiring items called seals, the player can revert regions to their previous statuses to play through them again; regions can be unsealed again at any time. Unlike in the predecessor, the game is automatically <a href="save%20point">saved</a> when players enter the Historia Crux, as well as at key moments in the plot. The player may also manually save at any time. Instead of accessing stores at save points like in "XIII", the player can purchase items from a character named Chocolina, who is found throughout the game. An in-game data log provides a <a href="bestiary">bestiary</a> and incidental information about the world of "Final Fantasy XIII-2". When talking to characters, the game sometimes begins the Live Trigger system, in which the player chooses their response from several options; these dialogue options are generally not repeatable. The game also occasionally features temporal rifts, in which the player must complete a puzzle to close the rift and continue the game.

Combat is almost identical to the previous game's version of the series' <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Parties%20and%20battles">Active Time Battle</a> (ATB) system, called the Command Synergy Battle system. Under this system, the player selects an action from the <a href="Menu%20%28computing%29">menus</a>, such as Attack, Abilities, or Item. Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills at a constant rate to a set maximum number of slots. The kinds of attack actions available are close-range melee attacks or ranged magical attacks, but there are also other magical actions that evoke healing or shielding abilities. The ATB bar can be increased in size throughout the game from three slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of combat, and the characters' <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> is fully restored after each fight. Players have the option of restarting a battle while in the middle of a fight. During some skirmishes, players are put through <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s called Cinematic Actions that allows them to deal higher damage to foes and end certain battles.

Monsters do not freely roam the map like in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XI">Final Fantasy XI</a>" to "XIII", but instead, they <a href="random%20encounter">randomly appear</a> as in the earlier "Final Fantasy" games. For a limited time after monsters appear, the player may attack them to gain a combat bonus; after this window expires, the monsters attack the player to begin a regular battle, and if too much time passes before combat begins, the player cannot restart the fight during combat. When the battle begins, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen as in "XIII". Three characters are used in combat‚Äîthe two main characters and a monster. Monsters must be captured from battles before they can be used, and there are around 150 different monster types available to be collected. Captured monsters act just like the main characters, but can also perform a "feral link" attack that increases the chance of capturing another monster. Either of the two main characters can be selected as the one that the player has direct control over at any point; the other character and the monster are then controlled by the game's <a href="artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>.

Each enemy has a meter, called a Chain Gauge, consisting of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy is struck by attacks or <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">spells</a>. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.

The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20character%20jobs%23White%20Mage">White Mage</a>-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in "Final Fantasy XIII", the player cannot summon the <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%23Gameplay">Eidolons</a>, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.

The Crystarium is a leveling and growth system, making a return from "Final Fantasy XIII" in an altered form. The system consists of constellation-style representations of the character's weapons and tamed monsters, made up of small and large crystal nodes, which can be accessed from the start of the game. There is one Crystarium system available for each monster and Paradigm role. Crystogen points gained in battle can be used to expand the Crystarium, unlocking bonuses to health, magic, or strength, or provide the characters with new abilities and slots for battle accessories. For the monsters, the bonuses are unlocked with items dropped by defeated enemies.

The story of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" follows on from that of "Final Fantasy XIII", but as is typical for the series, it is unrelated to all other previous "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" games. In "XIII", one of the fal'Cie‚Äîa god-like race‚Äîtransformed a team of six people, the primary characters of the game, into l'Cie (servants of the fal'Cie with magical powers and a 'Focus'‚Äîan assigned task to be completed within a time limit), in the hope that they would initiate the end of the world. The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.

"XIII-2" begins three years after the end of "XIII". Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of "XIII" and the collapse of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of "XIII-2", most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new <a href="Technocracy">technocratic</a> government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of "XIII-2" jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro. This place is a realm at the end of time where the goddess keeps a dark energy called Chaos from escaping and destroying the timeline.

As opposed to the previous game, <a href="Lightning%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Lightning</a>, the main character of "XIII", only appears as a supporting character and the game's primary narrator. The two main playable characters are <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Serah%20Farron">Serah Farron</a>, Lightning's sister and the second narrator, and <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Noel%20Kreiss">Noel Kreiss</a>, a young man originally from the distant future. Other characters from the previous game who appear in important roles are <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Hope%20Estheim">Hope Estheim</a>, who becomes leader of the Academy, and <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Snow%20Villiers">Snow Villiers</a>, Serah's fianc√©, who set off to find Lightning for Serah. The three other main characters from the previous game, <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Oerba%20Dia%20Vanille">Oerba Dia Vanille</a>, <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Oerba%20Yun%20Fang">Oerba Yun Fang</a> and <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Sazh%20Katzroy">Sazh Katzroy</a>, appear in cameo roles. Three new characters are introduced: <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Caius%20Ballad">Caius Ballad</a>, the game's primary antagonist; <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Paddra%20Nsu-Yeul">Paddra Nsu-Yeul</a>, a <a href="seeress">seeress</a> possessing the all-seeing Eyes of Etro; and <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Alyssa%20Zaidelle">Alyssa Zaidelle</a>, a young girl who works as an assistant to Hope. A minor supporting character is <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Mog">Mog</a>, a <a href="Moogle">Moogle</a> sent with Noel by Lightning as Serah's "good luck charm".

The game opens in 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is attacked by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears to help fight the monsters and claims to be a time traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where he claims to have met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF to resolve a paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%23Story">Purge</a>, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of "Final Fantasy XIII".

Traveling to the ruined city of Paddra in 10 AF, they find Hope, who has become the leader of the Academy, with Alyssa as his assistant. They also find a recording of prophecies made by one of the seeresses of Paddra, who are believed to have died out centuries prior: one fragmented prophecy shows Lightning in Valhalla. Paddra is shrouded by an eclipse, which Noel says is not supposed to happen for several centuries. While Serah and Noel resolve the paradox causing the eclipse, they encounter Caius Ballad, a man Noel knows from 700 AF who opposes their mission, and Yeul, who looks identical to a girl of the same name Noel knew in the future. After resolving the paradox, an alternative timeline appears in which there was never an eclipse. The repaired prophecy shows Caius in Valhalla fighting Lightning and the pillar supporting Cocoon collapsing. Noel claims that this takes place around 400 AF, devastating the human population as well as the world, creating a future where he is the last human in existence. Serah and Noel move on, while Hope and Alyssa work on finding a way to prevent the pillar's collapse.

Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, the pair find Snow fighting a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays the fall of Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair then go to the city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to disappear in the corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.

Yeul explains that every time the timeline is changed, the resulting shock kills her; Caius has been driven mad by watching her die repeatedly and seeks to end the process by unleashing the Chaos trapped in Valhalla to destroy all time. Serah, it is revealed, has the same power, and risks death every time she changes the future. Resolving to go on, Serah breaks free of her dream-world and frees Noel from his, in which he is the last living human after his Yeul dies and Caius leaves for Valhalla. After briefly encountering Lightning, the pair fight Caius, first in 500 AF Academia and then in Valhalla. As they defeat him, he claims to have killed Lightning, then impales himself through the heart on Noel's blade, killing the weakened Etro. When the pair return to Academia in 500 AF, where Vanille and Fang have been rescued from the collapsing pillar and the new Cocoon, named "Bhunivelze", has risen, Serah dies in front of Noel and Hope from the shock of the future changing. Just then, a black cloud erupts from the sky as the Chaos that Etro was keeping trapped breaks free. Lightning is then shown in crystal stasis on the throne of Etro's temple. If the player completes all optional parts of the game, they are shown an <a href="post-credits%20scene">additional scene</a> in which Caius is on the throne, declaring that the goddess is gone for good, and that Yeul and he can begin a new life freed from their 'curses'.

Development of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" began around March and April 2010 and lasted about one and a half years. It was carried out by <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>'s 1st Production Department, a collective name for the teams in charge of the "<a href="Fabula%20Nova%20Crystallis%20Final%20Fantasy">Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy</a>", "<a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a>" and "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series. Many of the key personnel from "Final Fantasy XIII" remained in their roles: <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a> was director, <a href="Yoshinori%20Kitase">Yoshinori Kitase</a> producer, <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> character designer and <a href="Isamu%20Kamikokuryo">Isamu Kamikokuryo</a> art director.

The troubled development of "Final Fantasy XIII" that had been caused by the simultaneous creation of the company-wide engine <a href="Crystal%20Tools">Crystal Tools</a> gave reason to rethink the production process for high-budget games at Square Enix. For "Final Fantasy XIII-2", the team consulted the European subsidiary <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos</a> to more closely adapt a Western approach to game development. As a consequence, monthly schedules and project <a href="Milestone%20%28project%20management%29">milestones</a> were introduced to better monitor the staff members' progress. Furthermore, unlike its predecessor, "Final Fantasy XIII-2" was not entirely developed in-house; Japanese studio <a href="tri-Ace">tri-Ace</a> was contracted to help out with aspects of the game design, art and programming. This was done to keep the number of internal staff members on the game lower. The contributions of external developers were planned and clearly divided beforehand to achieve a more structured team organization. Concept videos and frequent test playing during production helped constantly engage the staff and keep to the original vision of the game.

Despite its strong sales, "Final Fantasy XIII" had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints included that the game had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s, and had not featured enough <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Minigames">minigames</a> and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in "Final Fantasy XIII". Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel in line with what players had hoped "Final Fantasy XIII" would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from <a href="Rockstar%20San%20Diego">Rockstar San Diego</a>'s "<a href="Red%20Dead%20Redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>". The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama referred to as a first for the series.

Toriyama originally envisioned the plot not as a direct sequel to "Final Fantasy XIII" but instead as taking place 900 years after. However, while creating the backstory for the events in between both eras, it was decided to have the game revolve around time traveling. Toriyama expressed his wish to "create a story where [Lightning] ends up [truly] happy one day" as he considered her emotional state at the end of "Final Fantasy XIII" doubtful. He also wanted to "see [Serah] take an active part" because her crystal stasis over the course of the predecessor's story did not allow for such a role. Lead scenario writer <a href="Daisuke%20Watanabe">Daisuke Watanabe</a> thought about how the narrative could be continued in a sequel. Emi Nagashima, also known by her pen name Jun Eishima, had written novellas for "Final Fantasy XIII" and was consulted early on in development to help come up with the plot for "Final Fantasy XIII-2".

The narrative was divided into smaller "pieces of drama" similar to a <a href="television%20series">television series</a> rather than one overarching story piece. This was reflected by the game's working title "Final Fantasy XIII: Season 2" when the project was first proposed within the company. Unlike "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X-2">Final Fantasy X-2</a>", which had a more cheerful and humorous feel than "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>", the staff members wanted the overall tone of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" to be serious as well as darker and more mysterious than its predecessor. The original scenario had called for Serah to travel alone with Mog. However, Kitase felt that their dialogue was "quite girly, almost camp and a bit over the top" and resulted in a tonal shift that was too similar to the one from "X" to "X-2". Noel was added to the story to counter this. Watanabe considered scriptwriting for the game's two-character party difficult. With the lack of varied personality traits provided by an ensemble cast, he had to ensure that conversations between Serah and Noel would not be repetitive or unrealistic. Unfamiliar concepts and terms in "Final Fantasy XIII", such as "l'Cie" and "fal'Cie", were deemed too difficult to understand and hence avoided in the sequel. A story link to "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Type-0">Final Fantasy Type-0</a>" via the location Valhalla was planned but later discarded.

Based on the much darker tone of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" compared to its predecessor, Kamikokuryo decided on <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a> as the main theme for the graphics. The works of <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dal√≠</a> and <a href="Giorgio%20de%20Chirico">Giorgio de Chirico</a> were used as visual references and helped Kamikokuryo strike a balance between <a href="photorealism">photorealism</a> and fantasy-like surrealism. Unlike "Final Fantasy XIII", the game had a much tighter schedule allowing for little <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>. Kamikokuryo hence used photographs instead of self-drawn pictures to explain his setting ideas to the other staff members. For example, a photograph of ruined buildings in the Cuban capital <a href="Havana">Havana</a> inspired the look of Valhalla. Character design duties were split up: Nomura designed the faces of the new and returning main characters while their clothing was done by other artists. Kamikokuryo drew the final version of Lightning based on a silhouette sketch and suggestions by Nomura. <a href="Yusuke%20Naora">Yusuke Naora</a> took charge of Serah's, Noel's and Caius' costumes, while Hideo Minaba worked on Yeul, Alyssa and the adult version of Hope in the same capacity. Mog was designed by Toshitaka Matsuda after he had received a request for a cute and <a href="mascot">mascot</a>-like Moogle character.

The music of "Final Fantasy XIII-2" was composed by <a href="Masashi%20Hamauzu">Masashi Hamauzu</a>, <a href="Naoshi%20Mizuta">Naoshi Mizuta</a>, and Mitsuto Suzuki. <a href="Keiji%20Kawamori">Keiji Kawamori</a> coordinated the three artists to ensure their styles meshed well. Hamauzu, who was the sole composer for the <a href="music%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII">music of "Final Fantasy XIII"</a>, wrote roughly a quarter of the game's tracks, as did Suzuki, while Mizuta wrote nearly half. Prior to this game, Mizuta had worked on the <a href="music%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20XI">music of "Final Fantasy XI"</a>, and Suzuki had been a sound director for several <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> games and served as an arranger for "XIII". The game's director, Motomu Toriyama, wanted the game's soundtrack to have more variety than that of the music in "Final Fantasy XIII", as well as feature more styles. As a result, the game had three composers rather than just Hamauzu. Toriyama also wished for the music to have "a more edgy sound" and more vocal pieces, so that it would sound "unlike the typical "Final Fantasy" title". The music incorporates a wide variety of styles, from orchestral and electronic to rap, hip-hop, jazz funk, and metal.

Since the release of the game, Square Enix has published the 2011 four-disc soundtrack album, "Final Fantasy XIII-2 Original Soundtrack", as well as an album of arrangements and alternate versions of tracks from the game, "Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack PLUS", in 2012. The theme song for the game, , was released by singer <a href="Mai%20Fukui">Mai Fukui</a> as a single in 2011, and the English version of the song, sung by <a href="Charice">Charice Pempengco</a> and included in the non-Japanese versions of the game, was included on her 2012 album "<a href="Infinity%20%28Charice%20album%29">Infinity</a>". Reviews of the soundtrack album were positive, with critics praising both the variety of styles and quality of the pieces. Several critics noted Mizuta's work as possibly his finest to date. Reviewers were mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling that several of the pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese <a href="Oricon">Oricon</a> charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.

"Final Fantasy XIII-2" was first hinted at three months after the January 2010 release of "Final Fantasy XIII". Kitase said in an interview "If we could do a "XIII-2", we could direct all our attention to the story and refine what we have already built." Toriyama stated in the October 2010 "<a href="List%20of%20Square%20Enix%20companion%20books">Ultimania Omega</a>" companion book that he hoped to continue the story. Two months later, Nomura released a drawing of Lightning along with the words "She must not be forgotten". On January 11, 2011, Square Enix registered the domain name FinalFantasy13-2game.com via a proxy company that it had used to register websites for several other unannounced games. "Final Fantasy XIII-2" was officially announced at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> on January 18, 2011. The teaser trailer showed Lightning, outfitted in armor, drawing her weapon and engaging Caius, who was not yet named. To promote the game's release in Japan, Japanese singer <a href="Yuko%20Oshima">Yuko Oshima</a> was appointed the leader of a group of thirteen official test players.

The game features <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) in the form of downloadable outfits, weapons, accessories, scenarios, recruitable monsters and minigames. Although there had been initial plans to release DLC for "Final Fantasy XIII", these ideas did not come to fruition. For "Final Fantasy XIII-2", the team designed and planned for content, including DLC, that would expand on the game since the beginning of its development. Players who own "Final Fantasy XIII" save data can unlock an additional wallpaper (PS3) or gamer picture (Xbox 360) for the save file. DLC released after the game contained additional weapons, costumes, and monsters. Post-release downloads also included ""Final Fantasy XIII" Lost Report", which offers a look back at "Final Fantasy XIII"s story through the perspective of non-playable characters from the game, and three downloadable scenarios for other characters: "Perpetual Battlefield", which reveals Snow's fate; "Heads or Tails", which shows how Sazh came to 500 AF Academia; and "Requiem of the Goddess", which shows Lightning's struggle against Caius and explains how she became crystallized in the main story's ending.

During its first week of release in Japan, "Final Fantasy XIII-2" sold 524,000 copies, and the PlayStation 3 version was the highest-selling game for the system. The Xbox 360 version only reached 48th. Although high, initial sales were notably lower than what they were for the game's predecessor, which sold 1.5 million units in its first week. By the end of the year, the game had sold over 697,000 units, and was the fifth-best selling game of 2011 in Japan. It was just below four <a href="handheld%20video%20game">handheld video game</a>s, making it the highest-selling home <a href="console%20game">console game</a> in Japan that year. It finished 2012 with over 840,000 copies sold in Japan. In the United States, the game placed as the second-best selling game of February 2012, just below "". In the United Kingdom, "Final Fantasy XIII-2" was the best-selling game of February 2012. By January 2013, "Final Fantasy XIII-2" had sold 3.1 million copies worldwide, almost half of the 7 million copies its predecessor sold. It would ship an additional 200,000 to 400,000 copies according to Square Enix press releases. Its Steam release sold over 330,000 copies by early 2016. To October 15, 2017 has sold a total of 3.7 million copies.

"Final Fantasy XIII-2" received very favorable reviews by Japanese reviewers, getting perfect scores from the Japanese magazines "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" and "<a href="Dengeki%20PlayStation">Dengeki PlayStation</a>". "Famitsu" editor Ranbu Yoshida said that "it feels like a very different game from its predecessor" and that "it's easy to lose yourself in changing and redoing areas you've previously finished." Assistant editor Norihiro Fujiwara added that "the setting and presentation is fantastic, and the issues people brought up with the first game‚Äîits linearity, its lack of meaty gameplay‚Äîare a thing of the past. You're sucked into the game right from the beginning, and the story's very easy to get into." The game won the "Future Division" award at the 2011 Japan Game Awards and later won an "Award of Excellence" at the 2012 Japan Game Awards.

Outside Japan, the game received mostly positive reviews, which primarily focused on the changes in the game from its predecessor. Reviewers generally praised the graphics. The "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" review described the environments as "entirely captivating" and said that the "visual and audio design is marvellous", and Kevin VanOrd of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> praised the graphics as beautiful and visually diverse. Jeremy Parish of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> disagreed, however, saying that the art "represents a step back from the splendor of "Final Fantasy XIII"". The music received mixed reviews; Parish said that the music was great, applauding the unique styles, but Simon Parkin of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> felt that the music "suffers from a lack of coherent direction", and tracks often failed to match their scenes. Dale North of <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> felt that the soundtrack was "wonderfully varied and lots of fun" and predicted that "traditionalist" fans of "Final Fantasy" music would not like it as much because of the varied new styles.

The gameplay was generally praised as well, with many reviewers noting the improvements in areas they saw as problems in the previous game. Parkin praised the game's "smart, engaging mechanics" and the "novel structure" of the gameplay. Joe Juba of "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" said that the changes to "Final Fantasy XIII"s battle system made it his favorite "Final Fantasy" battle system, and that the gameplay was "phenomenal". Ryan Clements of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> felt that the gameplay was an improvement over "XIII"s, fixing many of its problems. Parish stated that "XIII-2" was an inversion of "XIII" in that the gameplay took precedence over the story. He described the battle system as "a joy" and said that the game was "never not fun". VanOrd agreed that the combat was fun, though he found it to be too easy. The "Edge" review, which was harsher on the game than most others, also found it to be too easy, which combined with what they saw as poor subquests and a lack of effort put in some regions made the gameplay uninteresting.

The story of the game received poor to mixed reviews. Parish felt that it was confusing and inessential to the game, while Juba said that it was "a disaster" which "screws up at almost every turn", overshadowing the game's good points. Parkin felt that the characters were weak and the story was not engaging, and Clements said that the story was insubstantial, which he found particularly disappointing as most "Final Fantasy" games focused heavily on their story. VanOrd was less negative towards the characters and story than most others, but still described the characters as good, but not great. He felt the game focused too much on the less interesting characters of Noel and Serah over Lightning and Caius, and said that the story was "semi-coherent" and missed several emotional notes, particularly in the first half of the game.

Hints and rumors began circulating about a sequel to "Final Fantasy XIII-2" as early as December 2011, when Square Enix registered the "Final Fantasy XIII-3" web domain. At the time, the company stated that it was simply a precaution and did not mean there was such a game. After the game was released with a "To be continued" ending, Square Enix said that the ending was chosen to prompt players to explore the alternative endings and remain ready for the coming DLC levels. However, after the release of what was stated to be the final piece of DLC, officials at Square Enix announced that they would be releasing future "Final Fantasy XIII"-related content. In late August 2012, a teaser site was unveiled in preparation for the "Final Fantasy" 25th Anniversary Event, titled "A Storm Gathers", promising a "new direction for the saga of key character Lightning". At the event, it was announced that the title for this game would be "", that it would be released in 2013, and that it would serve as the ending to the story of the main "Final Fantasy XIII" character, Lightning.

Bastion (video game)

Bastion is an <a href="Action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing</a> video game developed by <a href="Indie%20game">independent developer</a> <a href="Supergiant%20Games">Supergiant Games</a> and published by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Interactive%20Entertainment">Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment</a>. In the game, the player controls "the Kid" as he moves through floating, fantasy-themed environments and fights enemies of various types. It features a dynamic voiceover from a narrator, and is presented as a two-dimensional game with an <a href="isometric%20graphics%20in%20video%20games%20and%20pixel%20art">isometric</a> camera and a hand-painted, colorful art style. "Bastion"s story follows the Kid as he collects special shards of rock to power a structure, the Bastion, in the wake of an apocalyptic Calamity.

The game was built over the course of two years by a team of seven people split between <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. They debuted the game at the September 2010 <a href="Penny%20Arcade%20Expo">Penny Arcade Expo</a>, and it went on to be nominated for awards at the 2011 <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a> and win awards at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202011">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> prior to release. "Bastion" was published in July 2011 for <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> via <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, and in August 2011 through digital distribution for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. Supergiant Games made it available as a <a href="browser%20game">browser game</a> for <a href="Google%20Chrome">Google Chrome</a> in December 2011. It was released for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> via the <a href="Mac%20App%20Store">Mac App Store</a> in April 2012 and directly followed by a SteamPlay update in early May 2012 which allows the version purchased via Steam to be playable on both Mac OS X and Windows. A version for iPad was released in August 2012. In April 2015 it was released for the PlayStation 4. "Bastion"s soundtrack was produced and composed by Darren Korb, and a soundtrack album was made available for sale in August 2011.

During 2011, the game sold more than 500,000 copies, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. It sold over 3 million copies across all platforms by January 2015. The game was widely praised by reviewers, primarily for its story, art direction, narration, and music. Opinions were mixed on the depth of the gameplay, though the variety of options in the combat system was praised. "Bastion" has won many nominations and awards since its release, including several for best downloadable game and best music, from review outlets such as <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" as well as from the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, the <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>, and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Interactive%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences</a>.

"Bastion" is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> with a level structure. The player character, "the Kid", moves through floating, fantasy-themed environments that form paths as the player approaches the edge. Levels consist of a single plane, and are viewed <a href="isometric%20graphics%20in%20video%20games%20and%20pixel%20art">isometrically</a>. They are filled with enemies of various types, which attempt to harm the Kid. The Kid carries two weapons, which may be selected from the choices available to the player at specific locations called arsenals. The Kid also has the ability to perform a special attack. Weapons and special attacks must be acquired before they can be used. There are a limited number of special attacks that the player can perform at any time, represented by "black tonics" that can be found in the levels or dropped from enemies. Special attacks may be used a total of three times. This maximum number of uses can be increased in the Distillery. The Kid's health is represented by a <a href="health%20%28gaming%29">health bar</a>, which can be replenished with "health tonics". Like black tonics, the Kid can only carry a certain number of health tonics at a time, and can replenish them by finding more in the levels.

Levels contain many different environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At the end of most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; occasionally, the level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes the item, forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.

Between levels, the Kid visits the Bastion, where the player can use fragments‚Äîthe game's form of currency‚Äîthat they have accrued to buy materials and upgrade weapons. With each core the player collects, they can add one of six structures to the Bastion, such as a shrine, an armory, or a distillery, and each shard allows the player to expand a structure. Each structure serves a different purpose; for example, the distillery lets the player select upgrades, and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke, causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s and currency. Experience points are used to determine the Kid's ability level; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select.

Whenever the player leaves the Bastion, they can choose between one or two regular levels to play. In addition to these levels, however, the Kid can engage in challenge courses designed to test the player's skills with the weapons the player has found. They are called Proving Grounds. The challenges differ depending on the weapon, such as destroying a certain number of objects within a given time or breaking targets in the fewest shots possible. According to the player's score, different tiers of prizes are awarded. Additionally, the Kid can fight waves of enemies while the narrator tells a character's backstory by journeying to "Who Knows Where" from the Bastion. The back story battles occur during 'Memories.' The player earns fragments and experience for each completed wave. After the game is completed, the player can choose to begin a "<a href="New%20Game%20Plus">new game+</a>" mode, where the player replays through the game while keeping the experience points, fragments, and weapons that they have gained. This mode also offers more options in the buildings, as well as two more journeys to "Who Knows Where".

The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity, a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia () as well as the surrounding areas of the game's world into many floating pieces, disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash. Players take control of the Kid, a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion, where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times. The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks, the game's narrator, who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia. A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures, as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via "skyways" that propel him through the air.

During his quest, the Kid meets two more survivors: Zulf, an ambassador from the Ura, underground-dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war; and Zia, an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia. Both of them return to the Bastion, but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers, Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion's central device (the monument) and returns to Ura territory. The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia's father, Venn, who had worked for the Caelondians. He had helped Caelondian scientists ("Mancers") build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war. Venn rigged the weapon to backfire, so that when he was finally forced to trigger it, the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well.

To repair Zulf's damage to the Bastion, the Kid starts collecting Shards, a lesser form of Cores. As he obtains the penultimate shard needed, the Ura attack the Bastion, damaging it and abducting Zia. In the next seven days, The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory. When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia, she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity. The Kid travels to the once-underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard. There, he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people: the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces, and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home. The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him. If he leaves Zulf behind, the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway. If he chooses to carry Zulf, Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion.

After the Kid returns and recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as there was no way to test the process. The game ends either way, showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game+</a> mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.

"Bastion" was created by a team of seven people, who composed the studio <a href="Supergiant%20Games">Supergiant Games</a>. It was the company's first game. The game was directed by Amir Rao and <a href="Greg%20Kasavin">Greg Kasavin</a> wrote the game's narration, which was spoken by Logan Cunningham. Jen Zee was the artist, Gavin Simon developed the gameplay, Andrew Wang helped develop the game, and Darren Korb handled the sound effects and music. The co-founders of Supergiant Games, Rao and Simon, previously worked for <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>, where they helped develop "" and "". They left to form the studio because they wanted the development speed and the ability to try new ideas that would be possible with a smaller team. Development began on the game in September 2009. The team created the game over almost two years, and funded the development themselves. Most of the team built the game in a house in San Jose, though the music and voice acting were recorded in New York City. Some of the San Jose designers‚Äîincluding the writer‚Äîdid not meet Rucks' voice actor in person until near the release of the game. The team spent the first nine months of development prototyping various ideas, before settling on the game's design.
The original idea was based around the premise of creating a town like those found in a <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground come up to the Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the <a href="pixel%20art">pixel art</a> landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.

The narrator was added early in the game's development as a way to provide background details and depth to the world without requiring the player to read long strings of text or wait through cutscenes. To avoid slowing the pace of the action-oriented gameplay, the team had the narrator mainly speak in short, evocative phrases, with long pauses between speaking parts. The narrator is intended to feel like an "old acquaintance" to the player, a connection built by his commentary on the player's actions as they happen, both major and minor. Kasavin sought to make the game feel as if it were the player's story, rather than just a story being watched. The development of "Bastion" was chronicled in the monthly Building the Bastion video series from October 2010 to May 2011 in which Supergiant Games collaborated with Kasavin's former <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> co-workers at <a href="Giant%20Bomb">Giant Bomb</a>. The videos showed early game concepts in addition to the process of building the final game, as well as interviews with the team.

Supergiant Games showed an early, unplayable version of the game at the March 2010 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>, to little acclaim. They debuted a playable version of the game at the September 2010 <a href="Penny%20Arcade%20Expo">Penny Arcade Expo</a>, where it was well received. After a strong showing at the March 2011 Game Developers Conference, <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Interactive%20Entertainment">Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment</a> signed on to publish and distribute the game. The team decided to partner with a publisher in order to get through the process of Xbox Live certification. "Bastion" was released on July 20, 2011 for <a href="Xbox%20Live%20Arcade">Xbox Live Arcade</a> (XBLA), and on August 16, 2011 for digital distribution on <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a>. It was released as a <a href="browser%20game">browser game</a> for <a href="Google%20Chrome">Google Chrome</a> on December 9, 2011. A version for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> was made available via the <a href="Mac%20App%20Store">Mac App Store</a> on April 26, 2012 along with a SteamPlay update for <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>.

"Bastion"s soundtrack was produced and composed by Darren Korb, a songwriter and composer. He was selected to pen the soundtrack by Rao, who was a childhood friend of Korb. "Bastion" was the first video game that Korb had scored; prior to it he had worked on a few smaller television shows and movies. He was brought onto the team in the beginning stages of the project, and several of the pieces he developed were created prior to the final design of the levels with which they were associated. The musical style of the soundtrack has been described by Korb as "acoustic frontier trip hop". It was intended to evoke both the <a href="American%20Old%20West">American frontier</a> and an exotic fantasy world. The songs combine "heavily sampled beats in layers, along with acoustic elements", and he determined that he wanted to create the soundtrack in that style as it was different from video game soundtracks that he had heard before. The music was recorded in Korb's closet at his New York City apartment, as were the sound effects and more than three thousand lines of narration by Cunningham.

In addition to composing the music, Korb wrote all the lyrics for the soundtrack. The soundtrack features four vocal themes: "Build That Wall", "What's Left Undone", "Mother, I'm Here", and "Setting Sail, Coming Home". "Build That Wall" features the voice of Ashley Lynn Barrett, "What's Left Undone" features that of Cunningham and "Mother, I'm Here" features Korb, and both Korb and Barrett perform in "Setting Sail, Coming Home". Supergiant Games originally had not planned to release a full soundtrack album for the game, but due to fan demand they released one in digital format on August 5, 2011, with two songs not heard in the game. These songs are "Get Used to It", which has a voiceover written by Greg Kasavin and spoken by Logan Cunningham, and "The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You)", with lyrics written by Korb and sung by Cunningham. A physical limited edition CD signed by Korb was released on September 2. The soundtrack sold 30,000 copies by November 2011. On March 15, 2012, Supergiant Games released sheet music for piano and guitar arrangements by Korb of "Build That Wall", "Mother, I'm Here", "Setting Sail, Coming Home", and "The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You)" for free in their online store.

"Bastion" was released to strong sales and critical acclaim. The game sold more than 500,000 copies during 2011, 200,000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade. In March 2013 at the PAX East gaming convention, Bastion's creative director Greg Kasavin stated that the game had sold more than 1.7 million copies combined across all platforms. By May 2014, the game had sold over 2 million copies, and by January 2015, it had sold over 3 million. Bob Mackey of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> called it "the perfect mesh of game and story", and McKinley Noble of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" said that it "raises the visual and narrative bar for downloadable titles". Maxwell McGee of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> called it "wonderfully crafted" and "an amazingly good time", and Greg Miller of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> concluded that "Bastion" "is amazing and you owe it to yourself to download it".

The presentation of the game was widely praised, especially the narration. Mackey said that the game "could be sold on its presentation alone", focusing on the graphics, music, and story. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" said that the narration added "emotional resonance" to the game, and Tom Bramwell of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> praised the "dazzling visuals" and "artful commentary". "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Matt Miller highlighted "the well-written narration, excellent music, and bright visuals" as factors that made the game feel "like a storybook in which you control the outcome." Of the presentation elements, the story was the least praised, though several reviewers such as Noble enjoyed it, saying that it "just gets better the further you delve into it." Ryan Scott of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, however, termed it a "just-sorta-there plot", and Greg Miller said that it "could have been better" and never "hooked" him.

Reviewers had a more mixed opinion of the gameplay. Mackey praised the variety of gameplay elements and said that combat has "a deceptive amount of depth", but Bramwell felt that the combat did not "invite experimentation" and was somewhat disappointing. "Edge" said that the gameplay was "more interested in variety than challenge", for which he praised it, and Matt Miller said that combat was "a lot of fun", though he felt it lacked "the depth, speed, or complexity of a true action game". Greg Miller highlighted the variety of the gameplay as the best part of the game, and Scott called it "enjoyable", though not "challenging".

The game won several awards, both before and after publication. It was nominated for the 2011 <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a> awards at the Game Developers Conference in the Excellence In Visual Art and Excellence In Audio categories. It went on to win the <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Award</a> for Best Downloadable Game of <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202011">E3 2011</a>, and received a nomination for Best Original Game.

Over There (Fringe)

"Over There" is the two-part <a href="Fringe%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> <a href="Season%20finale">finale</a> of the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> science fiction drama series "<a href="Fringe%20%28TV%20series%29">Fringe</a>". They are the 22nd and 23rd episodes of the season, and the 42nd and 43rd episodes of the series overall. Both parts were written by <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning screenwriter <a href="Akiva%20Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a>, together with <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a>s <a href="Jeff%20Pinkner">Jeff Pinkner</a> and <a href="J.%20H.%20Wyman">J. H. Wyman</a>. Goldsman also served as director, his first such credit since the <a href="A%20New%20Day%20in%20the%20Old%20Town">season premiere</a>.

"Fringe"s premise is based on the idea of two <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">parallel universes</a>, our own and the Other Side, each of which contains historical idiosyncrasies. The two universes began to clash in 1985, after <a href="Walter%20Bishop%20%28Fringe%29">Dr. Walter Bishop</a> (<a href="John%20Noble">John Noble</a>) stole the parallel universe version of his son, <a href="Peter%20Bishop">Peter</a>, following his own son's death. The finale's narrative recounts what happens when Peter (<a href="Joshua%20Jackson">Joshua Jackson</a>) is taken back to the Other Side by his real father, dubbed <a href="Walter%20Bishop%20%28Fringe%29%23Walternate">"Walternate"</a> (Noble). <a href="FBI">FBI</a> agent <a href="Olivia%20Dunham">Olivia Dunham</a> (<a href="Anna%20Torv">Anna Torv</a>) and Walter lead a team of former <a href="Cortexiphan">Cortexiphan</a> test subjects to retrieve him, after discovering that Peter is an unwitting part of Walternate's plans to bring about the destruction of our universe using an ancient <a href="doomsday%20device">doomsday device</a>.

In the finale, the main characters spend the longest amount of time in the parallel universe to date. The writers sought to emphasize the differences between the two worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's <a href="doppelg%C3%A4nger">doppelg√§nger</a>, Fauxlivia; <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the <a href="Fringe%20%28season%203%29">third season</a>. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character <a href="Lincoln%20Lee">Lincoln Lee</a> (<a href="Seth%20Gabel">Seth Gabel</a>), as well as the return of actors <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> and <a href="Kirk%20Acevedo">Kirk Acevedo</a> as <a href="William%20Bell%20%28Fringe%29">William Bell</a> and Agent <a href="Charlie%20Francis%20%28Fringe%29">Charlie Francis</a>, respectively.

Although originally intended to air on the same night, the two parts were broadcast in the United States a week apart. On its initial airing on May 13, 2010, an estimated 5.99¬†million viewers watched part one. Part two aired on May 20, and was viewed by an estimated audience of 5.68¬†million. Both episodes received overwhelmingly positive reviews, and the season was chosen for a significant number of "best of" lists by various media outlets; many critics praised the second episode's <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> in particular. The finale was included in most of the categories at "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s voter-driven TV Season Finale Awards, placing first in two. Pinkner, Wyman, and Goldsman submitted both episodes for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">drama writing</a> and <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Directing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">directing</a> categories for the <a href="62nd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">62nd Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, and Nimoy submitted his work from the second episode for consideration in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a> category; none received a nomination.

<a href="Walter%20Bishop%20%28Fringe%29">Dr. Walter Bishop</a> (<a href="John%20Noble">John Noble</a>) and <a href="FBI">FBI</a> agent <a href="Olivia%20Dunham">Olivia Dunham</a> (<a href="Anna%20Torv">Anna Torv</a>) discover that <a href="Peter%20Bishop">Peter Bishop</a> (<a href="Joshua%20Jackson">Joshua Jackson</a>) has agreed to return with his real father, dubbed <a href="Walter%20Bishop%20%28Fringe%29%23Walternate">"Walternate"</a> (Noble), to <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">his own universe</a> called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious <a href="List%20of%20Fringe%20characters%23The%20Observer">Observer</a>s (<a href="Michael%20Cerveris">Michael Cerveris</a>) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible for the end of the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the <a href="Fringe%20%28TV%20series%29%23Premise">Fringe Division</a> work with biotechnology corporation <a href="Mythology%20of%20Fringe%23Massive%20Dynamic">Massive Dynamic</a> to come up with a way to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other <a href="Cortexiphan">Cortexiphan</a> test subjects who have unique abilities: <a href="List%20of%20Fringe%20characters%23Nick%20Lane">Nick Lane</a> (<a href="David%20Call">David Call</a>), <a href="Sally%20Clark%20%28Fringe%29">Sally Clark</a> (<a href="Pascale%20Hutton">Pascale Hutton</a>), and <a href="List%20of%20Fringe%20characters%23James%20Heath">James Heath</a> (<a href="Omar%20Metwally">Omar Metwally</a>), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team‚Äîcomposed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James‚Äîsuccessfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> on the Other Side.

Peter reunites with his real mother, <a href="Elizabeth%20Bishop%20%28Fringe%29">Elizabeth</a> (<a href="Orla%20Brady">Orla Brady</a>), while Walter's team journeys to meet with <a href="William%20Bell%20%28Fringe%29">William Bell</a> (<a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>) at <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>. But instead of Bell the alternate Fringe Division appears, and attacks Walter's team. Nick is shot and Sally stays with him; she produces a suicidal fireball that torches both her and Nick to ashes and severely burns the Other Side Fringe Division's principal investigator <a href="List%20of%20Fringe%20characters%23Lincoln%20Lee">Lincoln Lee</a> (<a href="Seth%20Gabel">Seth Gabel</a>). Walter is shot and walks to the hospital. Olivia follows her alternate counterpart and encounters Bell, who insists he did not betray their location to the Fringe Division and tells her that Walter is in trouble. Walternate is seen in the room housing the doomsday device Peter will be a part of, and leaves with its final component.

Walternate learns of Walter's presence in the hospital and dispatches "Fauxlivia" (Torv) and "Alt-Charlie" (<a href="Kirk%20Acevedo">Kirk Acevedo</a>) to apprehend him, but before their arrival Bell and Olivia liberate Walter and escape. Fauxlivia sees a surveillance shot of Olivia and Walter and decides to confer with Walternate about the doppelg√§ngers. During a discussion in his office, Walternate lies to Peter about the doomsday machine's real purpose, claiming it can help to heal both worlds. Fauxlivia meets Peter in Walternate's office and subsequently drives him to his new apartment. Walter and Bell travel to Harvard to collect some equipment necessary for the journey back to their own universe, and Walter reveals his intense dislike for Bell, whom he considers to have been a selfish war profiteer while he himself was locked away for seventeen years. Bell tells Walter that the parallel universe equivalent of himself died in a car accident as a young man. Olivia confronts Fauxlivia, who recognizes that Olivia has feelings for Peter. The women fight, and after rendering Fauxlivia unconscious Olivia dyes her hair to assume Fauxlivia's identity. Meanwhile, Peter discovers that the machine is symbiotic and needs a particular human to control it‚Äîhim.

Olivia and an oblivious alt-Charlie visit Peter to take him to a safe location. Olivia knocks out alt-Charlie and reveals herself to Peter, informing him of the machine's real purpose and Walternate's intentions. Peter tells her that he does not belong in either reality, following which Olivia admits her romantic feelings for him and convinces him to leave with her. The couple race to meet Walter and Bell at the Opera House, where Fauxlivia and a team of Fringe Commandos catch up with them. Bell and Olivia hold off the assault while Peter and Walter set up the dimensional device to enable their return home. Lacking a fuel source for the device, Bell sacrifices himself to create a nuclear reaction, using his body's unstable molecular state. Close to death, Bell reveals that he removed Walter's memories at his own request, and he and Walter are reconciled. Olivia, Walter, and Peter return home. Peter tells Walter he will never understand him, but because Walter traveled to another universe twice to save him‚Äîwhich has "gotta count for something"‚Äîhe forgives him. Olivia is revealed to be Fauxlivia, infiltrating Our Side, when she arrives at a <a href="Mythology%20of%20Fringe%23Shapeshifters">typewriter communication station</a> to await orders. The Olivia from our world is then seen in a military detention center on the Other Side. Walternate visits and stares at Olivia without speaking before leaving her in the dark, in solitary confinement.

"Over There" was written by <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning screenwriter and frequent "Fringe" collaborator <a href="Akiva%20Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a>, together with <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a>s <a href="Jeff%20Pinkner">Jeff Pinkner</a> and <a href="J.%20H.%20Wyman">J. H. Wyman</a>. Goldsman directed the episodes, his first such credit since the <a href="A%20New%20Day%20in%20the%20Old%20Town">season premiere</a>. He explained the finale in a January 2010 interview with "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>": "We're trying to do the last two episodes as a singular event, a little bit more movie-like. It's really one big story. We're approaching it like a mini-feature. It'll have a singular narrative drive." They originally intended for the two parts to air on the same night, but <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> told them it would be shown on two nights, a week apart. The episodes first aired in the United States on May 13 and May 20, 2010. The writers, finding the script to be easily divisible, ended the first episode with <a href="William%20Bell%20%28Fringe%29">William Bell</a> and <a href="Olivia%20Dunham">Olivia</a> meeting outside Fauxlivia's apartment, and began the second with Bell helping <a href="Walter%20Bishop%20%28Fringe%29">Walter</a> escape from the hospital.

Pinkner and Wyman brought back the "Cortexiphan kids", introduced in the first two seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted the end of the season to be a "beautiful culmination of everything" while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but "Over There" marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." Wyman said that the parallel universe "is a reminder to our viewers that your life is what your choices are." The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" that "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a>s or the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> if we didn't let it oxidize or the <a href="Hotel%20Attraction">Grand Central Hotel</a>, we're not making up. Had the <a href="LZ%20129%20Hindenburg">Hindenburg</a> not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the <a href="Empire%20State%20Building">Empire State Building</a>. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." Pinkner later elaborated, "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor <a href="Joshua%20Jackson">Joshua Jackson</a> are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of <a href="Peter%20Bishop">Peter</a> a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend <a href="Geoff%20Johns">Geoff Johns</a>, Chief Creative Officer at <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.

The finale introduces parallel-universe versions of familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress <a href="Anna%20Torv">Anna Torv</a>. One topic of conversation among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using "Fauxlivia", "Bolivia", and/or "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because a character in a <a href="Reciprocity%20%28Fringe%29">season three episode</a> referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." Torv further explained, "Olivia wants to be the best, but [Fauxlivia] just wants to win;" "There's just a front-footedness I think to [her], simply because she just doesn't carry the weight of the world on her shoulders like Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and [Fauxlivia]'s mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a>: "When [Torv] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities¬†... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this?

"Over There" marks the first time Olivia meets Fauxlivia. Their meeting was one of the first scenes to be shot; this caused Anna Torv to be anxious about her new character's traits "coming across", as she had not yet developed all her mannerisms for Fauxlivia. While filming the conversation between the two, they did not use a double; Torv memorized the timing and where she should be looking and pointing her gun, and the characters were filmed one at a time. Torv commented about the scene, "You're talking to air. Learning both sides¬†... was tough." For the fight scene that followed, Torv had to block and aim her gun carefully while being mindful of her movements and the camera's location‚Äîthough she was aided by stunt doubles. Torv credits the crew for successfully completing the scene: "I give them all the credit in the world. It took a while. They had to change the makeup, change the clothes, change the hair, change every little thing, every time they [moved] the camera."

A later scene depicts Walter in a hospital recovering from a gunshot wound. Olivia and William Bell try to smuggle him out. As it was a real emergency room in a Vancouver hospital, the crew had only one day of shooting. One of the scenes included "monitor acting", in which Torv had to react to a blank computer screen, because the writers had not yet chosen what images they wanted to display. The scene between Olivia, Walter, and Bell was originally set in a coffee shop, but the producers changed their minds when they realized they needed more funding for the finale. Consequently, they began "hawking" the scene in the hopes of gaining a sponsor. <a href="KFC">KFC</a> responded, agreeing to pay them for shooting the scene at one of their locations. Walternate's office scenes were shot in a <a href="mortuary">mortuary</a> overlooking a cemetery. Goldsman had Joshua Jackson react in different ways during his first meeting with Fauxlivia, including showing "anger and testiness". He ultimately decided he would be "quite taken with her". For the second episode's cliffhanger, the producers worried about making it as "provocative" as the <a href="There%27s%20More%20Than%20One%20of%20Everything">first season's</a>. They were originally going to have Olivia sacrifice herself to allow Peter and Walter's return to Our Side, but changed their minds when Wyman suggested she be secretly swapped with Fauxlivia instead. Wyman commented, "We were ecstatic when we figured [the cliffhanger] out." Co-creator <a href="J.J.%20Abrams">J.J. Abrams</a> and other cast members were also pleased with it, with Abrams calling it "different, but I think equally impactful." They wrote the cliffhanger before they knew whether the series had been renewed‚Äîthey would have had to make an "eleventh-hour redraft" had the show been canceled by Fox.

On April 5, 2010, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" reported that "<a href="Dirty%20Sexy%20Money">Dirty Sexy Money</a>" actor <a href="Seth%20Gabel">Seth Gabel</a> had been cast as the lead Fringe investigator in the parallel universe, and would be making his first appearance in the finale as a possible recurring character. Jeff Pinkner described the character as "the scientist-cop-leader of the team on the Other Side." In an interview with "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", Gabel commented that during shooting he felt that he looked "like such a doofus holding a gun," but changed his mind when he saw the finished production. Gabel elaborated, "I was so scared that I wouldn't pull it off. Once I saw myself being a scientist-slash-FBI hero, I felt more confident and relaxed." His character is caught in a large explosion in the finale, but Gabel confirmed, in a "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" interview, that his character would be returning for the third season. He states that the parallel universe has "special technology than can heal burns".

The finale marked the return of actor <a href="Kirk%20Acevedo">Kirk Acevedo</a> as the Other Side FBI agent <a href="Charlie%20Francis%20%28Fringe%29">Charlie Francis</a>. In the DVD audio commentary, the producers admit they "faced a bit of hatred" when they killed off Acevedo's character near the beginning of the season. They were aware the entire time that Charlie exists in the parallel universe, and that "nobody ever dies on "Fringe". Acevedo describes the parallel universe version of his character as someone who is "so much more fun." He is subtly different, with a lighter personality; he jokes around more, and is less "doom and gloom" than the original character. Some viewers refer to the new character as "alt-Charlie" to differentiate the two. The actor, the producers, and some fans have called the new character "Scarlie" in reference to a scar on his cheek, which takes ten minutes to apply before shooting, according to Acevedo. Previous guest actors <a href="Orla%20Brady">Orla Brady</a>, Lily Pilblad, <a href="Ari%20Graynor">Ari Graynor</a>, <a href="Omar%20Metwally">Omar Metwally</a>, <a href="Ryan%20McDonald%20%28actor%29">Ryan McDonald</a>, and <a href="David%20Call">David Call</a> appear in the finale, as well as new guest stars <a href="Philip%20Winchester">Philip Winchester</a> and <a href="Pascale%20Hutton">Pascale Hutton</a>.

Some cast members portray alternate versions of their characters, including <a href="John%20Noble">John Noble</a>, <a href="Lance%20Reddick">Lance Reddick</a>, and <a href="Jasika%20Nicole">Jasika Nicole</a>. Noble described his doppelg√§nger‚Äînicknamed "Walternate" by Walter‚Äîas "[physically] the same man and the same actor." He continued, "I think of [Walternate] as a soldier. He's like a general in the army. He's very upright, he's very strong." Reddick called alt-Broyles "a great patriot and a great mind," but "a bit of a maverick, so I guess we'll see just how that loyalty and relationship plays out." Nicole based "alterna-Astrid"s characteristics on her sister, who has <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, partly by avoiding eye contact with the other characters when relaying information to them and by focusing solely on the data in front of her.

Though guest actor Leonard Nimoy was reluctant to return after completing his three-episode commitment on the show that had ended with the season's <a href="Grey%20Matters%20%28Fringe%29">tenth episode</a>, he returned for the season finale when the producers "essentially called him up and pleaded". They discussed their plans for the character, and "told him it was a story we couldn't tell without him." He "graciously agreed." "Over There" marked Nimoy's longest appearance on "Fringe", a longer and "much more involv[ed]" <a href="Filmmaking%23Production">shoot</a> of roughly seven days was required. Despite Leonard Nimoy's planned exit from the show, the show's producers have said that nothing is final in the "Fringe" world. Pinkner commented that Nimoy's retirement from acting obviously hinders his character's possible return but, "if Leonard chooses to come back, there is a story in place that we'd love to tell." Wyman elaborated that "I think it's fair to say that you have not experienced the last of William Bell". When the producers told Nimoy their ideas for Bell's storyline in the third season, he returned for some brief voice and animation work in the episode "<a href="Lysergic%20Acid%20Diethylamide%20%28Fringe%29">Lysergic Acid Diethylamide</a>".

A number of <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a> references are used to subtly differentiate the two universes. The American drama series "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>" is beginning its 11th season in the parallel universe, and US politicians <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> and <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a> are in one of the show's advertisements. The parallel universe's <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> is still its original shiny copper. "We imagined that Over There, they really liked copper and they cleaned it all the time," one of the creators says. <a href="Liberty%20Island">Liberty Island</a> is the location of Fringe Division and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> on the Other Side. The <a href="Hotel%20Attraction">Hotel Attraction</a> project by Catalan architect <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaud√≠</a> was built in 1908 in the parallel universe, whereas in our world it never went past initial planning. Former president <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> is shown on a <a href="Dollar%20coin%20%28United%20States%29">dollar coin</a> in the parallel universe, rather than <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>. Fauxlivia finds a <a href="United%20States%20twenty-dollar%20bill">twenty-dollar bill</a> from Our Side and questions who <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> is, implying that he was either never president or is far less known in their universe. <a href="Civil%20rights">Civil rights</a> activist <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> is shown on their version of the bill, which has been nicknamed a "junior".

Aviator <a href="Charles%20Lindbergh">Charles Lindbergh</a> is less well known in the parallel universe, and the <a href="Lindbergh%20kidnapping">famous kidnapping</a> of his son presumably did not occur, as Fauxlivia expresses confusion when his name is brought up. When Walter, Bell, and Olivia are on the Other Side eating at <a href="KFC">KFC</a> (called KGC in the alternate universe, for Kentucky Grilled Chicken), Walter puts on a <a href="History%20of%20the%20Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> baseball cap. Unlike in Our Side, the team never moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles</a>. The parallel universe has a number of famous comic book issues from DC Comics, similar to Our Side, but with notable differences. For instance, the Red Arrow and Red Lantern exist on the Other Side, rather than the green versions of both characters in our universe, and there are different members in the <a href="Justice%20League">Justice League</a>. Fauxlivia's cellphone <a href="ringtone">ringtone</a> is taken from the 1975 film "<a href="The%20Rocky%20Horror%20Picture%20Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>". Other films, both real and invented, are also shown in the parallel universe, such as "Superman vs. Batman 2", "Indiana Jones and the Hex of the Hydra", "Star Wars: Legion of Droids", "Splash 7", "Smokey and the Bandit: The Final Lap" and "Mask vs. Joker".

Fox renewed "Fringe" for a third season in early March 2010. The episodes aired on May 13 and May 20, 2010, in the United States and Canada. On May 17 Fox announced that the show would remain in its Thursday timeslot for the new season. A deleted scene cut from the finale featured Walternate and Peter discussing the fictional band "<a href="The%20Firefly%20%28Fringe%29">Violet Sedan Chair</a>" while driving a <a href="Ford%20Taurus">Ford Taurus</a>; the scene's reference to a "Ford exclusive", as well as the perceived "loving shots" of the car, caused it to be noted as a prime example of <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a> by some critics. The scene was advertised during the second episode's commercial breaks in the US, advising viewers to view the clip at Fox's official website. As with other "Fringe" episodes, Fox released two science lesson plans for grade school children focusing on the science seen in both parts of "Over There"; the first part's intention was to have "students learn about how the various forms of energy can be converted into other forms of energy and how these conversions can be used to either disperse or concentrate energy." The second part's purpose was for "students [to] learn about how various types of sensors can be used to remotely collect information about a geographical area, which allows for unique scientific analyses and discoveries."

According to the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> system, upon its original US broadcast, part one garnered an estimated 5.99¬†million viewers and a 3.6/6 ratings share among all households. It received a 2.3/7 ratings share among adults 18‚Äì49. In keeping with the rest of its second season, "Fringe"s ratings suffered due to tough competition from episodes of <a href="CBS">CBS</a>'s "" and <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>'s "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>", as these programs were also broadcast in the same time slot. "Fringe" and its lead-in, "<a href="Bones%20%28TV%20series%29">Bones</a>", helped Fox place third for the night, behind CBS and ABC. The second part was viewed by an estimated 5.68¬†million viewers, with a 2.0 ratings share among adults 18‚Äì49. This was a 13 percent fall in the 18‚Äì49 ratings share from the previous week, as the second episode faced competition from the <a href="Meat%20Jekyll">season finale</a> of "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and the two-part season finale of "Grey's Anatomy". "Over There's" second part helped Fox place third for total viewers that night, behind CBS and ABC, and tie with <a href="NBC">NBC</a> for third place among viewers 18‚Äì49.

The finale aired on two separate nights in the United Kingdom. The first part was scheduled to air on May 25, 2010, on the UK's <a href="Sky1">Sky1</a>, but was put back a week to make room for the <a href="The%20End%20%28Lost%29">series finale</a> of "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>". The first part aired on June 1 in the UK, with an estimated 195,000 viewers tuning in. The second part aired on June 8 to an estimated 246,000 viewers.

The first part of the finale received critical acclaim. Ramsey Isler of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> thought it "fantastic," because it was "a great story that leads us into one hell of a conclusion to the season," and that it "right away [gave] us the deepest, most exciting look into the alternate universe we've seen so far." He rated it 9.0/10. Ken Tucker from "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" and <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s Josh Wigler agreed on this last point, with Tucker noting the first part "was a complete success and a blast at giving us a fully lived-in alternate universe." Noel Murray of "<a href="The%20Onion">The Onion</a>"s <a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a> graded the first part with an A‚àí, calling it "a fun, exciting episode that nicely set up next week's finale". Isler, Wigler, and Murray loved the return of the Cortexifan subjects; Murray docked the episode a half point, explaining "I love the idea of Olivia & The Cortexifanatics so much that I'm bummed "Fringe" burned through the group so quickly." Critic Andrew Hanson, writing for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", noted that because of the parallel universe focus, the first part felt like the following season's premiere. He praised the opening scene, and believed the scenes between Peter and his mother helped "ground the episode. They might be out of pace with the action and drama pouring out of every other moment, but there was weight and emotion. Bravo Joshua Jackson and Orla Brady. Bravo." Ken Tucker noted that the scenes with Peter and his true mother indicated "a great, humantistic use of a sci-fi trope". MTV's Josh Wigler praised Torv's performance, but wished the two-part finale was not broken up, explaining "I could have easily tuned in for another several hours. Heck, I could watch an entire parallel series focused solely on the alternate universe!"

Like part one, the second part premiered to critical acclaim. IGN's Ramsey Isler wrote that it "changed the whole landscape of the show's main plot arc. Although there were some rough spots in the execution of this story, overall it's one hell of a way to end the season." He rated the episode 8.6/10. While praising Noble's performance, Isler criticized some plot aspects. He was "kind of torn" on the Peter-Olivia kiss, wished Peter and the doomsday device had been set up more for the third season, and believed the Olivia-Fauxlivia interaction to be "a little strange," as the two went from discussing their respective families to "ass kicking". Isler did praise the fight itself. Ken Tucker praised the acting and the writers, noting "The fact that the series can accommodate a fan like me only confirms what a well-wrought piece of pop culture "Fringe" has become." Tucker included the second part of the season in his mid-year "Top 10" list for 2010, partly attributing this ranking to "Fringe" "offer[ing] the season's best cliffhanger", alongside "<a href="Breaking%20Bad">Breaking Bad</a>". Noel Murray declared that he enjoyed part two slightly more, grading it an A. He praised Torv and Noble's performances for "inhabiting their respective worlds so well", and Goldsman for "[shooting] this episode with an emphasis on the characters more than the setting".

Andrew Hanson of the "Los Angeles Times" felt the second part fulfilled all of the criteria for an incredible season finale: the season's arc had a "pay-off" he "didn't see coming" in the aftermath of Walternate crossing universes to take back Peter; the entire episode was an "event" because it spent more time in the parallel universe than ever before, and it had an "A+ cliffhanger". MTV's "Fringe" reviewer Josh Wigler enjoyed the ending, calling it "one heck of a cliffhanger!" <a href="James%20Poniewozik">James Poniewozik</a> from "<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time Magazine</a>" positively compared both parts of the finale to "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", writing that, unlike that series, "Fringe"s standalone episodes contribute to the overall mythology of the show. To him the finale "demonstrates how well the show now manages to balance its far-fetched sci-fi with grounded character storylines." Poniewozik concluded his review by expressing that it was not as strong as "<a href="Peter%20%28Fringe%29">Peter</a>", but Over There' was a season-ender that did what it should‚Äîleft me wanting more".

Many critics praised the many subtle differences between the two universes, while others lauded Leonard Nimoy's appearance as William Bell and his scenes with Walter. Website blogger <a href="io9">io9</a> listed both parts of "Over There" as one of the select few "crucial" episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show, referring to it as "one of the most epic season finales ever". Another io9 reviewer called the ending one of the "best SF/fantasy cliffhangers ever shown on television" in a September 2010 list. The finale helped propel "Fringe" onto a number of 2010 "best of television" lists, including <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>, "Entertainment Weekly", the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>", "<a href="The%20Daily%20Beast">The Daily Beast</a>", "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>, the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>", and IGN; the last of these named "Fringe" the best sci-fi series of 2010, beating fellow nominees "Lost", "<a href="Caprica%20%28TV%20series%29">Caprica</a>", and "<a href="Stargate%20Universe">Stargate Universe</a>". Some critics predicted that, because of the increased focus on looking into the alternate universe and advancing its mythology, "Fringe"s "<a href="Villain%20of%20the%20week">monster-of-the-week</a>" episodes would become less frequent. This could make it more difficult for casual viewers to follow the show in its third season.

Writers J.H. Wyman, Jeff Pinkner, and Akiva Goldsman submitted both parts of "Over There" for consideration in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series</a> category at the <a href="62nd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">62nd Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, and director Goldsman made a submission of both parts for the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Directing%20for%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series</a> category. None of the three secured a nomination. Leonard Nimoy submitted part two for consideration in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a> category. He and fellow guest actor <a href="Peter%20Weller">Peter Weller</a> (who appeared in "<a href="White%20Tulip">White Tulip</a>") were not chosen for nominations. At "Entertainment Weekly"s June 2010 voter-driven TV Season Finale Awards, "Fringe" was nominated for multiple awards, and won in several categories. The Olivia-Fauxlivia swap was named the "Best Non-Romantic Cliff-hanger" of the season and placed third for the "Single Most Clever Twist", but it also came in third place for "Single Weakest Twist". The ending scene with Walternate and Olivia was voted the winner of the "Spookiest Image" category. Olivia's kiss with Peter finished in fifth place for the "Best Kiss" category, and her fight with Fauxlivia placed second in the "Best Fight" category. In the "Biggest Regret That I Didn't See the Finale, I Just Read About It" category "Fringe" won third place.

The Turn of the Screw (2009 film)

The Turn of the Screw (also known as Ghost Story: The Turn of the Screw) is a British <a href="television%20film">television film</a> based on <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>'s 1898 ghost story <a href="The%20Turn%20of%20the%20Screw">of the same name</a>. Commissioned and produced by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009, on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>. The novella was adapted for the screen by <a href="Sandy%20Welch">Sandy Welch</a>, and the film was directed by <a href="Tim%20Fywell">Tim Fywell</a>. Although generally true to the tone and story of James's work, the film is set in the 1920s‚Äîin contrast to the original 1840s setting‚Äîand accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella. The film's story is told in <a href="flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> during consultations between the institutionalised Ann (<a href="Michelle%20Dockery">Michelle Dockery</a>) and Dr Fisher (<a href="Dan%20Stevens">Dan Stevens</a>). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (<a href="Mark%20Umbers">Mark Umbers</a>) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (<a href="Eva%20Sayer">Eva Sayer</a>). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (<a href="Sue%20Johnston">Sue Johnston</a>), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation.

Critics were divided in their reviews of "The Turn of the Screw". The acting and tone of the production were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its <a href="ambiguity">ambiguity</a>, and critics disagreed about the extent to which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. "The Turn of the Screw" was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.

The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> had previously adapted several horror stories as Christmas films, with their series "<a href="A%20Ghost%20Story%20for%20Christmas">A Ghost Story for Christmas</a>" including adaptations of the <a href="M.%20R.%20James">M. R. James</a> stories "<a href="The%20Stalls%20of%20Barchester%20Cathedral">The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral</a>" (filmed as "<a href="The%20Stalls%20of%20Barchester">The Stalls of Barchester</a>"), "<a href="A%20Warning%20to%20the%20Curious">A Warning to the Curious</a>", "<a href="Lost%20Hearts">Lost Hearts</a>", "<a href="The%20Treasure%20of%20Abbot%20Thomas">The Treasure of Abbot Thomas</a>" and "<a href="The%20Ash%20Tree">The Ash Tree</a>". "The Turn of the Screw" fits into this "mini-genre" of the Christmas horror film. The BBC executive and drama commissioner <a href="Ben%20Stephenson">Ben Stephenson</a>, discussing "The Turn of the Screw", said that "Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without a ghost story for the adults to watch in front of the fire when the children are in bed, and they don't get more chilling than this bold reimagining of the classic Henry James tale." The film was commissioned by Stephenson and <a href="Jay%20Hunt%20%28television%20executive%29">Jay Hunt</a>, then controller of BBC One. It was directed by <a href="Tim%20Fywell">Tim Fywell</a>, and produced by <a href="Colin%20Wratten">Colin Wratten</a>; the executive producer was <a href="Jessica%20Pope">Jessica Pope</a>.

The film is an adaptation of <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>'s 1898 novella "<a href="The%20Turn%20of%20the%20Screw">The Turn of the Screw</a>". As one of his more popular stories it had already been adapted for films and television many times, although not previously by the BBC. The adaptation was screenwritten by <a href="Sandy%20Welch">Sandy Welch</a>, who set the film in the early 1920s, in contrast to the novella's 1840s setting. This allowed the introduction of the <a href="Freudian">Freudian</a> psychiatrist interviewing the main character; this <a href="Frame%20story">framing device</a> is not used by James, but both the novella and the film share a <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-person narrator</a>. The updated setting also allowed the First World War to account for the lack of male staff at the house. The Freudian and libidinous elements some literary theorists have seen in James's story are particularly prevalent in the film, with Ann's repressed sexual feelings for the Master resulting in a number of highly sexual sequences. Further, Welch added a <a href="theological">theological</a> element not present in James's story; Ann's father is a <a href="preacher">preacher</a>, although Ann herself is unsure of her faith. The psychiatrist, by contrast, is an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>. When he asks Ann about her faith, she replies that she believes in the <a href="Devil">Devil</a>.

The changes to the story were mostly superficial, and the adaptation generally mirrors the novella's tone. The television critic <a href="Matthew%20Baylis">Matthew Baylis</a> observed that the film creates unease and horror through distortions of reality, and that "The Turn of the Screw" is not a "screaming-banshees-and-horrible-corpses style of ghost story". The film utilises subtle horror, including details such as a broken doll on a window ledge, and the fact that viewers never discover certain elements of the story (for example, it is never revealed why the character Miles has been suspended from his boarding school). This, for Baylis, ties to the title of the film: "it's the writer who puts the screw in the hole and the best ones ask the audience to turn it themselves".

"The Turn of the Screw" was filmed <a href="Location%20shooting">on location</a> in the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> of England, beginning in August 2009. The scenes at Bly were filmed at <a href="Brympton%20d%27Evercy">Brympton d'Evercy</a>, a <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a> near <a href="Yeovil">Yeovil</a>, <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>. Brympton was chosen because of its similarity to Bly House, as described by James, including its extensive grounds and large lake. The railway scenes were filmed at the <a href="East%20Somerset%20Railway">East Somerset Railway</a>.

"The Turn of the Screw" starred <a href="Michelle%20Dockery">Michelle Dockery</a> as Ann, <a href="Sue%20Johnston">Sue Johnston</a> as Mrs Sarah Grose, <a href="Dan%20Stevens">Dan Stevens</a> as Dr Fisher, <a href="Mark%20Umbers">Mark Umbers</a> as the Master, <a href="Nicola%20Walker">Nicola Walker</a> as Carla, <a href="Edward%20MacLiam">Edward MacLiam</a> as Peter Quint and Katie Lightfoot as Emily Jessel. <a href="Corin%20Redgrave">Corin Redgrave</a>, who played the professor, was the son of <a href="Michael%20Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a>, who starred in "<a href="The%20Innocents%20%281961%20film%29">The Innocents</a>", a 1961 adaption of "The Turn of the Screw". The children, Flora and Miles, were played respectively by <a href="Eva%20Sayer">Eva Sayer</a> and Josef Lindsay. However, due to the sexual content of the film, the child actors did not attend the preview screenings.

"The Turn of the Screw" was first shown at 9 pm on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> on 30 December 2009, as part of the BBC's Christmas 2009 season. It has since been broadcast on other BBC channels and on <a href="Drama%20%28TV%20channel%29">Drama</a>. In the UK, the film was released on DVD on 1 March 2010, and distributed by <a href="Acorn%20Media%20UK">Acorn Media UK</a>. The DVD was rated "15" by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a> for "infrequent scenes of strong sex". The film was released on DVD for the North American market as "Ghost Story: The Turn of the Screw" on 28 April 2015. The DVD was <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system%23Other%20labels">unrated</a> and had no extra features. Foreign language versions of the film include television screenings or DVD releases of the film in German ("Schloss des Schreckens"), Finnish ("Ruuvikierre") and Polish ("W kleszczach lƒôku").

The film's story is told in a series of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> interspersed with discussions between Ann (Dockery), a patient in a sanatorium, and Dr Fisher (Stevens), a sceptical and atheistic psychiatrist. Despite the suggestion of his superior (Redgrave) that he focus upon soldiers who have returned from the First World War, Fisher wishes to help Ann if he can.

In flashbacks, Ann is hired by a wealthy and sophisticated aristocrat (Umbers) to act as a governess for his orphaned nephew and niece who live at Bly. He tells her that he is not to be bothered in London, and that Ann is to deal with any problems that may arise. Ann travels to Bly, where she meets the all-female household staff‚Äîled by Mrs Sarah Grose (Johnston), the housekeeper‚Äîand then the young Flora (Sayer), one of Ann's new pupils. Ann finds the house somewhat unnerving, and the staff standoffish and unwilling to talk. Ann subsequently receives a letter informing her that Miles (Lindsay), her other pupil, has been expelled from his boarding school, but is assured by Mrs Grose that Miles is well behaved. When he arrives at Bly, Ann finds Miles to be charming, and although he does not explain what happened at school, she does not push him. Her interactions with the children are idyllic, and they sail on Bly's lake and enjoy picnics together. Meanwhile, Ann fantasises about the Master, futilely hoping that he will visit.

Ann discovers that her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), is buried in Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures of a young man and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly affected by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.

Ann believes the figures to be the ghosts of Quint and Jessel, seeking to continue their passionate and violent sexual encounters through Miles and Flora. However, she is concerned to find that others apparently cannot see the ghosts. She then begins to suspect that Miles and Flora, having been groomed by and involved in the activities of Quint and Jessel, may be deliberately seeking to bring the pair back. She resolves to leave Bly, but, when saying goodbye to Miles, learns that he, too, sees the figures. Minutes after leaving, she asks to be taken back. Later, Ann panics, believing Miles and Flora to have left the house. She finds them by the lake, but they are playing roughly; when Miles pushes Flora's head under the water, Ann sees the pair as Quint and Jessel. She rushes to intervene, and grapples with the figure which alternates between Quint and Miles. When Ann repeatedly strikes Miles, Mrs Grose stops her, and Flora says that she no longer wishes to see Ann. After ordering the staff and Flora away from Bly, Ann waits with Miles to confront Quint. The pair are scared, but when Quint arrives Ann tells Miles to demand that Quint leave him alone. Miles (speaking with Quint's voice) shouts at Ann, but eventually (in his own voice) tells the ghostly Quint that he wishes him to leave. Ann embraces Miles, whose body goes limp.

Ann is found some time later by the police, clutching Miles's dead body, but she refuses to speak of what happened until meeting Dr Fisher. He seems to accept Ann's story, unconvinced by his own <a href="psychosexual">psychosexual</a> explanations of her visions. Fisher is dismayed to see Ann led away by the police, accused of Miles's murder, and he sees Quint's face on one of the officers. The film closes with a new governess arriving at Bly.

The critical response to "The Turn of the Screw" was mixed. The film was praised by <a href="Matthew%20Baylis">Matt Baylis</a>, writing in "The Express", as one of the better adaptations of James's story. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"s David Chater, although he did not consider the film "terrifying" or "suppurate[d] in evil", found it "never less than absorbing", suspecting this would be particularly so for viewers unfamiliar with the story. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"s Simon Horsford felt that "The Turn of the Screw" "might not work on all levels but it is an unsettling interpretation nonetheless". By contrast, <a href="Tom%20Sutcliffe%20%28broadcaster%29">Tom Sutcliffe</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", was unimpressed with the film, considering James's novel to have been "comprehensively vandalised", while Richard Whittaker, writing in "<a href="The%20Austin%20Chronicle">The Austin Chronicle</a>", felt that the film was "a particular and peculiar misfire" from Welch. "The Turn of the Screw" was chosen as "pick of the day" in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", despite the reviewer, Victoria Segal, expressing her view that the film was "far from perfect". But she added that the flaws could be overlooked, and although there are times "when it grinds through the gears with a clunk and clatter", the "spirit" of James's story is retained.

Several other critics praised the way that the film had kept the tone of James's story and the subtle approach to horror. This subtlety, according to a review in the "<a href="Western%20Morning%20News">Western Morning News</a>", hit "exactly the right note of terror", and the film was praised as genuinely scary by some critics. Whittaker, though generally critical of the film, felt it strongest when focussed on the house, children and ghosts. Paul Whitelaw, writing in "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>", commended Welch and Fywell for sustaining a horrific atmosphere, and noted that the soundtrack added to the horror. For him, even the use of horror clich√©s was effective, contributing to the film's atmosphere. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Phil Hogan expressed a contrary opinion: while he thought "The Turn of the Screw" "exquisitely turned out", he felt the film's use of clich√©s limited the extent to which it was actually scary. In a review for "<a href="The%20Leader-Post">The Leader-Post</a>", Andy Cooper praised the "creepy atmosphere" and tension, but said that the film "[fell] short in the chills department" and "could have done with a few jolts of terror to breathe more life into it".

The divergences from the original novella's plot were generally not well received. Tim Teeman, reviewing "The Turn of the Screw" for "The Times", felt the 1920s setting did not contribute to the story, as it was not properly developed. He compared the film to <a href="Sarah%20Waters">Sarah Waters</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Little%20Stranger">The Little Stranger</a>", a ghost story set in the 1920s in which the social upheavals of the decade are explored. Gerard Gilbert, writing both for "The Independent" and <a href="The%20Arts%20Desk">The Arts Desk</a>, felt that Ann's relationship to the Master was "unnecessarily sexed up", and that this element added nothing to the story, and, in fact, detracted from it. In his review of the American DVD release for the "<a href="Deseret%20Morning%20News">Deseret Morning News</a>", Chris Hicks said that he could not see why the changes had been made, and that the literalisation of the sex and violence detracted from the film. Whittaker suggested that "The Turn of the Screw" was "oddly sexually explicit", and that the changes were unnecessary for the plot. The biggest problem, he suggested, was the introduction of the psychiatrist; his discussions with Ann, which could easily be removed, served to remove the mystery from the plot, in Whittaker's eyes. Sutcliffe was critical of the reframing of the story as a stereotypical account of how "a cocky young man of science has his certainties upturned", and said the film took "the terrifying indeterminacies of the original", turning them "into a slightly shabby ghost-train ride".

Critics disagreed about how successful the film was in capturing the novel's ambiguity, which is part of the enduring appeal of James's story. For <a href="Tim%20Dowling">Tim Dowling</a>, a columnist for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways." As a result, "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story‚Äîuncertainty‚Äîvanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us." By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for "The Times") felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. "The Scotsman"s Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.

The cast of the film were praised, with Dowling considering "The Turn of the Screw" "a slick production with strong performances", and Cooper saying that the film features "a great supporting cast". Critics particularly commended the performances of Dockery and Johnston. Dowling also picked out the performances of Lindsay and Sayer as worthy of note, while Whitelaw praised MacLiam, who was able "to personify pure evil with scarcely a line of dialogue". Segal, by contrast, felt MacLiam was badly cast, which resulted in "one of the story's primary dark forces [looking] more like a member of <a href="Elbow%20%28band%29">Elbow</a> than the very essence of evil".

James's novella "The Turn of the Screw" has been much analysed in academic literature, and, given that it has been frequently reinterpreted in the arts, discussion of many of the adaptations has found a place in the academic literature on Henry James and <a href="neo-Victorian">neo-Victorian</a> culture. Considering the <a href="frame%20narrative">frame narrative</a> of the film, Anna Viola Sborgi, a literary theorist, argues that the fact that Ann begins the film in a sanatorium conveys the impression that the character is mad, resulting in a loss of ambiguity. Consequently, the film is left less a horror story and more a <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a>. Sborgi argues that the film is explicitly made psychological through particular narrative and visual choices; for example, Miles appears at the train station in a ghost-like way through a cloud of steam. The fact that the film is a thriller, she argues, is further expressed through the use of a collage of images before the opening scene. However, the use of horrific imagery (including an open grave) in the collage "highlight[s] the contradiction inherent in this rendering of the novella": while the story is presented as psychological, the viewer is nonetheless drawn into the film as a horror story. Other than the atypical frame narrative, Sborgi considers the adaptation fairly conventional with regard to both setting and costume.

For the literary theorist Thomas S. Hischak, "The Turn of the Screw" is a weak adaptation of the novella, with poor acting which can be "ascribed to the trite, anachronistic dialogue and leaden direction". He likens the film to "<a href="In%20a%20Dark%20Place">In a Dark Place</a>" (2006), another film adaptation of James's novella, which focuses upon the supposed sexual aspects of the story. For Hischack, the 2009 film presents a governess who is not successful in <a href="sexual%20repression">repressing her sexuality</a>. Ann's fantasies of her own sexual encounters with the Master, as well as her visions of the sexual encounters between Quint and Jessel, "are among the many obvious and clumsy aspects of this adaptation". Like Sborgi, Hischak sees little ambiguity in the film, calling it a "misguided adaptation that likes to spell things out for the viewer".

Astonishing Stories

Astonishing Stories was an American <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, published by <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a> between 1940 and 1943. It was founded under Popular's "Fictioneers" imprint, which paid lower rates than Popular's other magazines. The magazine's first editor was <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, who also edited a companion publication, "<a href="Super%20Science%20Stories">Super Science Stories</a>". After nine issues Pohl was replaced by <a href="Alden%20H.%20Norton">Alden H. Norton</a>, who subsequently rehired Pohl as an assistant. The budget for "Astonishing" was very low, which made it difficult to acquire good fiction, but through his membership in the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of young <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fans</a> and aspiring writers, Pohl was able to find material to fill the early issues. The magazine was successful, and Pohl was able to increase his pay rates slightly within a year. He managed to obtain stories by writers who subsequently became very well known, such as <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> and <a href="Robert%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>. After Pohl entered the army in early 1943, wartime paper shortages led Popular to cease publication of "Astonishing". The final issue was dated April of that year.

The magazine was never regarded as one of the leading titles of the genre, but despite the low budget it published some well-received material. Science fiction critic <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> comments that "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and this view has been echoed by other historians of the field.

Although science fiction had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. By the end of the 1930s the field was booming, and several new sf magazines were launched in 1939. <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, a young science fiction reader, was looking for a job that year. He visited Robert Erisman, who was the editor of two pulps, "<a href="Marvel%20Science%20Stories">Marvel Science Stories</a>" and "<a href="Dynamic%20Science%20Stories">Dynamic Science Stories</a>", to ask for a job as an assistant. Erisman turned him down, but suggested that Pohl contact <a href="Rogers%20Terrill">Rogers Terrill</a> at <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, a leading pulp publisher. Erisman had heard that Popular was starting a new line of magazines, and thought that they might be interested in adding a science fiction title. On October 25, 1939, Pohl visited Terrill and persuaded him to give the idea a try, and left Terrill's office having been hired, at the age of nineteen, to edit two new magazines, on a salary of ten dollars per week. One was "<a href="Super%20Science%20Stories">Super Science Stories</a>"; the other was at one point intended to be titled "Incredible Stories", but ultimately appeared as "Astonishing Stories".

Popular was uncertain of the sales potential for the two new titles and decided to publish them under its Fictioneers imprint, which was used for lower-paying magazines. "Astonishing"s first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with "Super Science Stories". Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls <a href="Harry%20Steeger">Harry Steeger</a>, one of the company owners, breaking down the budget for him: "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper than any of the other sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. Pohl later commented that he was uncertain whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. Some of the additional money went to long-time writer <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate. Pohl comments in his memoirs that "for months he would turn up regularly as clockwork and sell me a new story; I hated them all, and bought them all."

Pohl stretched his budget by reducing the space he needed to fill with fiction. For example, a long letter column took up several pages but required no payment; similarly, running advertisements for Popular's other magazines did not use up the fiction budget. Some authors sent inaccurate word counts with the stories they submitted, and Popular saved money by paying them on the basis of whichever word count was less‚Äîthe author's or one done by Popular's staff. The result was a saving of forty to fifty dollars per issue. More money was saved by reusing snipped elements of black and white illustrations to fill space, as multiple uses of the same artwork did not require additional payments to the artist.

Towards the end of 1940 Popular doubled Pohl's salary to twenty dollars per week. In June 1941 Pohl went to see Steeger to ask for a further raise; he was planning to resign and work as a free-lance writer if he did not get more pay. Steeger, in Pohl's words, "had complaints of his own", and was not receptive; by the end of the meeting Pohl had lost his job as editor. Pohl later commented "I have never been sure whether I quit or got fired." Instead of replacing Pohl, Popular assigned editor-in-chief <a href="Alden%20H.%20Norton">Alden H. Norton</a> to add the magazines to his responsibilities. The arrangement lasted for seven months, after which Norton asked Pohl to return as his assistant. Norton offered Pohl a higher salary as an associate editor than he had received as the editor, and Pohl quickly accepted.

Pohl was not eligible to be drafted for military service as he was married, but by the end of 1942 his marriage was over and he decided to enlist. As voluntary enlistment was suspended he was unable to immediately join the army, but eventually was inducted on April 1, 1943. Paper was difficult to obtain because of the war, and Popular decided to close the magazine down; the final issue, dated April 1943, was assembled with the assistance of <a href="Ejler%20Jakobsson">Ejler Jakobsson</a>.

Because of the low rates of pay, the stories submitted to "Astonishing" in its first year had generally already been rejected elsewhere. However, Pohl was a member of the <a href="Futurians">Futurians</a>, a group of science fiction fans that included <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="C.M.%20Kornbluth">C.M. Kornbluth</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wilson%20%28author%29">Richard Wilson</a> and <a href="Donald%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a>; the Futurians were eager to become professional writers and were glad to submit stories to Pohl. Asimov recalls in his memoirs that on October 27, 1939, two days after Pohl was hired to edit the magazines, Pohl turned up at Asimov's apartment and asked to buy "<a href="Half-Breed%20%28short%20story%29">Half-Breed</a>", a story Pohl had been trying to sell on Asimov's behalf since June of that year. Pohl needed stories quickly for the first issue of "Astonishing" (though the name had not yet been selected), and as the story had been rejected by "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>" and "<a href="Astounding%20Stories">Astounding Stories</a>", Asimov was willing to sell it for half a cent per word. A couple of weeks later Pohl also acquired "<a href="The%20Callistan%20Menace">The Callistan Menace</a>" from Asimov. The other Futurians were prolific as well; in Pohl's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>, another of the Futurians, recalled in his memoirs that Pohl once asked the group for a story to fill out an issue, with $35 available to pay for it. Kornbluth and Wilson wrote a first draft, alternating turns at the typewriter; the result was edited by Harry Dockweiler, another Futurian, and then again by Pohl before it appeared in the April 1940 "Astonishing" under the title "Stepsons of Mars", with a byline of "Ivar Towers". Pohl contributed material himself, using the pseudonyms "James McCreigh" and "Dirk Wylie" (the latter pseudonym was also used by Dockweiler); he used his own stories when he needed to fill an issue, and to supplement his salary of ten dollars a week. Particularly after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over, and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines. When Pohl lost his job as editor in late 1941, he had bought from himself (and paid for) a couple of stories that he had not actually written, and hence had to write them very quickly and turn them in.

The first issue of "Astonishing Stories" was dated February 1940; the lead story was "Chameleon Planet" by <a href="John%20Russell%20Fearn">John Russell Fearn</a>, and it also included Asimov's "Half-Breed" and fiction by <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a> and <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a>. Despite the difficulties caused by the low budget, Pohl was able to pay his authors promptly, unlike some of his competitors, and he thus began to receive stories of higher quality. Sf historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> identifies "The Last Drop", by <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> as one of the better stories in "Astonishing"; historians Milton Wolf and <a href="Raymond%20H.%20Thompson">Raymond H. Thompson</a> consider the story to be unimpressive, and point instead to <a href="Alfred%20Bester">Alfred Bester</a>'s "The Pet Nebula" in the February 1941 issue. Kuttner's "Soldiers of Space" and <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>'s "It Happened Tomorrow", both of which appeared in the February 1943 issue, are also praised. Pohl was also able to print the first three of <a href="Ross%20Rocklynne">Ross Rocklynne</a>'s well-liked "Into the Darkness" series. Other well-known writers who appeared in the pages of "Astonishing" include <a href="Leigh%20Brackett">Leigh Brackett</a>, <a href="Clifford%20Simak">Clifford Simak</a>, and <a href="E.%20E.%20Smith">E. E. Smith</a>.

Pohl told his readers in "Astonishing"s first issue that he would listen to their feedback and respond to their requests. In addition to paying attention to their comments on stories, he included departments in the magazine that encouraged interaction with the fans, such as a letter column, a section that listed fanzines with names and addresses, and a review column. The reviews, primarily by Wollheim, but also including contributions from Richard Wilson, <a href="Forrest%20Ackerman">Forrest Ackerman</a>, and <a href="John%20Michel">John Michel</a>, were of a higher standard than elsewhere in the field, and historian Paul Carter regards "Astonishing" and "Super Science Stories" as the place where "book reviewing for the first time began to merit the term 'literary criticism, and adds that "it was in those magazines that the custom began of paying attention to science fiction on the stage and screen also."

The artwork in "Astonishing" was initially quite poor, which was unsurprising given the minuscule budget Pohl had to work with. Much of the art was supplied by fans and artists early in their careers, including Doris Baumgardt (under the pseudonym <a href="Leslie%20Perri">Leslie Perri</a>) and Dorothy Les Tina, who later became Pohl's first and second wives, respectively. One fan artist who stood out from the rest was <a href="Hannes%20Bok">Hannes Bok</a>, who went on to become a well-respected artist with a very distinctive style. <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> commented positively on Bok's work in a letter in the August 1940 "Astonishing", and Bok subsequently illustrated a story of Bradbury's in the April 1943 issue. Aleck Portegal, Popular's art director, had initially told Pohl that the regular artists would be unwilling to work for the low rates he could offer, but in the event some of them were willing to take less pay to get the extra work. More professional art began to appear in the magazine, including work by <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Leydenfrost">Alexander Leydenfrost</a>, <a href="Leo%20Morey">Leo Morey</a>, <a href="Hans%20Wessolowski">Hans Wessolowski</a>, and <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a>, all well known in the field. Some art appeared under the name Stephen Lawrence, which was known to be a pseudonym of <a href="Lawrence%20Stevens%20%28artist%29">Lawrence Stevens</a>, but it was subsequently discovered that some of this work was actually by Lawrence Stevens' son Peter.

"Astonishing Stories" is not remembered as being among the best science fiction magazines: both critic <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> and sf writer <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a> have described it as a "training ground" for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. However, Nicholls adds that "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that "there was much that was memorable in "Astonishing", both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. He quotes as an example his serialization of <a href="Malcolm%20Jameson">Malcolm Jameson</a>'s story "Quicksands of Youthwardness" in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding "With what I know now I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".

"Astonishing Stories" was edited by Frederik Pohl from February 1940 through September 1941 (nine issues), and then by Alden H. Norton from November 1941 through April 1943 (seven issues). It was published by Fictioneers, Inc., a subsidiary of Popular Publications. It was pulp-sized throughout its run, with 112 pages and a cover price of 10 cents. The volume numbering was regular, with four volumes of four numbers. It was bimonthly for the first eight issues; the next four were on an irregular schedule, and the last four, from October 1942, were bimonthly again.

A Canadian edition appeared for three issues, dated January, March, and May 1942, published by Popular Publications' Toronto branch. It was priced at 10 cents and ran to 96 pages; it was also in pulp format, but fractionally larger than the US version. The first and third issues reprinted the November 1941 and March 1942 US issues of "Astonishing", but the March 1942 Canadian issue was a reprint of the November 1941 "Super Science Stories", omitting one story. The covers in all three issues were replaced by new paintings, and the interior artwork was also different. The artists responsible for the new illustrations and covers were not credited. In August 1942 a Canadian edition of "Super Science Stories" began which also alternated between reprinting the US editions of "Astonishing" and "Super Science Stories"; this could be regarded as a continuation of the Canadian edition of "Astonishing", although the volume numbering was restarted at volume 1 number 1 when the name was changed.

Peter Jeffrey (RAAF officer)

Peter Jeffrey, (6 July 1913¬†‚Äì 6¬†April 1997) was a senior officer and <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Born in <a href="Tenterfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tenterfield</a>, New South Wales, he joined the RAAF active reserve in 1934, and transferred to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) shortly before World War¬†II. Posted to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a> in July 1940, Jeffrey saw action with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†3 Squadron</a> and took command of the unit the following year, earning the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for his energy and fighting skills. He was appointed <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a> of <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20wings">No.¬†234 Wing RAF</a> in November 1941, and became an ace the same month with his fifth solo victory. The next month he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> for his achievements, which included rescuing a fellow pilot who had crash landed in the desert.

In 1942, Jeffrey was posted to the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>, where he helped organise <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†75 Squadron</a> for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">defence of Port Moresby</a>, and <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†76 Squadron</a> prior to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Battle of Milne Bay</a>. He served two stints in charge of <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No.¬†2 Operational Training Unit</a> in southern Australia before the end of the war, broken by command of <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No.¬†1 (Fighter) Wing</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> during 1943‚Äì44, at which time he was promoted to temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>. Jeffrey was transferred to the RAAF reserve after the war but returned to the PAF in 1951, holding training posts in Victoria and command of <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Edinburgh">RAAF Base Edinburgh</a> in South Australia, before resigning in 1956. Outside the military, he was a <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">grazier</a> and <a href="stockbroker">stockbroker</a>. He died in 1997 at the age of 83.

The son of A. L. Jeffrey, Peter Jeffrey was born in <a href="Tenterfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tenterfield</a>, New South Wales, on 6¬†July 1913. He was educated at <a href="Toowoomba%20Preparatory%20School">Church of England Preparatory School</a> in <a href="Toowoomba%2C%20Queensland">Toowoomba</a>, Queensland, and at <a href="Cranbrook%20School%2C%20Sydney">Cranbrook</a> in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Having spent time as a <a href="Jackaroo%20%28trainee%29">jackaroo</a>, by 1934 he was in his first year of engineering studies at <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">Sydney University</a>, residing in <a href="St.%20Andrew%27s%20College%2C%20Sydney">St Andrew's College</a>. In December that year, he enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF).

Jeffrey undertook flying instruction on the 1935 'B'¬†(reservists) course conducted by <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†1 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, and was commissioned as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in July. Serving with <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†22 (City of Sydney) Squadron</a> from July 1936, he transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force (PAF) on a short-service commission in May 1938. He was then assigned to <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No.¬†1 Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, as an <a href="Flight%20instructor">instructor</a>. In January 1939, he was posted to Britain to attend the Specialists Signals Course at <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20College%20Cranwell">Royal Air Force College Cranwell</a>, and was promoted to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in September.

Completing his course at Cranwell in November 1939, Jeffrey returned to Australia the following January as Signals Officer with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.¬†3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales. He resumed flying duties in June 1940, and posted out to the Middle East as a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a> with No.¬†3 Squadron on 15¬†July.

Sailing via <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a>, India, No.¬†3 Squadron arrived at <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, Egypt, in late August 1940. Along with most of his comrades, Jeffrey flew obsolescent <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Gladiator</a> biplanes in support of the Australian <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> during the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>; he claimed no victories at this stage. Promoted <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, he took over No.¬†3 Squadron from Wing Commander <a href="Ian%20Dougald%20McLachlan">Ian McLachlan</a> on 13¬†February 1941, by which time the unit had converted to <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> monoplane fighters. Based at <a href="Benina%20International%20Airport">RAF Benina</a> in defence of <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a> when Jeffrey assumed command, No.¬†3 Squadron retreated eastwards only hours ahead of German tanks after <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Rommel</a> launched his offensive in April. The Australians were forced to use ten different airfields in as many days before the Allies regrouped.

Jeffrey was flying a Hurricane when he claimed his first aerial victory on 15¬†April 1941. Following a flight of four German <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B52">Junkers Ju¬†52</a> transports back to their base near <a href="Fort%20Capuzzo">Fort Capuzzo</a>, Libya, he shot one down before it landed and strafed the other three on the ground, setting all on fire. He was decorated with the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) for this exploit, as well as his "untiring efforts" and "high standard of efficiency¬†... under extremely trying conditions"; the award was promulgated in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 13¬†May. After converting to <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Tomahawks</a> the same month, No.¬†3 Squadron took part in the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria-Lebanon Campaign</a>. Jeffrey scored the unit's first victory in the new fighter when he shot down in flames an Italian <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B88">Junkers Ju¬†88</a> over the sea near <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> on 13¬†June 1941. Two days later he destroyed a <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy French</a> <a href="Martin%20Maryland">Martin 167</a> bomber in southern Syria. Jeffrey was credited with another Ju¬†88 before the squadron returned to North Africa in September to support the Allied counter-attack against the <a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>. He was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 24¬†September 1941.
As commanding officer of No.¬†3 Squadron, Jeffrey came up with innovative ways of improving morale in the face of living conditions that were "primitive at best". On one occasion he arranged accommodation for his men near a beach, well away from the din of night-time bombing that was causing them to lose sleep on a regular basis. Another of his more "radical ideas" and lasting legacies was a combined <a href="mess">mess</a> for all pilots in the combat zone, whether <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> or <a href="Non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned</a>. The concept was initially frowned upon by <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> units, but when Air Vice Marshal <a href="Arthur%20Coningham%20%28RAF%20officer%29">"Mary" Coningham</a> dined at the shared mess on 11¬†October 1941 and gave his approval, it took root across the entire <a href="Desert%20Air%20Force">Desert Air Force</a>; leading ace <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a> later put the same idea into practice as commander of the RAAF's <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">No.¬†1 (Fighter) Wing</a> in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory. One of No.¬†3 Squadron's <a href="flight%20sergeant">flight sergeant</a>s recalled that Jeffrey made it a rule for new pilots to get to know their ground crew to increase their sense of comradeship, and also gave one of his senior <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a>s special responsibility for keeping track of the location of Allied airfields and petrol supplies to ensure that the unit was never short of fuel or places to land in an emergency.

Having been promoted to temporary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> and appointed <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a> of <a href="List%20of%20Royal%20Air%20Force%20wings">No.¬†234 Wing RAF</a> earlier in the month, Jeffrey was credited with a share in the destruction of a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B110">Messerschmitt Bf¬†110</a> heavy fighter on 20¬†November. Two days later he was shot down himself, but was uninjured and managed to make his way back to base. On 25¬†November, above cheering Allied soldiers <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">besieged in Tobruk</a>, Jeffrey led No.¬†3 Squadron and <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B112%20Squadron%20RAF">No.¬†112 Squadron RAF</a> in an attack on <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> bombers that resulted in seven enemy aircraft being destroyed and eight damaged, against one Tomahawk lost. He scored his fifth solo victory during the engagement, shooting down a Bf¬†110, and damaged another. On 30¬†November, Jeffrey rescued one of his old comrades from No.¬†3 Squadron, <a href="Sergeant%20Pilot">Sergeant Pilot</a> Allan Cameron, who had crash-landed behind enemy lines. Nicknamed "Tiny", Cameron had the bulkiest frame of any man in the unit, and after landing Jeffrey had to ditch his parachute to make room for his passenger in the Tomahawk's cockpit. He nevertheless managed to take off and return to base, and Cameron went on to survive the war and become an ace in the process. For this and other achievements Jeffrey was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> on 12¬†December 1941. As well as his rescue of the downed pilot, the citation paid tribute to his "great success" as wing leader, his "fine fighting spirit" in returning to base after having been shot down himself, and to his "magnificent leadership, fearlessness and skill" that had "contributed in a large measure to the successes achieved". At the end of the month, Jeffrey was posted back to Australia to serve in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>. He was credited with a total of five aerial victories in the Middle East, plus one shared and one damaged, though he was considered to be "conservative" in his scoring.

Jeffrey arrived in Australia in January 1942, and the following month briefly took charge of <a href="RAAF%20Bankstown">RAAF Bankstown</a>, New South Wales. On 4¬†March he became the inaugural commander of <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 (Fighter) Squadron</a>, operating newly delivered <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawks</a>. Forming the squadron in <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a>, Queensland, Jeffrey was responsible for readying it for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">defence of Port Moresby</a>, which would become one of the crucial early battles in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. Although it included two other veterans of No.¬†3 Squadron in the Middle East, Flight Lieutenants <a href="John%20Francis%20Jackson">"Old John" Jackson</a> and <a href="Peter%20Turnbull%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Turnbull</a>, most of the unit's pilots were untried, and Jeffrey had only nine days to instil in them basic principles of combat flying, gunnery and tactics. He handed over command to Jackson on 19¬†March, but assisted in ferrying the Kittyhawks to Moresby two days later, only to be fired upon by nervous <a href="Anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft gunners</a> as he came in to land with Turnbull and two other pilots. All four aircraft were damaged, and Jeffrey came within inches of death as a bullet flew past his skull and into the headrest of his seat. By 24¬†March, No.¬†75 Squadron had already shot down several Japanese raiders; having witnessed it "quickly established as a fighting unit", Jeffrey returned to Australia. He immediately began working up a second new Kittyhawk unit for service in New Guinea, <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 (Fighter) Squadron</a>. Based in Townsville at this stage, it was subsequently commanded by Peter Turnbull and joined No.¬†75 Squadron in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Battle of Milne Bay</a>.
In April 1942, Jeffrey was appointed to establish and command <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> (No.¬†2 OTU). Initially based at <a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a>, South Australia, the unit relocated to <a href="Mildura%2C%20Victoria">Mildura</a>, Victoria, the following month, training pilots for combat in such aircraft as Kittyhawks, <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>s and <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s. Its instructors under Jeffrey included aces Clive Caldwell and <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilf Arthur</a>. Jeffrey married Colleen Crozier at <a href="Toorak%2C%20Victoria">Toorak Presbyterian Church</a> in Melbourne on 14¬†May; his best man was fellow ace and No.¬†3 Squadron veteran <a href="Alan%20Rawlinson">Alan Rawlinson</a>. The couple had two sons. In August 1943, Jeffrey took charge of <a href="No.%205%20Fighter%20Sector%20RAAF">No.¬†5 Fighter Sector Headquarters</a>, based in Darwin, Northern Territory. On 25¬†September, he took over from Caldwell as <a href="Officer%20Commanding">Officer Commanding</a> No.¬†1 (Fighter) Wing, comprising three Spitfire squadrons whose role was to defend <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> (NWA) from air attack. By this time, Japanese raids had declined in strength and frequency, and Allied forces in the NWA shifted from a defensive posture to assaulting Japanese positions in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> and <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea%20campaign">Western New Guinea</a>. No.¬†1 Wing intercepted some raiders in late September but none came in October; the last Japanese attack on northern Australia took place on 12¬†November. Jeffrey was promoted to temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in December.

On 8¬†March 1944, Jeffrey urgently dispatched two of his squadrons to the vicinity of <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, Western Australia, in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force <a href="Western%20Australian%20emergency%20of%20March%201944">would raid the area</a>, but it proved to be an abortive sortie; no attack ensued, and the squadrons were directed to return to Darwin on 20¬†March. He led the wing in its first offensive <a href="strafing">strafing</a> operation on 18¬†April, attacking Japanese positions in the <a href="Babar%20Islands">Babar Islands</a>. The next month, he deployed his headquarters and two squadrons to <a href="Exmouth%20Gulf">Exmouth Gulf</a> in Western Australia to protect facilities that had been established to refuel the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> prior to <a href="Operation%20Transom">Operation Transom</a>. On 5¬†September 1944, Jeffrey led No.¬†1 Wing to the <a href="Tanimbar%20Islands">Tanimbar Islands</a> and strafed targets in <a href="Selaru">Selaru</a>. Later he discussed the mission with Caldwell, who was then commanding <a href="No.%2080%20Wing%20RAAF">No.¬†80 (Fighter) Wing</a> and had tagged along to determine if such long-range operations might be worthwhile for his squadrons. Jeffrey declared that the trip was a wasted effort and he had only undertaken it to prevent, in Caldwell's words, "the morale of his pilots going completely down the drain". The following month, Jeffrey was recommended to be mentioned in despatches for "gallant and distinguished service" in North-Western Area; the award was <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 9¬†March 1945. Departing No.¬†1 Wing, in November he returned to the command of No.¬†2 OTU, in which role he saw out the rest of the war.

Following the cessation of hostilities, No.¬†2 OTU was reduced to the status of a care-and-maintenance unit, and Jeffrey's commission was terminated on 6¬†June 1946. Having been transferred to the RAAF reserve upon his demobilisation, he sought readmission to the PAF in August the same year, without success. He then took up farming, purchasing a property on the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a>. In April 1951 he again applied to rejoin the PAF and this time was granted a commission as a wing commander. Over the next two years he held training posts in Victoria, firstly at the <a href="RAAF%20Staff%20College">RAAF Staff College</a>, Point Cook, and in 1952 at <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20East%20Sale">East Sale</a>. The following year he became Deputy Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.

Raised to acting group captain in February 1954, Jeffrey was appointed Superintendent, Air, with the Long-Range Weapons Establishment in <a href="Salisbury%2C%20South%20Australia">Salisbury</a>, South Australia. Coordinating weapons trials at <a href="Woomera%20Test%20Range">Woomera Rocket Range</a>, Jeffrey and his support staff were based initially at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Mallala">RAAF Base Mallala</a> but later relocated to <a href="Edinburgh%2C%20South%20Australia">Edinburgh airfield</a>, then part of Salisbury and owned by the Department of Supply. On 17¬†January 1955, he became the inaugural Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Edinburgh">RAAF Base Edinburgh</a>, and oversaw the transfer of units from Mallala during the year. He handed over command of the base in April 1956, and resigned from the Air Force on 14¬†May. Returning to private life, Jeffrey settled in Queensland and became partner in a <a href="brokerage%20firm">stock broking firm</a> at <a href="Surfers%20Paradise%2C%20Queensland">Surfers Paradise</a>. He later became a <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">grazier</a>, running a sheep and cattle property at <a href="Emerald%2C%20Queensland">Emerald</a> in Queensland's <a href="Central%20Highlands%20Region">Central Highlands</a>. In 1972 he moved back to Surfers Paradise, where he died on 6¬†April 1997 at the age of 83, survived by his wife and sons. His obituary in "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" on 10¬†April described him as the "archetypal Australian combat leader¬†... fearless, forthright, unpretentious, caring".

Egyptian temple

Egyptian temples were built for the official worship of the <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">gods</a> and in commemoration of the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>s in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of <a href="ritual">ritual</a>s, the central functions of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Egyptian religion</a>: giving <a href="Sacrifice">offerings</a> to the gods, reenacting their <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">mythological</a> interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold "<a href="maat">maat</a>", the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties to a host of priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to <a href="prayer">pray</a>, give offerings, and seek <a href="oracle">oracular</a> guidance from the god dwelling within.

The most important part of the temple was the <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a>, which typically contained a <a href="cult%20image">cult image</a>, a statue of its god. The rooms outside the sanctuary grew larger and more elaborate over time, so that temples evolved from small shrines in late <a href="Prehistoric%20Egypt">Prehistoric Egypt</a> (late fourth millennium¬†BC) to large stone edifices in the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a> (c. 1550‚Äì1070¬†BC) and later. These edifices are among the largest and most enduring examples of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">Egyptian architecture</a>, with their elements arranged and decorated according to complex <a href="sacred%20architecture">patterns of religious symbolism</a>. Their typical design consisted of a series of enclosed halls, open courts, and entrance <a href="pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylons</a> aligned along the path used for festival processions. Beyond the temple proper was an outer wall enclosing a wide variety of secondary buildings.

A large temple also owned sizable tracts of land and employed thousands of laymen to supply its needs. Temples were therefore key economic as well as religious centers. The priests who managed these powerful institutions wielded considerable influence, and despite their ostensible subordination to the king they may have posed significant challenges to his authority.

Temple-building in Egypt continued despite the nation's decline and ultimate <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">loss of independence</a> to the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in 30¬†BC. With the <a href="Christianity%20in%20Egypt">coming of Christianity</a>, traditional Egyptian religion faced increasing persecution, and <a href="decline%20of%20ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">temple cults died out</a> during the fourth through sixth centuries AD. The buildings they left behind suffered centuries of destruction and neglect. At the start of the nineteenth century, a <a href="Egyptomania">wave of interest</a> in ancient Egypt swept Europe, giving rise to the discipline of <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> and drawing increasing numbers of visitors to the civilization's remains. Dozens of temples survive today, and some have become world-famous <a href="Tourism%20in%20Egypt">tourist</a> attractions that contribute significantly to the modern <a href="Economy%20of%20Egypt">Egyptian economy</a>. Egyptologists continue to study the surviving temples and the remains of destroyed ones as invaluable sources of information about ancient Egyptian society.

<a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="temple">temple</a>s were meant as places for the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20deities">gods</a> to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, "·∏•wt-n·πØr", means "mansion (or enclosure) of a god". A <a href="divine%20presence">divine presence</a> in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through <a href="ritual">ritual</a>. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were therefore a key part of the maintenance of "<a href="maat">maat</a>", the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief. Maintaining "maat" was the entire purpose of <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Egyptian religion</a>, and it was the purpose of a temple as well.

Because he was credited with divine power himself, the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, as a <a href="sacred%20king">sacred king</a>, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of "maat". Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt made it impossible for him to do so in all cases, and most of the time these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, and expand the temples throughout his realm.

Although the pharaoh delegated his authority, the performance of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The participation of the general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community <a href="shrine">shrine</a>s, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.

Each temple had a principal deity, and most were dedicated to other gods as well. Not all deities had temples dedicated to them. Many demons and <a href="Household%20deity">household gods</a> were involved primarily in magical or private religious practice, with little or no presence in temple ceremonies. There were also other gods who had significant roles in the cosmos but, for uncertain reasons, were not honored with temples of their own. Of those gods who did have temples of their own, many were venerated mainly in certain areas of Egypt, though many gods with a strong local tie were also important across the nation. Even deities whose worship spanned the country were strongly associated with the cities where their chief temples were located. In <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20creation%20myths">Egyptian creation myths</a>, the first temple originated as a shelter for a god‚Äîwhich god it was varied according to the city‚Äîthat stood on the mound of land where the process of creation began. Each temple in Egypt, therefore, was equated with this original temple and with the site of creation itself. As the primordial home of the god and the mythological location of the city's founding, the temple was seen as the hub of the region, from which the city's patron god ruled over it.

Pharaohs also built temples where offerings were made to sustain their spirits in the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion%23Afterlife">afterlife</a>, often linked with or located near their tombs. These temples are traditionally called "<a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>s" and regarded as essentially different from divine temples. In recent years some Egyptologists, such as Gerhard Haeny, have argued that there is no clear division between the two. The Egyptians did not refer to mortuary temples by any distinct name. Nor were rituals for the dead and rituals for the gods mutually exclusive; the symbolism surrounding death was present in all Egyptian temples. The worship of gods was present to some degree in mortuary temples, and the Egyptologist <a href="Stephen%20Quirke">Stephen Quirke</a> has said that "at all periods royal cult involves the gods, but equally... all cult of the gods involves the king". Even so, certain temples were clearly used to commemorate deceased kings and to give offerings to their spirits. Their exact purpose is not fully understood; they may have been meant to unite the king with the gods, elevating him to a divine status greater than that of ordinary kingship. In any case, the difficulty of separating divine and mortuary temples reflects the close intertwining of divinity and kingship in Egyptian belief.

Temples were also key centers of economic activity. The largest of them required prodigious resources and employed tens of thousands of priests, craftsmen, and laborers. The temple's economic workings were analogous to those of a large Egyptian household, with servants dedicated to serving the temple god as they might serve the master of an estate. This similarity is reflected in the Egyptian term for the temple lands and their administration, "pr", meaning "house" or "estate".

Some of the temple's supplies came from direct donations by the king. In the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>, when Egypt was an <a href="empire">imperial power</a>, these donations often came out of the spoils of the king's <a href="Military%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">military</a> campaigns or the tribute given by his client states. The king might also levy various taxes that went directly to support a temple. Other revenue came from private individuals, who offered land, <a href="Slavery%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt">slaves</a>, or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services to sustain their spirits in the afterlife.

Much of a temple's economic support came from its own resources. These included large tracts of land beyond the temple enclosure, sometimes in a completely different region than the temple itself. The most important type of property was <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20agriculture">farmland</a>, producing grain, fruit, or wine, or supporting herds of livestock. The temple either managed these lands directly, rented them out to farmers for a share of the produce, or managed them jointly with the royal administration. Temples also launched expeditions into the desert to collect resources such as salt, honey, or wild game, or to mine precious minerals. Some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across the country or even beyond Egypt's borders. Thus, as <a href="Richard%20H.%20Wilkinson">Richard H. Wilkinson</a> says, the temple estate "often represented no less than a slice of Egypt itself". As a major economic center and the employer of a large part of the local population, the temple enclosure was a key part of the town in which it stood. Conversely, when a temple was founded on empty land, a new town was built to support it.

All this economic power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, were subject to the state <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corv√©e</a> system, which conscripted labor for royal projects. They could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. <a href="Harkhuf">Harkhuf</a>'s trading expedition in the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the <a href="Theban%20Necropolis">Theban Necropolis</a> in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at <a href="Deir%20el-Medina">Deir el-Medina</a>. Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.

The royal administration could also order one temple to divert its resources to another temple whose influence it wished to expand. Thus, a king might increase the income of the temples of a god he favored, and mortuary temples of recent rulers tended to siphon off resources from temples to pharaohs long dead. The most drastic means of controlling the temple estates was to completely revise the distribution of their property nationwide, which might extend to closing down certain temples. Such changes could significantly alter Egypt's economic landscape. The temples were thus important instruments with which the king managed the nation's resources and its people. As the direct overseers of their own economic sphere, the administrations of large temples wielded considerable influence and may have posed a challenge to the authority of a weak pharaoh, although it is unclear how independent they were.

Once <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Egypt became a Roman province</a>, Roman officials sought to limit temples' power and independence. Temples were made to either pay rent to the government for the land they owned or surrender that land to the state in exchange for a government stipend. Their cults became tightly regulated, less self-supporting, and dependent on government donations and various small sources of revenue.

The earliest known shrines appeared in prehistoric Egypt in the late fourth millennium¬†BC, at sites such as <a href="Sais%2C%20Egypt">Sa√Øs</a> and <a href="Buto">Buto</a> in <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a> and <a href="Nekhen">Nekhen</a> and <a href="Qift">Coptos</a> in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>. Most of these shrines were made of perishable materials such as wood, reed matting, and <a href="mudbrick">mudbrick</a>. Despite the impermanence of these early buildings, later <a href="art%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian art</a> continually reused and adapted elements from them, evoking the ancient shrines to suggest the eternal nature of the gods and their dwelling places.

In the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20%28Egypt%29">Early Dynastic Period</a> (c. 3100‚Äì2686¬†BC), the first pharaohs built funerary complexes in the religious center of <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> following a single general pattern, with a rectangular <a href="adobe">mud brick</a> enclosure. In the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> (c. 2686‚Äì2181¬†BC) that followed the Early Dynastic Period, royal funerary monuments greatly expanded, while most divine temples remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized the cult of the divine king more than the direct worship of deities. Deities closely connected with the king, such as the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, received more royal contributions than other deities. Ra's temple at <a href="Heliopolis%20%28ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a> was one of the great religious centers of the age, and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temples</a> in his honor near their <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">pyramids</a>. Meanwhile, the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times, unaffected by the royal cult sites.
The expansion of funerary monuments began in the reign of <a href="Djoser">Djoser</a>, who built his complex entirely of stone and placed in the enclosure a step pyramid under which he was buried: the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Djoser">Pyramid of Djoser</a>. For the rest of the Old Kingdom, tomb and temple were joined in elaborate stone pyramid complexes. Near each pyramid complex was a town that supplied its needs, as towns would support temples throughout Egyptian history. Other changes came in the reign of <a href="Sneferu">Sneferu</a> who, beginning with his first pyramid at <a href="Meidum">Meidum</a>, built pyramid complexes symmetrically along an east‚Äìwest axis, with a valley temple on the banks of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> linked to a pyramid temple at the foot of the pyramid. Sneferu's immediate successors followed this pattern, but beginning in the late Old Kingdom, pyramid complexes combined different elements from the axial plan and from the rectangular plan of Djoser. To supply the pyramid complexes, kings founded new towns and farming estates on undeveloped lands across Egypt. The flow of goods from these lands to the central government and its temples helped unify the kingdom.

The rulers of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> (c. 2055‚Äì1650¬†BC) continued building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, like the one at <a href="Medinet%20Madi">Medinet Madi</a>, show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> lying behind a pillared hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.

With greater power and wealth during the New Kingdom (c. 1550‚Äì1070¬†BC), Egypt devoted still more resources to its temples, which grew larger and more elaborate. Higher-ranking priestly roles became permanent rather than rotating positions, and they controlled a large portion of Egypt's wealth. Anthony Spalinger suggests that, as the influence of temples expanded, religious celebrations that had once been fully public were absorbed into the temples' increasingly important festival rituals. The most important god of the time was <a href="Amun">Amun</a>, whose main cult center, the <a href="Precinct%20of%20Amun-Re">Precinct of Amun-Re</a> at <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a> in <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a>, eventually became the largest of all temples, and whose <a href="High%20Priests%20of%20Amun">high priests</a> may have wielded considerable political influence.

Many temples were now built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon gateways oriented along the path used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.

In the middle of the New Kingdom, Pharaoh <a href="Akhenaten">Akhenaten</a> promoted the god <a href="Aten">Aten</a> over all others and eventually abolished the official worship of most other gods. Traditional temples were neglected while new Aten temples, differing sharply in design and construction, were erected. But Akhenaten's revolution was reversed soon after his death, with the traditional cults reinstated and the new temples dismantled. Subsequent pharaohs dedicated still more resources to the temples, particularly <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a>, the most prolific monument-builder in Egyptian history. As the wealth of the priesthoods continued to grow, so did their religious influence: temple oracles, controlled by the priests, were an increasingly popular method of making decisions. Pharaonic power waned, and in the eleventh century BC a military leader, <a href="Herihor">Herihor</a>, made himself High Priest of Amun and the de facto ruler of <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, beginning the political fragmentation of the <a href="Third%20Intermediate%20Period">Third Intermediate Period</a> (c. 1070‚Äì664¬†BC).

As the New Kingdom crumbled, the building of mortuary temples ceased and was never revived. Some rulers of the Third Intermediate Period, such as those at <a href="Tanis">Tanis</a>, were buried within the enclosures of divine temples, thus continuing the close link between temple and tomb.

In the Third Intermediate Period and the following <a href="Late%20Period%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">Late Period</a> (664‚Äì323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell to a series of outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen their claim to the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Kushite pharaohs</a> of the eighth and seventh centuries¬†BC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kush">native land of Nubia</a>, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated <a href="Nubian%20architecture">Nubian temple</a> building. Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.
Despite the political upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence. Whereas earlier temple building mostly focused on male gods, goddesses and child deities grew increasingly prominent. Temples focused more on popular religious activities such as oracles, <a href="Animal%20worship">animal cults</a>, and prayer. New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate <a href="column">column</a> styles, and the "<a href="mammisi">mammisi</a>", a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though the characteristics of the late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemies</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> kings who <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">ruled as pharaohs</a> for nearly 300 years.

After <a href="Roman%20Empire">Rome</a> conquered the Ptolemaic kingdom in 30¬†BC, <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>s took on the role of ruler and temple patron, reducing the temples' wealth and political power. Many temples in Roman Egypt continued to be built in Egyptian style. Others, including some that were dedicated to Egyptian gods‚Äîsuch as the temple to <a href="Isis">Isis</a> at Ras el-Soda‚Äîwere built in a style derived from <a href="Roman%20architecture">Roman architecture</a>.

Temple-building continued into the third century¬†AD. As the empire weakened in the <a href="crisis%20of%20the%20third%20century">crisis of the third century</a>, imperial donations to the temple cults dried up, and almost all construction and decoration ceased. Cult activities at some sites continued, relying increasingly on financial support and volunteer labor from surrounding communities. In the following centuries, <a href="State%20church%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">Christian emperors</a> issued decrees that were increasingly hostile to pagan cults and temples. Some Christians attacked and destroyed temples, as in the plundering of the <a href="Serapeum">Serapeum</a> and other temples in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in AD 391 or 392. Through some combination of Christian coercion and loss of funds, temples ceased to function at various times. The last temple cults died out in the fourth through sixth centuries¬†AD, although locals may have venerated some sites long after the regular ceremonies there had ceased.

Temples were built throughout <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a>, as well as at Egyptian-controlled <a href="oasis">oases</a> in the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Libyan Desert</a> as far west as <a href="Siwa%20Oasis">Siwa</a>, and at outposts in the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a> such as <a href="Timna%20valley">Timna</a>. In periods when Egypt dominated Nubia, Egyptian rulers also built temples there, as far south as <a href="Jebel%20Barkal">Jebel Barkal</a>. Most Egyptian towns had a temple, but in some cases, as with mortuary temples or the temples in Nubia, the temple was a new foundation on previously empty land. The exact site of a temple was often chosen for religious reasons; it might, for example, be the mythical birthplace or burial place of a god. The temple axis might also be designed to align with locations of religious significance, such as the site of a neighboring temple or the rising place of the sun or particular stars. The Great Temple of <a href="Abu%20Simbel">Abu Simbel</a>, for instance, is aligned so that twice a year the rising sun illuminates the statues of the gods in its innermost room. Most temples were aligned toward the Nile with an axis running roughly east‚Äìwest.

An elaborate series of foundation rituals preceded construction. A further set of rituals followed the temple's completion, dedicating it to its patron god. These rites were conducted, at least in theory, by the king as part of his religious duties; indeed, in Egyptian belief all temple construction was symbolically his work. In reality, it was the work of hundreds of his subjects, conscripted in the <a href="corv%C3%A9e">corv√©e</a> system. The construction process for a new temple, or a major addition to an existing one, could last years or decades.

The <a href="stonemasonry">use of stone</a> in Egyptian temples emphasized their purpose as eternal houses for the gods and set them apart from buildings for the use of mortals, which were built of mudbrick. Early temples were built of brick and other perishable materials, and most of the outlying buildings in temple enclosures remained brick-built throughout Egyptian history. The main stones used in temple construction were <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, which are common in Egypt; stones that are harder and more difficult to carve, such as <a href="granite">granite</a>, were used in smaller amounts for individual elements like <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s. The stone might be quarried nearby or shipped on the Nile from <a href="Stone%20quarries%20of%20ancient%20Egypt">quarries</a> elsewhere.

Temple structures were built on foundations of stone slabs set into sand-filled trenches. In most periods, walls and other structures were built with large blocks of varying shape. The blocks were laid in courses, usually without <a href="mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a>. Each stone was dressed to fit with its neighbors, producing cuboid blocks whose uneven shapes interlocked. The interiors of walls were often built with less care, using rougher, poorer-quality stones. To build structures above ground level, the workers used construction ramps built of varying materials such as mud, brick, or rough stone. When <a href="rock-cut%20architecture">cutting chambers in living rock</a>, workers excavated from the top down, carving a crawlspace near the ceiling and cutting down to the floor. Once the temple structure was complete, the rough faces of the stones were dressed to create a smooth surface. In decorating these surfaces, <a href="relief">relief</a>s were carved into the stone or, if the stone was of too poor quality to carve, a layer of plaster that covered the stone surface. Reliefs were then decorated with <a href="gilding">gilding</a>, <a href="inlay">inlay</a>, or paint. The paints were usually mixtures of mineral pigments with some kind of adhesive, possibly <a href="natural%20gum">natural gum</a>.

Temple construction did not end once the original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions this may have been because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, but in most cases the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.

Like all <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">ancient Egyptian architecture</a>, Egyptian temple designs emphasized order, symmetry, and monumentality and combined geometric shapes with stylized organic motifs. Elements of temple design also alluded to the form of the earliest Egyptian buildings. <a href="Cavetto%20cornice">Cavetto cornice</a>s at the tops of walls, for instance, were made to imitate rows of palm fronds placed atop archaic walls, and the <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">batter</a> of exterior walls, while partly meant to ensure stability, was also a holdover from archaic building methods. Temple ground plans usually centered on an axis running on a slight incline from the sanctuary down to the temple entrance. In the fully developed pattern used in the New Kingdom and later, the path used for festival processions‚Äîa broad avenue punctuated with large doors‚Äîserved as this central axis. The path was intended primarily for the god's use when it traveled outside the sanctuary; on most occasions people used smaller side doors. The typical parts of a temple, such as column-filled <a href="hypostyle%20hall">hypostyle hall</a>s, open <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a> courts, and towering entrance <a href="pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>s, were arranged along this path in a traditional but flexible order. Beyond the temple building proper, the outer walls enclosed numerous satellite buildings. The entire area enclosed by these walls is sometimes called the "<a href="temenos">temenos</a>", the sacred precinct dedicated to the god.

The temple pattern could vary considerably, apart from the distorting effect of additional construction. Many temples, known as <a href="hypogea">hypogea</a>, were cut entirely into living rock, as at Abu Simbel, or had rock-cut inner chambers with masonry courtyards and pylons, as at <a href="Wadi%20es-Sebua">Wadi es-Sebua</a>. They used much the same layout as free-standing temples but used excavated chambers rather than buildings as their inner rooms. In some temples, like the mortuary temples at <a href="Deir%20el-Bahari">Deir el-Bahari</a>, the processional path ran up a series of terraces rather than sitting on a single level. The Ptolemaic <a href="Temple%20of%20Kom%20Ombo">Temple of Kom Ombo</a> was built with two main sanctuaries, producing two parallel axes that run the length of the building. The most idiosyncratic temple style was that of the Aten temples built by Akhenaten at <a href="el-Amarna">el-Amarna</a>, in which the axis passed through a series of entirely open courts filled with altars.

The traditional design was a highly symbolic variety of <a href="sacred%20architecture">sacred architecture</a>. It was a greatly elaborated variant on the design of an Egyptian house, reflecting its role as the god's home. Moreover, the temple represented a piece of the divine realm on earth. The elevated, enclosed sanctuary was equated with the sacred hill where the world was created in Egyptian myth and with the burial chamber of a tomb, where the god's "<a href="Egyptian%20soul%23Ba">ba</a>", or spirit, came to inhabit its cult image just as a human "ba" came to inhabit its <a href="mummy">mummy</a>. This crucial place, the Egyptians believed, had to be insulated from the impure outside world. Therefore, as one moved toward the sanctuary the amount of outside light decreased, and restrictions on who could enter increased. Yet the temple could also represent the world itself. The processional way could therefore stand for the path of the sun traveling across the sky, and the sanctuary for the <a href="Duat">Duat</a> where it was believed to set and to be reborn at night. The space outside the building was thus equated with the waters of chaos that lay outside the world, while the temple represented the order of the cosmos and the place where that order was continually renewed.

The temple's inner chambers centered on the sanctuary of the temple's primary god, which typically lay along the axis near the back of the temple building, and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base. The sanctuary was the focus of temple ritual, the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly. The form in which it manifested itself varied. In Aten temples and <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">traditional solar shrines</a>, the object of ritual was the sun itself or a "<a href="benben">benben</a>" stone representing the sun, worshipped in a court open to the sky. In many mortuary temples, the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh, or a <a href="false%20door">false door</a> where his <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23b%EA%9C%A3%20%28personality%29">bÍú£</a> ("personality", Egyptological "ba") was believed to appear to receive offerings.

In most temples, the focus was the <a href="cult%20image">cult image</a>: a statue of the temple god which that god's "ba" was believed to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a <a href="Shrine">naos</a>, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model <a href="Barque%23Barques%20and%20barque%20shrines%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt">barque</a> containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay at the very back of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated from the outside world by the surrounding corridors and rooms.

Subsidiary chapels, dedicated to deities associated with the primary god, lay to the sides of the main one. When the main temple god was male, the secondary chapels were often dedicated to that god's mythological consort and child. The secondary chapels in mortuary temples were devoted to gods associated with kingship.

Several other rooms neighbored the sanctuary. Many of these rooms were used to store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings were given to the deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall at the back of the temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.

Hypostyle halls, covered rooms filled with columns, appear in temples throughout Egyptian history. By the New Kingdom they typically lay directly in front of the sanctuary area. These halls were less restricted than the inner rooms, being open to laymen at least in some cases. They were often less dark as well: New Kingdom halls rose into tall central passages over the processional path, allowing a <a href="clerestory">clerestory</a> to provide dim light. The epitome of this style is the <a href="Great%20Hypostyle%20Hall">Great Hypostyle Hall</a> at Karnak, whose largest columns are tall. In later periods, the Egyptians favored a different style of hall, where a low screen wall at the front let in the light. The shadowy halls, whose columns were often shaped to imitate plants such as <a href="Lotus%20%28plant%29">lotus</a> or <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, were symbolic of the mythological marsh that surrounded the primeval mound at the time of creation. The columns could also be equated with the pillars that held up the sky in Egyptian cosmology.

Beyond the hypostyle hall were one or more <a href="peristyle">peristyle</a> courts open to the sky. These open courts, which had been a part of Egyptian temple design since the Old Kingdom, became transitional areas in the standard plan of the New Kingdom, lying between the public space outside the temple and the more restricted areas within. Here the public met with the priests and assembled during festivals. At the front of each court was usually a <a href="pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>, a pair of trapezoidal towers flanking the main gateway. The pylon is known from only scattered examples in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but in the New it quickly became the distinctive and imposing fa√ßade common to most Egyptian temples. The pylon served symbolically as a guard tower against the forces of disorder and may also have been meant to resemble the <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyph</a> for "horizon", underscoring the temple's solar symbolism.

The front of every pylon held niches for pairs of flagpoles to stand. Unlike pylons, such flags had stood at temple entrances since the earliest Predynastic shrines. They were so closely associated with the presence of a deity that the hieroglyph for them came to stand for the Egyptian word for "god".

Outside the temple building proper was the temple enclosure, surrounded by a rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties in the fourth century BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of invasion by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.
The walls enclosed many buildings related to the temple's function. Some enclosures contain satellite chapels dedicated to deities associated with the temple god, including <a href="mammisi">mammisi</a>s celebrating the birth of the god's mythological child. Sacred lakes found in many temple enclosures served as reservoirs for the water used in rituals, as places for the priests to ritually cleanse themselves and as representations of the water from which the world emerged.

<a href="Mortuary%20temple">Mortuary temple</a>s sometimes contain a palace for the spirit of the king to whom the temple was dedicated, built against the temple building proper. The <a href="Mortuary%20Temple%20of%20Seti%20I">Mortuary Temple of Seti I</a> at <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> incorporates an unusual underground structure, the <a href="Osireion">Osireion</a>, which may have served as a symbolic tomb for the king. <a href="Sanatoria">Sanatoria</a> in some temples provided a place for the sick to await healing dreams sent by the god. Other temple buildings included kitchens, workshops, and storehouses to supply the temple's needs.

Especially important was the "<a href="wikt%3Apr%20%EA%9C%A5n%E1%B8%AB">pr Íú•n·∏´</a>" "house of life", where the temple edited, copied, and stored its religious texts, including those used for temple rituals. The house of life also functioned as a general center of learning, containing works on non-religious subjects such as history, geography, <a href="Egyptian%20astronomy">astronomy</a>, and <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20medicine">medicine</a>. Although these outlying buildings were devoted to more mundane purposes than the temple itself, they still had religious significance; even <a href="granary">granaries</a> might be used for specific ceremonies.

Through the enclosure ran the processional path, which led from the temple entrance through the main gate in the enclosure wall. The path was frequently decorated with <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a> statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which was linked to the pyramid temple by the processional causeway.

The temple building was elaborately decorated with reliefs and free-standing sculpture, all with religious significance. As with the cult statue, the gods were believed to be present in these images, suffusing the temple with sacred power. Symbols of places in Egypt or parts of the cosmos enhanced the mythical geography already present in the temple's architecture. Images of rituals served to reinforce the rituals' magical effect and to perpetuate that effect even if the rituals ceased to be performed. Because of their religious nature, these decorations showed an idealized version of reality, emblematic of the temple's purpose rather than real events. For instance, the king was shown performing most rituals, while priests, if depicted, were secondary. It was unimportant that he was rarely present for these ceremonies; it was his role as intermediary with the gods that mattered.

The most important form of decoration is relief. Relief became more extensive over time, and in late temples, walls, ceilings, columns, and beams were all decorated, as were free-standing <a href="stela">stela</a>e erected within the enclosure. Egyptian artists used both bas relief and <a href="sunken%20relief">sunken relief</a>. Bas relief allowed more subtle artistry but involved more carving than sunken relief. Sunken relief was therefore used on harder, more difficult stone and when the builders wanted to finish quickly. It was also appropriate for exterior surfaces, where the shadows it created made the figures stand out in bright sunlight. Finished reliefs were painted using the basic colors black, white, red, yellow, green, and blue, although the artists often mixed pigments to create other colors, and Ptolemaic temples were especially varied, using unusual colors such as purple as accents. In some temples, gilding or inlaid pieces of colored glass or <a href="Egyptian%20faience">faience</a> substituted for paint.

Temple decoration is among the most important sources of information on Ancient Egypt. It includes calendars of festivals, accounts of myths, depictions of rituals, and the texts of hymns. Pharaohs recorded their temple-building activities and their campaigns against the enemies of Egypt. The Ptolemaic temples go further to include information of all kinds taken from temple libraries. The decoration in a given room either depicts the actions performed there or has some symbolic tie to the room's purpose, providing a great deal of information on temple activities. Interior walls were divided into several <a href="register%20%28art%29">registers</a>. The lowest registers were decorated with plants representing the primeval marsh, while the ceilings and tops of walls were decorated with stars and flying birds to represent the sky. Illustrations of rituals, surrounded by text related to the rituals, often filled the middle and upper registers. Courts and exterior walls often recorded the king's military exploits. The pylon showed the "smiting scene", a motif in which the king strikes down his enemies, symbolizing the defeat of the forces of chaos.

The text on the walls was the formal <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphic script</a>. Some texts were written in a "cryptographic" form, using symbols in a different way than the normal conventions of hieroglyphic writing. Cryptographic text became more widespread and more complex in Ptolemaic times. Temple walls also frequently bear written or drawn <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>, both in modern languages and in ancient ones such as <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>, <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, and <a href="Demotic%20%28Egyptian%29">Demotic</a>, the form of Egyptian that was commonly used in Greco-Roman times. Although not part of the temple's formal decoration, graffiti can be an important source of information about its history, both when its cults were functioning and after its abandonment. Ancient graffiti, for instance, often mention the names and titles of priests who worked in the temple, and modern travelers often inscribed their names in temples that they visited. Graffiti left by priests and pilgrims at Philae include the <a href="Graffito%20of%20Esmet-Akhom">last ancient hieroglyphic text</a>, inscribed in AD 394, and the last one in Demotic script, from AD 452.

<a href="Monumental%20sculpture">Large, free-standing sculpture</a> included <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s, tall, pointed pillars that symbolized the sun. The largest of them, the <a href="Lateran%20Obelisk">Lateran Obelisk</a>, was more than high. They were often placed in pairs in front of pylons or elsewhere along the temple axis. Statues of the king, which were similarly placed, also reached colossal size; the <a href="Colossi%20of%20Memnon">Colossi of Memnon</a> at the <a href="mortuary%20temple%20of%20Amenhotep%20III">mortuary temple of Amenhotep III</a> and the statue of Ramesses II at the <a href="Ramesseum">Ramesseum</a> are the largest free-standing statues made in ancient Egypt. There were also figures of gods, often in sphinx form, that served as symbolic guardians of the temple. The most numerous statues were votive figures donated to the temple by kings, private individuals, or even towns to gain divine favor. They could depict the god to whom they were dedicated, the people who donated the statue, or both. The most essential temple statues were the cult images, which were usually made of or decorated with precious materials such as gold and <a href="lapis%20lazuli">lapis lazuli</a>.

A temple needed many people to perform its rituals and support duties. Priests performed the temple's essential ritual functions, but in Egyptian religious ideology they were far less important than the king. As temple decoration illustrates, all ceremonies were, in theory, acts by the king, and priests merely stood in his place. The priests were therefore subject to the king's authority, and he had the right to appoint anyone he wished to the priesthood. In fact, in the Old and Middle Kingdoms most priests were government officials who left their secular duties for part of the year to serve the temple in shifts. Once the priesthood became more professional, the king seems to have used his power over appointments mainly for the highest-ranking positions, usually to reward a favorite official with a job or to intervene for political reasons in the affairs of an important cult. Lesser appointments he delegated to his <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a> or to the priests themselves. In the latter case, the holder of an office named his own son as his successor, or the temple clergy conferred to decide who should fill an empty post. Priestly offices were extremely lucrative and tended to be held by the wealthiest and most influential members of Egyptian society, until Roman economic reforms reduced the temples‚Äô resources.

The requirements for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, little is known about what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of <a href="Ritual%20purification">ritual purity</a> in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be <a href="celibacy">celibate</a>, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the <a href="Third%20Intermediate%20Period">Third Intermediate Period</a>. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and the most important of these consorts, the <a href="God%27s%20Wife%20of%20Amun">God's Wife of Amun</a>, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.

At the head of the temple hierarchy was the high priest, who oversaw all the temple's religious and economic functions and in the largest cults was an important political figure. Beneath him might be as many as three grades of subordinate priests who could substitute for him in ceremonies. While these higher ranks were full-time positions from the New Kingdom onward, the lower grades of priesthood still worked in shifts over the course of the year. Whereas many priests did a variety of menial tasks, the clergy also contained several ritual specialists. Prominent among these specialized roles was that of the <a href="lector%20priest">lector priest</a> who recited hymns and spells during temple rituals, and who hired out his magical services to laymen. Besides its priests, a large temple employed singers, musicians, and dancers to perform during rituals, plus the farmers, bakers, artisans, builders, and administrators who supplied and managed its practical needs. In the Ptolemaic era, temples could also house people who had sought <a href="Right%20of%20asylum">asylum</a> within the precinct, or <a href="recluse">recluse</a>s who voluntarily dedicated themselves to serving the god and living in its household. A major cult, therefore, could have well over 150 full or part-time priests, with tens of thousands of non-priestly employees working on its lands across the country. These numbers contrast with mid-sized temples, which may have had 10 to 25 priests, and with the smallest provincial temples, which might have only one.

Some priests' duties took them beyond the temple precinct. They formed part of the entourage in festivals that traveled from one temple to another, and clergies from around the country sent representatives to the national <a href="sed%20festival">sed festival</a> that reinforced the king's divine power. Some temples, such as those in the neighboring cities of <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a> and <a href="Letopolis">Letopolis</a>, were overseen by the same high priest.

At certain times there was an administrative office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it for much of the New Kingdom. The Romans established a similar office, that of the high priest for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.

The daily rituals in most temples included two sequences of <a href="sacrifice">offering</a> rites: one to clean and dress the god for the day, and one to present it with a meal. The exact order of events in these rituals is uncertain and may have varied somewhat each time they were performed. In addition, the two sequences probably overlapped with each other. At sunrise, the officiating priest entered the sanctuary, carrying a candle to light the room. He opened the doors of the shrine and prostrated himself before the god's image, reciting hymns in its praise. He removed the god from the shrine, clothed it (replacing the clothes of the previous day), and anointed it with oil and paint. At some point the priest presented the god's meal, including a variety of meats, fruits, vegetables, and bread.

The god was believed to consume only the spiritual essence of this meal. This belief allowed the food to be distributed to others, an act that the Egyptians called the "reversion of offerings". The food passed first to the other statues throughout the temple, then to local funerary chapels for the sustenance of the dead, and finally to the priests who ate it. The quantities even for the daily meal were so large that only a small part of it can have been placed on the offering tables. Most of it must have gone directly to these secondary uses.

Temple artwork often shows the king presenting an image of the goddess <a href="Maat">Maat</a> to the temple deity, an act that represented the purpose of all other offerings. The king may have presented a real figurine of Maat to the deity, or the temple reliefs depicting the act may have been purely symbolic.

Other offering rituals took place at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened. Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In the cult of the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a>, for instance, hymns were sung day and night for every hour of the god's journey across the sky. Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like <a href="Apep">Apep</a> or <a href="Set%20%28deity%29">Set</a>, acts that were believed to have a real effect through the principle of "<a href="heku">·∏•kÍú£</a>" (<a href="Egyptian%20language%23Egyptological%20pronunciation">Egyptological pronunciation</a> "heka", Coptic: "hik";) "<a href="magic%20%28supernatural%29">magic</a>".

In fact, the Egyptians believed that all ritual actions achieved their effect through ·∏•kÍú£. It was a fundamental force that rituals were meant to manipulate. Using magic, people, objects, and actions were equated with counterparts in the divine realm and thus were believed to affect events among the gods. In the daily offering, for instance, the cult statue, regardless of which deity it represented, was associated with <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, god of the dead. The priest performing the ritual was identified with <a href="Horus">Horus</a>, the living son of Osiris, who in mythology sustained his father after death through offerings. By magically equating himself with a god in a myth, the priest was able to interact with the temple deity.

On days of particular religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing was based on the <a href="Egyptian%20calendar">Egyptian civil calendar</a>, which most of the time was far out of step with the astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.
Festival ceremonies entailed reenactment of mythological events or the performance of other symbolic acts, like the cutting of a sheaf of wheat during the harvest-related festival dedicated to the god <a href="Min%20%28god%29">Min</a>. Many of these ceremonies took place only within the temple building, such as the "union with the sun disk" festival practiced in the Late Period and afterwards, when cult statues were carried to the temple roof at the start of the New Year to be enlivened by the rays of the sun. In festivals that involved a procession, priests carried the divine image out from the sanctuary, usually in its model barque, to visit another site. The barque might travel entirely on land or be loaded onto a real boat to travel on the river.

The purpose of the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the ideology of kingship. In the <a href="Opet%20Festival">Opet Festival</a>, an extremely important ceremony during the New Kingdom, the image of Amun from Karnak visited the form of Amun worshipped at <a href="Luxor%20Temple">Luxor Temple</a>, and both acted to reaffirm the king's divine rule. Still other celebrations had a <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20practices">funerary character</a>, as in the <a href="Beautiful%20Festival%20of%20the%20Valley">Beautiful Festival of the Valley</a>, when Amun of Karnak visited the mortuary temples of the <a href="Theban%20Necropolis">Theban Necropolis</a> to visit the kings commemorated there, while ordinary people visited the funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives. Some may have centered on <a href="hieros%20gamos">ritual marriages</a> between deities, or between deities and their human consorts, although the evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose is ambiguous. A prominent example is a festival in which an image of <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> from the <a href="Dendera%20Temple%20complex">Dendera Temple complex</a> was brought annually to visit the <a href="Temple%20of%20Edfu">Temple of Edfu</a>, the temple of her mythological consort <a href="Horus">Horus</a>. These varied ceremonies were united by the broad purpose of renewing life among the gods and in the cosmos.

The gods involved in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so it is likely that the celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.

Some temples kept sacred animals, which were believed to be manifestations of the temple god's "ba" in the same way that cult images were. Each of these sacred animals was kept in the temple and worshipped for a certain length of time, ranging from a year to the lifetime of the animal. At the end of that time, it was replaced with a new animal of the same species, which was selected by a divine oracle or based on specific markings that were supposed to indicate its sacred nature. Among the most prominent of these animals were the <a href="Apis%20%28deity%29">Apis</a>, a <a href="sacred%20bull">sacred bull</a> worshipped as a manifestation of the <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphite</a> god <a href="Ptah">Ptah</a>, and the falcon at Edfu who represented the falcon god Horus.

During the Late Period, a different form of worship involving animals developed. In this case, laymen paid the priests to kill, mummify, and bury an animal of a particular species as an offering to a god. These animals were not regarded as especially sacred, but as a species they were associated with the god because it was depicted in the form of that animal. The god <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, for instance, could be depicted as an <a href="ibis">ibis</a> and as a <a href="baboon">baboon</a>, and both ibises and baboons were given to him. Although this practice was distinct from the worship of single divine representatives, some temples kept stocks of animals that could be selected for either purpose. These practices produced large cemeteries of mummified animals, such as the catacombs around the <a href="Serapeum%20of%20Saqqara">Serapeum of Saqqara</a> where the Apis bulls were buried along with millions of animal offerings.

By the beginning of the New Kingdom, and quite possibly earlier, the festival procession had become an opportunity for people to seek <a href="oracle">oracle</a>s from the god. Their questions dealt with subjects ranging from the location of a lost object to the best choice for a government appointment. The motions of the barque as it was carried on the bearers' shoulders‚Äîmaking simple gestures to indicate "yes" or "no", tipping toward tablets on which possible answers were written, or moving toward a particular person in the crowd‚Äîwere taken to <a href="divination">indicate the god's reply</a>. In the Greco-Roman period, and possibly much earlier, oracles were used outside the festival, allowing people to consult them frequently. Priests interpreted the movements of sacred animals or, being asked questions directly, wrote out or spoke answers that they had supposedly received from the god in question. The priests' claim to speak for the gods or interpret their messages gave them great political influence and provided the means for the High Priests of Amun to dominate Upper Egypt during the Third Intermediate Period.

Although they were excluded from the formal rituals of the temple, laymen still sought to interact with the gods. There is little evidence of the religious practices of individual people from early Egyptian history, so Egyptologists' understanding of the subject derives mostly from the New Kingdom or later periods. The evidence from those times indicates that while ordinary Egyptians used many venues to interact with the divine, such as household shrines or community chapels, the official temples with their sequestered gods were a major focus for popular veneration.
Unable to address the cult image directly, laymen still attempted to convey their prayers to it. At times they related messages to priests to deliver to the temple deity; at other times they expressed their piety in the parts of the temple that they could access. Courts, doorways, and hypostyle halls might have spaces designated for public prayer. Sometimes people directed their appeals to the royal colossi, which were believed to act as divine intermediaries. More private areas for devotion were located at the building's outer wall, where large niches served as "chapels of the hearing ear" for individuals to speak to the god.

The Egyptians also interacted with deities through the donation of offerings, ranging from simple bits of jewelry to large and finely carved statues and stelae. Among their contributions were statues that sat in temple courts, serving as memorials to the donors after their deaths and receiving portions of the temple offerings to sustain the donors' spirits. Other statues served as gifts to the temple god, and inscribed stelae conveyed to the resident deity the donors' prayers and messages of thanks. Over the centuries, so many of these statues accumulated within a temple building that priests sometimes moved them out of the way by burying them in caches beneath the floor. Commoners offered simple wooden or clay models as votives. The form of these models may indicate the reason for their donation. Figurines of women are among the most common types of votive figures, and some are inscribed with a prayer for a woman to bear a child.

Festival processions offered a chance for laymen to approach and perhaps even glimpse the cult image in its barque, and for them to receive portions of the god's food. Because the key rituals of any festival still took place within the temple, out of public sight, Egyptologist Anthony Spalinger has questioned whether the processions inspired genuine "religious feelings" or were simply seen as occasions for revelry. In any case, the oracular events during festivals provided an opportunity for people to receive responses from the normally isolated deities, as did the other varieties of oracle that developed late in Egyptian history. Temples eventually became a venue for yet another type of divine contact: dreams. The Egyptians saw dreaming as a means of communion with the divine realm, and by the Ptolemaic period many temples provided buildings for <a href="incubation%20%28ritual%29">ritual incubation</a>. People slept in these buildings in hopes of contacting the temple god. The petitioners often sought a magical solution to sickness or infertility. At other times they sought an answer to a question, receiving the answer through a dream rather than an oracle.

After their original religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying to erase the remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the "mammisi" at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were <a href="Christianized%20sites">adapted into churches</a> or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of <a href="Khnum">Khnum</a> at <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a>, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful as a source of <a href="lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could be partly covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.

The situation changed dramatically with the <a href="French%20campaign%20in%20Egypt%20and%20Syria">French campaign in Egypt and Syria</a> in 1798, which brought with it a <a href="Commission%20des%20Sciences%20et%20des%20Arts">corps of scholars</a> to examine the surviving ancient monuments. The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe. In the early nineteenth century, growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt, both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities. Many temple artifacts, from small objects to enormous obelisks, were removed by outside governments and private collectors. This wave of <a href="Egyptomania">Egyptomania</a> resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel, but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness. The discoveries of the period made possible the <a href="decipherment%20of%20Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs</a> and the beginnings of <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a> as a scholarly discipline.
Nineteenth-century Egyptologists studied the temples intensively, but their emphasis was on collection of artifacts to send to their own countries, and their slipshod excavation methods often did further harm. Slowly the antique-hunting attitude toward Egyptian monuments gave way to careful study and preservation efforts. The government also took greater control of archaeological activity as Egypt's independence from foreign powers increased.

Yet even in recent times the ancient remains have faced threats. The most severe was the construction of the <a href="Aswan%20Dam">Aswan Dam</a> in the 1960s, which threatened to submerge the temples in what had been Lower Nubia beneath the newly formed <a href="Lake%20Nasser">Lake Nasser</a>. A major effort by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> disassembled some of the threatened monuments and rebuilt them on higher ground, and the Egyptian government gave several of the others, such as the <a href="Temple%20of%20Dendur">Temple of Dendur</a>, <a href="Temple%20of%20Taffeh">Temple of Taffeh</a>, and <a href="Temple%20of%20Debod">Temple of Debod</a>, as gifts to nations that had contributed to the preservation effort. Nevertheless, several other temples vanished beneath the lake.

Today there are dozens of sites with substantial temple remains, although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or <a href="Middle%20Egypt">Middle Egypt</a> are well preserved. Those that are well preserved, such as Karnak, Luxor, and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the <a href="tourism%20in%20Egypt">Egyptian tourist industry</a>, which is a major sector of the <a href="economy%20of%20Egypt">Egyptian economy</a>. Three temple sites‚ÄîAncient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae‚Äîhave been designated by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> as <a href="List%20of%20World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Egypt">World Heritage Sites</a>. The Egyptian government is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to <a href="Historic%20preservation">protect ancient monuments</a> from the harmful effects of tourist activity. <a href="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts are improving modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.
