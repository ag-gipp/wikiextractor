Xx (album)

xx is the debut <a href="album">album</a> by English <a href="indie%20pop">indie pop</a> band <a href="the%20xx">the xx</a>. It was released on 14 August 2009 by <a href="Young%20Turks%20%28record%20label%29">Young Turks</a>, an <a href="imprint%20label">imprint label</a> of <a href="XL%20Recordings">XL Recordings</a>.

After signing a record contract with XL, the xx recorded the album from December 2008 to February 2009 at <a href="XL%20Recordings%23XL%20Studio">the label's in-house studio</a> in London. Audio engineer <a href="Rodaidh%20McDonald">Rodaidh McDonald</a> worked with the band during the recording sessions and attempted to reproduce the intimate, unembellished quality of their <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a>. The band's <a href="Jamie%20xx">Jamie Smith</a> produced "xx" on his laptop and created electronic beats for the songs, which he then <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> in a detailed process with McDonald.

Although the xx had been strongly influenced by <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> acts, the album also drew comparisons from critics to <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, <a href="electronica">electronica</a>, and <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> sounds. The melancholic songs on "xx" featured <a href="minimal%20music">minimalist</a> arrangements and were built around Smith's beats, Oliver Sim's basslines, and sparse guitar figures played by Baria Qureshi and Romy Madley Croft, who employed <a href="reverberation">reverb</a> in her lead guitar parts. Most of them were sung as low-key duets by Croft and Sim, both of whom wrote emotional lyrics about love, intimacy, loss, and desire.

"xx" received widespread acclaim from critics, many of whom named it one of the year's best records. It sold steadily over its first few years of release, becoming a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a> in the United Kingdom and the United States. Although none of its singles became <a href="hit%20single">hits</a>, "xx" benefited commercially from the <a href="music%20licensing">licensing</a> of its songs to television programs and the band's <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a> win for the album in 2010.

When Qureshi was dismissed from the group shortly after the album's release, the xx continued to play as a trio on a protracted concert tour that helped increase their fanbase, reputation in the press, and confidence as performers. The record proved highly influential in subsequent years, as its distinctive stylistic elements were incorporated by many <a href="independent%20music">indie</a> bands and top-selling <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> acts. In 2013, "xx" was ranked number 237 on "<a href="NME">NME</a>" magazine's <a href="NME%27s%20The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">list of the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>.

While students at South London's <a href="Elliott%20School%20%28London%29">Elliott School</a> in 2005, childhood friends Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim formed the xx with <a href="Jamie%20xx">Jamie Smith</a> and Baria Qureshi. Croft and Sim played guitar and bass, respectively, and dueted as the band's vocalists, while Smith <a href="programming%20%28music%29">programmed</a> electronic <a href="beat%20%28music%29">beats</a> for their songs, and Qureshi doubled as a keyboardist and additional guitarist. During late nights, Croft and Sim either shared lyrics with each other through <a href="instant%20messaging">instant messaging</a> or rehearsed quietly with Smith and Qureshi in their bedrooms so they would not disturb the rest of the household. The xx were greatly influenced by American <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> producers such as <a href="The%20Neptunes">The Neptunes</a> and <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a>, whose <a href="minimal%20music">minimalist</a> productions incorporated <a href="vocal%20harmony">vocal harmonies</a>, <a href="clapping">clapping</a> percussion, unconventional <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a>, and pronounced beats. The band covered <a href="Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>'s "<a href="Hot%20Like%20Fire">Hot Like Fire</a>" (1997), <a href="Womack%20%26amp%3B%20Womack">Womack & Womack</a>'s "<a href="Teardrops%20%28Womack%20%26amp%3B%20Womack%20song%29">Teardrops</a>" (1988), and other past R&B hits when they performed live and recorded their <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a>.

After posting the demos on their <a href="Myspace">Myspace</a> page, the xx drew the interest of <a href="Young%20Turks%20%28record%20label%29">Young Turks</a>, an <a href="imprint%20label">imprint label</a> of <a href="XL%20Recordings">XL Recordings</a>. They submitted the demos to XL's head office at <a href="Ladbroke%20Grove">Ladbroke Grove</a> and were subsequently signed to a recording contract. The group worked with producers such as <a href="Diplo">Diplo</a> and <a href="Kwes">Kwes</a>, to no success before they were introduced to audio engineer <a href="Rodaidh%20McDonald">Rodaidh McDonald</a> by the xx's manager Caius Pawson, who gave him three CDs of demos titled "Early Demos", "Recorded in Rehearsal Space", and "What Producers Did Wrong". McDonald was impressed by the intimate quality and use of silence on the demos, which both he and the band felt may have challenged other producers who wanted to incorporate their individual tastes: "They'd worked with about four other producers before then that had—and no discredit to them—I guess they'd seen a lot of space to add a kind of stamp on. There was a lot of empty space in the xx's music, even then, in the 'Early Demos'. But we just found that the best stuff was the most sparse."

At the behest of XL owner <a href="Richard%20Russell%20%28XL%20Recordings%29">Richard Russell</a>, the xx recorded their debut album at the label's small, in-house recording studio—<a href="XL%20Recordings%23XL%20Studio">XL Studio</a>—making them the first act to record there. It was once the head office building's rear garage before Russell transformed it at the beginning of 2008 into a makeshift writing, rehearsal, and demo space for XL's artists. McDonald was assigned in September to manage and properly equip the room, which he liked because it was soundproof and "isolated from the rest of the office, so it wasn't like you were working in the record company's presence." Croft, on the other hand, called it a "pretty confined space" the size of a bathroom. Over the next few months, McDonald and Pawson prepared a budget for the label to fund the studio's preliminary setup, which would have recording equipment specifically suited for the xx, including a modestly sized <a href="mixing%20console">soundboard</a> ideal for recording a small group.

The xx started to record the album in December with McDonald, who <a href="audio%20engineer">engineered</a> the sessions. They would usually record at night after XL's staff had left, which Croft said made it feel "isolated and quite creepy". To reproduce the sound he had heard on the band's demos, McDonald had them write down their instruments' settings and test different areas of the studio to determine where he should record each member. Sim, who played a <a href="Fender%20Precision%20Bass">Precision Bass</a> manufactured in the 1970s, was often recorded in the hallway outside the studio with a <a href="Fender%20Bassman">Fender Bassman</a>, one of several amplifiers McDonald experimented with for "xx". Some of Qureshi and Croft's guitars were also done in the hallway. Qureshi played a <a href="Gibson%20SG">Gibson SG</a> with a <a href="Fender%20Hot%20Rod%20Deluxe">Fender Hot Rod Deluxe</a> or Blues Deluxe amplifier, while Croft played an <a href="Epiphone%20Les%20Paul">Epiphone Les Paul</a> on most of the album and a <a href="Gibson%20ES-335">Gibson ES-335</a> on a few songs. For her <a href="lead%20guitar">lead guitar</a> parts, Croft used a <a href="delay%20pedal">delay pedal</a> and a <a href="Roland%20Micro%20Cube">Roland Micro Cube</a> amplifier with a <a href="reverberation">reverb</a> setting, which McDonald felt would best replicate her "icy", echo-filled sound on the demos.

After all the instrumental elements had been <a href="multitrack%20recording">tracked</a>, Croft and Sim recorded their vocals together, rarely singing backup to one another on any of the songs. McDonald believed it was important for the singers be "in sync" and share the same mental state or mood when performing full takes of songs, some of which he said benefited from when they were both "quite tired and emotional". He had Croft and Sim sing into <a href="Georg%20Neumann">Neumann</a> microphones on most of the songs in order to make their vocals sound as "intimate" and conversational as possible. The microphones were among the more expensive items he borrowed for the studio's preliminary setup so XL would not be overwhelmed with a costly budget.

Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx had been encouraged to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the <a href="DIY%20ethic">DIY ethic</a> practiced at XL since its beginnings as a <a href="rave%20music">rave</a> label. Smith was chosen by the rest of the group to produce "xx". He used <a href="Logic%20Pro">Logic 8</a> recording software on his <a href="Mac%20Pro">Mac Pro</a> and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an <a href="Music%20Production%20Center">Akai MPC</a> sampler, which he occasionally <a href="audio%20signal%20processing">processed</a> through a <a href="Roland%20RE-201">Roland RE-201</a> and other <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a>s. He also created <a href="click%20track">click track</a>s for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing "xx", would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.

Most of "xx" was recorded from late December to late January before McDonald and Smith began an exhaustive <a href="Audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixing</a> process, which lasted two weeks. For each song, they mixed one or two tracks of each instrument and used <a href="Waves%20Audio">Waves Audio</a> components to <a href="equalization%20%28audio%29">equalize</a> the recordings. Having enjoyed how the demos captured unintended background noises such as street sounds, McDonald deliberately left certain sounds that would have otherwise been unwanted in the final mix. "I wanted it to sound like people in a room, rather than this polished kind of perfect crystalline thing", he explained. "It was all the small details that we really liked." In February, the group wrote and recorded "Fantasy", "<a href="Shelter%20%28The%20xx%20song%29">Shelter</a>", and "Infinity" before finishing "xx", possibly by month's end according to McDonald; the album's <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> credited the final date of recording as April 2009. Sim sang his vocals for "Infinity" on the side of the studio opposite from Croft after his microphone had been unintentionally moved there, which resulted in a distant-sounding vocal exchange on the song. While recording "Shelter", a mechanical part from the guitar amplifier loosened and caused it to make a clattering sound, which McDonald and the xx chose to retain. "It was just like this missing piece of percussion that the track needed!", McDonald recalled.

The songs on "xx" were developed around a framework of basslines and beats, while incorporating simple guitar riffs for melody, rhythm, and <a href="texture%20%28music%29">texture</a>; their melodic notes were separated by <a href="rest%20%28music%29">rests</a>. Croft said the band's style of instrumentation had become defined by the limited equipment they originally used: "My guitar sound pretty much came from discovering there was reverb on my little practice amp and really loving the mood it created." The loudest song, "<a href="Intro%20%28The%20xx%20song%29">Intro</a>", was a largely instrumental recording with <a href="double%20tracking">double-tracked</a> beats, distorted keyboard, <a href="Non-lexical%20vocables%20in%20music">non-lexical vocables</a>, and a guitar riff. Songs such as "<a href="Crystalised">Crystalised</a>" and "<a href="VCR%20%28song%29">VCR</a>" began with a melodic <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a> and some understated sounds, including a <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a> on the latter, before leading to quietly sung verses. Croft and Sim exchanged verses on "Crystalised" while backed by the sound of drum stick clicks and basslines before the beat was heard. On the austerely arranged "Night Time", Croft sang its first two minutes over only guitar and bass before its beat developed. "Fantasy" was highlighted by a <a href="shoegazing">shoegazing</a> guitar sound.

While McDonald observed a predominant R&B element, Russell felt the xx's music evoked the early <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> records he listened to when he was young, as they were often limited to vocals, samples, and beats. Music journalists, however, inferred from "xx" that their influences were <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> acts such as <a href="Portishead%20%28band%29">Portishead</a>, <a href="Young%20Marble%20Giants">Young Marble Giants</a>, and <a href="Cocteau%20Twins">Cocteau Twins</a>, the last of which Croft said she had never heard before the album was released. "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>" described "xx" as a minimalist, melancholic <a href="indie%20pop">indie pop</a> record that draws on elements from <a href="electronica">electronica</a> and R&B, as well as <a href="The%20Cure">The Cure</a> and other alternative groups. According to Sarah Boden of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", the album's unadorned, <a href="dream%20pop">dream pop</a> love songs are reminiscent of Cocteau Twins and <a href="Mazzy%20Star">Mazzy Star</a>, because they feature low tempos, moody melodies, and rhythms influenced by R&B and <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a>. Their <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>s have what <a href="Neil%20McCormick">Neil McCormick</a> called "a very British, industrial aspect", somewhat similar to the <a href="dub%20music">dub</a>-inflected <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> sound of English producer <a href="Martin%20Hannett">Martin Hannett</a> and his work with the band <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a>. Both Croft and Sim said their combination of seemingly disparate influences could have been attributed to the variety in each band member's music collection.
On "xx", Croft and Sim touched on themes of love, desire, and loss in their songwriting, which Croft said has "always been based around emotions, right from the start. My favourite songs are usually quite sad and I think heartbreak is something that so many people can connect with." Like Croft, Sim said he wrote much of his lyrics at night when his emotions ran "a bit higher". Because of their reserved personalities, <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> believed they relied on a low-key, vulnerable style and "traded ideas about intimacy as contemporaries, comrades, prospects, lovers, ex-lovers, and friends". According to "<a href="NME">NME</a>" magazine's Emily Mackay, all of the songs dealt with the consuming emotions associated with first love, including the tacit intimacy on "VCR", the yearning expressed on "Heart Skipped a Beat", and the premature affection warned of on "Crystalised". Petra Davis from "<a href="The%20Quietus">The Quietus</a>" argued that the thematic crux of "xx" was in the succession of songs from "<a href="Islands%20%28The%20xx%20song%29">Islands</a>" to "Shelter", each of which saw "a radical shift in perspective on a similar—perhaps a single—love story."

The album's <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> title referred to each of the band members having turned 20 years old by the time "xx" was released. Because of their age, many critics interpreted the songs as nocturnal depictions of adolescent lust. <a href="Philip%20Sherburne">Philip Sherburne</a> wrote in "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" that "xx" brimmed with a "young lust" often found in <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>, and recordings such as "Fantasy" and "Shelter" expressed a jaded yearning, particularly in a lyric from the latter song: "Can I make it better with the lights turned on". Croft vehemently denied this: "We were writing these songs when we were 17. I can honestly say I've never thought this is about my sex life." Croft and Sim, who were both gay, did not intend for the songs to be heard as romantic duets; she said they were singing "past each other" rather than to each other. Having combined their individually written lyrics, they could not definitely explain what their songs were about, although Croft said Sim's lyrics resonated with her nonetheless and enjoyed the personal interpretation it offered. "You can put them into your own life", she explained, "like, 'Oh, this is my song. The romantic situations Sim wrote of had been inspired by other people. "I hadn't really had any relationships to be working off, but I had a huge interest in life, and looking at other people's relationships around me", he said.

"Crystalised" was released as the xx's debut single on 27 April 2009 and helped build interest among listeners and journalists. It was part of a series of singles from "xx", which included "Basic Space" on 3 August, "Islands" on 26 October, and "VCR" on 25 January 2010. They did not receive significant airplay on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> in the United Kingdom, and other media outlets believed the xx did not warrant strong attention; one editor from "NME" said at the time that the band was not ideal for their magazine's front cover. In the United States, the group benefited from the <a href="word-of-mouth%20marketing">word-of-mouth marketing</a> of <a href="blog">blog</a>s, beginning when they performed six consecutive sold-out shows at New York City clubs such as <a href="Pianos%20%28club%29">Pianos</a> and the <a href="Mercury%20Lounge">Mercury Lounge</a> months prior to the album's release.

Several of the songs from "xx" were licensed by XL to television programs in the UK and North America. "Intro" became widely used as <a href="theme%20music">theme music</a> in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as "<a href="Law%20%26amp%3B%20Order">Law & Order</a>" and "<a href="Cold%20Case">Cold Case</a>", an advertisement for <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a>, and <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s coverage of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202010">2010 British general election</a>. Along with their <a href="product%20placement">placement</a> in television, songs from the record were used by North American <a href="chain%20store">chain store</a>s such as <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> and <a href="Urban%20Outfitters">Urban Outfitters</a> as background music at their locations. According to McCormick in 2010, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner "over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit". Kris Chen, XL's <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> senior vice president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not "driven by pop radio". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about "putting our music on everything, just to put it to anything just for the sake of money".

"xx" was released by Young Turks in August 2009 to widespread critical acclaim. According to <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a>, it was the most acclaimed album of the year, and at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">normalised</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an <a href="weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">average</a> score of 87, based on 25 reviews. Critics particularly praised the group's sound on the album; <a href="Simon%20Price">Simon Price</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" that they were being universally lauded for their "atmospheric indie rock, and rightly so". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"s Jack Arnhold regarded it as "one of this year's most beautiful and original debut albums". In a review for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", <a href="Sasha%20Frere-Jones">Sasha Frere-Jones</a> remarked that "xx" rewarded repeated listens because of the band's disciplined playing, while Mark Edwards of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" said it succeeded with simple but "very near perfect" pop songs. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Heather Phares called the instrumentation impeccable and said she was impressed by how poised and refined such a young group sounded. In "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>", <a href="Jim%20Carroll%20%28journalist%29">Jim Carroll</a> said the exceptional chemistry of Croft and Sim's melancholic duets was the highlight of "this drop-dead gorgeous dream-pop symphony". Matthew Cole from "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" believed their rapport gave an emotional weight to the music, which he said sounded timeless and capable of appealing to both <a href="Independent%20music">indie</a> and popular tastes. Christgau, writing in "<a href="MSN%20Music">MSN Music</a>", was somewhat more impressed by the music than by the lyrics, although he said the underlying force behind the singers' charmingly minimalist songs was a "spiritual dimension" offered by their ability to "shift roles without ever seeming hostile, cold or even unsupportive".

Some reviewers had reservations. Jon Caramanica of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" felt the singers were too disengaged and reticent to reveal any genuine emotion. "Though they're singing to each other, it rarely feels intimate", he wrote, "more like two shy teenagers, eyes cast downward, awkwardly talking to the ground". In the opinion of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" critic Ben Schumer, the consistent <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29">structures</a> and tempos of the songs made them sound somewhat monotonous on what was an otherwise affecting nocturnal mood piece. Conversely, Joshua Errett from "<a href="Now%20%28newspaper%29">Now</a>" found the music and singing mesmerizing but lamented the lyrics, which he deemed emotionally immature and "overwrought".

By the end of 2009, "xx" had appeared on several critics' lists of the year's best albums. It was ranked 21st by "<a href="The%20Wire%20%28magazine%29">The Wire</a>", ninth by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", sixth by "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>", third by "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", second by "NME", and fourth by "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" critic <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a>. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" named it the year's best record in their annual critics poll and Tim Jonze, the newspaper's editor, hailed it as not only "the sound of 2009, [but also] a distinctive musical statement of the like we may never get to hear again". It also finished seventh in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> poll of American critics and third in <a href="HMV%27s%20Poll%20of%20Polls">HMV's Poll of Polls</a>, an annual list compiled by British music retailer <a href="HMV">HMV</a> and collated from best-album nominations made by journalists in the English and Irish music press. In decade-end lists of the greatest records from the 2000s, "The Sunday Times" and its <a href="sister%20paper">sister paper</a>, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", ranked "xx" seventy-seventh and thirtieth, respectively. The record was also included in the 2010 edition of Robert Dimery's music reference book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>". In September of that year, "xx" won the <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a>, an annual award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland. Before the nominations shortlist had been announced, <a href="bookmaker">bookmaker</a>s and critics considered the xx as favorites and predicted they would win over the more high-profile artists <a href="Corinne%20Bailey%20Rae">Corinne Bailey Rae</a>, <a href="Paul%20Weller">Paul Weller</a>, and <a href="Dizzee%20Rascal">Dizzee Rascal</a>. McCormick, one of the critics who predicted its victory, explained that it "seemed the record that most represented Britain" with its charmingly intimate style and unique take on modern pop tastes.

"xx" was not an immediate <a href="record%20chart">chart</a> success, but eventually became a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a>. It debuted at number 36 on the UK's <a href="Official%20Albums%20Chart">Official Albums Chart</a> and sold 4,180 copies in the first week after it was released, while in the United States it did not chart higher than number 92 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The album sold steadily for the next 44 weeks until July 2010, when its announcement as a Mercury Prize nominee led to a sharp increase in sales and a jump from number 44 to 16 on the British chart. By then, it had sold more than 150,000 copies in the UK and 179,000 copies in the United States. "xx" remained in the top 20 of the Official Albums Chart in the weeks leading up to the Mercury Prize ceremony. Immediately after its win that week, it climbed from number 16 to 3 on its highest weekly sales—28,666 copies—and reached a total of 212,835 copies sold. According to McCormick, "its triumph is a rare example of the Mercury Prize doing music lovers a service." In the US, the album reached sales of 350,000 copies by June 2012 with consistent weekly sales during its first two years of release, which "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's Melissa Locker said was "quite a feat" in an era of <a href="music%20piracy">music piracy</a>, <a href="streaming%20media">media streaming</a>, and <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>.

Although "xx" had been highly anticipated by XL, the album's success exceeded expectations in the press. McDonald said their direction and sound would have been entirely different had expectations been higher. Croft was "baffled" by the acclaim given to what she viewed as an album they had made "for themselves". Sim had mixed feelings about its success and believed it could affect his songwriting in the future: "This album was done with no expectations. No one knew who we were. When I was writing the songs, I didn't think anyone other than Romy or James would ever actually hear them. Now I know so many people will. I might feel I have to be a bit more private." At the Mercury Prize ceremony, he said the time since its release has "felt like a haze", but that the event serves as "a moment of clarity". In their acceptance speech, the band announced they would use the £20,000 prize money to build their own studio, where they subsequently wrote and recorded their second album "<a href="Coexist%20%28album%29">Coexist</a>". When "Coexist" debuted in September 2012, "xx" was still on the British chart at number 37 and had sold 446,734 copies in the UK. The following year, it was ranked number 237 on <a href="NME%27s%20The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">"NME"s list of the top 500 albums of all time</a> and named the 74th greatest debut record by "Rolling Stone", who found its music radical as "an exercise in restraint, in the artful use of space and silence" during popular music's period of <a href="maximalism">maximalism</a>.

In subsequent years, "xx" proved highly influential as many indie bands and mainstream pop acts incorporated the record's distinctive musical characteristics into their own songs. Petridis later wrote that to his surprise much of 2016's best-selling singles "sounded oddly but irrefutably" like the album: "You can hear its muted, echoing guitars on everything from <a href="the%20Chainsmokers">the Chainsmokers</a>' '<a href="Don%27t%20Let%20Me%20Down%20%28The%20Chainsmokers%20song%29">Don't Let Me Down</a>' to <a href="Shawn%20Mendes">Shawn Mendes</a>' '<a href="Stitches%20%28song%29">Stitches</a>' to <a href="Zara%20Larsson">Zara Larsson</a>'s '<a href="Lush%20Life%20%28Zara%20Larsson%20song%29">Lush Life</a>'." <a href="Ryan%20Tedder">Ryan Tedder</a>, who wrote hit songs for such top-selling singers as <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="Taylor%20Swift">Taylor Swift</a>, and <a href="Ariana%20Grande">Ariana Grande</a>, said the xx's "hauntingness" on the record "gets referenced in at least every other [writing] session". By January 2017, "xx" had reached 562,400 copies sold in the UK.

After "xx" was released, the xx toured Europe and North America through the end of 2009. Their first show in August was at <a href="Hoxton%20Hall">Hoxton Hall</a> in London, which Sim recalled was attended by only 112 people. When "Pitchfork"s positive review of the album elicited greater interest among American listeners, the xx were booked as the supporting act for the <a href="Friendly%20Fires">Friendly Fires</a>'s tour of larger club venues in the US. The difficulties of touring early on exacerbated the growing tensions between Qureshi and the rest of the group, which culminated in her dismissal after a difficult stay at an October music festival in New York. It was reported that she had become fatigued and left the group after they cancelled several concerts. Sim disputed those reports and said her departure had been the band's decision: "We've grown up to be very different people. It wasn't working any more musically or as a friendship." Croft told "NME" in November, "I guess 'personal differences' would be the standard way to say it. I guess it's just the intensity of being on tour, things are so much heightened."

Rather than find a replacement for Qureshi, the xx continued to tour as a smaller line-up of guitar, bass, and percussion. They also reduced their already minimalist arrangements for songs in concert, although Sim jokingly said Smith "needs another few arms so he can work everything" after Qureshi's departure. In their shows, Croft abandoned playing solos and chords in favor of less defined <a href="figure%20%28music%29">figures</a> and <a href="motif%20%28music%29">motifs</a>, while Smith performed beats and <a href="ambient%20music">ambient</a> sounds from his <a href="synth%20pad">synth pad</a> as an <a href="accompaniment">accompaniment</a> to Croft and Sim's playing. Because their style had been suited to the small venues they first played, the xx focused more on the production value of their concerts and performing for larger audiences while on tour. They dressed in dark clothing and illuminated the stage with light boxes displaying their x-shaped, white-on-black logo.

With a growing fanbase, the xx made commitments to more concerts and extended their tour for the album. They toured intermittently for 18 months, including most of 2010. That year, they embarked on their first US tour and played high-profile festivals such as <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a>, <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella</a>, and <a href="Bonnaroo%20Music%20Festival">Bonnaroo</a>. Croft recalled their show at Coachella, where they performed for 30,000 people: "That was the moment when I was, like, Oh, my God, I think people might be into this." They were also a supporting act for fellow English group <a href="Florence%20and%20the%20Machine">Florence and the Machine</a>. By touring frequently, the xx broadened their reputation among listeners and the press. In March 2010, they played two consecutive nights at the <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush%20Empire">Shepherd's Bush Empire</a> in London to capacity crowds and appeared on the cover of "NME", who proclaimed them "the most underrated band in Britain". In April and May, they toured the southern US and Japan, which Croft said was most demanding part of the tour because "none of us had been away from home continuously for so long." They were accompanied during this six-week period by photographer <a href="Jamie-James%20Medina">Jamie-James Medina</a>, who later published his photos of the group in his book "The Tourist" (2010).

While on tour, the xx acclimated themselves to the increased attention and became considerably more sociable and confident. As Sim recounted, "If you'd have put me onstage at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire a few years ago, I'd have run away. I couldn't have done it. We used to be terrified." In June, the band played the <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> in Somerset and, according to journalist <a href="Jude%20Rogers">Jude Rogers</a>, displayed a newfound confidence through the rest of their summer and "post-Mercury [Prize] autumn" concerts: "Croft would sing more boldly, Sim developed an onstage swagger and Smith began experimenting with different rhythms and textures."

Z. Marcas

Z. Marcas is a <a href="Novella">novelette</a> by French author <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> first published in 1840. Set in contemporary <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, it describes the rise and fall of a brilliant political strategist who is abandoned by the politicians he helps into power. Destitute and forgotten, he befriends a pair of students who live next door to him in a boarding-house. The story follows their many discussions about the political situation in France.

Balzac was inspired to write the story after he spotted the name "Z. Marcas" on a sign for a tailor's shop in Paris. It was published in July 1840, in the "Revue Parisienne", a magazine he had founded that year. One year later it appeared in a collection from various authors under the title "La Mort d'un ambitieux" ("The Death of an Ambitious Man"). Balzac later placed it in the "Scènes de la vie politique" section of his vast <a href="novel%20sequence">novel sequence</a> "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>".

Although "Z. Marcas" features characters from other Balzac stories and elements of <a href="literary%20realism">literary realism</a> – both hallmarks of Balzac's style – it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a <a href="legitimists">legitimist</a>, believed that France's lack of bold leadership had led to mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in danger of being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.

The story also explores Balzac's conviction that a person's name is a powerful indicator of his or her destiny, an idea he drew from the work of <a href="Laurence%20Sterne">Laurence Sterne</a>. The title character, with his keen intellect, is based on Balzac's conception of himself: a visionary genius who fails to achieve his true potential because of less talented individuals with more social power.

<a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> was drawn to a diversity of interests throughout his life, from business to politics. After studying the law for three years, he wrote a number of <a href="potboiler">potboiler</a> novels under various pseudonyms. He also lost large sums of borrowed money in the publishing trade, attempting to capitalize on cheap editions of classical works. By 1828 he owed his mother 50,000 francs.

Although his views on politics were always changing, Balzac was primarily a <a href="legitimists">legitimist</a> who supported the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">House of Bourbon</a> and believed that the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830 had left France without strong leadership. In 1832 he declared his intent to run for the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20France">Chamber of Deputies</a> in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20France">French Parliament</a>. A variety of problems prevented his actual candidacy, but he mounted a serious campaign which was met mostly with ridicule by the press. Referring to Balzac's breakthrough 1831 novel "<a href="La%20Peau%20de%20chagrin">La Peau de chagrin</a>" ("The Wild Ass's Skin"), the newspaper "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" mused: "This is the first time anyone has been seen caressing the voters with an ass's skin." Although he later showed renewed interest in public office, he mostly expressed his political views through writing.

In July 1840 he attempted to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the "Revue Parisienne", funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned all there was to know about the trade. "[T]hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, "is as simple as a roasting spit turned by a poodle." Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the "Revue Parisienne", in part to challenge the popularity of the "<a href="feuilleton">roman-feuilleton</a>" serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.

In the summer of 1840, Balzac had a discussion with his friend <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Gozlan">Léon Gozlan</a> about the power of a person's name. In his comic essay "Balzac en pantoufles", Gozlan recounted his associate's insistence: ("We are named up there [in heaven] before being named down here. It's a mystery to which it's not suitable to apply, for the sake of understanding, the little rules of our slight reasoning.")

Balzac insisted to Gozlan that by searching through the streets of Paris, they would find a name suitable for a character he had imagined, a political genius thwarted by the mediocrity of the time. They finally came upon a tailor's sign that enraptured Balzac, bearing the name Z. Marcas. He believed that the name suggested ("some mysterious fatality"), and chose it for his story's protagonist. He wrote the 30-page story soon afterwards.

Balzac published "Z. Marcas" in the first issue of the "Revue Parisienne", 25 July 1840. It was republished a year later under the title "La Mort d'un ambitieux" ("The Death of an Ambitious Man"), in a collection from various authors called "Le Fruit défendu" ("Forbidden Fruit"). Shortly before his death, Balzac placed the story in the "Scènes de la vie politique" section of his collection "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>".

The story is told from the point of view of a <a href="First-person%20narrative">first-person</a> narrator, about whom little is revealed before the final pages. Before the story itself, an extended meditation appears on the nature of human names, and that of Z. Marcas specifically:

The narrator, Charles, lives with his friend Juste in a large boarding-house populated almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they see only momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn that he is a copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.

Recognizing at an early age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his associate had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then hired and abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.

Eventually his politician friend seeks his help for a third time. Marcas is dismissive, but the students convince him to give the process one last chance. After three months, Marcas appears at the boarding house again, sick and exhausted. The politician never visits Marcas, who soon dies. The students are the only mourners at his funeral, and – disheartened by the tragedy – leave France.

In addition to his distinctive name, Z. Marcas has a remarkable appearance which his neighbors notice immediately. The story's first line refers to his ("striking") appearance. As usual in his later work, Balzac describes Marcas by relating him to an animal: "L'animal de Marcas était le lion. Ses cheveux ressemblaient à une crinière, son nez était court, écrasé, large et fendu au bout comme celui d'un lion, il avait le front partagé comme celui d'un lion par un sillon puissant, divisé en deux lobes vigoureux." ("The animal for Marcas was the lion. His hair was like a mane, his nose was short and flat; broad and dented at the tip like a lion's; his brow, like a lion's, was strongly marked with a deep median furrow, dividing two powerful bosses.")

Marcas appears to be destined for greatness; he is described as having tremendous spirit, sound but speedy judgment, and comprehensive knowledge of public manners. His gaze has ("a power"), which he tries not to use, since it has brought him nothing but misery in the past. Despite these innate proficiencies, however, the political genius living in the students' midst requires their aid to dress himself when official company comes to call.

The character of Z. Marcas nonetheless represents a fiery drive to succeed in the world of politics, an acute mind seeking to do good in the public sphere. One critic calls him "ambition in its pure state". Like other persons of genius in "La Comédie humaine", Marcas is seen as a reflection of Balzac's own ego and desire. Like Marcas, the author dreamed of fame and positive influence; as Balzac believed himself to be, the character is dismissed and manipulated by mediocre minds. Even their work habits – toiling at their desks throughout the night – are similar.

Balzac began using characters from earlier works in his 1835 novel "<a href="Le%20P%C3%A8re%20Goriot">Le Père Goriot</a>", and made the technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of "Z. Marcas", the narrator – Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed at the end of the story – is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale "<a href="Les%20Employ%C3%A9s%20ou%20la%20Femme%20sup%C3%A9rieure">La Femme supérieure</a>". The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the "La Femme supérieure", Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in "Z. Marcas" is evidence of his failure.

Charles Rabourdin's interactions with Marcas echo the difficulties he saw in his father's government career. As critic Herbert J. Hunt notes, Marcas "represents in the political sphere what Rabourdin represents in the administrative sphere". Allan H. Pasco echoes this point: "Charles has had the lesson of futility from two tutors: his father and Marcas. Outstanding men have no future in politics, in the administration, or in business – at least not in France."

Balzac's use of recurring characters provides unparalleled depth and <a href="characterization">characterization</a> for his readers. "This technique", insists critic Mary Susan McCarthy, "not only furnished him with a unifying principle but also offers the reader a network of relationships through which to unite the many separate stories and novels in which the characters appear, forming the fictional universe that is "La Comédie humaine"." Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he "did not know where to begin".

Z. Marcas himself appears in one other Balzac story, "<a href="Un%20prince%20de%20la%20boh%C3%A8me">Un prince de la bohème</a>", which the author revised twice before it appeared in its final form. In the 1846 edition, the character of Marcel has been changed to Marcas; but this may have been a printer's error. As Anthony Pugh explains: "This detail is inexplicable; the principal character of "Z. Marcas", who does not otherwise appear outside his own story, seems a very unlikely candidate for the role. Could it be a misprint?"

Balzac was known for his use of <a href="literary%20realism">realism</a>, including exquisite detail when describing people and locations. His fanaticism about the name Z. Marcas is cited as an example of the author's "zeal" for "close local color". Balzac's belief in the connection between one's name and one's destiny is brought to the fore; the pattern demonstrated in "Z. Marcas" reflects many in the larger collection of Balzac's work. As critic Charles Affron puts it: "The creator of a universe so tied up with inner rhythms and resounding with so many echoes does not hesitate to imply that the germs of a character's failure can be found in the physical qualities of his name." This idea came to Balzac from <a href="Laurence%20Sterne">Laurence Sterne</a>, as he acknowledged in his 1841 story "<a href="Ursule%20Mirou%C3%ABt">Ursule Mirouët</a>": ("Should we not agree with Sterne in recognizing the occult power in names, which sometimes mock and sometimes define the characters of their possessors?")

"Z. Marcas" includes many other examples of realist detail as well. The students live in shabby environs, furnished by ("only a scrap of thin carpet"). They share ("a tawny twig of Turkish tobacco") with their neighbor, and the three discuss political personalities drawn directly from recent history, including <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt the Elder</a> and the <a href="Voltigeurs">Voltigeurs</a>. Still, realist detail is not commonly in the foreground of commentary about "Z. Marcas". As Hunt explains, it is mostly remembered "as a vehicle for a characteristic Balzacian whimsy".

"Z. Marcas" is best known for its reflection of Balzac's political views, specifically the neglect of talent and ability in a sea of republican mediocrity; and the abandonment of young people by older generations. Pasco suggests: "'Z. Marcas' has then become, not the story of one particular, political failure, not the story of a young man of potential who abandons France for Malaysia, but the story of France herself, wasting away and thus losing her greatest resource – her youth."

Balzac believed that the <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a> had brought a wave of poor leadership, and that people of quality and integrity were scorned in the name of <a href="cronyism">cronyism</a>. Marcas, a prime example of such a man, is doomed to fail in the government of <a href="Louis-Philippe%20I%2C%20King%20of%20the%20French">Louis-Philippe</a>. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: ("we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry"). Marcas' personal woes – and his tales of life within the corridors of power – strongly reinforce this view.

Through Marcas, Balzac claimed that young people in France were being ignored by government officials, and predicted an uprising:

Although Balzac's "Revue Parisienne" lasted only three issues, "Z. Marcas" has remained a moderately popular story. Hunt notes that it has "only subsidiary value", but biographer André Maurois calls it "an admirable tale". Robb notes that "Z. Marcas" was an important herald of political realities to come, and provided a warning to the political class of the time.

As critic Félicien Marceau points out, however, the greatest value of "Z Marcas" may have been for the author himself.

Okęcie Airport incident

The Okęcie Airport incident () was a dispute between players and technical staff of the <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">Poland national football team</a> on 29 November 1980, starting at the team hotel in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> and climaxing at <a href="Frederic%20Chopin%20Airport">Okęcie Airport</a>. An incident of footballing insubordination at a time when <a href="strike%20action">strike action</a> and other forms of civil resistance were intensifying in <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland">communist Poland</a>, it caused a domestic press storm, which led first to the suspension of several prominent players, then the resignation of the team <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a>, <a href="Ryszard%20Kulesza">Ryszard Kulesza</a>.

<a href="J%C3%B3zef%20M%C5%82ynarczyk">Józef Młynarczyk</a>, the team's <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a>, was hungover when the time came to leave the hotel for the airport, having not been to sleep following a night on the town with a friend. Kulesza and one of his assistants, <a href="Bernard%20Blaut">Bernard Blaut</a>, decided to leave Młynarczyk behind, much to the indignation of some players, including <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Terlecki">Stanisław Terlecki</a>, <a href="Zbigniew%20Boniek">Zbigniew Boniek</a>, <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20Smolarek">Włodzimierz Smolarek</a> and <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20%C5%BBmuda">Władysław Żmuda</a>. Terlecki, a stridently pro-Western intellectual with a reputation for mocking the communist establishment, was particularly angered, and himself drove Młynarczyk to the airport, where the players continued their protests. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed Młynarczyk to travel with the team.

The Polish media took hold of the story and vociferously attacked the rebellious players over the following days. Meanwhile, Terlecki again defied the communist authorities by arranging for the players to meet <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>. The <a href="Polish%20Football%20Association">Polish Football Association</a> sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home and imposed various bans preventing them from playing at the international and club level over the next year. Terlecki and Boniek in particular were condemned by the association as insubordinate "rabble-rousers". Smolarek received a more modest, <a href="Suspended%20sentence">suspended</a> ban. Kulesza resigned in protest at the sanctions imposed on the players, saying they were too harsh. Most of the banned players were reinstated during 1981, but Terlecki was not—he emigrated to the United States in June that year and although he returned home five years later, he never played for Poland again.

In June 1976, <a href="June%201976%20protests">a series of protests</a> took place across <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland">communist Poland</a> soon after the government announced plans to increase sharply the <a href="fixed%20price">fixed price</a>s charged nationwide for many basic commodities. Violent incidents occurred in <a href="P%C5%82ock">Płock</a>, <a href="Radom">Radom</a> and <a href="Ursus%20%28district%20in%20Warsaw%29">Ursus</a> as the protests were forcibly put down, and the planned price hikes were cancelled. These demonstrations and the events surrounding them brought the Polish workforce and intellectual political opposition together, and by 1980, a campaign of <a href="civil%20resistance">civil resistance</a> for political change was intensifying strongly. Industrial <a href="strike%20action">strike action</a> in <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a> in July 1980—the so-called <a href="Lublin%201980%20strikes">Lublin July</a>—preceded the formation of <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a> ("Solidarność") in the port city of <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a> during the following months. This was the first non-communist <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> in an <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a> country. The government took several steps to obstruct Solidarity's emergence, enforcing press censorship and cutting off telephone connections between the coast and the <a href="hinterland">hinterland</a>, but despite these efforts four out of every five Polish workers were members of the union by late 1980.

Poland's <a href="Poland%20national%20football%20team">national football team</a>, <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">managed</a> by <a href="Ryszard%20Kulesza">Ryszard Kulesza</a>, was then regarded as one of the world's best, having finished third at the <a href="1974%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1974 World Cup</a>. In November 1980 it was ranked sixth in the world by the <a href="World%20Football%20Elo%20Ratings">Elo rating system</a>. Late that month, the team was preparing for a <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a> <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28UEFA%29">qualifying</a> match away against <a href="Malta%20national%20football%20team">Malta</a> on 7 December. The squad's departure was scheduled for 29 November, 10 days before the game, so the players could attend a training camp in Italy, then contest a warm-up match against a team representing the <a href="Serie%20A">Italian league</a>.

One of Poland's key players at the time was <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Terlecki">Stanisław Terlecki</a>, a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> whose club was <a href="%C5%81KS%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">ŁKS Łódź</a>. The son of university lecturers, Terlecki held a degree in history from the <a href="University%20of%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">University of Łódź</a>, as well as fervent anti-communist political views and a strident attitude regarding their display. He was known for openly mocking the establishment with subversive abandon, and regularly made jokes in public about communist authority figures and organisations, prompting the ire of the <a href="Polish%20Football%20Association">Polish Football Association</a> (PZPN) and the Warsaw police force. The first Polish international player with a university degree in anything other than <a href="physical%20education">physical education</a>, he eschewed the Polish sports magazines read by many of his teammates on road trips in favour of <a href="Western%20world">Western</a> news journals such as "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>". Like many Polish intellectuals, he sympathised with movements such as Solidarity; following their example, he twice attempted to unionise Polish footballers during the late 1970s. The PZPN blocked both attempts, banning Terlecki from all organised football each time; first for six months, then for a year.

Late on 28 November 1980, the night before the team's departure for Italy, <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20M%C5%82ynarczyk">Józef Młynarczyk</a> and forward <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20Smolarek">Włodzimierz Smolarek</a>, both of <a href="Widzew%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Widzew Łódź</a>, left the team hotel in Warsaw, the Hotel Vera, without permission. According to Smolarek they did this to get some dinner because they did not like the food at the hotel. They met a friend of Młynarczyk's, sports journalist <a href="Wojciech%20Zieli%C5%84ski">Wojciech Zieliński</a>, at the Adria nightclub. According to <a href="Andrzej%20Iwan">Andrzej Iwan</a>, another member of the team, the main topic of conversation was Zieliński's estranged wife, who had been caught prostituting herself around Warsaw, and had since moved to Italy. Several Poland players knew her, and Młynarczyk had just been to Italy to play for Widzew Łódź against <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>. According to Iwan, the journalist encouraged Młynarczyk to drink as they talked, hoping the goalkeeper might have news of her. Smolarek left the club around 02:00, but Młynarczyk and Zieliński stayed until about three hours later.

A senior national team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the <a href="Polish%20Land%20Forces">Polish Army</a>, said he saw the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined the rest of the players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked up about possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, <a href="Bernard%20Blaut">Bernard Blaut</a>, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.

Smolarek, Terlecki and two other Polish players—<a href="Zbigniew%20Boniek">Zbigniew Boniek</a> and <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20%C5%BBmuda">Władysław Żmuda</a>, both of Widzew Łódź—angrily objected and nearly came to blows with Blaut. <a href="Grzegorz%20Lato">Grzegorz Lato</a>, one of the team's forwards, did not join the protest but later said that he had not thought Młynarczyk drunk enough to warrant exclusion. The team eventually left without Terlecki or Młynarczyk. Terlecki, whose own car was to hand, drove himself and Młynarczyk to the airport, where the confrontation continued.

Terlecki tried to stop the many pressmen at the airport from photographing Młynarczyk by running around, yelling, and snatching cameras and microphones from their hands. Meanwhile, the other players attempted to talk Kulesza around, telling him that Młynarczyk had serious personal problems. Kulesza eventually relented and allowed the goalkeeper to travel with the team.

Among the journalists at the airport were Jacek Gucwa of <a href="Telewizja%20Polska">Polish Television</a>, Bogdan Chruścicki of <a href="Polskie%20Radio">Polish Radio</a>, and Remigiusz Hetman of the weekly football journal "<a href="Pi%C5%82ka%20No%C5%BCna">Piłka Nożna</a>". News about the incident quickly spread across the country, partly because of Terlecki's outlandish actions in the reporters' presence—Iwan later reflected that Terlecki had "made so much commotion it was impossible to sweep everything under the carpet". Boniek corroborates this version of events: "Terlecki was massively to blame. He brought Młynarczyk to the airport in his own car, then pulled the plug powering a TV camera out of the wall." Grzegorz Majchrzak, a historian of the Polish <a href="Institute%20of%20National%20Remembrance">Institute of National Remembrance</a>, questions Boniek's words, positing that he might have distorted events in an attempt to distance himself from Terlecki.

The government attempted to use the scandal as a popular distraction, aiming to deflect attention from the strikes and other industrial action. A number of journalists attacked the players who had supported Młynarczyk; the "<a href="Przegl%C4%85d%20Sportowy">Przegląd Sportowy</a>" sports magazine ran the headline "No Mercy for Those Guilty of the Scandal at the Airport" while "<a href="Tempo%20%28Polish%20magazine%29">Tempo</a>", another journal, was similarly severe, proclaiming "This Cannot Be Tolerated". "Piłka Nożna" condemned the "magnificent men ... who think they can do what they want", but at the same time questioned the conduct of the team's non-playing staff.

In the Italian capital, Terlecki continued to defy the establishment. The players were under strict instructions not to associate with the Vatican while in Rome, but Terlecki arranged for them to meet <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>, who was himself Polish. Seeing this as a second act of defiance, the PZPN promptly sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home, escorted by General <a href="Marian%20Ryba">Marian Ryba</a> of the Polish Army, who was also the football association president. <a href="Lech%20Pozna%C5%84">Lech Poznań</a>'s <a href="Piotr%20Mowlik">Piotr Mowlik</a> replaced Młynarczyk for the match against Malta, which Poland won 2–0.

Ryba announced on 1 December 1980 that he intended to bar the dissenting players from the Poland squad. When the rest of the team returned to Poland, Terlecki once again attempted to form a footballers' union. Securing the support of 16 other Poland international players, he wrote a letter to the PZPN declaring their intention to do so, leading the authorities to order them to face a tribunal. Only Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk continued to endorse the letter when challenged in court.

On 15 December, PZPN officials attempted to reconstruct the night's events, asking various players and staff to give accounts of what had happened. Several journalists were present. The stories told contradicted each other in several places, notably regarding how much Młynarczyk had had to drink. The team's technical staff said that he had been obviously intoxicated when they had seen him, while the goalkeeper insisted he had taken only "three glasses of champagne and a sip of beer" with his friend. Another point of contention regarded the conversation at the airport, which had caused Kulesza to yield. It was generally agreed that the players had talked the manager around by telling him that Młynarczyk had personal problems, but the non-playing staff now accused them of emotional blackmail. The players said their intention had been to explain the goalkeeper's off-field issues to help the manager make a more informed decision.

Terlecki's answers at this meeting under the questioning of General Ryba, a former military prosecutor, were typically provocative; when the general asked what time Terlecki had left the hotel on 29 November, the ŁKS forward said 08:00. "Are you sure it was 08:00?" Ryba pressed—"Are you sure it wasn't 08:02?" The player replied that he wasn't: "No. Maybe it was even 08:03. I don't know this time exactly, because I have one of your Russian watches."
A week later, the PZPN announced its final verdict. The only versions of events accepted for consideration were those recounted by Kulesza and Blaut; those of all the players and of the team physiotherapist and sport psychologist were dismissed. Żmuda and Młynarczyk were barred from playing for either Poland or their clubs for eight months, and Terlecki and Boniek for twelve. Smolarek received a two-month ban, which was <a href="Suspended%20sentence">suspended</a> for six months. Citing their previous records of insubordination and misconduct, the PZPN called Terlecki and Boniek "rabble-rousers".

Kulesza left his job soon afterwards; according to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN of bias, saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder some of the blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising <a href="Marek%20Dziuba">Marek Dziuba</a>, <a href="Pawe%C5%82%20Janas">Paweł Janas</a> and <a href="Wojciech%20Rudy">Wojciech Rudy</a>, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at what they saw as excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.

Despite being without some of their top players, Widzew Łódź were crowned champions of Poland at the end of the 1980–81 season. Ryba left his post in April 1981, along with a number of his contemporaries, described by <a href="Stefan%20Szczep%C5%82ek">Stefan Szczepłek</a>, a sports journalist and football historian, as "honest officials, together with some football-friendly Polish Army officers". In their place came a number of communist officials, most prominently <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20Reczek">Włodzimierz Reczek</a>, an erstwhile <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a> member, who took over as head of the football association despite a reputation for not liking the sport.

Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda had their bans cancelled early. Żmuda and Młynarczyk returned in the 1–0 home win over <a href="East%20Germany%20national%20football%20team">East Germany</a> on 2 May 1981, and Boniek was reinstated four months later. The players' recall was partly due to the efforts of Kulesza's replacement, <a href="Antoni%20Piechniczek">Antoni Piechniczek</a>, to secure their return. According to Majchrzak, Boniek and Żmuda apologised for their actions before the General Committee for Physical Culture and Sport of the Polish People's Republic, the PZPN's governing body, but kept this from Terlecki, who appealed to have his ban lifted several times, but to no avail.

Terlecki openly participated in <a href="Independent%20Students%27%20Union">students' strikes</a> at his old university in Łódź and across Poland over the next few months, providing food to the students by the car-load. ŁKS cancelled his registration in early 1981. Majchrzak stresses that Terlecki was the only player involved in the incident not to regain his place in the Poland team, and claims that this was down to an intense grudge held against him by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Poland%29">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a> and <a href="S%C5%82u%C5%BCba%20Bezpiecze%C5%84stwa">Secret Police</a> (SB). Terlecki developed his own theory that the media circus following the airport incident had been deliberately engineered by the SB to head the players off forming their own trade union. There were several other incidents of drunkenness involving Młynarczyk, Majchrzak writes, but this was the only occasion when any player was punished for it. In October 1981, when the team travelled to Argentina, Młynarczyk arrived at Okęcie "completely drunk", according to Iwan, but far from reprimanding him, team staff gave him even more alcohol during the flight to help ease the pain of his broken finger.

Poland qualified for the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a> with a perfect record, and performed strongly in the competition, losing to <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italy</a> in the semi-finals but beating <a href="France%20national%20football%20team">France</a> in a play-off to claim third place. Kulesza became the manager of <a href="Tunisia%20national%20football%20team">Tunisia</a>, and later founded a coaching school in Warsaw.

Saying he was "being treated like a leper", Terlecki emigrated to the United States in June 1981, and joined the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Spirit">Pittsburgh Spirit</a> of the <a href="Major%20Indoor%20Soccer%20League%20%281978%E2%80%931992%29">Major Indoor Soccer League</a>. He pursued a new life in America with great vigour. Terlecki's on-field displays in the U.S. were widely praised—in three seasons with Pittsburgh he became the club's all-time top goalscorer—but managers reportedly had trouble "harness[ing] Terlecki's fiery temper", and his wife Ewa became intensely homesick. Terlecki announced his intention to move back to Poland in 1985, saying that he believed the political situation had improved and that he wished to reunite his family. He returned home the following year, and resumed his career in Polish club football. He expressed a desire to play for the national team again, but was never selected.

Alice Ayres

Alice Ayres (12 September 1859 – 1885) was an English <a href="nursemaid">nursemaid</a> honoured for her bravery in rescuing the children in her care from a house fire. Ayres was a <a href="Domestic%20worker">household assistant</a> and nursemaid to the family of her brother-in-law and sister, Henry and Mary Ann Chandler. The Chandlers owned an oil and paint shop in <a href="Union%20Street%2C%20London">Union Street</a>, <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, then just south of London, and Ayres lived with the family above the shop. In 1885 fire broke out in the shop, and Ayres rescued three of her nieces from the burning building, before falling from a window and suffering fatal injury.

Britain, in the wake of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, experienced a period of great social change in which the rapidly growing news media paid increasing attention to the activities of the poorer classes. The manner of Ayres's death caused great public interest, with large numbers of people attending her funeral and contributing to the funding of a memorial. Shortly after her death, she underwent what has been described as a "secular <a href="Canonization">canonisation</a>", being widely depicted in popular culture and, although very little was known about her life, widely cited as a role model. Various social and political movements promoted Ayres as an example of the values held by their particular movement. The circumstances of her death were distorted to give the impression that she was an employee willing to die for the sake of her employer's family, rather than for children to whom she was closely related. In 1902 her name was added to the <a href="Memorial%20to%20Heroic%20Self-Sacrifice">Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice</a> and in 1936 a street near the scene of the fire was renamed Ayres Street in her honour.

The case of Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of <a href="Patrick%20Marber">Patrick Marber</a>'s 1997 play "<a href="Closer%20%28play%29">Closer</a>", and the <a href="Closer%20%282004%20film%29">2004 film</a> based on it. An important element of the plot revolves around a central character who fabricates her identity based on the description of Ayres on the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice, with some of the film's key scenes shot around the memorial.

Alice Ayres was born into a large family in 1859, the seventh of ten children of a labourer, John Ayres. In December 1877, her sister Mary Ann (older than Alice by eleven years) married an oil and paint dealer, Henry Chandler. Chandler owned a shop at 194 Union Street in Southwark, about south of the present-day <a href="Tate%20Modern">Tate Modern</a>.

In 1881 Ayres worked as a <a href="Domestic%20worker">household assistant</a> to Edward Woakes, a doctor specialising in ear and throat disorders. By 1885 she had become a household assistant and <a href="nursemaid">nursemaid</a> to the Chandlers, living with the family. After her death, Ayres was described by a local resident as "not one of your fast sort—gentle and quiet-spoke, and always busy about her work". Another neighbour told the press that "no merry making, no excursion, no family festivity could tempt her from her self-imposed duties. The children must be bathed and put to bed, the clothes must be mended, the rooms must be 'tidied up', the cloth must be laid, the supper carefully prepared, before Alice would dream of setting forth on her own pleasures".

The Chandlers' shop at Union Street, as depicted in a contemporary newspaper illustration, occupied the corner premises of a building of three storeys. The family lived above the shop, with Henry and Mary Ann Chandler sleeping in one bedroom with their six-year-old son Henry, and Ayres sharing a room on the second floor with her nieces, five-year-old Edith, four-year-old Ellen and three-year-old Elizabeth. On the night of 1885, fire broke out in the oil and paint shop, trapping the family upstairs. Gunpowder and casks of oil were stored in the lower floors of the building, causing the flames to spread rapidly. Although the shop was near the headquarters of the <a href="London%20Fire%20Brigade">London Fire Brigade</a> and the emergency services were quickly on scene, by the time the fire engine arrived intense flames were coming from the lower windows, making it impossible for the fire brigade to position ladders. Meanwhile, Ayres, wearing only a nightdress, had tried to reach her sister but was unable to get to her through the smoke. The crowd that had gathered outside the building were shouting to Ayres to jump. Instead she returned to the room she shared with the three young girls and threw a mattress out of the window, carefully dropping Edith onto it. Despite further calls from below to jump and save herself, she left the window and returned carrying Ellen. Ellen clung to Ayres and refused to be dropped, but Ayres threw her out of the building, and the child was caught by a member of the crowd. Ayres went back into the smoke a third time and returned carrying badly injured Elizabeth, whom she dropped safely onto the mattress.

After rescuing the three girls, Ayres tried to jump herself, but overcome by smoke inhalation, fell limply from the window, striking the projecting shop sign. She missed the mattress and the crowd below and fell onto the pavement, suffering spinal injuries. Ayres was rushed to nearby <a href="Guy%27s%20Hospital">Guy's Hospital</a> where, because of the public interest that her story excited, hourly bulletins were issued about her health and <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> sent a <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> to enquire after her condition.

The oil and paint stored in the shop caused the fire to burn out of control, and when the fire services were eventually able to enter the premises the rest of the family were found dead. The body of Henry Chandler was found on the staircase, still clutching a locked <a href="strongbox">strongbox</a> filled with the shop's takings, while the badly burnt remains of Mary Ann Chandler were found lying next to a first floor window, the body of six-year-old Henry by her side. Ayres's condition deteriorated and she died in Guy's Hospital on 1885. Her last words were reported as "I tried my best and could try no more". Elizabeth, the last of the children to be rescued, had suffered severe burns to her legs and died shortly after Ayres.

Ayres's body was not taken to Guy's Hospital's mortuary, but was laid in a room set aside for her. The estimated value of the floral tributes came to over £1,000 (about £ as of 2019). Ayres was posthumously recognised by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Board%20of%20Works">Metropolitan Board of Works</a>-controlled <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Life%20from%20Fire">Royal Society for the Protection of Life from Fire</a> (today the Society for the Protection of Life from Fire), who awarded her father John Ayres a sum of 10 <a href="Guinea%20%28coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ as of 2019) in her honour. A memorial service for Ayres at <a href="Southwark%20Cathedral">St Saviour's Church</a> (now Southwark Cathedral) attracted such a large crowd that mourners were turned away due to lack of standing room, while a collection taken at the memorial service comprised 951 coins, totalling over £7. Ayres was given a large public funeral, attended by over 10,000 mourners. Her coffin was carried from her parents' house to her grave in <a href="Isleworth%20Cemetery">Isleworth Cemetery</a> by a team of 16 firemen, relieving each other in sets of four. The church service was attended by a group of 20 girls, dressed in white, from the village school that Ayres had attended. It had been planned that the girls should follow the coffin to the graveside and sing, but a severe hailstorm prevented this.

Henry and Mary Ann Chandler were buried in <a href="Lambeth%20Cemetery">Lambeth Cemetery</a> along with the two children who had died in the fire. Edith and Ellen Chandler were accepted by the <a href="Joseph%20Soul">Orphan Working School</a> in <a href="Kentish%20Town">Kentish Town</a> and trained as domestic servants.

Shortly after the fire it was decided to erect a monument to Ayres, to be funded by public subscription, and by August 1885 the fund had raised over £100 (about £ as of 2019). On 1885 work began on the memorial. The monument was erected above her grave in Isleworth Cemetery, and was of an Egyptian design inspired by <a href="Cleopatra%27s%20Needle%2C%20London">Cleopatra's Needle</a>, which had been raised in central London in 1878. It took the form of a solid red <a href="granite">granite</a> <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>, and is still today the tallest grave marker in the cemetery. On the front of the obelisk is inscribed The right hand side of the monument lists the ten members of the Alice Ayres Memorial Committee, chaired by Rev H. W. P. Richards. The Union Street fire and Ayres's rescue of the children caused great public interest from the outset, and the fire, Ayres's death and funeral, and the fundraising for and erection of the memorial were all reported in detail in the local and national press and throughout the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>.

The British government had traditionally paid little attention to the poor, but in the wake of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> attitudes towards the accomplishments of the lower classes were changing. The growth of the railways, the mechanisation of agriculture and the need for labour in the new inner-city factories had broken the traditional feudal economy and caused the rapid growth of cities, while increasing literacy rates led to a greater interest in the media and current affairs among ordinary workers. In 1856 the first military honour for bravery open to all ranks, the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, had been instituted, while in 1866 the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20for%20Lifesaving">Albert Medal</a>, the first official honour open to civilians of all classes, was introduced. Additionally, a number of private and charitable organisations dedicated to lifesaving, most prominently the <a href="Royal%20Humane%20Society">Royal Humane Society</a> (1776) and <a href="Royal%20National%20Lifeboat%20Institution">Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a> (1824), were increasing in activity and prominence, and gave awards and medals as a means of publicising their activities and lifesaving advice.

Painter and sculptor <a href="George%20Frederic%20Watts">George Frederic Watts</a> and his second wife, designer and artist <a href="Mary%20Fraser%20Tytler">Mary Fraser Tytler</a>, had long been advocates of the idea of art as a force for social change, and of the principle that narratives of great deeds would provide guidance to address the serious social problems of British cities. Watts had recently painted a series of portraits of leading figures he considered to be a positive social influence, the "Hall of Fame", which was donated to the <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28London%29">National Portrait Gallery</a>; since at least 1866 he had proposed as a companion piece a monument to "unknown worth", celebrating the bravery of ordinary people.

On 5 September 1887, a letter was published in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" from Watts, proposing a scheme to commemorate the <a href="Golden%20Jubilee">Golden Jubilee</a> of Queen Victoria by means of collecting and commemorating "a complete record of the stories of heroism in every-day life". He cited the death of Alice Ayres as an example of the type of event he proposed to commemorate, and included in his letter a distorted account of Ayres's actions during the Union Street fire.

Watts had originally proposed that the monument take the form of a colossal bronze figure, but by 1887 was proposing that the memorial take the form of "a kind of <a href="Camposanto%20Monumentale">Campo Santo</a>", consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with the names of everyday heroes, to be built in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>. Watts's suggestion was not taken up, leading Watts to comment that "if I had proposed a race course round Hyde Park, there would have been plenty of sympathisers". However, his high-profile lobbying further raised the already high public awareness of the death of Alice Ayres.

<a href="Emilia%20Aylmer%20Blake">Emilia Aylmer Blake</a> wrote perhaps the first poem about Ayres, titled , which she recited at a social gathering in June 1885. Sir <a href="Francis%20Hastings%20Doyle">Francis Hastings Doyle</a> also wrote a well-received poem in honour of Ayres, as did leading social reformer and women's rights campaigner <a href="Laura%20Ormiston%20Chant">Laura Ormiston Chant</a>. By the late 1880s Ayres was coming to be seen as a model of British devotion to duty, and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children, including as the first story in <a href="F.%20J.%20Cross">F. J. Cross</a>'s influential "Beneath the Banner", in which Cross remarked that: "She had tried to do her best "always". Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was any thought of her dying a heroic death. So, when the great trial came, she was prepared; and what seems to us Divine unselfishness appeared to her but simple duty."
In 1890 a series of painted panels by <a href="Walter%20Crane">Walter Crane</a> were unveiled in <a href="Octavia%20Hill">Octavia Hill</a>'s <a href="Red%20Cross%20Hall">Red Cross Hall</a>, from the site of the Union Street fire. Inspired by George Frederic Watts's proposals, the panels depicted instances of heroism in everyday life; Watts himself refused to become involved in the project, as his proposed monument was intended to be a source of inspiration and contemplation as opposed to simply commemoration, and he felt that an artistic work would potentially distract viewers from the most important element of the cases, the heroic sacrifices of the individuals involved.

The first of Crane's panels depicted the Union Street fire. It is an idealised image depicting Ayres as the rescued rather than the rescuer, blending religious imagery with traditional 19th-century symbols of British heroism, and bears no relationship to actual events. Ayres, in a long and flowing pure white gown, stands at a first floor window, surrounded in flames and holding a small child. A fireman stands on a ladder and reaches out to Ayres and the child; meanwhile, a sailor in full <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> uniform holds a second child. Although in reality Ayres had been at a much higher level of the building and the heat of the burning oil and gunpowder had made it impossible for the fire brigade to approach the building, by depicting Ayres with the fireman and sailor, widely seen as symbols of British heroism and British strength, Crane's picture further enhanced her growing reputation as a heroic figure. Crane's picture in the Red Cross Hall was itself mentioned in , a <a href="border%20ballad">border ballad</a> by <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a> founder <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">Canon</a> <a href="Hardwicke%20Rawnsley">Hardwicke Rawnsley</a> published in his 1896 "Ballads of Brave Deeds", for which George Frederic Watts wrote the preface.

In 1898 George Frederic Watts was approached by <a href="Henry%20Gamble">Henry Gamble</a>, vicar of <a href="St%20Botolph%27s%2C%20Aldersgate">St Botolph's, Aldersgate</a> church in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. St Botolph's former <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a> had recently been converted, along with two smaller adjoining burial grounds, into <a href="Postman%27s%20Park">Postman's Park</a>, one of the largest public parks in the City of London, and the church was engaged in a protracted financial and legal dispute over ownership of part of the park. To provide a public justification for keeping the disputed land as part of the park, and to raise the park's profile and assist in fundraising, the church offered part of the park as a site for his proposed memorial. Watts agreed, and in 1900 the <a href="Memorial%20to%20Heroic%20Self-Sacrifice">Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice</a> was unveiled by Alfred Newton, <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>, and <a href="Mandell%20Creighton">Mandell Creighton</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. The memorial consisted of a and wooden <a href="loggia">loggia</a> with a tiled roof, designed by <a href="Ernest%20George">Ernest George</a>, sheltering a wall with space for 120 ceramic memorial tablets.
The memorial tablets were handmade and expensive to produce, and at the time of the memorial's unveiling only four were in place. In 1902 a further nine tablets were unveiled, including the memorial to Alice Ayres for which Watts had long lobbied. Made by <a href="William%20De%20Morgan">William De Morgan</a> in the <a href="Arts%20and%20Crafts%20movement">Arts and Crafts</a> style, the green-and-white tablet reads "Alice Ayres, daughter of a bricklayer's labourer who by intrepid conduct saved 3 children from a burning house in <a href="Union%20Street%2C%20Borough">Union Street, Borough</a>, at the cost of her own young life April 24, 1885".

Although the public would have been familiar with the concept of a female national heroic figure following the widespread coverage and public admiration of <a href="Harriet%20Newell">Harriet Newell</a>, <a href="Grace%20Darling">Grace Darling</a> and <a href="Florence%20Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>, the ongoing coverage of Ayres and her elevation as a national hero was unusual for the period. Ayres was an uneducated working-class woman, who after her death underwent what has been described as "a secular canonisation", at a time when, despite the gradual formal recognition of the contributions of the lower classes, national heroes were generally male and engaged in exploration, the military, religion or science and engineering.

This was a period in which political pressures for social reform were growing. The version of Ayres presented to the public as a woman devoted entirely to duty embodied the idealised British character at the time, while the image of a hard-working but uncomplaining woman who set the welfare of others above her own embodied the idealised vision of the working class presented by social reformers, and the ideal selfless and dedicated woman presented by campaigners for women's rights. At the unveiling of the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice the Lord Mayor, Alfred Newton, had remarked that it was "intended to perpetuate the acts of heroism which belonged to the working classes", while George Frederic Watts, although he was opposed in principle to discrimination based on class and saw the Memorial as being theoretically open to all classes, had remarked that "the higher classes do not or ought not to require reminders or inducements". Watts saw the purpose of his Memorial not as a commemoration of deeds, but as a tool for the education of the lower classes.

Watts's view was shared by others who sought to provide inspirational material on British heroes, and authors writing about Ayres systematically altered the fact that the children rescued were members of her family, instead describing them as the children of her employer. Press reports at the time of the fire described Ayres variously as a "little nursemaid", "a willing, honest, hard-working servant", and a "poor little domestic". As well as Watts's 1887 description of Ayres as "the maid of all work at an oilmonger's", Cross's chapter on Ayres in "Beneath the Banner" is titled "Only a Nurse Girl!", while Rawnsley called her "the nursemaid in the household". Barrington, writing five years after the fire at the unveiling of Price's panel, acknowledges in a footnote that Ayres was related to the Chandlers, but nonetheless describes her as displaying the "typical English virtues—courage, fortitude, and an unquestioning sense of duty".

While George and Mary Watts and their fellow <a href="Paternalism">paternalist</a> social reformers, along with the broadly sympathetic mainstream British press, portrayed Ayres as an inspirational selfless servant to her employer, others had a different view. The left-wing "<a href="Reynold%27s%20News">Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper</a>" complained that the lack of support for Ayres's family from the state was symbolic of poor treatment of workers as a whole. The pioneering feminist periodical "<a href="The%20Englishwoman%27s%20Review">The Englishwoman's Review</a>" described their "righteous pride" at Ayres's "instinctive motherhood"; on the other hand "<a href="Young%20England%20%28magazine%29">Young England</a>", an imperialist children's <a href="story%20paper">story paper</a>, said that "there is no sex in self-sacrifice", lauding Ayres as a model of devotion to duty.

In 1936 the new <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> administration of the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> renamed White Cross Street, near the site of the Red Cross Hall and the scene of the Union Street fire, to Ayres Street in tribute to Alice Ayres, a name it retains today. The Chandlers' house at 194 Union Street no longer stands, and the site is occupied by part of the Union House office complex; immediately opposite the site of the fire is the present-day headquarters of the <a href="London%20Fire%20Brigade">London Fire Brigade</a>.

Alice Ayres came to renewed public notice with the release of the 1997 play "<a href="Closer%20%28play%29">Closer</a>" by <a href="Patrick%20Marber">Patrick Marber</a> and the 2004 <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA Award</a>- and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a>-winning film <a href="Closer%20%282004%20film%29">"Closer"</a> based on it starring <a href="Natalie%20Portman">Natalie Portman</a>, <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>, <a href="Jude%20Law">Jude Law</a> and <a href="Clive%20Owen">Clive Owen</a>. A key plot element revolves around the memorial tablet to Ayres at the <a href="Memorial%20to%20Heroic%20Self-Sacrifice">Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice</a> in <a href="Postman%27s%20Park">Postman's Park</a>, in which it is revealed that the character Jane Jones (played by Portman in the film), who calls herself Alice Ayres for most of the story, has in fact fabricated her name and identity based on the tablet on the memorial, which she reads at the time of her first meeting with Dan Woolf (played by Jude Law) near the beginning of the film. The park, and the memorial to Ayres, feature prominently in the opening and closing scenes of the film.

Operation Teardrop

Operation Teardrop was a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> operation of World War II conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s approaching the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States East Coast</a> that were believed to be armed with <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a>s. <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> had threatened in propaganda to attack New York with V-1 flying bombs and <a href="Rocket%20U-boat">V-2 missiles</a>. After the war the Allies determined that the submarines had not been carrying either.

Operation Teardrop was planned during late 1944 in response to <a href="Intelligence%20%28information%20gathering%29">intelligence</a> reports which indicated that Germany was <a href="Rocket%20U-boat">preparing a force</a> of missile-armed submarines. Two large US Navy <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> task forces were set up. The plan was executed in April 1945 after several <a href="German%20Type%20IX%20submarine">Type IX submarines</a> put to sea from Norway bound for North America. While severe weather conditions in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a> greatly reduced the effectiveness of the four US Navy <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s involved, long patrol lines of <a href="destroyer%20escort">destroyer escort</a>s detected and engaged most of the German submarines. Aircraft of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> supported this effort. Five of the seven submarines in the group stationed off the US were sunk, four with their entire crews. 33 <a href="German%20submarine%20U-546">"U-546"</a> crew members were captured, and specialists among them abusively interrogated. One destroyer escort was sunk, with the loss of most of her crew. The war ended shortly afterwards and all surviving U-boats surrendered; interrogation of their crews found that missile launching equipment was not fitted.

In late 1944, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> received intelligence reports which suggested that Nazi Germany's "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" was planning to use launched from submarines to attack cities on the east coast of the United States. In September of that year, <a href="Oscar%20Mantel">Oscar Mantel</a>, a spy captured by the US Navy when the submarine transporting him to <a href="Maine">Maine</a> was sunk, told his <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> interrogators that several missile-equipped U-boats were being readied. <a href="United%20States%20Tenth%20Fleet">United States Tenth Fleet</a> analysts subsequently examined photos of unusual mountings on U-boats at <a href="German%20U-boat%20bases%20in%20occupied%20Norway">bases in Norway</a>, but concluded that they were wooden tracks used to load torpedoes. Further rumors of missile-armed submarines emerged later that year, including one from Sweden passed on by the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Expeditionary%20Force">Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force</a>. The British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> discounted these reports, and assessed that while V-1s could be potentially mounted on Type IX submarines, the Germans were unlikely to devote scarce resources to such a project.
Despite the Tenth Fleet and Admiralty assessments, the U.S. military and government remained concerned that Germany would conduct vengeance attacks against East Coast cities. In early November 1944, the <a href="Eastern%20Sea%20Frontier">Eastern Sea Frontier</a> mounted an intensive search for submarines within of New York City. In early December 1944, the spies <a href="William%20Colepaugh">William Curtis Colepaugh</a> and <a href="Erich%20Gimpel">Erich Gimpel</a>, who had been captured in New York City after being landed by in Maine, told their interrogators that Germany was preparing a group of rocket-equipped submarines. On 10 December, the <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a>, <a href="Fiorello%20La%20Guardia">Fiorello La Guardia</a>, publicly warned that Germany was considering an attack on New York with long-range rockets. La Guardia's warning and the claims made by the captured spies received considerable media coverage. Despite this, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">Department of War</a>, which was dominated by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a>, advised President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> on 11 December that the threat of missile attack was so low that it did not justify the diversion of resources from other tasks. This assessment was not supported by the U.S. Navy.

In response to the perceived threat, the <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">U.S. Atlantic Fleet</a> prepared a plan to defend the east coast from attacks by aerial raiders and missiles. This plan was originally code-named 'Operation Bumblebee', and later renamed 'Operation Teardrop'. Completed on 6 January 1945, the plan involved U.S. Navy anti-submarine forces as well as <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) and Army units, which were responsible for shooting down attacking aircraft and missiles. The centerpiece of the plan was the formation of two large naval task forces to operate in the mid-Atlantic as a barrier against submarines approaching the east coast. These task forces were formed from several existing escort carrier groups, and used <a href="Naval%20Station%20Argentia">Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland</a>, as their forward operating base. As well as guarding against missile attacks, these large forces were tasked with countering the new and high-performance <a href="Type%20XXI%20submarine">Type XXI submarine</a>s if they began operating in the central Atlantic. The Atlantic Fleet's commander, Vice Admiral <a href="Jonas%20H.%20Ingram">Jonas H. Ingram</a>, gave a press conference on 8 January in which he warned there was a threat of missile attack and announced that a large force had been assembled to counter seaborne missile launchers.

In January 1945, German Minister of Armaments and War Production <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a> made a <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> broadcast in which he claimed that V-1 and V-2s "would fall on New York by February 1, 1945", increasing the U.S. Government's concern over the threat of attack. However, the Germans had no ability to fire missiles from their submarines, as both attempts to develop submarine-launched rockets ended in failure. In June 1942, was used to trial small and short-ranged artillery rockets which could be fired while submerged. Development of this system ended in early 1943, as it was found to decrease the U-boats' seaworthiness. The German military also began the development of a U-boat-towed launch canister for the <a href="V-2">V-2</a> ballistic missile in November 1944. Once complete, these canisters were to be towed to a position off the U.S. east coast and be used to attack New York. Vulkan Docks in <a href="Szczecin">Stettin</a> was contracted to build a prototype in March or April 1945, but little work took place before Germany's final collapse. It is unlikely that the system would have been successful if it had been completed.

Nine Type IX U-boats were dispatched from Norway to patrol off Canada and the U.S. in March 1945 and attack shipping. The purpose of this deployment was to divert Allied anti-submarine forces away from the coastal waters of the United Kingdom. These waters were the main operational area for German submarines in early 1945, but heavy casualties had forced the German navy to break off operations in late March. On 12 April, , , , , , and were designated ""<a href="Wolf%20pack%20Seewolf">Gruppe Seewolf</a>"" and ordered to attack shipping from New York southwards. The remaining two boats, and , were directed to Canadian waters.

The Allies were aware of this force's departure and destination through information gathered from <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma</a> decrypts. Vice Admiral Ingram and the U.S. Tenth Fleet concluded that the boats in "Gruppe Seewolf" were carrying V-1s and launched Operation Teardrop in response. The ships of the First Barrier Force, which comprised <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s and and 20 destroyer escorts, sortied from <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> between 25 and 27 March, proceeded to Argentia to refuel and assembled east of <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a> on 11 April. Twelve of the destroyer escorts deployed into a line long while the two carriers, each protected by four destroyer escorts, sailed to the west of the line. The carriers' air operations were, however, greatly hindered by heavy seas. The rough weather also forced the cancellation of planned memorial services for President Roosevelt after his death on 12 April.

As it sailed west, "Gruppe Seewolf" was ordered to attack shipping by <a href="Befehlshaber%20der%20U-Boote">U-boat Command</a>. The boats found no targets, however, as the Allies had routed convoys to the south to avoid the submarines and severe weather. The German submarines began to reach their initial stations east of the <a href="Grand%20Banks%20of%20Newfoundland">Grand Banks of Newfoundland</a> on 8 April. U-Boat Command assigned "Gruppe Seewolf" 12 different scouting lines between 2 and 19 April. The radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by the Allies, providing them with accurate information on where the boats were operating.

Just before midnight on 15 April, made radar contact with "U-1235" at a position about north of <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores Island</a>. She immediately attacked the submarine with her <a href="Hedgehog%20%28weapon%29">hedgehog</a> anti-submarine mortar, but the submarine submerged and escaped. Assisted by , "Stanton" quickly gained sonar contact with the submarine and made three more hedgehog attacks. The third attack, which was conducted at 00:33 on 16 April, sank the submarine with the loss of her entire crew. Shortly afterwards "Frost" detected "U-880" by radar as she attempted to flee the area on the surface. After illuminating the submarine with <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29%23Illumination">star shell</a> and spotlights, the destroyer escort opened fire on her with <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> guns from a range of at 02:09. "U-880" quickly submerged but was tracked by "Stanton"s and "Frost"s sonar operators. The two American ships made several hedgehog attacks on the submarine, with "Stanton" sinking her with no survivors at 04:04. Both submarines suffered huge explosions after being struck by hedgehog projectiles. This further raised the fear that they were carrying rockets and motivated the First Barrier Force to intensify its efforts to destroy the remaining U-boats.

The First Barrier Force maneuvered south westward following the destruction of "U-1235" and "U-880". <a href="Leigh%20light">Leigh light</a>-equipped <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a>s from <a href="VP-26">VPB-114</a> spotted "U-805" on the surface during the nights of 18–19 April. The submarine was only from "Mission Bay" and her escorts, but was not attacked as the aircraft could not confirm whether she was hostile before she submerged. On the night of 20 April, "U-546" attempted to torpedo a U.S. destroyer escort, but missed. The following night, "U-805" was detected by , but escaped after being depth charged by "Mosley", and for two hours.

The First Barrier Force scored its final success on the night of 21–22 April. Just before midnight, detected "U-518" with sonar. joined her and made the initial hedgehog attack on the submarine. Following this, "Carter" made her own hedgehog run, which sank "U-518" with no survivors. By this time, the First Barrier Force was returning to Argentia, after the Second Barrier Force had relieved it.

Even though Operation Teardrop was undertaken in the part of the North Atlantic for which Canada had primary responsibility, Ingram did not seek assistance from the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Royal Canadian Navy</a> (RCN) at any stage of the engagement. Moreover, Ingram did not provide the Canadian military with a situation report until after the sinking of "U-518". However, aircraft of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> (RCAF) flew offensive patrols in support of the American effort, and the RCN and RCAF intensified their patrols of inshore waters around <a href="Halifax%20%28former%20city%29">Halifax</a>.

The Second Barrier Force comprised escort carriers and and 22 destroyer escorts. "Bogue" and 10 destroyer escorts had sailed from <a href="Quonset%20Point">Quonset</a> on 16 April, while "Core" and 12 destroyer escorts sailed from <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and other locations. The force was initially stationed along the <a href="45th%20meridian%20west">45th meridian</a> in a patrol line long, and sailed towards the east. This line was made up of 14 destroyer escorts sailing at intervals, with "Core" and her four escorts at its northern end and "Bogue" and her four escorts at the southern end.

On the night of 22–23 April, U-boat Command dissolved Gruppe Seewolf and directed the three surviving boats to take up stations between New York and <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax</a>. Shortly afterwards, , and , which had been operating separately, were also ordered to positions between New York and <a href="Cape%20Hatteras">Cape Hatteras</a>. Radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by Allied code breakers and increased fears that the submarines were trying to attack American cities.

The Second Barrier Force encountered its first U-boat on 23 April when a <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman TBF Avenger</a> from <a href="VC-19">VC-19</a> sighted "U-881" about north west of "Bogue" just after noon. The aircraft dropped depth charges, but did not seriously damage the submarine. This was the first attack made by an aircraft during Operation Teardrop.
The next day, <a href="German%20submarine%20U-546">"U-546"</a> sighted "Core" and maneuvered to attack the escort carrier. She attempted to pass through the barrier line but was detected by at 08:30, which immediately prepared to attack the submarine. After realizing that his boat had been detected "U-546"s commander, "Kapitänleutnant" Paul Just, fired a <a href="G7es%20torpedo">T-5 acoustic torpedo</a> at the destroyer escort from a range of . "Frederick C. Davis" <a href="foxer">foxer</a> decoy was not effective, and the torpedo struck her forward engine room at 0835. She sank five minutes later with the loss of 126 of her 192 crewmen. Eight American destroyer escorts subsequently <a href="USS%20Neunzer%20%28DE-150%29%23Battling%20German%20Submarine%20U-546">hunted "U-546" for almost 10 hours</a> before severely damaged her with a hedgehog salvo. The submarine immediately surfaced, but sank after "Flaherty" and three or four other destroyer escorts fired at it. "Kapitänleutnant" Just and 32 other crewmen survived the sinking and were taken prisoner.

Some of <a href="German%20submarine%20U-546">"U-546"</a> s survivors were harshly treated in an attempt to force them to divulge whether the submarines bound for the U.S. east coast were carrying missiles. After brief interviews on board "Bogue", the survivors were transferred to the U.S. base at Argentia. Upon arrival on 27 April, the prisoners were screened for interrogation, with eight specialists being separated from the other 25 survivors, who were then sent to <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> camps. The specialists were held in solitary confinement and subjected to "shock interrogation" techniques, exhausting physical exercise and beatings. On 30 April, "Kapitänleutnant" Just provided brief information on Gruppe Seewolf's composition and mission following a second interview in which he collapsed unconscious. The information provided by Just and the other specialists did not mention whether the submarines were equipped with missiles. The eight men were transferred to <a href="Fort%20Hunt%2C%20Virginia">Fort Hunt, Virginia</a> shortly after <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">VE Day</a>, where they continued to be harshly treated until Just agreed to write an account of "U-546"s history on 12 May. Historian <a href="Philip%20K.%20Lundeberg">Philip K. Lundeberg</a> has written that the beating and torture of "U-546"s survivors was a "singular atrocity" motivated by the interrogators' need to promptly extract information on potential missile attacks.

The Second Barrier Force slowly moved south west from 24 April, searching for the remaining U-boats. made radar contact with a submarine on the night of 24 April, but it escaped during the resulting search. After a week of searching south of the Newfoundland Banks, the barrier force was split on 2 May to provide greater depth. The "Mission Bay" group reinforced the Second Barrier Force during this period, bringing its strength to three escort carriers and thirty one destroyer escorts.

"U-881" became the fifth and final U-boat to be sunk during Operation Teardrop on 5 May. The boat was detected while attempting to pass submerged through the barrier line by shortly before daybreak. The destroyer escort immediately turned to starboard and dropped depth charges, which sank the submarine with no survivors at 0616. "U-881" was the last German submarine to be sunk by the U.S. Navy during World War II.

The Second Barrier Force established its final barrier line along the <a href="60th%20meridian%20west">60th meridian</a> on 7 May. Following the <a href="end%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">unconditional surrender of all German forces</a> that day, it accepted the surrender of , "U-805", "U-858" and at sea before returning to bases on the U.S. east coast.

After the German surrender the U.S. Navy continued its efforts to determine whether the U-boats had carried missiles. The crews of "U-805" and "U-858" were interrogated and confirmed that their boats were not fitted with missile launching equipment. "Kapitänleutnant" Fritz Steinhoff, who had commanded "U-511" during her rocket trials and was captured at sea when he surrendered , was subjected to an abusive interrogation at Portsmouth by the interviewers of "U-546"s crew. An official Navy investigation was held into this interrogation after Steinhoff committed suicide at <a href="Charles%20Street%20Jail">Charles Street Jail</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> shortly afterwards. It is not known if the Allies were aware of Steinhoff's involvement in the rocket trials.

The tactics used in Operation Teardrop were evaluated by U.S. Navy officers after the war. The escort carriers' air wings were disappointed with their experience, as their ability to detect submarines was hampered by severe weather throughout the operation. Despite this, the aircraft were successful in forcing the U-boats to remain submerged, thereby greatly slowing their speed. Other after action reports stressed the importance of teamwork between destroyer escorts when attacking submarines and argued that single barrier lines such as those used throughout most of Operation Teardrop were inferior to grouping ships in assigned patrol areas. Nevertheless, Philip K. Lundeberg has assessed the operation as "a classic demonstration not only of coordinated hunter tactics, derived in part from British experience, but also of the profound impact of communications intelligence in the interdiction of U-boat transit and operating areas." Similarly, the British <a href="official%20history">official history</a> of the role intelligence played in World War II noted that information obtained from decrypted German radio transmissions contributed to "virtually all" of the sinkings during Operation Teardrop.

A variant of the V-1 was used by the U.S. Navy to test the feasibility of launching missiles from submarines in the years after World War II. <a href="Republic%E2%80%90Ford%20JB%E2%80%902">Republic‐Ford JB‐2</a> "Loon" missiles were launched from and in a series of tests which began on February 12, 1947. These tests were successful, and led to the development of further submarine-launched cruise missiles. The U.S. Navy's success in adapting a variant of the V-1 to be launched from submarines also demonstrated that it would have been technically feasible for the German navy to have done the same.

Anglo-Saxon Chronicle

The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a collection of <a href="annals">annals</a> in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> chronicling the history of the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>. The original manuscript of the "Chronicle" was created late in the 9th century, probably in <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a>, during the reign of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> (r. 871–899). Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. In one case, the "Chronicle" was still being actively updated in 1154.

Nine manuscripts survive in whole or in part, though not all are of equal historical value and none of them is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at <a href="Peterborough%20Cathedral">Peterborough Abbey</a> after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the "Chronicle" is in the form of annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for <a href="Caesar%27s%20invasions%20of%20Britain">Caesar's invasions of Britain</a>), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle".

The "Chronicle" is not unbiased: there are occasions when comparison with other medieval sources makes it clear that the scribes who wrote it omitted events or told one-sided versions of stories; there are also places where the different versions contradict each other. Taken as a whole, however, the "Chronicle" is the single most important historical source for the period in <a href="British%20Isles%20%28terminology%29%23England">England</a> between the <a href="End%20of%20Roman%20rule%20in%20Britain">departure of the Romans</a> and the decades following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a>. Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere. In addition, the manuscripts are important sources for the <a href="history%20of%20the%20English%20language">history of the English language</a>; in particular, the later <a href="Peterborough%20Chronicle">Peterborough text</a> is one of the earliest examples of <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> in existence.

Seven of the nine surviving manuscripts and fragments now reside in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>. The remaining two are in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> at Oxford and the <a href="Parker%20Library%2C%20Corpus%20Christi%20College">Parker Library</a> of <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</a>.

All of the surviving manuscripts are copies, so it is not known for certain where or when the first version of the "Chronicle" was composed. It is generally agreed that the original version – sometimes known as the "Early English Annals" – was written in the late 9th century by a scribe in Wessex. <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> argued from internal evidence that it was first compiled for a secular, but not royal, patron; and that “its origin is in one of the south-western shires...at some point not far from the boundary between Somerset and Dorset”. After the original "Chronicle" was compiled, copies were made and distributed to various monasteries. Additional copies were made, for further distribution or to replace lost manuscripts, and some copies were updated independently of each other. Some of these later copies are those that have survived.

The earliest extant manuscript, the "Parker Chronicle", was written by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, in the margin of the next line; subsequent material was written by other scribes. This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop <a href="Asser">Asser</a>'s use of a version of the Chronicle in his work "Life of King Alfred", known to have been composed in 893. It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original "Chronicle"; as a result, there is no proof that the "Chronicle" was compiled at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>. It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of English as a <a href="written%20language">written language</a>. The "Chronicle", as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.

Of the nine surviving manuscripts, seven are written entirely in <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> (also known as Anglo-Saxon). One, known as the "Bilingual Canterbury Epitome", is in Old English with a translation of each annal into <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Another, the "<a href="Peterborough%20Chronicle">Peterborough Chronicle</a>", is in Old English except for the last entry, which is in early <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a>. The oldest (Corp. Chris. MS 173) is known as the "Winchester Chronicle" or the "Parker Chronicle" (after <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, an <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, who once owned it), and is written in the Mercian dialect until 1070, then Latin to 1075. Six of the manuscripts were printed in an 1861 edition for the <a href="Rolls%20Series">Rolls Series</a> by <a href="Benjamin%20Thorpe">Benjamin Thorpe</a> with the text laid out in columns labelled A to F. He also included the few readable remnants of a burned seventh manuscript, which he referred to as [G], partially destroyed in a fire at <a href="Ashburnham%20House">Ashburnham House</a> in 1731. Following this convention, the two additional manuscripts are often called [H] and [I]. The known surviving manuscripts are listed below.

The manuscripts are all thought to derive from a common original, but the connections between the texts are more complex than simple inheritance via copying. The diagram at right gives an overview of the relationships between the manuscripts. The following is a summary of the relationships that are known.

All the manuscripts described above share a chronological error between the years 756 and 845, but it is apparent that the composer of the "Annals of St Neots" was using a copy that did not have this error and which must have preceded them. Æthelweard's copy did have the chronological error but it had not lost a whole sentence from annal 885; all the surviving manuscripts have lost this sentence. Hence the error and the missing sentence must have been introduced in separate copying steps, implying that none of the surviving manuscripts are closer than two removes from the original version.

[A]: The "Winchester" (or "Parker") Chronicle is the oldest manuscript of the "Chronicle" that survives. It was begun at <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">Old Minster, Winchester</a>, towards the end of Alfred's reign. The manuscript begins with a genealogy of Alfred, and the first chronicle entry is for the year 60 BC. The section containing the "Chronicle" takes up folios 1–32. Unlike the other manuscripts, [A] is of early enough composition to show entries dating back to the late 9th century in the hands of different scribes as the entries were made. The first scribe's hand is dateable to the late 9th or very early 10th century; his entries cease in late 891, and the following entries were made at intervals throughout the 10th century by several scribes. The eighth scribe wrote the annals for the years 925–955, and was clearly at Winchester when he wrote them since he adds some material related to events there; he also uses "ceaster", or "city", to mean Winchester. The manuscript becomes independent of the other recensions after the entry for 975. The book, which also had a copy of the <a href="Doom%20book">Laws of Alfred</a> and <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a> bound in after the entry for 924, was transferred to Canterbury some time in the early 11th century, as evidenced by a list of books that Archbishop Parker gave to Corpus Christi. While at Canterbury, some interpolations were made; this required some erasures in the manuscript. The additional entries appear to have been taken from a version of the manuscript from which [E] descends. The last entry in the vernacular is for 1070. After this comes the Latin "Acta Lanfranci", which covers church events from 1070–1093. This is followed by a list of <a href="pope">pope</a>s and the Archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the <a href="pallium">pallium</a>. The manuscript was acquired by Matthew Parker, Archbishop of Canterbury (1559–1575) and master of <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</a>, following the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution of the monasteries</a>, and bequeathed to the college on his death. It now forms part of the Parker Library.

[B] "The Abingdon Chronicle I" was written by a single scribe in the second half of the 10th century. The "Chronicle" takes up folios 1–34. It begins with an entry for 60 BC and ends with the entry for 977. A manuscript that is now separate (British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178) was originally the introduction to this chronicle; it contains a genealogy, as does [A], but extends it to the late 10th century. [B] was at Abingdon in the mid-11th century, because it was used in the composition of [C]. Shortly after this it went to Canterbury, where interpolations and corrections were made. As with [A], it ends with a list of popes and the archbishops of Canterbury to whom they sent the pallium.

[C] includes additional material from local annals at Abingdon, where it was composed. The section containing the "Chronicle" (folios 115–64) is preceded by King Alfred's <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> translation of <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a>'s world history, followed by a <a href="menologium">menologium</a> and some <a href="Gnomic%20poetry">gnomic verses</a> of the <a href="Physical%20law">laws of the natural world</a> and of humanity. Then follows a copy of the chronicle, beginning with 60 BC; the first scribe copied up to the entry for 490, and a second scribe took over up to the entry for 1048. [B] and [C] are identical between 491 and 652, but differences thereafter make it clear that the second scribe was also using another copy of the "Chronicle". This scribe also inserted, after the annal for 915, the "Mercian Register", which covers the years 902–924, and which focuses on <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a>. The manuscript continues to 1066 and stops in the middle of the description of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a>. In the 12th century a few lines were added to complete the account.

[D] The Worcester Chronicle appears to have been written in the middle of the 11th century. After 1033 it includes some records from <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, so it is generally thought to have been composed there. Five different scribes can be identified for the entries up to 1054, after which it appears to have been worked on at intervals. The text includes material from Bede's "Ecclesiastical History" and from a set of 8th-century <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Northumbrian</a> annals. It is thought that some of the entries may have been composed by <a href="Wulfstan%20II%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop Wulfstan</a>. [D] contains more information than other manuscripts on northern and <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> affairs, and it has been speculated that it was a copy intended for the Anglicised Scottish court. From 972 to 1016, the <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a> of <a href="York">York</a> and Worcester were both held by the same person—<a href="Oswald%20of%20Worcester">Oswald</a> from 972, <a href="Ealdwulf%20%28died%201002%29">Ealdwulf</a> from 992, and Wulfstan from 1003, and this may explain why a northern recension was to be found at Worcester. By the 16th century, parts of the manuscript were lost; eighteen pages were inserted containing substitute entries from other sources, including [A], [B], [C] and [E]. These pages were written by <a href="John%20Joscelyn">John Joscelyn</a>, who was secretary to Matthew Parker.

[E] "The Peterborough Chronicle": In 1116, a fire at the monastery at Peterborough destroyed most of the buildings. The copy of the "Chronicle" kept there may have been lost at that time or later, but in either case shortly thereafter a fresh copy was made, apparently copied from a <a href="Kentish%20%28Old%20English%29">Kentish</a> version—most likely to have been from Canterbury. The manuscript was written at one time and by a single scribe, down to the annal for 1121. The scribe added material relating to Peterborough Abbey which is not in other versions. The Canterbury original which he copied was similar, but not identical, to [D]: the Mercian Register does not appear, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh%20%28poem%29">a poem</a> about the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a> in 937, which appears in most of the other surviving copies of the Chronicle, is not recorded. The same scribe then continued the annals through to 1131; these entries were made at intervals, and thus are presumably contemporary records. Finally, a second scribe, in 1154, wrote an account of the years 1132–1154; but his dating is known to be unreliable. This last entry is in Middle English, rather than Old English. [E] was once owned by <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury 1633–1654, so is also known as the "Laud Chronicle". The manuscript contains occasional glosses in Latin, and is referred to (as "the Saxon storye of Peterborowe church") in an antiquarian book from 1566. According to Joscelyn, Nowell had a transcript of the manuscript. Previous owners include <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a> and <a href="William%20L%27Isle">William L'Isle</a>; the latter probably passed the manuscript on to Laud.

[F] The Canterbury Bilingual Epitome: In about 1100, a copy of the "Chronicle" was written at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Christ Church, Canterbury</a>, probably by one of the scribes who made notes in [A]. This version is written in both Old English and Latin; each entry in Old English was followed by the Latin version. The version the scribe copied (on folios 30–70) is similar to the version used by the scribe in Peterborough who wrote [E], though it seems to have been abridged. It includes the same introductory material as [D] and, along with [E], is one of the two chronicles that does not include the "Battle of Brunanburh" poem. The manuscript has many annotations and interlineations, some made by the original scribe and some by later scribes, including <a href="Robert%20Talbot%20%28scribe%29">Robert Talbot</a>.

[A]/[G] Copy of "the Winchester Chronicle": [A] was copied from [A] at Winchester in the eleventh century and follows a 10th-century copy of an Old English translation of Bede's "Ecclesiastical History". The last annal copied was 1001, so the copy was made no earlier than that; an episcopal list appended to [A] suggests that the copy was made by 1013. This manuscript was almost completely destroyed in the 1731 fire at <a href="Ashburnham%20House">Ashburnham House</a>, where the <a href="Cotton%20Library">Cotton Library</a> was housed. Of the original 34 leaves, seven remain, ff. 39–47 in the manuscript. However, a transcript had been made by <a href="Laurence%20Nowell">Laurence Nowell</a>, a 16th-century antiquary, which was used by <a href="Abraham%20Wheelocke">Abraham Wheelocke</a> in an edition of the "Chronicle" printed in 1643. Because of this, it is also sometimes known as [W], after Wheelocke. Nowell's transcript copied the genealogical introduction detached from [B] (the page now British Library MS. Cotton Tiberius Aiii, f. 178), rather than that originally part of this document. The original [A] introduction would later be removed prior to the fire and survives as British Library Add MS 34652, f. 2. The appellations [A], [A] and [G] derive from Plummer, Smith and Thorpe, respectively.

The "Cottonian Fragment" [H] consists of a single leaf, containing annals for 1113 and 1114. In the entry for 1113 it includes the phrase "he came to Winchester"; hence it is thought likely that the manuscript was written at Winchester. There is not enough of this manuscript for reliable relationships to other manuscripts to be established. Ker notes that the entries may have been written contemporarily.

[I] "Easter Table Chronicle": A list of "Chronicle" entries accompanies a table of years, found on folios 133-37 in a badly burned manuscript containing miscellaneous notes on charms, the calculation of dates for church services, and annals pertaining to Christ Church, Canterbury. Most of the Chronicle's entries pertain to Christ Church, Canterbury. Until 1109 (the death of <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>) they are in English; all but one of the following entries are in Latin. Part of [I] was written by a scribe soon after 1073, in the same hand and ink as the rest of the Caligula MS. After 1085, the annals are in various contemporary hands. The original annalist's entry for the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a> is limited to "Her forðferde eadward kyng"; a later hand added the coming of <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, "7 her com willelm." At one point this manuscript was at <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, Canterbury.

Two manuscripts are recorded in an old catalogue of the library of Durham; they are described as "cronica duo Anglica". In addition, Parker included a manuscript called "Hist. Angliae Saxonica" in his gifts but the manuscript that included this, now Cambridge University Library MS. Hh.1.10, has lost 52 of its leaves, including all of this copy of the chronicle.

The "Chronicle" incorporates material from multiple sources. The entry for 755, describing how <a href="Cynewulf%20of%20Wessex">Cynewulf</a> took the kingship of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> from <a href="Sigeberht%20of%20Wessex">Sigebehrt</a>, is far longer than the surrounding entries, and includes direct speech quotations from the participants in those events. It seems likely that this was taken by the scribe from existing saga material. Early entries, up to the year 110, probably came from one of the small encyclopedic volumes of world history in circulation at the time the Chronicle was first written. The chronological summary to <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "Ecclesiastical History" was used as a source. The Chronicle gives dates and genealogies for <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n and <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>n kings, and provides a list of Wessex bishops; these are likely to have had separate sources. The entry for 661 records a battle fought by Cenwalh that is said to have been fought "at Easter"; this precision implies a contemporary record, which survived and was re-used by the Chronicle scribe.

Contemporary annals began to be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The material compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, <a href="South%20Saxon">South Saxon</a>, Mercian and, particularly, <a href="Wessex">West Saxon</a> history, but, with the exception of the Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The "Chronicle" grew out of the tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.

As with any historical source, the "Chronicle" has to be treated with some caution. For example, between 514 and 544 the "Chronicle" makes reference to Wihtgar, who is supposedly buried on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> at "Wihtgar's stronghold" (which is "Wihtgaræsbyrg" in the original) and purportedly gave his name to the island. However, the name of the "Isle of Wight" derives from the Latin "Vectis", not from Wihtgar. The actual name of the fortress was probably "Wihtwarabyrg", "the stronghold of the inhabitants of Wight", and either the chronicler or an earlier source misinterpreted this as referring to Wihtgar.

The dating of the events recorded also requires care. In addition to dates that are simply inaccurate, scribes occasionally made mistakes that caused further errors. For example, in the [D] manuscript, the scribe omits the year 1044 from the list on the left hand side. The annals copied down are therefore incorrect from 1045 to 1052, which has two entries. A more difficult problem is the question of the date at which a new year began, since the modern custom of starting the year on 1 January was not universal at that time. The entry for 1091 in [E] begins at <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> and continues throughout the year; it is clear that this entry follows the old custom of starting the year at Christmas. Some other entries appear to begin the year on 25 March, such as the year 1044 in the [C] manuscript, which ends with <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>'s marriage on 23 January, while the entry for 22 April is recorded under 1045. There are also years which appear to start in September.

The manuscripts were produced in different places, and each manuscript reflects the biases of its scribes. It has been argued that the "Chronicle" should be regarded as <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>, produced by Alfred's court and written with the intent of glorifying Alfred and creating loyalty. This is not universally accepted, but the origins of the manuscripts clearly colour both the description of interactions between <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and other kingdoms, and the descriptions of the Vikings' depredations. An example can be seen in the entry for 829, which describes <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a>'s invasion of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. According to the Chronicle, after Egbert conquered Mercia and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Essex">Essex</a>, he became a "<a href="bretwalda">bretwalda</a>", implying overlordship of all of England. Then when he marched into Northumbria, the Northumbrians offered him "submission and peace". The Northumbrian chronicles incorporated into <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>'s 13th-century history give a different picture: "When Egbert had obtained all the southern kingdoms, he led a large army into Northumbria, and laid waste that province with severe pillaging, and made King Eanred pay tribute."

Occasionally the scribes' biases can be seen by comparing different versions of the manuscript they created. For example, <a href="%C3%86lfgar%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Ælfgar</a>, earl of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, and son of <a href="Leofric%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Leofric</a>, the earl of Mercia, was exiled briefly in 1055. The [C], [D] and [E] manuscripts say the following:


Another example that mentions Ælfgar shows a different kind of unreliability in the "Chronicle": that of omission. Ælfgar was Earl of Mercia by 1058, and in that year was exiled again. This time only [D] has anything to say: "Here Earl Ælfgar was expelled, but he soon came back again, with violence, through the help of Gruffydd. And here came a raiding ship-army from <a href="Norway">Norway</a>; it is tedious to tell how it all happened." In this case other sources exist to clarify the picture: a major Norwegian attempt was made on England, but [E] says nothing at all, and [D] scarcely mentions it. It has sometimes been argued that when the "Chronicle" is silent, other sources that report major events must be mistaken, but this example demonstrates that the" Chronicle" does omit important events.

The three main <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> historians, <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a>, <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> and <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, each had a copy of the "Chronicle", which they adapted for their own purposes. <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a> also had a copy of the "Chronicle". Some later medieval historians also used the "Chronicle", and others took their material from those who had used it, and so the "Chronicle" became "central to the mainstream of English historical tradition".

Henry of Huntingdon used a copy of the "Chronicle" that was very similar to [E]. There is no evidence in his work of any of the entries in [E] after 1121, so although his manuscript may actually have been [E], it may also have been a copy—either one taken of [E] prior to the entries he makes no use of, or a manuscript from which [E] was copied, with the copying taking place prior to the date of the last annal he uses. Henry also made use of the [C] manuscript.

The <a href="Waverley%20Annals">Waverley Annals</a> made use of a manuscript that was similar to [E], though it appears that it did not contain the entries focused on Peterborough. The manuscript of the chronicle translated by <a href="Geoffrey%20Gaimar">Geoffrey Gaimar</a> cannot be identified accurately, though according to historian <a href="Dorothy%20Whitelock">Dorothy Whitelock</a> it was "a rather better text than 'E' or 'F'". Gaimar implies that there was a copy at Winchester in his day (the middle of the 12th century); Whitelock suggests that there is evidence that a manuscript that has not survived to the present day was at Winchester in the mid-tenth century. If it survived to Gaimar's time that would explain why [A] was not kept up to date, and why [A] could be given to the monastery at Canterbury.

John of Worcester's "<a href="John%20of%20Worcester%23Chronicon%20ex%20chronicis">Chronicon ex chronicis</a>" appears to have had a manuscript that was either [A] or similar to it; he makes use of annals that do not appear in other versions, such as entries concerning <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a>'s campaigns and information about Winchester towards the end of the chronicle. His account is often similar to that of [D], though there is less attention paid to <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Margaret of Scotland</a>, an identifying characteristic of [D]. He had the Mercian register, which appears only in [C] and [D]; and he includes material from annals 979–982 which only appears in [C]. It is possible he had a manuscript that was an ancestor of [D]. He also had sources which have not been identified, and some of his statements have no earlier surviving source.

A manuscript similar to [E] was available to <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, though it is unlikely to have been [E] as that manuscript is known to have still been in Peterborough after the time William was working, and he does not make use of any of the entries in [E] that are specifically related to Peterborough. It is likely he had either the original from which [E] was copied, or a copy of that original. He mentions that the chronicles do not give any information on the murder of <a href="Alfred%20Aetheling">Alfred Aetheling</a>, but since this is covered in both [C] and [D] it is apparent he had no access to those manuscripts. On occasion he appears to show some knowledge of [D], but it is possible that his information was taken from John of Worcester's account. He also omits any reference to a battle fought by <a href="Cenwealh">Cenwealh</a> in 652; this battle is mentioned in [A], [B] and [C], but not in [E]. He does mention a battle fought by Cenwealh at <a href="Wirtgernesburg">Wirtgernesburg</a>, which is not in any of the extant manuscripts, so it is possible he had a copy now lost.

The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" is the single most important source for the history of England in Anglo-Saxon times. Without the "Chronicle" and <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>" (the "Ecclesiastical History of the English People"), it would be impossible to write the history of the English from the Romans to the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest</a>; <a href="Nicholas%20Howe">Nicholas Howe</a> called them "the two great Anglo-Saxon works of history". It is clear that records and annals of some kind began to be kept in England at the time of the earliest spread of Christianity, but no such records survive in their original form. Instead they were incorporated in later works, and it is thought likely that the "Chronicle" contains many of these. The history it tells is not only that witnessed by its compilers, but also that recorded by earlier annalists, whose work is in many cases preserved nowhere else.

Its importance is not limited to the historical information it provides, however. It is just as important a source for the early development of English. The "Peterborough Chronicle" changes from the standard <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> literary language to early <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> after 1131, providing some of the earliest Middle English text known. Howe notes, in "Rome: Capitol of Anglo-Saxon England", that many of the entries indicate that Rome was considered a spiritual home for the Anglo-Saxons, Rome and Roman history being of paramount importance in many of the entries; he cites the one for AD 1, for instance, which lists the reign of <a href="Augustus">Octavian Augustus</a> before it mentions the birth of Christ.

The "Chronicle" is not without literary interest. Inserted at various points since the 10th century are Old English poems in celebration of royal figures and their achievements: "<a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh%20%28poem%29">The Battle of Brunanburh</a>" (937), on King <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a>'s victory over the combined forces of Vikings, Scots and the Strathclyde Britons, and five shorter poems, "<a href="Capture%20of%20the%20Five%20Boroughs">Capture of the Five Boroughs</a>" (942), "The Coronation of King Edgar" (973), "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20King%20Edgar">The Death of King Edgar</a>" (975), "The Death of Prince Alfred" (1036), and "The Death of King Edward the Confessor" (1065).

An important early printed edition of the "Chronicle" appeared in 1692, by <a href="Edmund%20Gibson">Edmund Gibson</a>, an English jurist and divine who later (1716) became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. Titled "Chronicon Saxonicum", it printed the Old English text in parallel columns with Gibson's own Latin version and became the standard edition until the 19th century. Gibson used three manuscripts of which the chief was the Peterborough Chronicle. It was superseded in 1861 by <a href="Benjamin%20Thorpe">Benjamin Thorpe</a>'s <a href="Rolls%20Series">Rolls</a> edition, which printed six versions in columns, labelled A to F, thus giving the manuscripts the letters which are now used to refer to them.

<a href="John%20Earle%20%28professor%29">John Earle</a> wrote "Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel" (1865). <a href="Charles%20Plummer">Charles Plummer</a> edited this book, producing a "Revised Text" with notes, appendices, and glossary in two volumes in 1892 and 1899. This edition of the A and E texts, with material from other versions, was widely used; it was reprinted in 1952.

Beginning in the 1980s, a new set of scholarly editions have been printed under the series title "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition". Some volumes are still projected, such as a volume focusing on the northern recension, but existing volumes such as Janet Bately's edition of [A] are now standard references. A recent translation of the Chronicle is <a href="Michael%20Swanton">Michael Swanton</a>'s "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", which presents translations of [A] and [E] on opposite pages, with interspersed material from the other manuscripts where they differ.

A facsimile edition of [A], "The Parker Chronicle and Laws", appeared in 1941 from the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>, edited by Robin Flower and Hugh Smith. A recent scholarly edition of the [B] text is "The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition, 4, MS B" by S. Taylor (Cambridge, 1983). The [C] manuscript was edited by H.A. Rositzke; "The C-Text of the Old English Chronicles", in "Beitrage z. engl. Phil.", XXXIV, Bochum-Langendreer, 1940; and the [D] manuscript in "An Anglo-Saxon Chronicle from British Museum Cotton MS., Tiberius B. iv", edited by E. Classen and F.E. Harmer, Manchester, 1926. Rositzke also published a translation of the [E] text in "The Peterborough Chronicle" (New York, 1951). The [F] text was printed in F.P. Magoun, Jr., "Annales Domitiani Latini: an Edition" in "Mediaeval Studies of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies", IX, 1947, pp. 235–295. The first edition of [G] was Abraham Whelock's 1644 "Venerabilis Bedae Historia Ecclesiastica", printed in Cambridge; there is also an edition by Angelica Lutz, "Die Version G der angelsächsischen Chronik: Rekonstruktion und Edition" (Munich, 1981).

Khan Noonien Singh

Khan Noonien Singh, commonly shortened to Khan, is a fictional character in the "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> franchise. The character first appeared in the "" episode "<a href="Space%20Seed">Space Seed</a>" (1967), and was portrayed by <a href="Ricardo%20Montalb%C3%A1n">Ricardo Montalbán</a>, who reprised his role in the 1982 film "". In the 2013 film "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Into%20Darkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>", he is played by <a href="Benedict%20Cumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a>.

The character once controlled more than a quarter of the Earth during the <a href="Eugenics%20Wars">Eugenics Wars</a> of the 1990s. After being revived from <a href="suspended%20animation">suspended animation</a> in 2267 by the crew of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">Starship "Enterprise"</a>, Khan attempts to capture the starship, but is thwarted by <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T.

In "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan", set fifteen years after "Space Seed", Khan escapes his exile and sets out to exact revenge upon Kirk.

In "Star Trek Into Darkness", set in the alternate continuity established in "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" (2009), Khan is awakened almost a decade before the events of "<a href="Space%20Seed">Space Seed</a>". Khan is given the false identity "John Harrison" and coerced by Admiral Marcus into building weapons for <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> in exchange for the lives of Khan's crew. He ultimately rebels and comes into conflict with the crew of "Enterprise".

Khan makes his introductory appearance in the episode "<a href="Space%20Seed">Space Seed</a>", first broadcast on February 16, 1967. According to the backstory revealed in the episode, Khan is one of a group of <a href="Genetic%20engineering">genetically engineered</a> superhumans, bred to be free of the usual <a href="human">human</a> mental and physical limitations, who were removed from power after the Eugenics Wars of the 1990s. Khan had been both the most successful conqueror and the most benign ruler of the group, ruling more than a quarter of the Earth's area across <a href="Asia">Asia</a> to the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> from 1992 to 1996 with a firm but generally peaceful hand until he was deposed. While most of the supermen were killed or sentenced to death, Khan and 84 others escaped Earth by way of the <a href="sleeper%20ship">sleeper ship</a> SS "Botany Bay". "Botany Bay" is discovered by the crew of the Starship <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">"Enterprise"</a> in 2267, with Khan and 72 of the 84 crew members of "Botany Bay" still alive, <a href="Cryonics">cryogenically frozen</a> in suspended animation.

When Khan's sleep chamber malfunctions, he is transported to "Enterprise," where he reawakens and learns he is in the 23rd century. Given spacious quarters while "Botany Bay" is towed to a starbase, Khan fascinates and charms the ship's historian, <a href="Marla%20McGivers">Marla McGivers</a> (<a href="Madlyn%20Rhue">Madlyn Rhue</a>), while using his access to the ship's technical manuals to learn how to take over and operate "Enterprise". McGivers agrees to help Khan revive the other supermen, allowing him to organize an attempted takeover. To coerce the "Enterprise" crew to cooperate with him, Khan places Captain <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> (<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a>) in the ship's decompression chamber and threatens to kill Kirk unless the crew submits. McGivers cannot stand by as her Captain dies and frees Kirk, who neutralizes Khan's men by using a neural gas. Khan heads to engineering and sets the ship's engines to self-destruct, whereupon he is incapacitated by Kirk. Captain Kirk conducts a hearing, sentencing Khan and his followers to exile on an uncolonized world, Ceti Alpha V. Khan accepts Kirk's challenge—invoking the fall of <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a> in <a href="John%20Milton">Milton's</a> "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>"—and McGivers joins Khan rather than face court-martial. <a href="Spock">Spock</a> (<a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>) wonders what the "seed" Kirk has planted will bear in a hundred years.

Khan returns in the 1982 feature film "". Captain <a href="Clark%20Terrell">Clark Terrell</a> (<a href="Paul%20Winfield">Paul Winfield</a>) and First Officer <a href="Pavel%20Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a> (<a href="Walter%20Koenig">Walter Koenig</a>) of <a href="USS%20Reliant">USS "Reliant"</a> are searching for an uninhabited world to test the Genesis device, a powerful <a href="terraforming">terraforming</a> tool. They beam down to what they believe is Ceti Alpha VI. Khan's followers capture Terrell and Chekov, and Khan explains that the barren world is Ceti Alpha V; the sixth planet of the system exploded shortly after Khan and his followers were marooned. The cataclysm caused massive climate disturbances, rendering the planet into a desert, and many of the survivors—including Khan's wife—were killed by the only surviving species of animal, the <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20animals%23Ceti%20eel">Ceti eel</a>. Only twenty of Khan's followers survive. Swearing vengeance on Kirk, Khan implants Ceti eels in Terrell and Chekov's brains, rendering them vulnerable to suggestion. Khan then seizes control of "Reliant", intent on capturing the Genesis device.

Khan lures "Enterprise" to the space station "Regula I", and he launches a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan by using a special code to remotely lower "Reliant"s shields, allowing "Enterprise" to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on "Regula I". Spock deceives Khan into thinking that "Enterprise" is crippled, surprising Khan when "Enterprise" rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara <a href="Nebula">Nebula</a>. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots "Reliant" into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, "Enterprise" defeats "Reliant" and Khan is fatally wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>" as he watches "Enterprise" try to escape, which it eventually does.

Khan appears in the 2013 film "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Into%20Darkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>", taking place in the alternate continuity established in "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" (2009). While the character’s backstory remains the same, Khan is revived by Starfleet Admiral Alexander Marcus rather than the crew of "Enterprise". Marcus anticipates a war with the <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>s, and forces Khan to develop warships and weapons for Starfleet under the cover identity of "Commander John Harrison", holding Khan's shipmates hostage. These developments include advanced long-range torpedoes and the warship USS "Vengeance".

Believing Marcus killed his crew, Khan engineers attacks on a Starfleet archive and Starfleet leadership, before fleeing to the Klingon homeworld <a href="Klingon%23Homeworld">Qo'noS</a>. Marcus arms "Enterprise" with 72 advanced torpedoes and sends Kirk and "Enterprise" to Qo'noS to kill Harrison. Against orders, Kirk attempts to capture him alive. Upon learning the number of torpedoes on board "Enterprise", Khan surrenders, revealing his identity, the presence of his followers in the torpedoes, and the reasons for his attacks.

When Marcus arrives aboard "Vengeance" and attacks "Enterprise", Kirk and Khan work together to take control of "Vengeance"s bridge. Once in control of "Vengeance", Khan kills Admiral Marcus and demands that Spock return his crew. Spock, having removed Khan's people from the torpedoes, lowers the "Enterprise"'s shields and allows Khan to beam the activated weapons' warheads aboard "Vengeance." Before Khan can attack the "Enterprise" Spock remotely detonates the torpedoes crippling the "Vengeance." Khan crashes "Vengeance" in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in an attempt to destroy <a href="Starfleet%20Headquarters">Starfleet Headquarters</a> and escape, but is pursued and captured by Spock and Uhura. Khan is placed back into cryogenic sleep along with his crew.

Khan has been depicted in various novels and comic book publications. As with all non-television and non-film "Star Trek" material, the publications are outside of <a href="Star%20Trek%20canon">"Star Trek" canon</a>.

Author <a href="Greg%20Cox%20%28writer%29">Greg Cox</a> penned three "Star Trek" novels featuring Khan, published by licensee <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a>. In the two-volume "", Khan is depicted as a North <a href="Indian%20people">Indian</a> from a family of <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a>s. "Khan" is a title; his adoptive parents are from <a href="Chandigarh">Chandigarh</a>, <a href="Punjab%2C%20India">Punjab</a>, India and are both eugenic scientists. At the end of the second novel, Khan and his followers are placed aboard the "Botany Bay" by <a href="Gary%20Seven">Gary Seven</a> as part of a deal to stop Khan's machinations on Earth. The 2005 follow-up, "", relates what happened to Khan and his fellow exiles between the events of "Space Seed" and "The Wrath of Khan". A different version of Khan's exile on Ceti Alpha V is depicted in <a href="IDW%20Publishing">IDW Publishing</a>'s 2010 comic miniseries "Khan: Ruling in Hell".

From 2013 to 2014, IDW published a five-part series of comic books telling the story of the "Into Darkness" incarnation of Khan. The first issue in the series acknowledges the discrepancy of Khan's physical appearance compared to that of the previous incarnation. In keeping with the prime timeline's backstory, Khan's beginnings, rise to power, and involvement in the Eugenics War are depicted. It is also revealed his birth name was Noonien Singh and that he adopted the title "Khan" out of admiration for <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>. The series goes on to mention that Khan's anatomy and memories were altered per Marcus's orders, so that Khan would initially believe himself to be the fabricated Harrison.

Writer Carey Wilber pitched "Space Seed" to "Star Trek" producers Roddenberry, Gene Coon, and Robert Justman with an 18-page outline dated August 29, 1966. In the outline, Wilber envisioned the crew of "Botany Bay" as criminals sent on a 1,500-year journey to make room on Earth for others. Khan was represented as a Nordic criminal with a "magnificent" body, Harald Ericsson. The producers suggested changes to the outline in a series of memos; in memos dated September 7 and 9, Coon suggested significant changes to Ericsson. "I want to rather do more with him than you have indicated in the story outline,” he wrote. Believing that Ericsson (misspelled as Erickson in the memo) could be a worthy adversary for Kirk, Coon suggested that the character be “in fact very similar to James Kirk, our captain, except that our captain has made an adjustment to this world and this culture [...] In other words, Carey, build us a giant of a man."

The first draft of the script introduced the character as John Ericssen—who is revealed to be a man involved in "The First World Tyranny", named Ragnar Thorwald. The character of Thorwald was more brutal than Khan in the final version, killing guards using a phaser. In the original script, Kirk forgives Ericssen and offers him and his people a chance at a fresh start—something that remained in the final episode—but the character committing murder would have precluded such an ending, as NBC censors would have necessitated the "bad guy" be punished for his actions.

By the final draft, Khan is Indian; a character guesses that Khan is from <a href="North%20India">Northern India</a>, and "probably a <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a>." Khan's full name was based on that of Kim Noonien Singh, a pilot <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> served with during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. Roddenberry lost touch with his friend and had hoped that Khan's similar name might attract his attention and renew his old acquaintance.

In "Space Seed", Khan is presented as having several positive characteristics: he is gracious, smiling, fearless and generous. He is not threatened by the success of others, and encourages their self-esteem. He is also ambitious, desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities, but this ambition is not tempered by any consideration of the rights of others. Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree. During the episode, several of the characters express their admiration for the man even as they oppose him, with Kirk referring to him as "the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous." The character's <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Spanish</a> accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most "Star Trek" characters.

After the disappointing response to the first "Star Trek" feature film, "", Paramount executives appointed Harve Bennett, a television producer who had never watched "Star Trek", to be executive producer for the sequel. Bennett watched all the original series episodes and chose Khan from "Space Seed" as a possible villain for the film. Early drafts of the script had Khan as a shadowy tyrant leading a planet in revolt; later drafts added the "Genesis device" which Khan would steal.

Costume designer Robert Fletcher wanted to emphasize the effects of their harsh environment on Khan and his followers. "My intention with Khan was to express the fact that they had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship," he said. Director <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a> told Montalbán to keep Khan's right glove on at all times, in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to the character. Meyer has been repeatedly asked if Montalbán wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes, as his uniform was purposefully designed with an open front. Meyer replied in audio commentary for the film that Montalbán (who was 61 during filming) is "one strong cookie," and that no prosthetics were applied to the actor's sizeable frame.

At no point during "The Wrath of Khan" are Khan and Kirk in the same location; they speak to each other only over communication links such as view screens. This was due in part to the fact that the set of the "Reliant" was a <a href="redress">redress</a> of the "Enterprise" bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.

Montalbán said in promotional interviews for the film he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always tried to find a flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan had a rather distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>" throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.

Following the box office success of <a href="J.%20J.%20Abrams">J. J. Abrams</a>' <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">"Star Trek" reboot</a> and the announcement that actors <a href="Chris%20Pine">Chris Pine</a> and <a href="Zachary%20Quinto">Zachary Quinto</a> had tentatively agreed to appear in two sequels, Internet rumors began circulating about the plot of the second film. Abrams hinted that because of the <a href="Alternate%20history">alternate timeline</a> created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into "Star Trek" lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, "[Khan and Kirk] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is," Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues." Writer <a href="Damon%20Lindelof">Damon Lindelof</a> declared that Khan's "intense gravity," particularly regarding the character's delivery of <a href="monologue">monologue</a>s, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'"

As part of the secrecy campaign, <a href="Benedict%20Cumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, describing Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has come back to haunt him." He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," adding parallels to the current world order "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." "Into Darkness" writers <a href="Roberto%20Orci">Roberto Orci</a> and <a href="Alex%20Kurtzman">Alex Kurtzman</a> added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you think people are going to love it. You must come up with what the movie can be on its own and then, if it turns out the villain maybe can be Khan, then you can do it. But you can’t start there."—but for fitting the sequel's theme of "how far will we go to exact vengeance and justice on an enemy that scares us."

Some protested Cumberbatch's casting as Khan, believing that a person of Indian descent should have been given the role instead.

Superficially, Khan has been compared to <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>'s concept of the "<a href="%C3%9Cbermensch">Übermensch</a>" (superman or overman). Khan is mentally and physically superior to any normal human. In the "" episode "", Malik, the leader of a group of "supermen" created from the same genetic engineering project as Khan, quotes Nietzsche, telling <a href="Jonathan%20Archer">Archer</a> that "Mankind is something to be surpassed". Professor William J. Devlin and coauthor Shai Biderman examined Khan's character compared to the Übermensch and found that Khan's blind pursuit of revenge is against Nietzsche's ideals of transcendence and self-creation of a meaningful life. Instead, the authors offer Spock's self-sacrifice in "The Wrath of Khan" as a better example of the Übermensch.

Montalbán's performance as Khan was favorably received by critics. Discussing the "Star Trek" motion pictures, the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> noted that "Star Trek" films were measured by how menacing their foe was, and that Khan was among the best in the series; a 2002 review of the "Star Trek" films ranked Khan as the greatest enemy seen in any of the films. Reviewers of "The Wrath of Khan", such as <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, rated Khan as one of the strongest aspects of the film. New Yorker critic <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> said Montalbán's performance "was the only validation he has ever had of his power to command the big screen."

Critic <a href="Christopher%20Null">Christopher Null</a> notes that "it is nearly gospel now among Trekkies that... "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" is the undisputed best of the series, and will likely never meet its equal," and calls Khan the "greatest role of <nowiki>[Montalbán's]</nowiki> career". Though he felt that the villain of "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", <a href="V%27ger">V'ger</a>, was more cerebral and interesting, author James Iaccino notes that most fans and moviegoers preferred the archetypical good-versus-evil fight that the struggle between Khan and Kirk represents. Villains in subsequent "Star Trek" films have been measured by the standard of Khan, with Paramount promising fans that the villain of "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Generations">Star Trek Generations</a>" would be equal to the genetic superman. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked Khan as the best "Star Trek" villain, noting that he set the pattern for revenge-seeking villains in the series; in the decades since the film's release, "even those with a passing interest [in "Trek"] know the name."
"Star Trek" producer <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a> called the villain "threatening and memorable."

Khan is also recognized as a great villain outside of the "Star Trek" series. The Associated Press called the character "one of sci-fi's great villains". In 2002, the Online Film Critics Society's 132 members voted Khan as the 10th Greatest Screen Villain of all time, the only "Star Trek" character to appear in the listing. In 2006, "Emmy Magazine" voted Khan "TV's Most Out-of-This-World Character", beating out other science-fiction characters such as <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Doctor</a> and <a href="Commander%20Adama">Commander Adama</a>. Editors wrote that "Khan was so cool we would've bought a <a href="Chrysler%20Cordoba">Chrysler Cordoba</a> if he'd told us to," referring to an ad campaign Montalbán appeared in for Chrysler. The character also had a cultural impact outside of "Star Trek" fandom; a clip from "The Wrath of Khan" featuring Kirk screaming "Khaaan!" was one popular culture appropriation that became a "popular fad" driving the success of the website <a href="YTMND">YTMND</a>.

In 2004, the "Star Trek" franchise returned to Khan's backstory in a three-episode <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> on "". In "", "<a href="Cold%20Station%2012">Cold Station 12</a>" and "<a href="The%20Augments">The Augments</a>", a 22nd-century scientist is portrayed as having revived genetically engineered embryos from Khan's time and raised them as "Augments". "Enterprise" producer <a href="Manny%20Coto">Manny Coto</a> described these characters as "mini Khan Noonien Singhs".

Benedict Cumberbatch's performance in "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Into%20Darkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>" drew praise from critics with Peter Travers of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine calling it a "tour-de-force to be reckoned with" and his character "a villain for the ages". Joe Neumaier of New York's "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">Daily News</a>" wrote that Cumberbatch delivered "one of the best blockbuster villains in recent memory". Jonathan Romney of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" specifically noted Cumberbatch's voice saying it was "So sepulchrally resonant that it could have been synthesised from the combined timbres of <a href="Ian%20McKellen">Ian McKellen</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Stewart">Patrick Stewart</a> and <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a> holding an elocution contest down a well." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised his screen presence saying "He fuses Byronic charisma with an impatient, imperious intelligence that seems to raise the ambient I.Q. whenever he’s on screen."

Christian Blauvelt from website Hollywood.com criticized the casting of Khan in "Star Trek Into Darkness" as being "whitewashed into oblivion". "" actor <a href="Garrett%20Wang">Garrett Wang</a> tweeting, "The casting of Cumberbatch was a mistake on the part of the producers. I am not being critical of the actor or his talent, just the casting." Co-producer and co-screenwriter <a href="Roberto%20Orci">Roberto Orci</a> addressed the issue of the casting saying, "Basically, as we went through the casting process and we began honing in on the themes of the movie, it became uncomfortable for me to support demonizing anyone of color, particularly any one of Middle Eastern descent or anyone evoking that. One of the points of the movie is that we must be careful about the villain within "us", not some other race."

In 2016, ScreenRant rated Khan as the 6th best character in "Star Trek" overall.

Brazilian cruiser Bahia

Bahia was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of a <a href="Bahia-class%20cruiser">two-vessel class</a> of <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s built for <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> by the British company <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a>. In November 1910, just six months after her <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioning</a>, crewmen aboard "Bahia", , , and mutinied, beginning the (<a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Lash">Revolt of the Lash</a>). During the four-day rebellion, Brazil's capital city of <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> was held hostage by the possibility of a naval bombardment, leading the government to give in to the rebel demands, which included the abolition of <a href="Flagellation">flogging</a> in the navy. During the First World War, "Bahia" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> were assigned to the (Naval Division in War Operations), the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a>'s main contribution in that conflict. Based out of <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> and <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, the squadron escorted convoys through an area believed to be heavily patrolled by <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s.

In the mid-1920s, "Bahia" was extensively modernized. She received three new <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Brown–Curtis</a> turbine engines and six new <a href="Water-tube%20boiler%23Thornycroft">Thornycroft boilers</a>, and, in the process, was converted from coal-burning to oil. The refit resulted in a striking aesthetic change, with the exhaust being trunked into three funnels instead of two. The armament was also modified; three <a href="Madsen%20gun">Madsen gun</a>s, a <a href="Hotchkiss%20et%20Cie">Hotchkiss</a> machine gun, and four <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s were added. In the 1930s, she served with government forces during multiple revolutions.

In the Second World War, "Bahia" was once again used as a convoy escort, sailing over in the span of about a year. On 4 July 1945 she was acting as a <a href="plane%20guard">plane guard</a> for <a href="Military%20transport%20aircraft">transport aircraft</a> flying from the Atlantic to Pacific theaters of war. While "Bahia"s gunners were firing at a kite for anti-aircraft practice, one aimed too low and hit <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s stored near the <a href="stern">stern</a> of the ship, resulting in a massive explosion that incapacitated the ship and sank her within minutes. Only a small portion of the crew survived the blast, and even fewer were still living when their rafts were discovered days later.

"Bahia" was part of a large 1904 naval building program by Brazil. Also planned as part of this were the two <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s, ten destroyers, three <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and a <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a>. With a design that borrowed heavily from the British scout cruisers, "Bahia"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid on 19 August 1907 in <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth's</a> Elswick, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> yard. Construction took about a year and a half, and she was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 20 January 1909 with Madame Altino Correia being the sponsor on behalf of Madame Dr. Araugo Pinho. The process of <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a> pushed her completion date to 2 March 1910, after which she sailed to Brazil, arriving in <a href="Recife">Recife</a> on 6 May. The new cruiser—the third ship of the Brazilian Navy to honor the <a href="States%20of%20Brazil">state</a> of <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>—was <a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> into the navy shortly thereafter on 21 May 1910. As a class, "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul" were the fastest cruisers in the world when they were commissioned, and the first in the Brazilian Navy to utilize <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s for propulsion.

Brazil's economy was suffering from a severe recession at the same time "Bahia" was commissioned. This economic hardship and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships, spawned a mutiny known as the (<a href="Revolt%20of%20the%20Whip">Revolt of the Whip</a>) among sailors on the most powerful ships.

Unhappy with the violent treatment they were receiving, black sailors on the dreadnought battleship began planning an uprising early in 1910, choosing <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20C%C3%A2ndido%20Felisberto">João Cândido Felisberto</a> — an experienced sailor later known as the "Black Admiral" — as their leader. In mid-November, a sailor was sentenced to be flogged in front of his fellow sailors, even though the practice had been banned by law. The punishment was administered and continued even after the sailor fainted, infuriating the nascent mutineers. Although they were not ready and could not revolt immediately, they quickened their preparations and rebelled on 21 November, earlier than originally planned. They killed several officers and the captain of "Minas Geraes", while other officers were forced off the ship. The revolt quickly expanded to the battleship , the elderly coastal defense ship , and "Bahia". While joining the revolt, the crew of the scout cruiser murdered one of their officers. During this time, discipline on the rebelling ships was not relaxed; daily drills were conducted and Felisberto ordered all liquor to be thrown overboard.
The crews of the <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s remained loyal to the government, and army troops moved to the <a href="Catete%20Palace">presidential palace</a> and the coastline, but neither group could stop the mutineers. The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers' cause, coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships, forced the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20Brazil">National Congress of Brazil</a> to give in to the rebels' demands. These included the abolition of flogging, improved living conditions, and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers. The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret; its submission resulted in the rebellion's end on 26 November, when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy.

In the opening years of the First World War, the Brazilian Navy was sent out to patrol the South Atlantic with French, British and American naval units, although its ships were not supposed to engage any threat outside territorial waters as Brazil was not at war with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>. The country also tried to ensure that it remained totally neutral; "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul" were sent to <a href="Santos%2C%20S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">Santos</a> in August 1914 to enforce neutrality laws when it was reported that the German raider was lying in wait off that port for British and American merchant ships. Brazil joined the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Entente</a> and declared war on the Central Powers on 26 October 1917.

On 21 December 1917, the Brazilian Navy—at the behest of the British—formed a small naval force with the intent of sending it to the other side of the Atlantic. On 30 January 1918, "Bahia" was made the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the newly organized (Naval Division in War Operations, abbreviated as DNOG), under the command of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Pedro%20Max%20Fernando%20Frontin">Pedro Max Fernando Frontin</a>. The other ships assigned to the squadron were "Bahia"s sister "Rio Grande do Sul", destroyers , , and , <a href="Ship%27s%20tender">tender</a> , and tugboat "Laurindo Pita".

The DNOG sailed for the British colony of <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> on 31 July. Since other allied countries helped with logistics, little was provided by Brazil aside from the ships themselves and the men crewing them. Despite the threat of a <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> attack, they were forced to stop several times so "Belmonte" could transfer necessities such as coal and water to the other ships. They reached <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a> safely on 9 August and remained in the port until 23 August when they departed for <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>. While on this section of the voyage, "Bahia", "Rio Grande do Sul", "Rio Grande do Norte", "Belmonte" and "Laurindo Pita" spotted an apparent torpedo heading for "Belmonte", but it missed. "Rio Grande do Norte" then fired several shots and depth-charged what the force believed to be a U-boat. While the official Brazilian history of the ship definitively claims to have sunk a submarine, author <a href="Robert%20Scheina">Robert Scheina</a> notes that this action was never confirmed, and works published about U-boat losses in the war do not agree.

After arriving in Dakar on 26 August, the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar, <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> and <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>; the Allies believed that this area was rife with U-boats waiting for convoys to pass through. As such, the Brazilian unit's mission was to patrol for <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> laid by German minelaying submarines and to make sure that <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s passing through would be safe. Complications arose when both "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul" had problems with their <a href="condenser%20%28heat%20transfer%29">condenser</a>s, a matter which was made much worse by the hot, tropical climate in which the ships were serving.

In early September, the squadron was struck by the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">Spanish flu pandemic</a>. The contagion began aboard "Bahia", spread to the other ships of the squadron and remained present for seven weeks. At one point, 95% of some of the ships' crews were infected; 103 died overseas, and 250 died in Brazil after returning there. On 3 November, "Bahia", three of the four destroyers, and the tugboat were sent to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean Sea. They arrived on 9 or 10 November, escorted by the American destroyer , but the fighting ceased on the 11th when the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice with Germany</a> was signed. Sometime in early 1919, "Bahia", accompanied by four destroyers, voyaged to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, England; they then traveled across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> to <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>, arriving there on 15 February. The commander of the squadron, Admiral <a href="Pedro%20Max%20Fernando%20Frontin">Pedro Max Fernando Frontin</a>, met with the <a href="Maritime%20Prefect">Maritime Prefect</a> prior to the commencement of "social events"; these lasted until 23 February, when the ships moved to <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> and Frontin journeyed overland to Paris. The DNOG was dissolved on 25 August 1919.

In 1925–26, "Bahia" underwent significant modernization. The original five turbines were replaced by three <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Brown–Curtis</a> turbines, while the original ten boilers were replaced by six <a href="Water-tube%20boiler%23Thornycroft">Thornycroft</a> oil-burning boilers, which necessitated the addition of a third funnel. The former coal bunkers, along with some of the space freed up by the decrease in boilers, were converted to hold of oil. These modifications resulted in "Bahia"s top speed increasing to . All of the boats on board were replaced, and three <a href="Madsen%2020%20mm%20anti-aircraft%20cannon">Madsen guns</a>, a <a href="Hotchkiss%20et%20Cie">Hotchkiss</a> machine gun, and four torpedo tubes were added to give the ship a defense against aircraft and more power against surface ships, respectively. Still, in 1930 "The New York Times" labeled "Bahia" and the other warships in Brazil's navy as "obsolete" and noted that nearly all were "older than the ages considered effective by powers signatory to the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington</a> and <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">London Naval Treaties</a>."

On 28 June 1926, the "<a href="Ludington%20Daily%20News">Ludington Daily News</a>" reported that "Bahia" would pay a visit to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, accepting an invitation from the United States government to participate in the <a href="Sesquicentennial%20Exposition">sesquicentennial celebrations</a>. In mid-1930, "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul"—under the command of <a href="Her%C3%A1clito%20Belford%20Gomes">Heráclito Belford Gomes</a>—escorted Brazil's President-elect <a href="J%C3%BAlio%20Prestes">Júlio Prestes</a> to the United States. Traveling on board the <a href="Brazilian-Lloyd">Brazilian-Lloyd</a> <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> , Prestes was returning American then-President-elect <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>'s visit to Brazil in December 1928. The cruisers and met the three ships about off of <a href="Sandy%20Hook">Sandy Hook</a> and honored Prestes with a <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a>. After spending five hours in the <a href="Ambrose%20Channel">Ambrose Channel</a> due to fog, Prestes traveled on a launch to a pier, during which "Bahia" rendered one 21-gun salute and <a href="Fort%20Jay">Fort Jay</a> offered two. After arriving ashore, he traveled to <a href="New%20York%20City%20Hall">City Hall</a> before speeding down to Washington, D.C. He stayed in the United States for eight days before departing for France on the <a href="White%20Star%20Line">White Star Line</a>'s . "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul" were berthed at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> for the visit.

During the <a href="Brazilian%20Revolution%20of%201930">Brazilian Revolution of 1930</a>, "Bahia" served with "Rio Grande do Sul"—until that ship defected—and five or six destroyers off the coast of <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>; they were once again commanded by Belford Gomes. Two years later, when the state of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a> rebelled in the <a href="Constitutionalist%20Revolution">Constitutionalist Revolution</a>, "Bahia"—under the command of <a href="Frigate%20Captain">Frigate Captain</a> <a href="Lucas%20Alexandre%20Boiteux">Lucas Alexandre Boiteux</a>—and other vessels blockaded the rebel-held <a href="port%20of%20Santos">port of Santos</a>. "Bahia" was under repair from 1934 into 1935. In November 1935, "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul" sailed to <a href="Natal%2C%20Rio%20Grande%20do%20Norte">Natal</a>, the capital of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Norte">Rio Grande do Norte</a>, to lend support against another rebellion. As part of their mission, they were ordered to sink the steamship "Santos" on sight, as several escaping leaders of the revolution were on board.

From 17–22 May 1935, "Bahia" and "Rio Grande do Sul"—joined at an unknown point by the Argentine battleships and , the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a>s and , and five destroyers—escorted , with Brazilian President <a href="Get%C3%BAlio%20Vargas">Getúlio Vargas</a> <a href="wikt%3Aembark">embarked</a>, up the (<a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">River Plate</a>) to <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, the capital of Argentina. Vargas was returning visits from the presidents of Argentina and Uruguay, <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Pedro%20Justo">Agustín Pedro Justo</a> and <a href="Gabriel%20Terra">Gabriel Terra</a>. Vargas and Justo planned to be present at the opening session of the <a href="Pan-American%20Commercial%20Conference">Pan-American Commercial Conference</a> on 26 May, and open a <a href="Chaco%20War">Chaco War</a> <a href="peace%20conference">peace conference</a>, before "São Paulo" conveyed Vargas to <a href="Montevideo">Montevideo</a>, Uruguay for meetings with Terra.

On 2 March 1936, "Bahia" escorted "Veinticinco de Mayo", which had the Argentine Navy Minister Rear Admiral <a href="Eleazar%20Videla">Eleazar Videla</a> embarked, and "Almirante Brown" in the last part of their journey to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>.

After Brazil's entrance into the Second World War on 21 August 1942, which took effect on 31 August, "Bahia" was used extensively at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">campaign of Atlantic</a> for escorts and patrols; sources conflict as to the actual number—either 67 and 15 or 62 and 11. In total, she traveled in 358 days, and played a role in shepherding over 700 merchant ships, though she and "Rio Grande do Sull" were labeled by the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Institute">United States Naval Institute</a>'s magazine <a href="Proceedings%20%28magazine%29">"Proceedings"</a> as being "oversized destroyers" that were "relatively slow".

"Bahia" was modernized again twice during the war, in both 1942 and 1944; these modernizations were not as extensive as those of the 1920s. Two of her <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss"></a> guns were replaced with L/23 AA guns, her Madsen guns were replaced with seven <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm cannons</a> in single mounts, and a <a href="fire-control%20system">director</a> for these guns was installed. Two depth charge tracks were added, improved range-finders were added to the guns, and sonar and radar were fitted, in addition to other minor modifications. The Brazilian Navy's official history of the ship reports these modifications, but does not specify which were undertaken in which year.

On 3 June 1943, while "Bahia" was escorting the convoy BT 12, she located an <a href="naval%20mine">underwater mine</a> and destroyed it with one of her Madsen guns. On 10 July, while at , "Bahia" received a <a href="sonar">sonar</a> contact and <a href="depth%20charge">depth-charged</a> what the Brazilian Navy's official history of the ship reports might have been the German submarine , which was sunk later that month in the same area (off Rio de Janeiro) by American and Brazilian aircraft. In November 1944, "Bahia" joined the American <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and <a href="destroyer%20escort">destroyer escort</a> in escorting "" <a href="troopship">troopship</a>, which was carrying the 4th transportation of the <a href="Brazilian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Brazilian Expeditionary Force</a>'s troops heading <a href="Italian%20campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">to Italy</a>.

At the end of hostilities in the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European theater</a> in May 1945 various warships of the Allied nations, including Brazil's, were assigned to patrol in the Atlantic as rescue ships, standing by near routes frequented by <a href="military%20transport%20aircraft">military transport aircraft</a> carrying personnel from Europe to the continuing <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">war in the Pacific</a>. "Bahia" was one such ship; on 4 July 1945, she was stationed northeast of Brazil around , near the <a href="Saint%20Peter%20and%20Saint%20Paul%20Archipelago">Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago</a>. For anti-aircraft target practice, crewmen were firing the ship's 20 mm guns at a kite that was being towed behind the ship. One of them shot it down, but also accidentally hit the <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s on the <a href="stern">stern</a>—a direct consequence of the lack of guide rails that would normally prohibit the guns from being aimed at the ship. The resulting explosion knocked out all power on the ship and sank her in about three minutes. 

The survivors of the blast endured four or five days of no food, high temperatures and full exposure to the sun on their makeshift rafts. "The New York Times" reported that some were driven mad by these conditions and simply jumped into the water, where they were devoured by sharks. From this point on, sources vary greatly. According to an article in <a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">"Time"</a>, "Bahia" loss was not discovered until 8 July, when 22 survivors were picked up by a freighter, . Naval historian Robert Scheina, however, says that the disaster was revealed when "Rio Grande do Sul" arrived on station four days after the sinking to take "Bahia" place and could not find her.

Sources also disagree on the number rescued and final death toll. The official history of the ship gives 36 rescued and 336 dead, and the "Navios de Guerra Brasileiros" gives 36 and 339. Contemporary news articles also published varying numbers; in an article published a day after the accident became known, "The Evening Independent" stated that the ship carried 383 men, though it did not give any more information. "The New York Times" gave figures of 28 saved and 347 lost, while the "St. Petersburg Times" gave 32 and 395. Sources do agree, however, that four American sound technicians were killed.

Rescued crewmen believed that they had hit a mine that detonated one of the ship's <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>. <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jorge%20Dodsworth%20Martins">Jorge Dodsworth Martins</a>—Brazil's chief of naval intelligence—thought that "Bahia" could have been mined or torpedoed by , which surrendered under strange circumstances in <a href="Mar%20del%20Plata">Mar del Plata</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, on 10 July (some two months after Germany's surrender), but the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20of%20the%20Argentine%20Republic">Argentine Naval Ministry</a> stated that it would have been impossible for the submarine to travel from the site of the sinking to Mar del Plata in six days (4–10 July). The "<a href="U-977">U-977</a>", which crew was also heading to Argentina <a href="Refugee%23Asylum_seekers">seeking for asylum</a>, was also accused of sinking "Bahia". However, military investigations carried out by both US and Brazilian Navies, concluded that the cruiser had been indeed sunk due to the above described gunnery accident.

Distributed element filter

A distributed element filter is an <a href="electronic%20filter">electronic filter</a> in which <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a>, <a href="inductance">inductance</a> and <a href="electrical%20resistance">resistance</a> (the <a href="electrical%20element">elements</a> of the circuit) are not localised in discrete <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>s, <a href="inductor">inductor</a>s and <a href="resistor">resistor</a>s as they are in conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of <a href="frequency%20spectrum">signal frequencies</a> to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped element model</a>, which considers each element to be "lumped together" at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the <a href="frequency">frequency</a> of the signal increases, or equivalently as the <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> decreases. The <a href="distributed%20element%20model">distributed element model</a> applies at all frequencies, and is used in <a href="transmission%20line">transmission line</a> theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of <a href="electrical%20conductor">conductors</a> and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate "lumped" capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> band (wavelength less than one metre).

Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters, such as <a href="Selectivity%20%28electronic%29">selectivity</a> of radio channel, <a href="bandlimited">bandlimiting</a> of noise and <a href="Frequency-division%20multiplexing">multiplexing</a> of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (<a href="low-pass">low-pass</a>, <a href="band-pass">band-pass</a>, etc.) with the exception of <a href="high-pass">high-pass</a>, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (<a href="Butterworth%20filter">Butterworth</a>, <a href="Chebyshev%20filter">Chebyshev</a>, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.

There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a <a href="Reflections%20of%20signals%20on%20conducting%20lines%23Discontinuity%20along%20line">discontinuity</a> on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a <a href="Electrical%20reactance">reactive impedance</a> to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped <a href="inductor">inductor</a>s, <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>s or <a href="resonator">resonator</a>s, as required by the filter.

The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="electronic%20counter%20measures">electronic counter measures</a> during World War II. Lumped element <a href="analogue%20filter">analogue filter</a>s had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the <a href="microwave%20link">microwave link</a>s used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the <a href="Low-noise%20block%20converter">converters</a> (figure 1 shows an example) used with <a href="satellite%20dish">satellite television dishes</a>.

Distributed element filters are mostly used at frequencies above the <a href="VHF">VHF</a> (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 <a href="megahertz">MHz</a>). At these frequencies, the physical length of <a href="passive%20components">passive components</a> is a significant fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped element model</a>. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common rule of thumb is to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher as a result of these advances. On the other hand, <a href="antenna%20%28radio%29">antenna</a> structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.

The most noticeable difference in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped-element approximation is that the former will have multiple <a href="passband">passband</a> replicas of the lumped-element <a href="prototype%20filter">prototype</a> passband, because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals. These spurious passbands are undesirable in most cases.

For clarity of presentation, the diagrams in this article are drawn with the components implemented in <a href="stripline">stripline</a> format. This does not imply an industry preference, although <a href="planar%20transmission%20line">planar transmission line</a> formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a> manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using <a href="microstrip">microstrip</a> or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial cable</a>s, <a href="twin%20lead">twin lead</a>s and <a href="waveguide">waveguide</a>s, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a> designs.

Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War II. <a href="Warren%20P.%20Mason">Warren P. Mason</a> founded the field of <a href="distributed%20element%20circuit">distributed element circuit</a>s. A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published electrical design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="electronic%20counter-measures">electronic counter-measures</a>. A good deal of this was at the <a href="MIT%20Radiation%20Laboratory">MIT Radiation Laboratory</a>, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.

Some important advances in <a href="Network%20analysis%20%28electrical%20circuits%29">network theory</a> were needed before filters could be advanced beyond wartime designs. One of these was the commensurate line theory of <a href="Paul%20Richards%20%28scientist%29">Paul Richards</a>. Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. <a href="Richards%27%20transformation">Richards' transformation</a> allows a lumped element design to be taken "as is" and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation.

The difficulty with Richards' transformation from the point of view of building practical filters was that the resulting distributed element design invariably included <a href="Series%20and%20parallel%20circuits">series</a> connected elements. This was not possible to implement in planar technologies and was often inconvenient in other technologies. This problem was solved by K. Kuroda who used impedance transformers to eliminate the series elements. He published a set of transformations known as <a href="Kuroda%27s%20identities">Kuroda's identities</a> in 1955, but his work was written in Japanese and it was several years before his ideas were incorporated into the English-language literature.

Following the war, one important research avenue was trying to increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was to start with a lumped element <a href="prototype%20filter">prototype filter</a> and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum "Q" of five (see <a href="%23Band-pass%20filters">Band-pass filters</a> below for an explanation of "Q"). In 1957, <a href="Leo%20C.%20Young">Leo Young</a> at <a href="Stanford%20Research%20Institute">Stanford Research Institute</a> published a method for designing filters which "started" with a distributed element prototype. This prototype was based on <a href="quarter%20wave%20impedance%20transformer">quarter wave impedance transformer</a>s and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an <a href="Octave%20%28electronics%29">octave</a>, corresponding to a "Q" of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later, exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.

The introduction of printed planar technologies greatly simplified the manufacture of many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's "stripline" soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially "triplate" and "microstrip". The generic term "stripline" in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as "triplate".

Early stripline directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but the length was reduced and the compactness successively increased with the introduction of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-<a href="elliptic%20filter">elliptic</a>, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as <a href="suspended%20stripline">suspended stripline</a> and <a href="finline">finline</a>.

The initial non-military application of distributed element filters was in the <a href="microwave%20link">microwave link</a>s used by telecommunications companies to provide the <a href="backbone%20network">backbone</a> of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic <a href="satellite%20television">satellite television</a> systems. An emerging application is in <a href="superconductivity">superconducting</a> filters for use in the <a href="cellular%20base%20station">cellular base station</a>s operated by mobile phone companies.

The simplest structure that can be implemented is a step in the <a href="characteristic%20impedance">characteristic impedance</a> of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with <a href="quarter%20wave%20impedance%20transformer">impedance transformers</a> to produce a filter of higher <a href="Degree%20of%20a%20polynomial">order</a>. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (<a href="Butterworth%20filter">Butterworth</a>, <a href="Chebyshev%20filter">Chebyshev</a>, etc.) by approximating the <a href="rational%20function">rational</a> <a href="transfer%20function">transfer function</a> of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).
Another very common component of distributed element filters is the <a href="Stub%20%28electronics%29">stub</a>. Over a narrow range of frequencies, a stub can be used as a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt <a href="LC%20circuit">LC</a> <a href="antiresonance">antiresonators</a>, and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC <a href="resonator">resonator</a>. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications. While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).

A <a href="helical%20resonator">helical resonator</a> is similar to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper <a href="VHF">VHF</a> and lower <a href="UHF">UHF</a> bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and <a href="Super%20high%20frequency">SHF</a> bands.

Coupled lines (figures 3(c-e)) can also be used as filter elements; like stubs, they can act as resonators and likewise be terminated short-circuit or open-circuit. Coupled lines tend to be preferred in planar technologies, where they are easy to implement, whereas stubs tend to be preferred elsewhere. Implementing a true open circuit in planar technology is not feasible because of the dielectric effect of the substrate which will always ensure that the equivalent circuit contains a shunt capacitance. Despite this, open circuits are often used in planar formats in preference to short circuits because they are easier to implement. Numerous element types can be classified as coupled lines and a selection of the more common ones is shown in the figures.

Some common structures are shown in figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations are not to be taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and <a href="band-stop%20filter">band-stop filter</a>s. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a> applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two structures are therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.

A <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a> can be implemented quite directly from a <a href="ladder%20topology">ladder topology</a> lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5. This is also called a "cascaded lines" design. The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are sometimes referred to as "chokes". In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance. Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial</a> implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.

A more complex example of stepped impedance design is presented in figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology can be used to design <a href="elliptical%20filter">elliptical filter</a>s or <a href="Chebyshev%20filter">Chebyshev filter</a>s with poles of attenuation in the <a href="stopband">stopband</a>. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as <a href="m-derived%20filter">m-derived filter</a>s instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the <a href="band%20rejection">stopband rejection</a>. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter. This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.
Another common low-pass design technique is to implement the shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line as shown in figure 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub on "both sides" of the line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill-defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.

A <a href="band-pass%20filter">band-pass filter</a> can be constructed using any elements that can resonate. Filters using stubs can clearly be made band-pass; numerous other structures are possible and some are presented below.

An important parameter when discussing band-pass filters is the fractional bandwidth. This is defined as the ratio of the bandwidth to the geometric centre frequency. The inverse of this quantity is called the <a href="Q%20factor">Q-factor</a>, "Q". If ω and ω are the frequencies of the passband edges, then:

The capacitive gap structure consists of sections of line about λ/2 in length which act as resonators and are coupled "end-on" by gaps in the transmission line. It is particularly suitable for planar formats, is easily implemented with printed circuit technology and has the advantage of taking up no more space than a plain transmission line would. The limitation of this topology is that performance (particularly <a href="insertion%20loss">insertion loss</a>) deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth, and acceptable results are not obtained with a "Q" less than about 5. A further difficulty with producing low-"Q" designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths. The minimum width of gaps, like the minimum width of <a href="signal%20trace">tracks</a>, is limited by the resolution of the printing technology.

Parallel-coupled lines is another popular topology for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of nothing more than the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the "Q". Lower-"Q" lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and "Q"-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.

The hairpin filter is another structure that uses parallel-coupled lines. In this case, each pair of parallel-coupled lines is connected to the next pair by a short link. The "U" shapes so formed give rise to the name "<a href="bobby%20pin">hairpin</a> filter". In some designs the link can be longer, giving a wide hairpin with λ/4 impedance transformer action between sections. The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity. Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph at the top of the article.

Interdigital filters are another form of coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is terminated in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, the advantage of a mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and "Q" values as low as 1.4 are possible.

The comb-line filter is similar to the interdigital filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.

As mentioned above, stubs lend themselves to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line is no longer a narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs in the body of the filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.

Yet another structure available is λ/2 open-circuit stubs across the line coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, it is possible to transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω, as opposed to 3ω for the λ/4 stub filter.

Konishi describes a wideband 12 GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs and also has a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response). As is often the case with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which are considered to be spurious.

Genuine <a href="high-pass%20filter">high-pass filter</a>s are difficult, if not impossible, to implement with distributed elements. The usual design approach is to start with a band-pass design, but make the upper stopband occur at a frequency that is so high as to be of no interest. Such filters are described as pseudo-high-pass and the upper stopband is described as a vestigial stopband. Even structures that seem to have an "obvious" high-pass topology, such as the capacitive gap filter of figure 8, turn out to be band-pass when their behaviour for very short wavelengths is considered.

Wotton railway station (Brill Tramway)

Wotton railway station was a small station in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, England, built by the <a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Duke of Buckingham</a> in 1871. Part of a private <a href="Horsecar">horse-drawn</a> <a href="Tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> designed to carry freight from and around his lands in Buckinghamshire, Wotton station was intended to serve the Duke's home at <a href="Wotton%20House">Wotton House</a> and the nearby village of <a href="Wotton%20Underwood">Wotton Underwood</a>. In 1872 the line was extended to the nearby village of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a>, converted to passenger use, equipped with steam locomotives, and renamed the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>. In the 1880s, it was proposed to extend the line to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but the operation of the line was instead taken over by London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a>.

Although situated in an unpopulated area, Wotton station was relatively well used. It saw the highest passenger numbers of any station on the line other than the terminus at <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a> and the junction with the main line to London at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road railway station</a>, and it also carried large quantities of milk from the area's dairy farms. In 1906 the <a href="Great%20Western%20and%20Great%20Central%20Joint%20Railway">Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway</a> (commonly known as the Alternative Route) was opened, crossing the Brill Tramway at Wotton. Although the lines were not connected, a station (also named <a href="Wotton%20%28GCR%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a>) was built on the new line very near the existing Wotton station; the two stations shared a <a href="stationmaster">stationmaster</a>.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, which leased the line, was taken into public ownership and became the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a>. Despite being a small rural station by train from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, Wotton became a station on the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>. <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, the Chief Executive of the London Passenger Transport Board, aimed to abandon freight operations on the London Underground network, and saw no way in which the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway could ever become viable passenger routes. As a result, all passenger services north of <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> were withdrawn between 1935 and 1936; the last trains on the Brill Tramway ran on 30 November 1935. The line then reverted to the descendants of the Duke of Buckingham, but having no funds and no rolling stock they were unable to operate it. On 2 April 1936, the line's entire infrastructure, including Wotton station, was sold for scrap at auction. Except for a small building which once housed the Brill Tramway's forge, all the station buildings at Wotton have been demolished.

On 23 September 1868, the small <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&BR) opened, linking the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>'s station at <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Varsity%20Line">Oxford to Bletchley line</a> at <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a>. On 1 September 1894, London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a> began on 1 January 1897.

<a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a>, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861. In the early 1870s, he decided to build a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR's line at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>. As the proposed line was to run on land owned by the Duke and by the Winwood Charity Trust, who consented to its construction, the line did not need Parliamentary approval and construction could begin immediately.

The first stage of the route, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Wotton Tramway</a>, was a line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>, opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by <a href="Horsecar">horse trams</a> only, the line was built with <a href="Baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a>, to reduce the risk of horses tripping.

Residents of the nearby town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> lobbied the Duke for the introduction of passenger services on the line. This led to an upgrading and extension of the line from Wotton, via the original terminus of the tramway system at <a href="Wood%20Siding%20railway%20station">Wood Siding</a>, to a new terminus at the foot of <a href="Brill%20Hill">Brill Hill</a>, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself. The new <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill railway station</a> opened in March 1872. In addition to freight trains which ran as and when required, two <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a>s per day ran in each direction. The Duke bought two <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s modified to work as locomotives, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of was enforced. With the extension to Brill opened, the line began to be referred to as the Brill Tramway.

In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died, and in 1894 the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of his <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built it would have been the shortest route between Oxford and the City of London.

The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, and from then on the MR (the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> from July 1933) operated all services on the line, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC. Throughout the operation of the Brill Tramway the track and stations remained in the ownership of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company; the MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.

Wotton station was situated in open countryside, about one mile (1.6 km) from the nearest settlement of <a href="Wotton%20Underwood">Wotton Underwood</a>, which in 1871 had a population of around 220. Roughly halfway between the line's terminus at <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill</a> and the junction with the main line at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>, the station marked the official midpoint of the line for operating purposes. When more than one locomotive was in operation on the line, the Tramway operated a <a href="Token%20%28railway%20signalling%29">token signalling</a> system using colour-coded staffs; drivers on the section between Quainton Road and Wotton were obliged to carry a blue staff; those between Wotton and Brill (and the Kingswood siding) a red staff. The station was situated on a sharp curve; had the extension to Oxford been built, the station would have needed to have been resited to accommodate longer and faster trains.

The original station was a crude earth bank high, held in place by wooden planks, but it was later rebuilt. The station was equipped with a short level platform, and a small square goods shed. The main users of the goods facilities appear to have been the local dairy farms; in the 1880s, prior to the transfer to Metropolitan Railway operation, Wotton station was handling from 45,000 to 60,000 gallons (200,000 to 270,000 l; 54,000 to 72,000 US gal) of milk each year. The passenger station building itself was a wooden hut with an iron roof, long by wide, including a waiting room, a booking office and male and female toilet facilities. Until the early 20th century the station porter was required to keep a three-gallon kettle on the boil for foot warmers, should the passengers require them. A pair of small cottages were built near the station to house Tramway employees.

A small <a href="Siding%20%28rail%29">siding</a> immediately west of the station originally led to a stable, which housed the Tramway's horses. After the line's mechanisation in 1872 the stables were closed, and the siding served a small cattle pen.

Slightly to the west of the station was a junction with a 1 mile 57 chain (1 mile 1,300 yards; 1.8 km) spur line known as Church Siding, which ran through Wotton Underwood to the hamlet of <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>. This spur line served two coal merchants, and never officially carried passengers; it was never upgraded to carry locomotives and remained worked by horses throughout its existence. (The siting of the coal bay at Kingswood was controversial, as it was inconveniently sited and built on low ground prone to flooding. The Duke and the line's surveyor had disagreed on the best location for the depot; to resolve the matter the Duke had thrown his hat in the air and the coal bay was built where the hat landed.) The spur to Kingswood was abandoned in about 1915, although a short stub, running between the Brill Tramway and the Duke of Buckingham's home at <a href="Wotton%20House">Wotton House</a>, remained open for occasional goods traffic until the line was closed.

On 2 April 1906, the <a href="Great%20Western%20and%20Great%20Central%20Joint%20Railway">Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway</a>, commonly known as the Alternative Route, opened to passengers. The new line linked <a href="Ashendon%20Junction">Ashendon Junction</a> on the <a href="Chiltern%20Main%20Line">Chiltern Main Line</a> to the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central Railway</a> at <a href="Grendon%20Underwood">Grendon Underwood</a>, a short distance northwest of Quainton Road. The Alternative Route crossed the Brill Tramway on a bridge at Wotton, and <a href="Wotton%20%28GCR%29%20railway%20station">another station</a>, also named "Wotton", was built on the embankment immediately to the south of the existing Wotton station. Although the lines did not connect, a temporary siding was built from the Brill Tramway onto the new embankment, and used for the transport of construction materials and the removal of spoil from the works during the building of the new line. The two Wotton stations were very close together, and the same <a href="stationmaster">stationmaster</a> was responsible for both stations.

From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until closure in 1935. Limited by poor quality locomotives and <a href="Land%20grading">ungraded</a>, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and stopping at three intermediate stations between Wood Siding and Quainton Road to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains took between 35 and 45 minutes to travel from Wotton to Brill, and around an hour from Wotton to the <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> with the main line at Quainton Road.

Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Wotton to Brill and Quainton Road to around 10 minutes and 25 minutes respectively. Serving a lightly populated area, Wotton railway station saw little passenger use, although it was the most-used station on the line other than Brill itself and the junction station at Quainton Road; in 1932, the last year of private operation, the station saw 2,648 passenger journeys earning a total of £144 (about £ in 2019) in passenger receipts.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways aside from the short <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). Thus, despite it being and over two hours travel from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, Wotton formally became a <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> station, although in common with other Metropolitan line stations north of Aylesbury it was never shown on the <a href="tube%20map">tube map</a>. <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2,000 (about £ in 2019) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway.
With Pick wanting to abandon freight services and seeing no future for the extremities of the former Metropolitan Railway as passenger routes, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. All services on the Brill Tramway were officially withdrawn on 1 December 1935, with the last trains running on 30 November. While services were withdrawn completely from the Brill Tramway, the LPTB considered the Verney Junction branch as having a use as a freight line and as a <a href="Detour">diversionary route</a>, and continued to maintain the line and to operate freight services until 6 September 1947.

Following the withdrawal of London Transport services the Metropolitan Railway's lease was voided and the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own the O&ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. Wotton station building sold for £5 10s (about £ in 2019), the platform for £2 5s (about £ in 2019), and the cattle pen for 11s (about £ in 2019).

Wotton station on the Alternative Route, which had passed from the ownership of the Great Central Railway to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>, remained open (albeit little used and served by only two trains per day in each direction) until 7 December 1953, when the line was abandoned. All buildings of the Brill Tramway station at Wotton were subsequently demolished, other than a small building which had once housed the Tramway's forge, which was left derelict. The bridge that had formerly carried the Alternative Route was demolished in 1970, and the former Great Central Railway station on the Alternative Route was converted to a private house.

Planet of the Apes

Planet of the Apes is an American <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="media%20franchise">media franchise</a> consisting of films, books, television series, comics and other media about a world in which humans and intelligent apes clash for control. The franchise is based on French author <a href="Pierre%20Boulle">Pierre Boulle</a>'s 1963 novel "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28novel%29">La Planète des singes</a>", translated into English as "Planet of the Apes" or "Monkey Planet". Its 1968 film adaptation, "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%281968%20film%29">Planet of the Apes</a>", was a critical and commercial hit, initiating a series of sequels, tie-ins, and derivative works. <a href="Arthur%20P.%20Jacobs">Arthur P. Jacobs</a> produced the first five "Apes" films through APJAC Productions for distributor <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a>; since his death in 1973, Fox has controlled the franchise.

Four sequels followed the original film from 1970 to 1973: "<a href="Beneath%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Beneath the Planet of the Apes</a>", "<a href="Escape%20from%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Escape from the Planet of the Apes</a>", "<a href="Conquest%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</a>" and "<a href="Battle%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Battle for the Planet of the Apes</a>". They did not approach the critical acclaim of the original, but were commercially successful, spawning two <a href="%23Television%20series">television series</a> in 1974 and 1975. Plans for a film remake stalled in "<a href="development%20hell">development hell</a>" for over ten years before <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>'s "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%282001%20film%29">Planet of the Apes</a>" was released in 2001. A <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> film series commenced in 2011 with "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Rise of the Planet of the Apes</a>", which was followed by "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a>" in 2014 and "<a href="War%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">War for the Planet of the Apes</a>" in 2017. The films have grossed a total of over $2,000,000,000 worldwide, against a combined budget of $567.5 million. Along with further narratives in various media, franchise tie-ins include video games, toys and planned theme park rides.

"Planet of the Apes" has received particular attention among film critics for its treatment of <a href="Race%20%28human%20categorization%29">racial issues</a>. Cinema and cultural analysts have also explored its <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> themes. The series has influenced subsequent films, media and art, as well as popular culture and political discourse.

The series began with French author <a href="Pierre%20Boulle">Pierre Boulle</a>'s 1963 novel "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28novel%29">La Planète des singes</a>". Boulle wrote the novel in six months after the "humanlike expressions" of gorillas at the zoo inspired him to contemplate the relationship between man and ape. "La Planète des singes" was heavily influenced by 18th- and 19th-century fantastical <a href="travel%20narrative">travel narrative</a>s, especially <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>'s satirical "<a href="Gulliver%27s%20Travels">Gulliver's Travels</a>". It is one of several of Boulle's works to use science fiction tropes and plot devices to comment on the failings of human nature and mankind's overreliance on technology, though Boulle rejected the science fiction label, instead terming his genre "social fantasy".

The novel is a satire that follows French journalist Ulysse Mérou, who participates in a voyage to a distant planet where speechless, animalistic humans are hunted and enslaved by an advanced society of apes. The ape species are sorted into classes: the <a href="gorilla">gorilla</a>s are police and military officers, the <a href="Common%20chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>s are scientists and the <a href="orangutan">orangutan</a>s are politicians. Eventually, Mérou discovers that humans once dominated the planet until their complacency allowed the more industrious apes to overthrow them. The story's central message is that human intelligence is not a fixed quality and could atrophy if taken for granted. Boulle considered the novel one of his minor works, though it proved to be a bestseller. British author <a href="Xan%20Fielding">Xan Fielding</a> translated it into English; it was published in the United Kingdom as "Monkey Planet" and in the United States as "Planet of the Apes".

Boulle's literary agent, Allain Bernheim, brought the novel to the attention of American film producer <a href="Arthur%20P.%20Jacobs">Arthur P. Jacobs</a>, who had come to Paris looking for properties to adapt with his new company, APJAC Productions. To explain his interests, Jacobs would tell agents, "I wish "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>" hadn't been made so I could make it." Bernheim initially approached him about a <a href="Fran%C3%A7oise%20Sagan">Françoise Sagan</a> novel, which Jacobs turned down. Remembering Jacobs' earlier comment about "King Kong", Bernheim mentioned "La Planète des singes", not expecting he would be interested. However, the story intrigued Jacobs, who bought the film rights immediately.

After optioning the novel's film rights, Jacobs spent over three years trying to convince filmmakers to take on the project. He hired a succession of artists to create test sketches and hired veteran television writer <a href="Rod%20Serling">Rod Serling</a>, creator of "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>", to pen the screenplay. Serling's script changed elements of Boulle's novel, introducing <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> themes; notably, he devised a new twist ending that revealed the planet to be a future Earth where humans had destroyed themselves through <a href="nuclear%20warfare">nuclear warfare</a>. Production costs were estimated at over $10,000,000, a risk no studio in either Hollywood or Europe would assume. Jacobs and associate producer <a href="Mort%20Abrahams">Mort Abrahams</a> persevered and eventually persuaded <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a> to star; Heston in turn recommended director <a href="Franklin%20J.%20Schaffner">Franklin J. Schaffner</a>. The team recorded a brief <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a> featuring Heston, which ultimately convinced <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> the film could succeed.

Fox insisted on changes to reduce the budget to a more manageable $5.8 million. The producers hired veteran writer <a href="Michael%20Wilson%20%28writer%29">Michael Wilson</a>, who had previously <a href="The%20Bridge%20on%20the%20River%20Kwai">adapted</a> Boulle's novel "<a href="The%20Bridge%20over%20the%20River%20Kwai">The Bridge over the River Kwai</a>", to rewrite Serling's script. To save on special effects costs, Wilson's script described an ape society more primitive than that which appeared in the novel. The new version changed much of the plot and dialogue, but retained the Cold War themes and Serling's ending. <a href="John%20Chambers%20%28make-up%20artist%29">John Chambers</a> created the makeup effects.

Heston played 20th-century American astronaut <a href="George%20Taylor%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">George Taylor</a>, who travels to a strange planet where intelligent apes dominate mute, primitive humans. <a href="Kim%20Hunter">Kim Hunter</a> and <a href="Roddy%20McDowall">Roddy McDowall</a> played the sympathetic chimpanzees <a href="Zira%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Zira</a> and <a href="Cornelius%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Cornelius</a> and <a href="Linda%20Harrison%20%28actress%29">Linda Harrison</a> portrayed Taylor's love interest <a href="Nova%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Nova</a>. <a href="Maurice%20Evans%20%28actor%29">Maurice Evans</a> played the villain, orangutan Minister of Science <a href="Dr.%20Zaius">Dr. Zaius</a>. The finale, in which Taylor comes upon a ruined <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> and realizes he has been on Earth all along, became the series' defining scene and one of the most iconic images in 1960s film. "Planet of the Apes" was released on February 8, 1968 and was a smash success with both critics and audiences. It was one of the year's 10 biggest money makers in North America, taking in an estimated $22,000,000 (nearly four times its budget) and earned rave reviews. John Chambers received an honorary Oscar at the <a href="41st%20Academy%20Awards">41st Academy Awards</a> for his make-up effects, the first ever given to a make-up artist. <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a>'s score and <a href="Morton%20Haack">Morton Haack</a>'s costume design also earned Oscar nominations. Fox approached Jacobs and Abrahams about filming a sequel. Though they had not made the film with sequels in mind, its success led them to consider the prospect.

Planning for the sequel, eventually titled "<a href="Beneath%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Beneath the Planet of the Apes</a>", began two months after the original film's release. Jacobs and Abrahams considered several treatments by Serling and Boulle, eventually rejecting them. In late 1968, the producers hired <a href="Paul%20Dehn">Paul Dehn</a> to write the script; he would become the primary writer for the franchise. Charlton Heston was uninterested in a sequel, but agreed to shoot a few scenes if his character was killed off and his salary was donated to charity. In one of many major rewrites, Dehn altered the script to center on a new character, <a href="Brent%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Brent</a>, played by <a href="James%20Franciscus">James Franciscus</a>. With Shaffner unavailable, owing to his work on "<a href="Patton%20%28film%29">Patton</a>", the producers hired <a href="Ted%20Post">Ted Post</a> as director on January 8, 1969. Post struggled with the material, especially after the studio cut the budget to $3.4 million.

The story follows Franciscus' character, an astronaut who, while searching for Taylor, inadvertently follows him into the future. After encountering the apes from the first film, Brent finds Taylor imprisoned by a colony of subterranean human mutants who worship an ancient nuclear bomb. Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans and Linda Harrison returned as Zira, Zaius and Nova. <a href="David%20Watson%20%28actor%29">David Watson</a> replaced Roddy McDowall as Cornelius, as McDowall was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict. <a href="James%20Gregory%20%28actor%29">James Gregory</a> played gorilla <a href="General%20Ursus">General Ursus</a> and <a href="Paul%20Richards%20%28actor%29">Paul Richards</a> played mutant leader <a href="M%C3%A9ndez%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Méndez</a>. The film opened on May 26, 1970. Unlike its predecessor, "Beneath" was poorly reviewed; critics typically regard it as the worst of the "Apes" sequels other than the last one, "<a href="Battle%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Battle for the Planet of the Apes</a>". Nonetheless, it was a major box office hit, nearing the original's numbers. Despite a conclusion depicting the planet's nuclear destruction, Fox requested another sequel, creating a series.

Following the financial success of "Beneath", Arthur P. Jacobs recruited Paul Dehn to write a new script with a brief telegram: "Apes exist, sequel required." Dehn immediately started work on what became "<a href="Escape%20from%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Escape from the Planet of the Apes</a>". The producers hired a new director, <a href="Don%20Taylor%20%28American%20actor%20and%20director%29">Don Taylor</a>. Fox gave the production a greatly diminished budget of $2.5 million, which required a tight production schedule.

To work around the budget, as well as "Beneath"s seemingly definitive ending, the film took the series in a new direction by transporting Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall, returning to the role after being absent from "Beneath") back in time to the contemporary United States, reducing the need for expensive sets and ape make-up effects. In the film, Zira and Cornelius are initially accepted by American society, but fears that their child will bring about the domination of the human race by evolved apes leads to conflict. Jacobs' wife, <a href="Natalie%20Trundy">Natalie Trundy</a>, who appeared as a mutant in "Beneath" and would play the ape <a href="Lisa%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Lisa</a> in the next two sequels, was cast as Dr. Stephanie Branton. <a href="Bradford%20Dillman">Bradford Dillman</a> played Dr. Lewis Dixon, <a href="Ricardo%20Montalb%C3%A1n">Ricardo Montalbán</a> played <a href="Armando%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Armando</a> and <a href="Eric%20Braeden">Eric Braeden</a> portrayed the villain, the president's science advisor <a href="Otto%20Hasslein">Otto Hasslein</a>.

Compared to its predecessors, "Escape" dwelt more heavily on themes of racial conflict, which became a primary focus through the rest of the series. The film opened on May 21, 1971, less than a year after "Beneath". It was well received by critics. From this point critics began seeing the films less as independent units and more as installments in a greater work; "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" editor Frederick S. Clarke wrote that the burgeoning series had "the promise of being the first epic of filmed science fiction." It also performed well at the box office, though not as strongly as its predecessors. Fox ordered a third sequel.

Based on the strong positive response to "Escape", Fox ordered "<a href="Conquest%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</a>", though it provided a comparatively low budget of $1.7 million. Paul Dehn returned as the scriptwriter, and producer Jacobs hired <a href="J.%20Lee%20Thompson">J. Lee Thompson</a> to direct. Thompson had worked with Jacobs on two earlier films as well as during the initial stages of "Planet", but scheduling conflicts had made him unavailable during its long development process. For "Conquest", Thompson and Dehn focused heavily on the racial conflict theme, an ancillary concern in the early films that became a central focus in "Escape". In particular, Dehn associated the apes with African-Americans and modeled the plot after the 1966 <a href="Watts%20Riots">Watts Riots</a> and other episodes from the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>. Roddy McDowall signed on to play <a href="Caesar%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Caesar</a>, the son of his previous character Cornelius. Ricardo Montalban returned as Armando, while <a href="Don%20Murray%20%28actor%29">Don Murray</a> played <a href="Governor%20Breck">Governor Breck</a>, <a href="Severn%20Darden">Severn Darden</a> played <a href="Kolp%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Kolp</a> and <a href="Hari%20Rhodes">Hari Rhodes</a> played <a href="MacDonald%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">MacDonald</a>.

Following "Escape", "Conquest" is set in a near future where humans have turned apes into slaves; Caesar rises from bondage to lead an ape rebellion. The film opened on June 30, 1972. Reviews were mixed, but the ending left the series open to another sequel and "Conquest" was successful enough at the box office that Fox commissioned another film.

Fox approved "<a href="Battle%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Battle for the Planet of the Apes</a>" with a $1.2 million budget, the lowest of the series. The filmmakers went into the project knowing that it would be the end of the series. J. Lee Thompson returned as director. Series writer Paul Dehn submitted a treatment, but illness forced him to leave the film before completing the script. The producers subsequently hired <a href="John%20William%20Corrington">John William Corrington</a> and <a href="Joyce%20Hooper%20Corrington">Joyce Hooper Corrington</a> to write the screenplay. "Battle" continued "Conquest"s focus on racial conflict and domination but, likely based in part on the studio's wishes, the Corringtons discarded Dehn's pessimistic treatment in favor of a story with a more hopeful, though ambiguous, resolution.

"Battle" follows Caesar as he leads the apes and their human subjects after a devastating war that destroyed much of the planet. He contends with both an attack by radiation-scarred human mutants and a coup attempt as he attempts to build a better society for both apes and humans. McDowall returned as Caesar and Severn Darden returned as Kolp. <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28songwriter%29">Paul Williams</a> played the orangutan <a href="Virgil%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Virgil</a>, <a href="Austin%20Stoker">Austin Stoker</a> played <a href="MacDonald%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">MacDonald</a> (the brother of Hari Rhodes' character) and <a href="Claude%20Akins">Claude Akins</a> played the evil gorilla general <a href="Aldo%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Aldo</a>. <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a> played the orangutan <a href="Lawgiver%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Lawgiver</a> in a <a href="frame%20narrative">frame narrative</a>. The film opened on May 2, 1973. It made a profit over production costs, but received poor reviews from critics, who regard it as the weakest of the five films.

Critics have offered various interpretations of the film's message and its significance for the series. Particular attention has been paid to the ambiguous imagery in the ending: set over 700 years after the main events, the last scene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver recounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children. By one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of "Planet" and "Beneath" is unavoidable.

As well as their profitable returns at the box office, the films earned very high ratings on television after their theatrical runs. To capitalize on this success, Arthur P. Jacobs conceived of an hour-long live action television series to follow the films. He first had the idea in 1971 during the production of "Conquest", which he then anticipated would be the final film, but he shelved the project once Fox ordered a fifth installment. Jacobs died on June 27, 1973, bringing an end to the APJAC Productions era of the "Planet of the Apes" franchise. Former Fox executive <a href="Stan%20Hough">Stan Hough</a> took over as producer for the television project, titled "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28TV%20series%29">Planet of the Apes</a>". <a href="CBS">CBS</a> picked up the series for its 1974 autumn lineup.

<a href="Ron%20Harper%20%28actor%29">Ron Harper</a> and <a href="James%20Naughton">James Naughton</a> played Alan Virdon and Peter Burke, two 20th-century American astronauts who pass through a time warp to a future where apes subjugate humans (unlike the original film, the humans can speak). Roddy McDowall returned to the franchise as Galen, a chimpanzee who joins the astronauts. <a href="Booth%20Coleman">Booth Coleman</a> played orangutan Councillor <a href="Zaius">Zaius</a> and <a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a> played gorilla General Urko. Such celebrities appeared as Norman Alden as the gorilla leader Zako. The episodes portray Virdon, Burke, and Galen as they search for a way to go home, aid downtrodden humans and apes and avoid the authorities. The show premiered on September 13, 1974, filling CBS's 8–9 p.m. time slot on Fridays. It earned low ratings during its run, a fact the production team attributed to repetitive storytelling and too little screen time for the apes who made the franchise famous. Given the considerable production costs, CBS cancelled the show after 14 episodes, the last airing on December 20, 1974.

In 1981, Fox reedited ten of the episodes into five <a href="television%20film">television film</a>s. Each film combined two episodes and (in some markets) added new introductory and concluding segments starring McDowall as an aged Galen. The films were given what scholar Eric Greene calls "the most outlandish titles of the "Apes" corpus": "Back to the Planet of the Apes"; "Forgotten City of the Planet of the Apes"; "Treachery and Greed on the Planet of the Apes"; "Life, Liberty and Pursuit on the Planet of the Apes"; and "Farewell to the Planet of the Apes".

Greene finds the show's position in the "Apes" timeline significant: set in 3085, it occurs about 900 years before Taylor's crash in the original film and 400 years after the Lawgiver's sermon in "Battle". By depicting a future where apes dominate humans, it implies the Lawgiver's message of equality between man and ape has failed, giving weight to the more pessimistic interpretation of "Battle"s ending. Greene argues that the show emphasized the theme of racial conflict less than the films had, though the episodes "The Trap" and "The Liberator" made it a central focus.

In 1975, after the failure of the live-action series, <a href="NBC">NBC</a> and 20th Century Fox agreed to adapt "Planet of the Apes" for an animated series. The network contracted <a href="DePatie-Freleng%20Enterprises">DePatie-Freleng Enterprises</a> to produce a half-hour <a href="Saturday-morning%20cartoon">Saturday-morning cartoon</a> titled "<a href="Return%20to%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Return to the Planet of the Apes</a>". <a href="Doug%20Wildey">Doug Wildey</a>, co-creator of "<a href="Jonny%20Quest">Jonny Quest</a>", took on most creative control as associate producer, storyboard director and supervising director. Wildey had only watched the original film and "Beneath" and thus based his interpretation on them. As such, the show relied less on the themes and plot developments from "Escape", "Conquest" and "Battle" and instead returned to the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and Cold War themes prominent in the first two films.

The plot concerns three American astronauts, Bill Hudson (Tom Williams), Jeff Allen (<a href="Austin%20Stoker">Austin Stoker</a>, who played MacDonald in "Battle") and Judy Franklin (<a href="Claudette%20Nevins">Claudette Nevins</a>), who inadvertently journey to Earth's far future. They find the world populated by three groups: mute humans who inhabit desert caves, subterranean human "Underdwellers" fashioned after the mutants of "Beneath" and civilized apes who subjugate the humans. Through the show, the astronauts become increasingly involved in the planet's affairs and in defending the humans against an ape invasion. The cast featured characters based on those from the previous films and TV series, including Nova (Nevins again), General Urko (Henry Cordin), Zira (Philippa Harris), Cornelius (Edwin Mills) and Dr. Zaius (Richard Blackburn). NBC broadcast 13 episodes between September 6 and November 29, 1975. The show did not achieve particularly strong ratings. The network considered producing a second three-episode season to complete the story, but this never materialized.

Fox initiated plans to relaunch the "Planet of the Apes" series in the 1980s, but the project fell into a drawn-out and fruitless development phase—"<a href="development%20hell">development hell</a>"—for over 10 years, one of the most protracted development periods in film history. It began in 1988, when Fox announced that <a href="Adam%20Rifkin">Adam Rifkin</a>, then a 21-year-old <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a> director, would develop a new "Apes" movie. At a Fox executive's invitation, Rifkin pitched a concept for "Return to the Planet of the Apes", an alternative sequel to "Planet" that ignored the other four films. In Rifkin's initial concept, Taylor's descendant Duke launches a <a href="Spartacus">Spartacus</a>-like uprising against Roman-inspired ape oppressors led by General Izan. Days before the project was scheduled to enter <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>, Fox brought in new studio executives, who sent it back to development. They commissioned Rifkin to write several redrafts, but found them unsatisfactory and ultimately scrapped the project.

After several years in limbo, Fox returned to the "Apes" concept, this time with <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> as a producer. Stone brought in <a href="Terry%20Hayes">Terry Hayes</a> as screenwriter and they developed a script titled "Return of the Apes". In their script, humanity is threatened by an ailment encoded in their DNA, so two scientists go back in time thousands of years to stop it at its origin. They discover the disease was engineered by advanced apes to ensure humanity's eventual destruction. <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> committed to star as scientist Will Robinson and <a href="Philip%20Noyce">Philip Noyce</a> agreed to direct. The draft impressed Fox president <a href="Peter%20Chernin">Peter Chernin</a>, but other executives were ambivalent about the action script, believing that it should be lighter. At one point, executive Dylan Sellers insisted the script include a comic scene involving apes playing baseball as his "stamp" on the film and fired Hayes when he left it out. This move caused Noyce to quit as well and, subsequently, almost everyone involved in the project left for one reason or another.

After the collapse of the Stone-Hayes project, Fox brought on <a href="Chris%20Columbus%20%28filmmaker%29">Chris Columbus</a> to develop a new "Apes" concept. Columbus hired <a href="Sam%20Hamm">Sam Hamm</a> to write a screenplay taking elements from Boulle's novel and various unused treatments. In Hamm's script, an ape astronaut from a distant planet unleashes a devastating virus on Earth. Scientists go to the astronaut's planet, where apes hunt humans; they locate a cure, but return to find Earth overrun by simians. Schwarzenegger remained attached, but Fox found the script underwhelming. Columbus left the project in 1995 after his mother's death and <a href="James%20Cameron">James Cameron</a> stepped in to produce. Cameron intended to go in a "very different direction" with the script, but following the critical and financial success of his film "<a href="Titanic%20%281997%20film%29">Titanic</a>", he dropped out of the project. Fox approached a series of directors to take over, without success.

In 1999, Fox hired <a href="William%20Broyles%2C%20Jr.">William Broyles, Jr.</a> to write a new script. Fox insisted on a July 2001 release date, but otherwise offered Broyles considerable creative license. This prospect attracted director <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, who hoped to do a "re-imagining" of "Planet of the Apes". Burton found the production arduous, largely due to Fox's strict release schedule. The studio budgeted the film at $100,000,000, meaning Broyles' ambitious script had to be altered to reduce costs; <a href="Lawrence%20Konner">Lawrence Konner</a> and <a href="Mark%20Rosenthal">Mark Rosenthal</a> worked on rewrites even as the film entered production. The tight schedule meant that all stages of production were rushed.

The film stars <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a> as astronaut <a href="Leo%20Davidson">Leo Davidson</a>, who accidentally travels through a wormhole to a distant planet where talking apes enslave humans. He leads a human revolt and upends ape civilization by discovering that the apes evolved from the normal Earth primates who had accompanied his mission and had arrived on the planet years before. <a href="Helena%20Bonham%20Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a> played chimpanzee <a href="Ari%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Ari</a>, while <a href="Tim%20Roth">Tim Roth</a> played the human-hating chimpanzee <a href="General%20Thade">General Thade</a>. The film received mixed reviews; most critics believed it failed to compare to the original. Much of the negative commentary focused on the confusing plot and twist ending, though many reviewers praised the special effects. The film succeeded at the box office, taking in $362,000,000 worldwide. Fox had initially hoped for a sequel, but the difficult production left Burton unenthusiastic about participating and the film failed to generate enough interest for the studio to pursue a follow-up.

In 2005, screenwriters <a href="Rick%20Jaffa%20and%20Amanda%20Silver">Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver</a> developed a concept for a new "Planet of the Apes" film, eventually titled "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Rise of the Planet of the Apes</a>". Inspired by news articles on apes raised as humans and advances in genetics, Jaffa conceived an idea for a film about a genetically enhanced chimp raised in a human household. He and Silver pitched the concept to Fox as a way to <a href="reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> the "Apes" franchise by reinventing the story of the chimpanzee <a href="Caesar%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Caesar</a>, the lead character of "Conquest" and "Battle". Fox was impressed and bought the pitch, but development struggled for five years as the production cycled through scripts, writers, directors and producers. In 2010, producers <a href="Peter%20Chernin">Peter Chernin</a> and Dylan Clark of Chernin Entertainment stepped in to move the film forward, retaining Jaffa and Silver as writers.

In the final script, Caesar receives enhanced cognition from a viral drug created by Will Rodman, who raises him. After being imprisoned in a primate sanctuary, Caesar uses his ingenuity to launch an uprising. The screenplay contains complex connections to other entries in the series, causing some confusion as to its exact relation to them. Oliver Lindler writes that while the film's premise might identify it as a <a href="remake">remake</a> of "Conquest", official dispatches and professional reviewers typically avoided the term, instead calling the film a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> or "origin story" to the original "Planet of the Apes" film and/or a <a href="Reboot%20%28fiction%29">reboot</a> of the series; fans and bloggers were more apt to refer to it as a "remake". The completed script attracted director <a href="Rupert%20Wyatt">Rupert Wyatt</a>. To portray ape characters realistically, the production avoided <a href="practical%20effects">practical effects</a> in favor of <a href="performance%20capture%20acting">performance capture acting</a>, partnering with New Zealand visual effects company <a href="Weta%20Digital">Weta Digital</a>. Wyatt cast <a href="James%20Franco">James Franco</a> as Will Rodman, while veteran performance capture actor <a href="Andy%20Serkis">Andy Serkis</a> signed on to star as Caesar.

"Rise" debuted on August 5, 2011. Critics reviewed it positively, especially praising the visual effects and Serkis' performance. It was a major box office hit, taking in $482,000,000 globally, more than five times its $93,000,000 budget. Weta's special effects earned the film two <a href="Visual%20Effects%20Society%20Awards">Visual Effects Society Awards</a> and an Oscar nomination at the <a href="84th%20Academy%20Awards">84th Academy Awards</a>, among other accolades. The strength of Serkis' performance also inspired Fox to promote him for Oscar consideration; he was not nominated by Academy voters. Following the movie's success, Fox immediately planned for a sequel.

Producers Peter Chernin and Dylan Clark started planning the film eventually titled "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a>" just after "Rise"s release in 2011. Fox allocated a budget of $170,000,000. Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver returned to pen the script and produce and the studio quickly signed Andy Serkis to reprise his role as Caesar. Director Rupert Wyatt withdrew from the project due to production and scheduling issues and was replaced by <a href="Matt%20Reeves">Matt Reeves</a>.

Set 10 years after "Rise", the film establishes that the "simian flu" that increased the intelligence of the apes has killed most humans. Caesar struggles to maintain peace as his ape community is drawn into violent clashes with nearby human survivors. Weta Digital again provided special effects work, which combined practical sets, digitally manipulated backgrounds and performance capture ape characters. The lead human characters were played by <a href="Jason%20Clarke%20%28actor%29">Jason Clarke</a>, as Malcolm; <a href="Keri%20Russell">Keri Russell</a>, as Ellie; and <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>, as Dreyfus. Released on July 11, 2014, the film was very well received by critics, who found it a strong follow-up to "Rise" and lauded the combination of an engaging script with impressive special effects. It also performed very strongly at the box office, taking in $707,000,000 in worldwide grosses. Its special effects received several honors, including three Visual Effects Society Awards and an Oscar nomination at the <a href="87th%20Academy%20Awards">87th Academy Awards</a>.

Fox was confident enough in "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" that the studio started planning for the next installment months before the film debuted. After Fox and Chernin Entertainment screened Matt Reeves' cut of "Dawn", he was contracted to return as director; he also wrote the script with <a href="Mark%20Bomback">Mark Bomback</a>. Peter Chernin, Dylan Clark, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver again served as producers. Given a $150,000,000 budget, "<a href="War%20for%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">War for the Planet of the Apes</a>" was released on July 14, 2017.

The film depicts the apes and humans in armed conflict and follows Caesar and his followers as they track down the mysterious Colonel, a human paramilitary leader, and search for a new home. Serkis returned as Caesar, <a href="Woody%20Harrelson">Woody Harrelson</a> played the villainous Colonel and <a href="Steve%20Zahn">Steve Zahn</a> played Bad Ape. It earned widespread critical acclaim; reviewers praised the effects and narrative and found the film a fitting conclusion to Caesar's story. It earned $491,000,000 around the globe. In October 2016, it was reported that a fourth film in the new series was being discussed.

<a href="Pierre%20Boulle">Pierre Boulle</a>'s novel "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28novel%29">La Planète des singes</a>" was translated and reprinted several times after its original publication in 1963. All of the original sequels spawned <a href="novelization">novelization</a>s by established science fiction writers of the day, each of which went through multiple reprintings of their own. <a href="Michael%20Avallone">Michael Avallone</a> wrote the novelization for "Beneath the Planet of the Apes". <a href="Jerry%20Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a>, who later co-authored "<a href="Lucifer%27s%20Hammer">Lucifer's Hammer</a>" and "<a href="The%20Mote%20in%20God%27s%20Eye">The Mote in God's Eye</a>", wrote the "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" novelization. <a href="John%20Jakes">John Jakes</a>, former <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> president, wrote "Conquest of the Planet of the Apes". <a href="David%20Gerrold">David Gerrold</a>, scriptwriter for the "" episode "<a href="The%20Trouble%20with%20Tribbles">The Trouble with Tribbles</a>", novelized "Battle for the Planet of the Apes". Novelizations of the live action and animated television series were also produced. <a href="William%20T.%20Quick">William T. Quick</a> novelized the 2001 "Planet of the Apes"; he also wrote two <a href="prequel">prequel</a> novels, and several other book tie-ins were published.

"Planet of the Apes"–based comics have been published regularly since 1968. Among the most notable is <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a>' "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28magazine%29">Planet of the Apes</a>" magazine, published from 1974 to 1977. The black-and-white series featured adaptations of each of the films, new "Apes" stories by <a href="Doug%20Moench">Doug Moench</a>, series news, essays, interviews and other material. It became one of Marvel's most successful titles, attracting 300 to 400 fan letters with every issue, so many that the studio had to suspend its practice of writing personal responses. Marvel also published the monthly title "Adventures on the Planet of the Apes" from 1975 to 1976, comprising color reprints of the "Planet" and "Beneath" adaptations.

In 1990, during a resurgence of interest in the franchise, <a href="Malibu%20Comics">Malibu Comics</a> launched a new monthly black-and-white "Planet of the Apes" comic through its Adventure Comics studio. The debut issue sold 40,000 copies, a record for black-and-white comics, leading to a successful run of 24 issues over two years. The series follows Caesar's grandson and heir Alexander as he struggles to govern ape civilization. The comic's success led Malibu to publish five four-issue spinoff <a href="Comic%20miniseries">miniseries</a>: "Ape City", "Planet of the Apes: Urchak's Folly", the "<a href="Alien%20Nation">Alien Nation</a>" crossover "Ape Nation", "Planet of the Apes: Blood of the Apes" and "Planet of the Apes: The Forbidden Zone". Malibu also published two <a href="One-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> comics, "A Day on the Planet of the Apes" and "Planet of the Apes: Sins of the Fathers", a prequel story to the original film; a <a href="Trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback</a> collecting the first four issues of the main series, titled "Monkey Planet"; and reissues of stories from Marvel's earlier "Apes" series.

<a href="Gold%20Key%20Comics">Gold Key Comics</a>, <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> and <a href="Boom%21%20Studios">Boom! Studios</a> have also produced "Planet of the Apes" comic books. The Boom! releases include crossovers with other properties: 2014's "" and 2017's <a href="King%20Kong">King Kong</a> story "Kong on the Planet of the Apes." In 2018, Boom! released a graphic novel, "Planet of the Apes: Visionaries", adapted from Rod Serling's film scripts by <a href="Dana%20Gould">Dana Gould</a> and Chad Lewis.

The series, and particularly the live-action "Apes" television show and the "Return to the Planet of the Apes" cartoon, generated numerous toy and merchandising tie-ins. During the 1970s, Fox licensed around 60 companies to produce about 300 different "Apes" products, including action figures and playsets, <a href="model%20building">model building</a> kits, coloring books, <a href="book-and-record%20set">book-and-record set</a>s, trading cards, <a href="toy%20weapon">toy weapon</a>s, costumes, apparel, branded tableware and lunch boxes. This level of merchandising was unusual for the time and the success of "Apes" merchandise may have inspired the campaigns that later became commonplace for films and television series. The action figures, sold by <a href="Mego%20Corporation">Mego</a> beginning in 1973, were the first such toys sold as film tie-ins; they proved popular and inspired the rise of action figure series based on popular culture franchises. Eric Greene writes that "Apes" toys were popular enough to lead some contemporary children to engage in apes-vs.-humans role-playing <a href="make%20believe">make believe</a> games that simulated the series' conflicts in a manner similar to "Cowboys and Indians". With the release of the 21st-century films, Fox licensed several companies to manufacture new "Apes" toys, including detailed action figures of new and "classic" characters sold as <a href="collectible">collectible</a>s.

A "Planet of the Apes" ride is planned for the 20th Century Fox World <a href="theme%20park">theme park</a>s under construction in <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20World%20%28Dubai%29">Dubai</a> and <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20World%20%28Malaysia%29">Malaysia</a>.

In 1983, 20th Century Fox Videogames developed a "Planet of the Apes" game for the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a>, which was to be the first computer game based on the series. The game was still in the <a href="prototype">prototype</a> phase when Fox shuttered its game division during the <a href="video%20game%20crash%20of%201983">video game crash of 1983</a> and never saw release. It was assumed lost until 2002, when collectors identified a prototype, found earlier in a case labeled "Alligator People", as the missing "Apes" game. Independent designers Retrodesign completed and released the game as "<a href="Revenge%20of%20the%20Apes">Revenge of the Apes</a>" in 2003. In the game, the player controls Taylor as he fights apes across several levels inspired by the film to reach the Statue of Liberty.

A video game based on the series did not appear until 2001. <a href="Fox%20Interactive">Fox Interactive</a> began developing a <a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28video%20game%29">"Planet of the Apes" game</a> in 1998 for <a href="PC%20game">PC</a> and <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> as a tie-in to the long-gestating <a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%23Planned%20relaunch%20and%20development%20hell">remake project</a>. Fox and <a href="video%20game%20developer">developer</a> <a href="Visiware">Visiware</a> proceeded with the game when the project went into limbo, creating their own story based on Boulle's novel and the original films. The game is an <a href="Action-adventure%20video%20game">action-adventure</a> in which players control astronaut Ulysses as he explores an ape-ruled future Earth. Fox Interactive's decision to co-publish with another company, <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, further delayed the game's release. Despite its long development, the game missed the debut of Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes" film by two months;it finally appeared on September 20, 2001 to mostly negative reviews. Additionally, Ubisoft produced a substantially different "Planet of the Apes" game for <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a>, a <a href="side-scroller">side-scroller</a> following the first two films.

In 2014, Fox partnered with <a href="Ndemic%20Creations">Ndemic Creations</a> on a substantial "<a href="Dawn%20of%20the%20Planet%20of%20the%20Apes">Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</a>"–themed update to the <a href="mobile%20game">mobile game</a> "<a href="Plague%20Inc.">Plague Inc.</a>" Players create and spread a "simian flu" virus to eradicate humans while helping apes survive. In 2017, Fox commissioned an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a> to accompany "War for the Planet of the Apes" called "". <a href="Andy%20Serkis">Andy Serkis</a>' digital effects company <a href="The%20Imaginarium">The Imaginarium</a> worked on the game and Serkis performed motion capture. It was released on <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> on November 21, 2017 to mixed reviews. In 2018, Fox's <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> division <a href="FoxNext%20VR%20Studio">FoxNext VR Studio</a> partnered with developers Imaginati Studios on a VR first-person shooter, "Crisis on the Planet of the Apes". The player controls a chimpanzee attempting to escape a human detention facility. It was released on PC and PlayStation 4, receiving negative to average reviews.

Critics consider <a href="Race%20%28human%20categorization%29">race</a> to be the "Planet of the Apes" series' primary theme. Eric Greene, author of a book on the role of race in the original films and spinoff material, writes that "when seen as one epic work, the "Apes" saga emerges as a liberal allegory of racial conflict." In Greene's interpretation, the franchise's plot arc is rooted in the central conflict in which humans and apes alternately subjugate one another in a destructive cycle. <a href="Difference%20%28philosophy%29">Difference</a> between human and ape manifests primarily in physical appearance and dominance derives from social power rather than innate superiority. Each film shifts the power balance so that the audience identifies sometimes with the humans and at other times with the apes. According to Greene, this arc's central message is that unresolved racial discord inevitably leads to cataclysm. Other critics have adopted or echoed Greene's interpretation. Producers Abrahams and Jacobs did not consciously intend the first film's racial undertones and did not appreciate them until <a href="Sammy%20Davis%20Jr.">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> pointed them out in 1968. Subsequently, the filmmakers incorporated the theme more overtly in later installments; as a result, race moves from being a secondary motif in the first two films to becoming the major concern of the last three.

Several critics have written that the reboot films downplay this theme from the original series, removing the racial subtext of conflict between humans and apes. These critics generally argue that this is to the films' detriment, writing that it softens the series' edge, leaves it thematically shallow and marginalizes non-white characters; several critics have written that the films appear to invoke a "<a href="post-racial%20America">post-racial America</a>", rather than exploring issues of race. Others write that the films incorporate racial themes in subtler ways, but that their presentation oversimplifies a complex message to the point of reinforcing racial norms rather than challenging them.

The <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and the threat of <a href="nuclear%20holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a> are major themes introduced in Rod Serling's original "Planet of the Apes" script. The films are <a href="Apocalyptic%20fiction">apocalyptic</a> and <a href="dystopian">dystopian</a>, suggesting the era's tensions could well lead to world destruction. The films critique both sides of the war, with the oppressive ape society and the underground mutant city featuring traits of both Western culture and the Soviet bloc. According to Greene, Cold War motifs were central to the first two films and some spinoff media, but were less significant in the later sequels, which foregrounded racial conflict instead.

Questions of <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> also figure heavily in the series; Greene considers this related to the racial themes. The first film portrays Taylor treated cruelly by apes who consider him an animal; in later films, humans abuse apes for the same reason. The idea of primate rights is much more dominant in the reboot films, which directly invoke the question of <a href="great%20ape%20personhood">great ape personhood</a> in portraying Caesar and his followers struggling for their rights in a society that does not consider them <a href="legal%20persons">legal persons</a>.

"Planet of the Apes" received popular and critical attention well after production ended on the original films and television series. Fans' interest in the franchise continued through publications like <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a>' "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%28comics%29">Planet of the Apes</a>" magazine and <a href="science%20fiction%20convention">science fiction convention</a>s, where the series was sufficiently popular to inspire "apecons"—conventions devoted entirely to films involving apes—in the 1970s. The series' distinctive ape costumes were employed in live appearances, including by musician <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28songwriter%29">Paul Williams</a> (<a href="Virgil%20%28Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%29">Virgil</a> from "Battle") on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Johnny%20Carson">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a>" and by <a href="Mike%20Douglas">Mike Douglas</a> on "<a href="The%20Mike%20Douglas%20Show">The Mike Douglas Show</a>". In the 1970s, fans Bill Blake and Paula Crist created Cornelius and Zira costumes; their routine was convincing enough that Fox licensed them to portray the characters at events. The films earned strong ratings when they aired on television after their releases and various stations rebroadcast them together in <a href="Marathon%20%28media%29">marathons</a> in later years. The live-action television series was reformatted into five TV movies for further broadcast in 1981and the <a href="Sci-Fi%20Channel">Sci-Fi Channel</a> ran both it and the cartoon series in the 1990s.

"Planet of the Apes" had a wide impact on subsequent popular media. In terms of production, the series' success with sequelization, spinoffs and merchandising established a new model of <a href="media%20franchising">media franchising</a> in Hollywood filmmaking, in which studios develop films specifically to generate multimedia franchises. In terms of content, the series influenced various films and television productions during the 1970s and 1980s that used science fiction settings and characters to explore race relations, including "<a href="Alien%20Nation">Alien Nation</a>", "<a href="Enemy%20Mine%20%28film%29">Enemy Mine</a>" and "<a href="V%20%28science%20fiction%29">V</a>". More direct influence can be seen in <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>' 1972–1978 series "" and the Japanese franchise "<a href="Time%20of%20the%20Apes">Time of the Apes</a>", which concern human protagonists in post-apocalyptic worlds ruled by talking animals. <a href="Mel%20Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>' 1987 science fiction spoof "<a href="Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>" lampooned the original "Planet"'s Statue of Liberty ending.

Interest in the series resurged in the 1990s, as plans for a new film and other media circulated. Greene attributes this renewed interest to a combination of "pop culture nostalgia and baby boomer economics", as well as a "political ferment" rising at the time that hearkened back to the period when the films were first released. Inspired particularly by the publication of the <a href="Malibu%20Comics">Malibu Comics</a> series, during this period fans founded new clubs, websites and <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>s active in the U.S., Canada, Brazil and other countries. Companies began producing new branded merchandise, including clothing, toys and costumes.

Especially after the 1990s, artists in diverse media referenced, incorporated, or were otherwise influenced by the series. "Planet of the Apes" turned up in songs by various musicians, allusions in films, comedy bits by <a href="Dennis%20Miller">Dennis Miller</a> and <a href="Paul%20Mooney%20%28comedian%29">Paul Mooney</a> and an episode of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" hosted by Charlton Heston. "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" parodied the series several times. In particular, the episode "<a href="A%20Fish%20Called%20Selma">A Fish Called Selma</a>" features the washed-up actor <a href="Troy%20McClure">Troy McClure</a> starring in a <a href="Broadway%20musical">Broadway musical</a> adaptation called "Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off!" Artist <a href="Martha%20Rosler">Martha Rosler</a> incorporated footage of Cornelius and Zira's interrogation from "Escape" in her <a href="Installation%20art">installation</a> "Global Taste: A Meal in Three Courses", while <a href="Guillermo%20G%C3%B3mez-Pe%C3%B1a">Guillermo Gómez-Peña</a> and <a href="Coco%20Fusco">Coco Fusco</a> employed video from "Planet" in a 1993 <a href="performance%20art">performance art</a> piece at the <a href="Whitney%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a>.

The series' impact has extended to the political sphere and groups of various leanings have employed its themes and imagery in their discourse. The phrase "planet of the apes" has been used for an overturning of the political or racial status quo. Eric Greene writes that it is especially popular among <a href="racial%20nationalism">racial nationalists</a> and reactionaries of different stripes. According to Greene, <a href="white%20supremacist">white supremacist</a>s liken minority advancement to the films' world in which supposed "inferiors" seize control, while <a href="black%20nationalists">black nationalists</a> subvert the reference to celebrate the "racial apocalypse"; in this spirit, <a href="gangsta%20rap">gangsta rap</a> group <a href="Da%20Lench%20Mob">Da Lench Mob</a> titled their 1994 album "<a href="Planet%20of%20da%20Apes">Planet of da Apes</a>". Greene writes that these uses invert the anti-racist message of the films. "Planet"s final image of the ruined Statue of Liberty has become a common political reference; for example, <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> used it in an advertising campaign against <a href="nuclear%20testing">nuclear testing</a>. The series' themes and imagery have been invoked in political discussions on topics as varied as <a href="Sixties">Sixties</a> culture, urban decay, contemporary wars and gun violence.

Little Butte Creek

Little Butte Creek is a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="Rogue%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Rogue River</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. Its <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> consists of approximately of <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon">Jackson County</a> and another of <a href="Klamath%20County%2C%20Oregon">Klamath County</a>. Its two forks, the North Fork and the South Fork, both begin high in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> near <a href="Mount%20McLoughlin">Mount McLoughlin</a> and <a href="Brown%20Mountain%20%28Klamath%20County%2C%20Oregon%29">Brown Mountain</a>. They both flow generally west until they meet near <a href="Lake%20Creek%2C%20Oregon">Lake Creek</a>. The <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> continues west, flowing through the communities of <a href="Brownsboro%2C%20Oregon">Brownsboro</a>, <a href="Eagle%20Point%2C%20Oregon">Eagle Point</a>, and <a href="White%20City%2C%20Oregon">White City</a>, before finally emptying into the Rogue River about southwest of Eagle Point.

Little Butte Creek's watershed was originally settled by the <a href="Takelma">Takelma</a>, and possibly the <a href="Shasta%20people">Shasta</a> tribes of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>. In the <a href="Rogue%20River%20Wars">Rogue River Wars</a> of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto <a href="Indian%20reservation">Indian reservation</a>s. Early settlers named Little Butte Creek and nearby <a href="Big%20Butte%20Creek">Big Butte Creek</a> after their proximity to Mount McLoughlin, which was known as Snowy Butte. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and lumber production. The city of Eagle Point was <a href="municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.

Large amounts of water are diverted from Little Butte Creek for irrigation, water storage, and power generation. Canal systems deliver the water to nearby <a href="Howard%20Prairie%20Lake">Howard Prairie Lake</a> and the <a href="Klamath%20River">Klamath River</a> watershed, <a href="Agate%20Lake">Agate Lake</a>, and the <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a>.

Despite being moderately polluted, the creek is one of the best salmon-producing tributaries of the Rogue River. <a href="Coho%20salmon">Coho</a> and <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook</a> salmon <a href="fish%20migration">migrate</a> upstream each year; however, several dams hinder their progress. A fish ladder was built in 2005 to help fish swim past a dam constructed in Eagle Point in the 1880s, but was destroyed by flooding just three months later. It was rebuilt in 2008. Restoration of a artificially straightened section of the creek in the <a href="Denman%20Wildlife%20Area">Denman Wildlife Area</a> was completed in 2011.

Little Butte Creek begins in the Cascade Range near Mount McLoughlin and Brown Mountain. It flows generally west over approximately to its confluence with the Rogue River. There are two main forks of Little Butte Creek: the North Fork and the South Fork. The South Fork's <a href="headwaters">headwaters</a> are at above sea level, while the North Fork's headwaters are considerably lower at . They meet each other at , creating the <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> itself. Little Butte Creek's mouth is at above sea level, giving the creek an overall <a href="stream%20gradient">gradient</a> of approximately .

The north fork begins at Fish Lake, near Mount McLoughlin. It flows west, collecting only minor tributaries, before merging with the south fork. The south fork's headwaters are just south of the Brown Mountain. The <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a> passes through this area. It flows west, receiving Beaver Dam Creek and <a href="Dead%20Indian%20Creek%20%28Oregon%29">Dead Indian Creek</a> on the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left bank</a>. Beaver Dam Creek drains approximately , and Dead Indian Creek has a watershed of about . The <a href="Dead%20Indian%20Soda%20Springs">Dead Indian Soda Springs</a> are on Dead Indian Creek, about a mile south of its confluence with the south fork. The south fork then turns northwest, collecting water from <a href="Lost%20Creek%20%28South%20Fork%20Little%20Butte%20Creek%29">Lost Creek</a> on the left, near the <a href="Lost%20Creek%20Bridge">Lost Creek Bridge</a>, built in 1919. Lost Creek drains about .
Just after the two forks merge about northeast of <a href="Medford%2C%20Oregon">Medford</a>, Little Butte Creek receives Lake Creek on the left bank, flowing through the community of the same name at <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> (RM) 17 or river kilometer (RK) 27. Lake Creek drains . The main stem is crossed by South Fork Little Butte Creek Road in Lake Creek. Water is diverted here into the Joint System Canal for storage in Agate Lake and to provide irrigation for the Medford region. A few miles west, the creek receives Salt Creek and Lick Creek on the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right bank</a>, which have watersheds of , respectively. <a href="Oregon%20Route%20140">Oregon Route 140</a> crosses the creek at RM 10 (RK 16).

The creek turns southwest, flowing through Eagle Point. Four bridges span the stream in Eagle Point: East Main Street, Loto Street, and the <a href="Antelope%20Creek%20Bridge">Antelope Creek Bridge</a> near RM 5 (RK 8), and <a href="Oregon%20Route%2062">Oregon Route 62</a> at RM 4 (RK 6). Near RM 3 (RK 5), Little Butte Creek receives <a href="Antelope%20Creek%20%28Little%20Butte%20Creek%29">Antelope Creek</a> on the left. Antelope Creek is its largest tributary, draining . Agate Lake on Dry Creek is in the Antelope Creek watershed. At RM 1.5 (RK 2.4) the creek is crossed by Agate Road. It then flows into the Rogue River from its mouth at the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Little Butte Creek's mouth is in the <a href="Denman%20Wildlife%20Area">Denman Wildlife Area</a>, approximately southwest of Eagle Point, and about a mile southeast of <a href="Upper%20and%20Lower%20Table%20Rock">Upper Table Rock</a>.

The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> monitored the flow of Little Butte Creek at seven different <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a>s: two on the south fork, three on the north fork, and two on the main stem. The first opened in 1908 at the newly constructed Fish Lake Dam on the north fork, while the last opened in 1927 near the Big Elk Ranger Station on the south fork. By 1989, all seven were closed. The data recorded by the lowermost gauges of both forks and the main stem are listed below.

Little Butte Creek drains approximately of <a href="southern%20Oregon">southern Oregon</a>. Elevations range from at the <a href="river%20mouth">mouth</a> of the creek to at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of . Forest accounts for about 65 percent of the total area of the watershed, while 32 percent is farmland. The remaining three percent is within the Eagle Point <a href="city%20limits">city limits</a>. Forty-eight percent of the watershed is <a href="federal%20lands">federally owned</a>, 50 percent is privately owned, and Eagle Point accounts for the remaining two percent. Over 10,000 people live within the watershed's boundaries.

The region experiences a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>. Temperatures average from in the summer to in the winter. The average <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a> in the area ranges from in the lower regions to over in the upper reaches. July through October are the driest months, while December through April are the wettest. Thirty-four percent of the <a href="surface%20runoff">surface runoff</a> in the watershed is collected from rain, 31 percent from rain on snow, and 35 percent from <a href="snowmelt">snowmelt</a>.

The two main geologic regions in the Little Butte Creek watershed are the High <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascades</a> and the <a href="western%20Cascades">western Cascades</a>. The western Cascades make up the western two thirds of the watershed, generally below in elevation. Steep, rugged canyons are common in this region. The lower stretches of the watershed contain soils such as decomposed <a href="lava">lava</a>s, <a href="clay">clay</a>, and <a href="gravel">gravel</a>. The High Cascades compose the eastern third of the watershed, including volcanoes such as Brown Mountain and Mount McLoughlin, and <a href="lava%20plateau">lava plateau</a>s. In some places, streams descend over . Nearby watersheds include two Rogue River tributaries—<a href="Big%20Butte%20Creek">Big Butte Creek</a> to the north and <a href="Bear%20Creek%20%28Rogue%20River%29">Bear Creek</a> to the south—and small <a href="Klamath%20River">Klamath River</a> tributaries to the east.

As of 2003, there were 581 <a href="water%20right">water right</a>s recorded in the watershed, with 394 of them related to irrigation. Four hundred sixty-six water diversions were also recorded. In the summer, many streams are over-appropriated, leading to frequent water shortages along the lower portion of the creek.

The flora in the Little Butte Creek watershed is predominately <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">temperate coniferous forest</a>, which makes up approximately 65 percent of the total area. The lower regions are covered with <a href="chaparral">chaparral</a>, and the upper regions by <a href="fir">fir</a> forests. The chaparral region is inhabited by <a href="oak">oak</a>s such as <a href="Quercus%20garryana">garry oak</a> and <a href="Quercus%20kelloggii">California black oak</a>, with an <a href="understory">understory</a> of <a href="Ceanothus%20cuneatus">buckbrush</a> and <a href="Arctostaphylos%20viscida">manzanita</a>. <a href="Pseudotsuga%20menziesii%20var.%20menziesii">Coast douglas-fir</a>, <a href="Pinus%20lambertiana">sugar pine</a>, <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pine</a>, <a href="Calocedrus%20decurrens">California incense-cedar</a>, and <a href="Abies%20concolor">white fir</a> are the most common trees found in the <a href="mixed%20coniferous%20forest">mixed coniferous forest</a>. <a href="Abies%20magnifica">Shasta red fir</a>, white fir, and the <a href="Abies%20procera">noble fir</a> grow in the higher elevations of the watershed. <a href="Tsuga%20mertensiana">Mountain hemlock</a>, <a href="Pinus%20contorta">lodgepole pine</a>, <a href="Sorbus%20sitchensis">Sitka mountain-ash</a>, and <a href="Viburnum%20edule">squashberry</a> also grow in this region. <a href="Chrysolepis">Chinquapin</a> can be found around Fish Lake. The most common species of plants above near the <a href="tree%20line">tree line</a> on Mount McLoughlin and Brown Mountain include <a href="Pinus%20albicaulis">whitebark pine</a>, mountain hemlock, <a href="Abies%20lasiocarpa">Coast Range subalpine fir</a>, <a href="Cassiope">heather</a>, and <a href="Phyllodoce%20%28plant%29">mountain heather</a>.

Many species of birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to <a href="Breeding%20in%20the%20wild">breed</a> in the chaparral region, including several species of <a href="wren">wren</a>s, <a href="New%20World%20blackbird">blackbird</a>s, and <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a>s. The mixed coniferous forest is home to <a href="white-headed%20woodpecker">white-headed woodpecker</a>s, <a href="pygmy%20nuthatch">pygmy nuthatch</a>es, <a href="green-tailed%20towhee">green-tailed towhee</a>s, <a href="northern%20pygmy-owl">northern pygmy-owl</a>s, <a href="Vaux%27s%20swift">Vaux's swift</a>s, <a href="winter%20wren">winter wren</a>s, and <a href="MacGillivray%27s%20warbler">MacGillivray's warbler</a>s.

The <a href="Near%20Threatened">near-threatened</a> <a href="olive-sided%20flycatcher">olive-sided flycatcher</a> and <a href="Cassin%27s%20finch">Cassin's finch</a> also live in this area. <a href="Eurasian%20three-toed%20woodpecker">Eurasian three-toed woodpecker</a>s and <a href="Clark%27s%20nutcracker">Clark's nutcracker</a>s have been spotted near the tree line. The <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> <a href="Townsend%27s%20big-eared%20bat">Townsend's big-eared bat</a> is known to live in the watershed.

Little Butte Creek is known to be one of the best salmon producing tributaries of the Rogue River, and is also one of only a few streams in the Upper Rogue watershed to support salmon populations. The most common <a href="anadromous%20fish">anadromous fish</a> inhabiting the creek include <a href="Chinook%20salmon">chinook</a> and <a href="coho%20salmon">coho salmon</a>, and <a href="Coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">sea-run cutthroat trout</a>. The Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast Coho Salmon <a href="Evolutionary%20Significant%20Unit">Evolutionary Significant Unit</a> is listed as <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> (2011). Coho salmon are known to <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a> in of streams in the Little Butte Creek watershed. An estimated 35,131 Coho salmon lived in the creek in 2002. Resident fish include coastal cutthroat trout, <a href="Cottidae">sculpins</a>, <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a>, and <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a>.

The Little Butte Creek area was originally settled by the <a href="Takelma">Takelma</a>, and possibly the <a href="Shasta%20people">Shasta</a> tribe of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>s. The first non-<a href="indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> settlers arrived in the Eagle Point region in 1852. Little Butte Creek was named by the early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Big Butte Creek. Due to <a href="Rogue%20River%20Wars">conflicts</a> with the <a href="Rogue%20River%20%28tribe%29">Rogue River Indians</a>, <a href="Major">Major</a> J. A. Lupton gathered 35 men from <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Oregon">Jacksonville</a> on October 8, 1855, and attacked the Native Americans near the mouth of Little Butte Creek, killing about 30 of them. Lupton was also killed, and eleven of his men were injured. On December 24 of the same year, Captain Miles Alcorn discovered and attacked a Native American camp on the north fork, killing eight. On <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, the following day, another band of Native Americans were attacked near Little Butte Creek's mouth; some fled, while the rest were either captured or killed.

By the late 1850s, the land was primarily used for <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="lumber">lumber</a> in the upper regions. A <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> was constructed on the north fork in the 1870s. In 1901, the Sunnyside Hotel was built by Alfred Howlett on the banks of the creek in Eagle Point. Eagle Point was later <a href="Municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town in the watershed. In 1917, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> ore was discovered near the confluence of South Fork Little Butte Creek and its tributary, Lost Creek. Mined <a href="Nodule%20%28geology%29">nodules</a> consisted of approximately 55 percent manganese and weighed up to . <a href="Cinnabar">Cinnabar</a> was also discovered in the area. In 1922, the <a href="Antelope%20Creek%20Bridge">Antelope Creek Covered Bridge</a> was constructed on Antelope Creek. It was moved to Little Butte Creek in Eagle Point in 1987.

Some of the water in the Little Butte Creek watershed is diverted to irrigate the <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a> and to supplement <a href="Bear%20Creek%20%28Rogue%20River%29">Bear Creek</a>, both roughly to the southwest. In the late 19th century, a large number of <a href="orchard">orchard</a>s were planted near <a href="Ashland%2C%20Oregon">Ashland</a>. They were initially irrigated by Bear Creek; however, there was not enough water to satisfy the orchards' needs. In 1898, the Fish Lake Water Company was established to solve the problem. The company proposed the enlargement of <a href="Fourmile%20Lake%20%28Oregon%29">Fourmile</a> and Fish lakes by impounding Fourmile Creek and North Fork Little Butte Creek, respectively, and connecting them via the <a href="Cascade%20Canal">Cascade Canal</a>. Construction of the temporary Fish Lake Dam began in 1902. Around this time, construction of the Joint System Canal to the west also began. Construction of Fourmile Lake Dam started in 1906, along with the Cascade Canal. A network of other small canals, such as Hopkins Canal and the Medford Canal, were also built in the Rogue Valley around this time. Fish Lake Dam was completed in 1908, creating the reservoir.

The Cascade Canal was completed in 1915, delivering about of water from Fourmile Lake in the Klamath River watershed southwest to Fish Lake in the Rogue River watershed. The temporary Fish Lake Dam was also replaced by a permanent <a href="earthfill%20dam">earthfill dam</a>. It was later modified in 1922 and 1955. In 1996 an auxiliary <a href="spillway">spillway</a> was added. The dam stands high and has a length of .

In 1956, the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">United States Bureau of Reclamation</a> awarded a contract to <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>-based Lord Brothers to build the Deadwood Tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1957. <a href="Howard%20Prairie%20Lake">Howard Prairie Lake</a> was completed in 1958, and is about east of Ashland. Excess water is diverted from the South Fork, Beaver Dam Creek, and two of its tributaries south into the Deadwood Tunnel to supplement the lake and the surrounding regions. Dead Indian Creek is also diverted into Howard Prairie Lake. About annually, or about , was diverted into the Klamath River watershed between 1962 and 1999.

The Howard Prairie Delivery Canal was completed in 1959, along with Keene Creek Reservoir, Cascade Tunnel, and Greensprings Tunnel. Water from Howard Prairie Lake is diverted into the canal west to Keene Creek Reservoir, about east of Ashland. Nearby <a href="Hyatt%20Reservoir">Hyatt Reservoir</a> also provides water. It is then piped through the mile-long Cascade Tunnel to the Greensprings Power Plant, which generates about 18 <a href="megawatt">megawatt</a>s of power. Afterward, the water is conveyed from the power plant through the Greensprings Tunnel into Emigrant Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek. An average of approximately of water flows through the tunnel. The water eventually ends up in <a href="Emigrant%20Lake%20%28Oregon%29">Emigrant Lake</a>, about southeast of Ashland, where it either continues along Bear Creek, or is diverted for irrigation.

The Butte Creek Mill, originally named Snowy Butte Mill, was built in 1872 on the banks of Little Butte Creek about from its mouth. A <a href="diversion%20dam">diversion dam</a> was built in the 1880s to provide water for the <a href="turbine">turbine</a> that powers the mill. The dam was a damaging fish barrier in the watershed. In 2005, the Rogue Basin Fish Access Team built a $250,000 concrete <a href="fish%20ladder">fish ladder</a> to allow fish to swim past the dam. A small <a href="weir">weir</a> made of boulders was built at the base of the ladder, creating a jump between the creek and the ladder; however, the boulders were washed away in a severe storm just three months later, making the distance between them over . The weir was rebuilt in 2008 for about $122,500, with concrete instead of boulders.

The mill is now included on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and is the only <a href="gristmill">gristmill</a> in Oregon to still grind <a href="flour">flour</a>. It is also the oldest water-powered gristmill west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>.

On Christmas morning, December 25, 2015, the store had a fire and was considered a total loss. There are plans to rebuild. To assist in helping with the rebuild visit their website: buttecreekmill.com.

Intense flooding occurred throughout the <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a> in 1955, and Little Butte Creek's <a href="meander">meander</a>s in the <a href="Denman%20Wildlife%20Area">Denman Wildlife Area</a> between Eagle Point and the Rogue River were blamed for severe <a href="erosion">erosion</a>. The section of the creek was subsequently bulldozed and straightened in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The straightness forced water downward instead of outward like a typical creek, scouring the <a href="stream%20bed">stream bed</a> down to <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> and creating an unsuitable habitat for wild salmon. In 2007, a plan to divert the creek back into its old meanders was proposed. The $700,000 project involved building engineered <a href="riffle">riffle</a>s and <a href="log%20jam">log jam</a>s and adding boulders, extending the creek by approximately . It was completed in September 2011.

The <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) has monitored Little Butte Creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, <a href="oxygen%20saturation">oxygen saturation</a>, <a href="pH">pH</a>, <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, chemical contaminants such as <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and metals, <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a>, and <a href="alkalinity">alkalinity</a>. Streams that exceed the standard level are then placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a>. About 40 percent of the streams in the Little Butte Creek watershed were listed on the 2002 DEQ 303d list. The entire main stem exceeded the standard level for temperature, oxygen saturation, <a href="fecal%20coliform">fecal coliform</a>s (bacteria), and turbidity. The lower of the North Fork were listed for high temperature and elevated levels of "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>", while the upper region was affected by <a href="chlorophyll%20a">chlorophyll a</a> and pH levels. The South Fork was listed for turbidity and temperature.

Overall, high temperature is the most common problem in the Little Butte Creek watershed. This is most likely caused by water diversion and depleted <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>s. Approximately 53 percent of riparian zones in the watershed are damaged due to agriculture or <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>, while 43 percent are classified as healthy. Another threat to healthy riparian zones are <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a> <a href="blackberry">blackberries</a>, which crowd out native vegetation and provide little shade. The resulting higher water temperatures can be very harmful to anadromous fish. High concentration of bacteria is also an issue.

In 2003, the Little Butte Creek Watershed Council rated the health of the Little Butte Creek watershed on a scale of 1 (slightly degraded) to 5 (severely degraded). Overall, the watershed received 2.95, or moderately degraded. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Little Butte Creek at RM 1.4 (RK 2.3) between 1998 and 2007 was 72 (poor) in the summer and 82 (fair) in the fall, winter, and spring.

The Little Butte Creek watershed contains several <a href="point%20of%20interest">points of interest</a>. Popular activities in and around Fish Lake include fishing, swimming, and boating. Two <a href="campground">campground</a>s are on the banks of the lake: Doe Point and the Fish Lake Resort. Several trails in the area lead to the much larger Pacific Crest Trail. Two <a href="snowpark">snowpark</a>s are on <a href="Oregon%20Route%20140">Oregon Route 140</a>.

The Eagle Point Golf Course is in the watershed, built in 1995 by the world-renowned <a href="golf%20course%20architect">golf course architect</a> <a href="Robert%20Trent%20Jones%2C%20Jr.">Robert Trent Jones, Jr.</a> Another course, Stone Ridge Golf Course, is near Agate Lake. The Butte Creek Mill and the Antelope and Lost Creek covered bridges are also popular attractions. Several historic structures can be found in Eagle Point, including the Eagle Point Museum, built in 1925 as the Long Mountain School, and the Walter Wood House, constructed in 1879. The <a href="Denman%20Wildlife%20Area">Denman Wildlife Area</a> is at the mouth of Little Butte Creek, as is nearby <a href="TouVelle%20State%20Recreation%20Site">TouVelle State Park</a>.

Suillus brevipes

Suillus brevipes is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Suillaceae">Suillaceae</a>. First described by American <a href="Mycology">mycologists</a> in the late 19th century, it is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the stubby-stalk or the short-stemmed slippery Jack. The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> (<a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s) produced by the fungus are characterized by a chocolate to reddish-brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> covered with a sticky layer of slime, and a short whitish <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> that has neither a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> nor prominent, colored glandular dots. The cap can reach a diameter of about , while the stipe is up to long and thick. Like other <a href="bolete">bolete</a> mushrooms, "S. brevipes" produces <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> in a vertically arranged layer of spongy tubes with openings that form a layer of small yellowish pores on the underside of the cap.

"Suillus brevipes" grows in a <a href="mycorrhizae">mycorrhizal</a> association with various species of two- and three-needled pines, especially <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole</a> and <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a>. The fungus is found throughout North America, and has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to several other countries via transplanted pines. In the <a href="ecological%20succession">succession</a> of mycorrhizal fungi associated with the regrowth of <a href="jack%20pine">jack pine</a> after <a href="clearcutting">clearcutting</a> or <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s, "S. brevipes" is a multi-stage fungus, found during all stages of tree development. The mushrooms are <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, and are high in the <a href="essential%20fatty%20acid">essential</a> fatty acid <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a>.

The species was first described scientifically as "Boletus viscosus" by American mycologist <a href="Charles%20Christopher%20Frost">Charles Frost</a> in 1874. In 1885, <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a>, who had found specimens in pine woods of <a href="Albany%20County%2C%20New%20York">Albany County, New York</a>, explained that the species name was a <a href="homonym%20%28biology%29">taxonomic homonym</a> ("<a href="Boletus%20viscosus">Boletus viscosus</a>" was already in use for another species named by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Ventenat</a> in 1863), and so renamed it to "Boletus brevipes". Its current name was assigned by German <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> in 1898. <a href="William%20Alphonso%20Murrill">William Alphonso Murrill</a> renamed it as "Rostkovites brevipes" in 1948; the genus "Rostkovites" is now considered to be <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>".

<a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a> specialist <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> included "Suillus brevipes" in the <a href="subsection%20%28botany%29">subsection</a> "Suillus" of genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>", an infrageneric (a <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> level below genus) grouping of species characterized by a cinnamon-brown <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>, and pores less than 1 mm wide. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetic">Molecular phylogenetic</a> analyses of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> sequences shows that the most closely related species to "Suillus brevipes" include "<a href="Suillus%20luteus">S. luteus</a>", "<a href="Suillus%20pseudobrevipes">S. pseudobrevipes</a>", and "<a href="Suillus%20weaverae">S. weaverae</a>" (formerly "Fuscoboletinus weaverae").

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "brevipes", meaning "short-footed". The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as the "stubby-stalk" or the "short-stemmed slippery Jack".

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is deep brown to reddish-brown, later fading to <a href="tan%20%28color%29">tan</a> with age, and it does not bruise with handling. The cap surface is smooth, and, depending on the moisture in the environment, may range from sticky to the touch to slimy. Depending on its maturity, the cap shape may range from spherical to broadly convex. The cap diameter measures , and the <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> can be peeled from the surface. The tubes are yellow, becoming olive-green with age, and they have an attachment to the stipe that ranges from <a href="wikt%3Aadnate">adnate</a> (with most of the tube fused to the stipe) to <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> (with the tubes broadly attached, but running somewhat down the length of the stipe). They are typically up to deep, and there are about 1–2 tube mouths (pores) per millimeter. The pores are pale yellow, round, 1–2 mm wide, and do not change color when bruised.

The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> is white to pale yellow, dry, solid, not bruising, and <a href="wikt%3Apruinose">pruinose</a> (having a very fine whitish powder on the surface). A characteristic feature of many "Suillus" species are the glandular dots found on the stipe—clumps of <a href="hypha">hypha</a>l cell ends through which the fungus secretes various metabolic wastes, leaving a sticky or resinous "dot". In "S. brevipes", the form of the glandular dots is variable: they may be absent, slightly underdeveloped or obscurely formed with age. The stipe is usually short in comparison to the diameter of the cap, typically long and thick. It is either of equal width throughout, or may taper downwards; its surface bears minute puncture holes at maturity, and is it slightly fibrous at the base. Collections made in New Zealand tend to have a reddish coloration at the very base of the stipe. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> of the mushroom is initially white, but turns pale yellow in age. The odor and taste are mild. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is cinnamon-brown.

The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are <a href="wikt%3Aelliptical">elliptical</a> to <a href="wikt%3Aoblong">oblong</a>, smooth, and have dimensions of 7–10 by 3–4 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The spore-bearing cells, the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, are thin-walled, club-shaped to roughly cylindrical, and measure 2–25 by 5–7 µm. They bear either two or four spores. The pleurocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> that are found on the face of a gill) are roughly cylindrical with rounded ends, thin-walled, and 40–55 by 5–8 µm. The cells often have brown contents, and in the presence of 2% <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH) will appear <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) or <a href="wine%20%28color%29">vinaceous</a> (red wine-colored); in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> they become pale yellow or brown. The cheilocystidia (cystidia found on the edge of a gill) are 30–60 by 7–10 µm, club-shaped to almost cylindrical, thin-walled, with brown incrusting material at the base, and arranged like a bundle of fibers. In KOH they appear hyaline, and are pale yellow in Melzer's reagent. Caulocystidia (found on the stipe) are 60–90 by 7–9 µm, mostly cylindrical with rounded ends, and arranged in bundles with brown <a href="pigment">pigment</a> particles at the base. The caulocystidia stain vinaceous in KOH. The <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> of the cap is made of a layer of interwoven gelatinous hyphae that are individually 2–5 µm thick; the gelatinous hyphae are responsible for the sliminess of the cuticle. There are no <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e.

Like many species of the genus "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>", "S. brevipes" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, and the mushroom is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic. <a href="Field%20guide">Field guide</a>s typically recommended to remove the slimy cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. The mushrooms are common in the diet of <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>s in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>.

The <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a> composition of "S. brevipes" fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher <a href="lipid">lipid</a> content than the stipe—18.4% of the <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a>, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a> made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a> was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a> at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid—a member of the group of <a href="essential%20fatty%20acid">essential fatty acid</a>s called <a href="omega-6%20fatty%20acid">omega-6 fatty acid</a>s—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.

Several "Suillus" species which grow under pines could be confused with "S. brevipes". "<a href="Suillus%20granulatus">S. granulatus</a>" has a longer stipe, and distinct raised granules on the stipe. "S. brevipes" is differentiated from "<a href="Suillus%20albidipes">S. albidipes</a>" by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>) at the margin when young. "<a href="Suillus%20pallidiceps">S. pallidiceps</a>" is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and "<a href="Suillus%20albivelatus">S. albivelatus</a>" has a veil. "<a href="Suillus%20pungens">S. pungens</a>" has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of "S. brevipes", and like "S. granulatus", has glandular dots on the stipe.

"Suillus brevipes" is a <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungus, and it develops a close <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> association with the roots of various tree species, especially <a href="pine">pine</a>. The underground <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> form a sheath around the tree rootlets, and the fungal hyphae penetrate between the <a href="cortex%20%28botany%29">cortical</a> cells of the root, forming <a href="mycorrhiza%23Types%20of%20mycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizae</a>. In this way, the fungus can supply the tree with minerals, while the tree reciprocates by supplying <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s created by <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. In nature, it associates with two- and three-needle pines, especially <a href="Lodgepole%20Pine">lodgepole</a> and <a href="ponderosa%20pine">ponderosa pine</a>. Under controlled laboratory conditions, the fungus has been shown to form ectomycorrhizae with ponderosa, lodgepole, <a href="Loblolly%20Pine">loblolly</a>, <a href="Eastern%20White%20Pine">eastern white</a>, <a href="Patula%20Pine">patula</a>, <a href="Pond%20Pine">pond</a>, <a href="Radiata%20Pine">radiata</a>, and <a href="red%20pine">red pine</a>s. "<a href="In%20vitro">In vitro</a>" mycorrhizal associations formed with non-pine species include <a href="Pacific%20madrone">Pacific madrone</a>, <a href="Arctostaphylos%20uva-ursi">bearberry</a>, <a href="western%20larch">western larch</a>, <a href="Sitka%20spruce">Sitka spruce</a>, and <a href="coast%20Douglas-fir">coast Douglas-fir</a>. Fungal growth is inhibited by the presence of high levels of the <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> (350 <a href="parts%20per%20million">ppm</a>), <a href="lead">lead</a> (200 ppm), and <a href="nickel">nickel</a> (20 ppm).

During the regrowth of pine trees after disturbance like <a href="clearcutting">clearcutting</a> or <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>, there appears an orderly sequence of mycorrhizal fungi as one species is replaced by another. A study on the <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> of ectomycorrhizal fungi in Canadian <a href="jack%20pine">jack pine</a> forests following wildfire concluded that "S. brevipes" is a multi-stage fungus. It appears relatively early during tree development; fruit bodies were common in 6-year-old tree stands, and the fungus colonized the highest proportion of root tips. The fungus persists throughout the life of the tree, having been found in tree stands that were 41, 65, and 122 years old. There is, however, a relative reduction in the prevalence of the fungus with increasing stand age, which may be attributed to increased competition from other fungi, and a change in habitat brought about by closure of the <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">forest canopy</a>. Generally, "S. brevipes" responds favorably to <a href="silviculture">silvicultural</a> practices such as thinning and clearcutting. A 1996 study demonstrated that fruit bodies increased in abundance as the severity of disturbance increased. It has been suggested that the thick-walled, wiry <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s produced by the fungus may serve as an adaptation that helps it to survive and remain viable for a period of time following disturbance.

"Suillus brevipes" grows singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground in late summer and autumn. A common—and sometimes abundant—mushroom, it occurs over most of North America (including Hawaii), south to Mexico, and north to Canada. This species has been found in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> growing under planted "<a href="Pinus%20caribaea">Pinus caribaea</a>", where it is thought to have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> inadvertently from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> by the <a href="USDA%20Forest%20Service">USDA Forest Service</a> in 1955. Other introductions have also occurred in exotic pine plantations in Argentina, India, New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan.

Japanese battleship Tosa

Designed by <a href="Yuzuru%20Hiraga">Yuzuru Hiraga</a>, "Tosa" was intended to be part of a Japanese "Eight-four fleet", comprising eight battleships and four battlecruisers, the successor to the proposed "<a href="Eight-eight%20fleet">Eight-eight fleet</a>". "Tosa" and her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> were intended to be the second set of high-speed battleships (after the ) under the plan, and were approved for construction in the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet's</a> 14 July 1917 warship-building authorization. Engineering blueprints for the two ships were completed by Japanese naval engineers in 1919. Based on Japanese studies of the British experience at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, the ships were to include new features over previous designs, including higher steaming speed despite increased tonnage, flush decks, and inclined armor.

"Tosa" was <a href="Keel">laid down</a> on 16 February 1920 by <a href="Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a> in <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>. She utilized the same <a href="slipway">slipway</a> where, two decades later, the would be built. "Tosa" was originally scheduled to be <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> in October 1921, but multiple <a href="Strike%20action">strikes</a> delayed it until November. Ultimately, the battleship was not launched until 18 December 1921, two months behind schedule. <a href="Fitting-out">Fitting-out</a> commenced soon after with a projected completion date of July 1922. However, work on "Tosa" was halted on 5 February 1922, one day before Japan signed the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. Under the terms of the treaty, construction of "Tosa" and "Kaga" was formally canceled on 5 May 1922.

In August 1922, "Tosa" was moved to <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>, still incomplete. Fifty thousand people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s for the 406 mm (16 inch) guns were in place, but no <a href="gun%20turret">turrets</a> or weapons had been mounted, so the holes in the main deck were covered with a <a href="mesh">mesh</a>-like material. Her <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> was finished, and a superstructure deck, <a href="Bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge deck</a> and <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had been fitted, along with a light signal <a href="Mast%20%28sailing%29">mast</a> directly <a href="aft">aft</a> of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and <a href="bridge%20wing">bridge wing</a>s. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small <a href="Chimney">funnel</a> was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.

"Tosa" remained in Kure until mid-1924. <a href="wikt%3Astricken">Stricken</a> on 1 April 1924, the ship—with her hull virtually finished—was designated for use in testing the effectiveness of shells and torpedoes against its armor arrangements. As a result, in June 1924 the navy's gunnery school took possession of the hull and prepared it for testing.

During 6–13 June, "Tosa" was subjected to five explosions. The first involved a <a href="Mk.%20I%20mine">Mk. I mine</a> placed on the <a href="starboard">starboard</a> side of the ship, below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a> at <a href="frame%20%28nautical%29">frame 57</a>. The resultant explosion ruptured about of hull, while dishing in another of plating. Flooding took 23 compartments within the ship, 17 quickly and five slowly; a total of of water entered the ship, increasing the ship's <a href="List%20%28watercraft%29">list</a> to starboard by about ° 54'.

The second and fifth test charges (8 and 13 June) were both placed near the fore <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>. Involving larger charges than the first—about (a <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Technical%20Department%236th%20Year%20Type%20Torpedo">6th year type torpedo</a>) and (a <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Technical%20Department%239th%20year%20type%20mine">9th year type mine</a>)—they were both placed at frame 87: the second to port and below the waterline, the fifth to starboard and below. Both broached the side protection system—allowing 1,008 and 726 long tons (1,024 and 738 t) of water, respectively, to enter the ship—showing that the usual three-compartment, all-void system used in most Japanese battleships was an insufficient defense against modern torpedoes. The list incurred during test two was a ° 16' change, resulting in a port list of ° 36'; for test five these numbers were ° 38' and a starboard list of ° 48'.

Similar to two and five, tests three and four were conducted at the same frame (192) but on opposite sides. Frame 192 was in the middle of the ship, where the ship's protection system was designed to be the strongest. Test three (8 June) was a <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%20Technical%20Department%238th%20Year%20Type%20Torpedo%20%281919%29">8th year type torpedo</a> on the starboard side at a depth of under the ship's waterline; four (12 June) was a torpedo to port, below the waterline. The tests ruptured 15 and 26 m (160 and 280 sq ft), dished in 160 and 110 m (1,700 and 1,200 sq ft) of plating, and allowed 1,203 and 1,160 long tons (1,222 and 1,180 t) of water to enter the ship. Test three allowed the most water in out of all of the tests and, as a result, the list was altered from a previous port-side ° 51' to a starboard-side ° 22'—a change of ° 13'. Test four went from a starboard ° 0' to a port ° 20'.

Further tests included the explosion of several Type 8 torpedoes filled with 300–346 kg (660–760 lbs) of <a href="picric%20acid">picric acid</a> within "Tosa"s designed magazine for them, which was located forward of the first turret and had been considered a weak point in previous battleship designs. This caused "extreme structural damage above the waterline" to "Tosa", and confirmed that any problem in that part of the ship could seriously harm it. Possible solutions included the installation of additional armor over the room or the use of walls on one side of the magazine that would be <a href="blowout%20panel">blown out and away</a> from the ship in the event of any serious explosion inside. This would have the effect of focusing the explosion outside, minimizing structural damage to the ship itself. Another test involved the explosion of of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a> away from the side of the ship.

Another test conducted somewhere around this time involved a gun firing a shell at "Tosa". It fell about short of the ship, but continued through the water and struck the ship near frame 228, below the designed <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. The result was disturbing, as the shell was able to pass through the armor and explode in the port engine room. As a result, of water was let in, and "Tosa"s list was increased from ° 53' to ° 06'.

Results of the tests on "Tosa" were subsequently used in the refitting and reconstruction of existing warships. Lessons learned were also incorporated into the designs of the two super-battleships ten years later. In the latter, this meant that the side <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a> was continued below the <a href="waterline">waterline</a> and beneath the <a href="torpedo%20bulge">torpedo bulge</a> so that the class would have a defense against underwater shells.

For the next few months, "Tosa" was given to the Hiroshima gunnery school for use as a target. On 14 January 1925, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Navy%20of%20Japan">Navy Ministry of Japan</a> ordered "Tosa" to be <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> within one month's time. To ensure this, the Commander in Chief of the <a href="Kure%20Naval%20District">Kure Naval District</a> directed that preparations for scuttling the ship be completed by 1 February. It was planned that "Tosa" would be scuttled on or before 10 February after being towed by the former battleship to a location south of the <a href="Mizunokojima%20Lighthouse">Mizunokojima Lighthouse</a> and west of <a href="Okinoshima%2C%20K%C5%8Dchi">Okinoshima Island</a> (located southwest of the present-day <a href="K%C5%8Dchi%20Prefecture">Kōchi Prefecture</a>). Later that month, the United States <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Intelligence">Office of Naval Intelligence</a> reported that "work on the dismantling of ["Tosa"] has been going on at the Kure Navy Yard and everything possible has been removed. The intention is to fill her hull with sand and gravel, tow her out to deep water near the entrance to Kure, open her sea cocks, and send her to the bottom."
"Tosa" was brought from Kure on 3 February to <a href="Saiki%20Bay">Saiki Bay</a> in the <a href="Bungo%20Channel">Bungo Channel</a>. She was then towed from the bay on the 6th with the intention of bringing the battleship to the designated sinking spot, but were thwarted by a strong storm and returned. A second attempt was made at 10:00 on the 8th. Explosive "mines" were embarked: two shells were placed inside "Tosa"s <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a>, and two containers with of <a href="Shimose%20powder">Shimose powder</a> in each were put into the engine room on the port side. They would be detonated using electrical fuses, though time fuses were also fitted for use if the sea was calm. The explosives were triggered on the 8th, but they failed, so a contingent was sent aboard "Tosa" on the 9th; they opened six <a href="Kingston%20valve">Kingston valve</a>s in the engine room at about 01:25. Soon after, "Tosa" slowly began to sink by the stern and to starboard. By 03:50, the rate increased, and the ship slipped beneath the waves by 07:00. "Tosa" was the tenth and final Japanese capital ship sunk or <a href="ship%20breaking">scrapped</a> to comply with the naval treaty's stipulations.

Dendrocollybia

Dendrocollybia is a fungal <a href="genus">genus</a> in the family <a href="Tricholomataceae">Tricholomataceae</a> of the order <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>. It is a <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus, containing the single species Dendrocollybia racemosa, <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the branched Collybia or the branched shanklet. The somewhat rare species is found in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, including the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of western North America, and Europe, where it is included in several <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Regional Red List</a>s. It usually grows on the decaying <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of other <a href="agaric">agaric</a>s—such as "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>" and "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>"—although the <a href="host%20%28biology%29">host</a> mushrooms may be decayed to the point of being difficult to recognize.

"Dendrocollybia racemosa" fruit bodies have small pale grayish-white or grayish-brown <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> up to wide, and thin <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> up to long. The species is characterized by its unusual stem, which is covered with short lateral branches. The branches often produce spherical slimeheads of translucent <a href="conidium">conidiophores</a> on their swollen tips. The conidiophores produce conidia (asexual <a href="spore">spore</a>s) by <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>. Because the fungus can rely on either <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual</a> or <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual</a> modes of reproduction, fruit bodies sometimes have reduced or even missing caps. The unusual stems originate from black pea-sized structures called <a href="sclerotium">sclerotia</a>. The <a href="teleomorph%2C%20anamorph%20and%20holomorph">anamorphic</a> form of the fungus, known as "<a href="Tilachlidiopsis">Tilachlidiopsis</a> racemosa", is missing the sexual stage of its <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>. It can reproduce at relatively low temperatures, an adaptation believed to improve its ability to grow quickly and fruit on decomposing mushrooms.

The genus "Dendrocollybia" was first described in 2001, to accommodate the species previously known as "Collybia racemosa". Before then, the so-named <a href="taxon">taxon</a> was considered to be one of four species of "<a href="Collybia">Collybia</a>", a genus which had itself been redefined and reduced in 1997, when most of its species were transferred to "<a href="Gymnopus">Gymnopus</a>" and "<a href="Rhodocollybia">Rhodocollybia</a>". "C. racemosa" was originally described and named "Agaricus racemosus" by <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1797, and <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> under that name by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> in 1821. In his "<a href="Systema%20Mycologicum">Systema Mycologicum</a>", Fries <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> it in his "tribe" "Collybia" along with all other similar small, white-spored species with a convex cap and a fragile stem. In 1873 <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> raised Fries' tribe "Collybia" to generic rank. <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> called the species "Mycena racemosa" in his 1821 "Natural Arrangement of British Plants"; both this name and Joanne Lennox's 1979 "Microcollybia racemosa" are considered <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a>.

<a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>'s fourth edition (1986) of his comprehensive "Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy" included "Collybia racemosa" in <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Collybia", in addition to the three species that currently comprise the genus "Collybia": "<a href="Collybia%20tuberosa">C. tuberosa</a>", "<a href="Collybia%20cirrhata">C. cirrhata</a>" and "<a href="Collybia%20cookei">C. cookei</a>". A <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis of the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> sequences of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that "C. tuberosa", "C. cirrhata" and "C. cookei" form a <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group within a larger "Lyophyllum"–"Tricholoma"–"Collybia" <a href="clade">clade</a> that includes several species of "<a href="Lyophyllum">Lyophyllum</a>", "<a href="Tricholoma">Tricholoma</a>", "<a href="Lepista">Lepista</a>", "<a href="Hypsizygus">Hypsizygus</a>" and the species "C. racemosa". Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of "Collybia". <a href="Restriction%20fragment%20length%20polymorphism">Restriction fragment length polymorphism</a> analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ation, and <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">macrochemical reactions</a>, they circumscribed the new genus "Dendrocollybia" to contain "C. racemosa".

The fungus is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the branched Collybia, or the branched shanklet; Samuel Gray referred to it as the "racemelike high-stool". The genus name "Dendrocollybia" is a combination of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "dendro"-, meaning "tree", and "collybia", meaning "small coin". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "racemosa" is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "racemus"—"a cluster of grapes".

The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of "Dendrocollybia racemosa" is typically between in diameter, and depending on its stage of development, may be conic to convex, or in maturity, somewhat flattened with a slight rounded central elevation (an <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a>). The cap surface is dry and opaque, with a silky texture; its color in the center is <a href="wikt%3Afuscous">fuscous</a> (a dusky brownish-gray color), but the color fades uniformly towards the margin. The margin is usually curved toward the <a href="lamellae%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> initially; as the fruit body matures the edge may roll out somewhat, but it also has a tendency to fray or split with age. There may be shallow grooves on the cap that correspond to the position of the gills underneath, which may give the cap edge a <a href="wikt%3Acrenate">crenate</a> (scalloped) appearance. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is very thin (less than 1 mm thick) and fragile, lacking in color, and has no distinctive odor or taste. The gills are relatively broad, narrowly attached to the stem (<a href="wikt%3Aadnexed">adnexed</a>), spaced closely together, and colored gray to grayish-<a href="tan%20%28color%29">tan</a>, somewhat darker than the cap. There are additional gills, called "lamellulae", that do not extend all the way to the stem; they are interspersed between the gills and arranged in up to three series (tiers) of equal length. Occasionally, the fungus produces stems with aborted caps, or with the caps missing entirely.

The <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is long by 1 mm thick, roughly equal in width throughout, and tapers to a long "root" which terminates in a dull black, roughly spherical <a href="sclerotium">sclerotium</a>. The stem may be buried deeply in its <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. The stem surface is roughly the same color as the cap, with a fine whitish powder on the upper surface. In the lower portion, the stem is brownish, and has fine grooves that run lengthwise up and down the surface. The lower half is covered with irregularly arranged short branch-like protuberances at right angles to the stem that measure 2–3 by 0.5 mm. These projections are cylindrical and tapering, with ends that are covered with a slime head of <a href="conidium">conidia</a> (fungal spores produced <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexually</a>). "D. racemosa" is the only mushroom species known that forms conidia on side branches of the stem. The sclerotium from which the stem arises is watery grayish and homogeneous in cross section (not divided into internal chambers), with a thin dull black outer coat, and measures in diameter. American mycologist <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> cautioned that novice collectors will typically miss the sclerotium the first time they find the species. The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of "D. racemosa" is unknown, but as <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> says, the fruit bodies are "much too puny and rare to be of value."

The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are narrowly <a href="wikt%3Aellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> to <a href="wikt%3Aovoid">ovoid</a>, thin-walled, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), with dimensions of 4–5.5 by 2–3 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. When <a href="staining">stained</a> with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>, the spores turn a light blue color. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (the spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, measure 16–20 by 3.5–4 µm, and taper gradually towards the base. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are not differentiated in this species. The cap surface is made of a <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> of radial, somewhat <a href="wikt%3Aagglutinate">agglutinated</a>, rather coarse <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e that differ chiefly in size from the underlying tissue—initially 1–3 µm in diameter, becoming 5–7 µm wide in the underlying tissue. The hyphae are <a href="clamp%20connection">clamped</a>, and encrusted with shallow irregularly shaped masses that are most conspicuous in the surface cells. The gill tissue is made of hyphae that project downward from the cap and arranged in a subparallel fashion, meaning that the hyphae are mostly parallel to one another and are slightly intertwined. The hyphae are clamped, with a narrow, branched compact subhymenium (a narrow zone of small, short hyphae immediately beneath the hymenium) composed of hyphae 2–3 µm in diameter. The <a href="conidia">conidia</a> are 8.5–12 by 4–5 µm, peanut-shaped, non-<a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a> (not changing color when stained with Melzer's reagent), clamped, and produced by fragmentation of the coarse <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a>. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present in the hyphae. Asexual spores are 10.0–15.5 by 3–4 µm, ellipsoid to <a href="wikt%3Aoblong">oblong</a>, non-amyloid, and contain <a href="granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granular</a> contents. The grayish color of the fruit bodies is caused by encrusted pigments (crystalline aggregates of pigment molecules, possibly <a href="melanin">melanin</a>) that occur throughout the tissue of the stem and cap, including the gills; these pigments are absent in "Collybia" species.
In contrast to the three species of "Collybia", "D. racemosa" shows negligible reactivity to common <a href="chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests used in mushroom identification</a>, including <a href="aniline">aniline</a>, <a href="1-Naphthol">alpha-napthol</a>, <a href="guaiacol">guaiacol</a>, <a href="sulfoformol">sulfoformol</a>, <a href="phenol">phenol</a>, and <a href="phenol-aniline">phenol-aniline</a>.

The cortex (outer tissue layer) of the sclerotium can be used as a diagnostic character to distinguish between "D. racemosa" and small white specimens of "Collybia". The hyphae of the cortex of "D. racemosa" are "markedly angular", in comparison with "C. cookei" (rounded hyphae) and "C. tuberosa" (elongated hyphae). The cortical layer in "D. racemosa" has an arrangement that is known as "textura epidermoidea"—with the hyphae arranged like a jigsaw puzzle. Heavy deposits of dark reddish-brown pigment are evident throughout the cortical tissue in or on the walls and the tips of hyphae. The remaining "Collybia" species, "C. cirrhata", does not form sclerotia.

The anamorphic or <a href="fungi%20imperfecti">imperfect fungi</a> are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>, and typically reproduce by the process of <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> in <a href="conidium">conidia</a>. In some cases, the sexual stage—or <a href="teleomorph%2C%20anamorph%20and%20holomorph">teleomorph</a> stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. "<a href="Tilachlidiopsis">Tilachlidiopsis</a> racemosa" (formerly known as "Sclerostilbum septentrionale", described by <a href="Alfred%20Povah">Alfred Povah</a> in 1932) was shown to be the anamorphic form of "Dendrocollybia racemosa". The <a href="synnemata">synnemata</a> (reproductive structures made of compact groups of erect <a href="conidiophore">conidiophore</a>s) produced by "T. racemosa" always grow on the stem of "Dendrocollybia racemosa". The anamorph has an unusually low optimum growth temperature, between , within a larger growth range of . It is thought this is an adaptation that allows the <a href="mycelia">mycelium</a> to grow quickly and enhance its chances of fruiting on agaric mushrooms, which are generally short-lived.

"Dendrocollybia racemosa" is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species, meaning it derives nutrients by breaking down dead or dying tissue. Its fruit bodies grow on the well-decayed remains of <a href="agaric">agaric</a>s, often suspected to be "<a href="Lactarius">Lactarius</a>" or "<a href="Russula">Russula</a>", although the hosts' identities are often unclear due to an advanced state of decay. A 2006 study used <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis to confirm "<a href="Russula%20crassotunicata">Russula crassotunicata</a>" as a host for "D. racemosa". This "Russula" has a long and persistent decay period, and, in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of the United States where the study was conducted, provides a "nearly year-round substrate for mycosaprobic species". "Dendrocollybia" is one of four agaric genera obligately associated with growth on the fruit bodies of other fungi, the others being "<a href="Squamanita">Squamanita</a>", "<a href="Asterophora">Asterophora</a>", and "Collybia". "Dendrocollybia" is also found less commonly in deep coniferous <a href="forest%20floor">duff</a>, in groups or small clusters. The fungus can form sclerotia in the mummified host fruit bodies, and may also develop directly from their sclerotia in soil. The fungus is widely distributed in <a href="temperate">temperate</a> regions of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, but rarely collected "probably due to its small size, camouflage color, and tendency to be immersed in its substrate." In North America, where the distribution is restricted to the Pacific Northwest, fruit bodies are found in the late summer to autumn, often after a heavy fruiting period for other mushrooms is over. In Europe, it is known from the United Kingdom, <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, and Belgium. "Dendrocollybia racemosa" is in the Danish, Norwegian, and British <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Red List</a>s.

The saprobic behaviors of "Collybia" and "Dendrocollybia" are slightly different. In the autumn, fruit bodies of "C. cirrhata", "C. cookei" and "C. tuberosa", can be found on blackened, leathery, mummified fruit bodies of their hosts. Sometimes, these species appear to be growing in the soil (or from their sclerotium in soil or <a href="moss">moss</a>), but usually not in huge clusters. In these cases it is assumed that the hosts are remnants of fruit bodies from a previous season. In all observed cases of "D. racemosa", however, the hosts have not been readily observed, suggesting that rapid digestion of the host (rather than mummification) may have taken place. Hughes and colleagues suggest that this may indicate the presence of a different enzymatic system, and a differing ability to compete with other fungi or bacteria.

Sega v. Accolade

Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), is a <a href="Legal%20case">case</a> in which the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> applied American <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> law to the <a href="reverse%20engineering">reverse engineering</a> of <a href="computer%20software">computer software</a>. Stemming from the publishing of several <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> <a href="video%20games">games</a> by video game publisher <a href="Accolade%20%28company%29">Accolade</a>, which had disassembled Genesis software in order to publish games without being licensed by <a href="Sega">Sega</a>, the case involved several overlapping issues, including the scope of <a href="copyright">copyright</a>, permissible uses for <a href="trademark">trademark</a>s, and the scope of the <a href="fair%20use">fair use</a> doctrine for computer code.

The case was filed in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California">U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California</a>, which ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction against Accolade preventing them from publishing any more games for the Genesis and requiring them to recall all the existing Genesis games they had for sale. Accolade appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit on the grounds that their reverse engineering of the Genesis was protected under fair use. The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order and ruled that Accolade's use of reverse engineering to publish Genesis titles was protected under fair use, and that its alleged violation of Sega trademarks was the fault of Sega. The case is frequently cited in matters involving reverse engineering and fair use under copyright law.

In March 1984, <a href="Sega">Sega Enterprises Ltd.</a> was purchased by its former <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a>, <a href="David%20Rosen%20%28business%29">David Rosen</a>, along with a group of backers. <a href="Hayao%20Nakayama">Hayao Nakayama</a>, one of these backers, was named the new CEO of Sega. Following the crash of the arcade industry, Nakayama decided to focus development efforts on the <a href="Video%20game%20console">home console</a> market. During this time, Sega became concerned about <a href="Copyright%20infringement">software and hardware piracy</a> in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, and particularly in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. Taiwan was not a signatory of the <a href="Berne%20Convention%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Literary%20and%20Artistic%20Works">Berne Convention</a> on copyright, limiting Sega's legal options in that region. However, Taiwan did allow prosecution for <a href="trademark%20infringement">trademark infringement</a>. Though Sega had created security systems in their consoles to keep their software from being pirated and to keep unlicensed publishers out, much like its competitor <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, counterfeiters had discovered ways to prevent the Sega trademark from appearing on their games, bypassing the trademark altogether.

After the release of the Sega Genesis in 1989, video game publisher <a href="Accolade%20%28company%29">Accolade</a> began exploring options to release some of their <a href="PC%20game">PC game</a> titles onto the console. At the time, however, Sega had a licensing deal in place for <a href="Video%20game%20developers%23Third-party%20developers">third-party developers</a> that increased the costs to the developer. According to Accolade co-founder <a href="Alan%20Miller%20%28game%20designer%29">Alan Miller</a>, "One pays them between $10 and $15 per cartridge on top of the real hardware manufacturing costs, so it about doubles the cost of goods to the independent publisher." In addition to this, Sega required that it would be the exclusive publisher of Accolade's games if Accolade were to be licensed, preventing Accolade from releasing its games to other systems. To get around licensing, Accolade chose to seek an alternative way to bring their games to the Genesis by purchasing a console in order to decompile the <a href="executable">executable</a> code of three Genesis games and use it to program their new cartridges in a way that would allow them to disable the security lockouts that prevented playing of unlicensed games. This was done successfully to bring "" to the Genesis in 1990. In doing so, Accolade had also copied Sega's copyrighted game code multiple times in order to reverse engineer the software of Sega's licensed Genesis games.

As a result of the piracy and unlicensed development issues, Sega incorporated a technical protection mechanism into a new edition of the Genesis released in 1990, referred to as the Genesis III. This new variation of the Genesis included code known as the Trademark Security System (TMSS), which, when a game cartridge was inserted into the console, would check for the presence of the <a href="String%20%28computer%20science%29">string</a> "SEGA" at a particular point in the memory contained in the cartridge. If and only if the string was present, the console would run the game, and would briefly display the message: "PRODUCED BY OR UNDER LICENSE FROM SEGA ENTERPRISES LTD." This system had a twofold effect: it added extra protection against unlicensed developers and software piracy, and it forced the Sega trademark to display when the game was powered up, making a lawsuit for trademark infringement possible if unlicensed software were to be developed. Accolade learned of this development at the <a href="International%20CES">Winter Consumer Electronics Show</a> in January 1991, at which Sega showed the new Genesis III and demonstrated it screening and rejecting an "Ishido" game cartridge. With more games planned for the following year, Accolade successfully identified the TMSS file. They later added this file to the games "<a href="HardBall%21">HardBall!</a>", "<a href="Star%20Control">Star Control</a>", "Mike Ditka Power Football", and "<a href="Turrican">Turrican</a>".

On October 31, 1991, Sega filed suit against Accolade in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on charges of trademark infringement and <a href="unfair%20competition">unfair competition</a> in violation of the <a href="Lanham%20Act">Lanham Act</a>. Copyright infringement, a violation of the <a href="Copyright%20Act%20of%201976">Copyright Act of 1976</a>, was added a month later to the list of charges. In response, Accolade filed a counterclaim for falsifying the source of its games by displaying the Sega trademark when the game was powered up. The case was heard by Judge <a href="Barbara%20A.%20Caulfield">Barbara A. Caulfield</a>.

Sega argued that Accolade had infringed upon its copyrights because Accolade's games contained Sega's material. Accolade insisted that their use of Sega's material constituted fair use. However, Judge Caulfield did not accept this explanation since Accolade was a game manufacturer, their works were for financial gain, and because their works competed directly with Sega's licensed games, likely resulting in a sales decrease for Sega's games. Accolade's case was further hurt by a presentation by a Sega engineer named Takeshi Nagashima, who showed two Sega game cartridges that were able to run on the Genesis III without the trademark-displaying TMSS, and offered them to Accolade's defense team but would not reveal how that was possible. Ultimately, this would result in Accolade's defeat on April 3, 1992, when Judge Caulfield ruled in favor of Sega and issued an injunction prohibiting future sales by Accolade of Genesis-compatible games incorporating the Sega message or using the results of the reverse engineering. Almost a week later, Accolade was also required by the court to recall all of their Genesis-compatible games.

The decision in the district court ruling had been very costly to Accolade. According to Accolade co-founder Alan Miller, "Just to fight the injunction, we had to pay at least half a million dollars in legal fees." On April 14, 1992, Accolade filed for a stay on the injunction pending appeal in the district court, but when the court did not rule by April 21, Accolade appealed the verdict to the Ninth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals. A stay was granted on the mandate to recall all of Accolade's Genesis games, but the injunction preventing further reverse engineering and development of Genesis software was maintained until August 28, when the Ninth Circuit ordered it dissolved pending the appeal review.

In support of the appeal, the <a href="Computer%20%26amp%3B%20Communications%20Industry%20Association">Computer & Communications Industry Association</a> submitted an "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" brief claiming that the district court had made errors in concluding that Accolade had infringed upon Sega's copyright by reverse engineering its software, extending <a href="copyright">copyright</a> protection to <a href="Modus%20operandi">method of operation</a>, and failing to consider whether Accolade's games were substantially similar to Sega's copyrighted material. Amicus briefs were also submitted by the American Committee for Interoperable Systems, the <a href="Computer%20and%20Business%20Equipment%20Manufacturers%20Association">Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association</a>, and copyright law professor <a href="Dennis%20S.%20Karjala">Dennis S. Karjala</a> from <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a>.

In reviewing the case, the court considered several factors in its own analysis, examining trademark and copyright issues separately. As in the district court trial, Nagashima showed the court a game cartridge that ran on the Genesis that did not display the trademark logo. However, the court was not moved by this, deciding that Nagashima's cartridges showed what one could do with knowledge of the TMSS, which Accolade did not possess. According to the court, because knowledge of how to avoid displaying the trademark on the Genesis III was not information that was public to the industry, Sega's attempt to prove that the display of their trademark was not required for games to be played on the console was insufficient. Writing for the opinion of the court, Judge <a href="Stephen%20Reinhardt">Stephen Reinhardt</a> stated, "Sega knowingly risked two significant consequences: the false labeling of some competitors' products and the discouraging of other competitors from manufacturing Genesis-compatible games. Under the Lanham Act, the former conduct, at least, is clearly unlawful." The court then went on to cite "<a href="History%20of%20the%20board%20game%20Monopoly%23Anti-Monopoly%2C%20Inc.%20vs.%20General%20Mills%20Fun%20Group%2C%20Inc.%20court%20case%201976%E2%80%931985">Anti-Monopoly v. General Mills Fun Group</a>", which states in reference to the Lanham Act, "The trademark is misused if it serves to limit competition in the manufacture and sales of a product. That is the special province of the limited monopolies provided pursuant to the patent laws." The judges in the case had decided that Sega had violated this provision of the act by utilizing its trademark to limit competition for software for its console.

To determine the status of Accolade's claim of fair use of Sega's copyrighted game code, the court reviewed four criteria of fair use: the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount of the copyrighted work used, the purpose of use, and the effects of use on the market for the work. Of note to the judges in reviewing Sega's copyright claim was the difference in size between the TMSS file and the sizes of Accolade's games. As noted by Judge Reinhardt in writing the opinion of the court, the TMSS file "contains approximately twenty to twenty-five bytes of data. Each of Accolade's games contains a total of 500,000 to 1,500,000 <a href="byte">byte</a>s. According to Accolade employees, the header file is the only portion of Sega's code that Accolade copied into its own game programs." This made the games overwhelmingly original content, and according to Judge Reinhardt, to the benefit of the public to be able to compete with Sega's licensed games, especially if the games were dissimilar as contended in the appeal. The court did not accept the argument that Accolade's games competed directly with Sega's, noting that there was no proof that any of Accolade's published games had diminished the market for any of Sega's games. Despite claims from Sega's attorneys that the company had invested much time and effort into developing the Genesis, and that Accolade was capitalizing on this time and energy, the court rejected these claims under the notion that the console was largely functional, and its functional principles were not protected under the Copyright Act of 1976. On the matter of reverse engineering as a process, the court concluded that "where disassembly is the only way to gain access to the ideas and functional elements embodied in a copyrighted computer program and where there is a legitimate reason for seeking such access, disassembly is a fair use of the copyrighted work, as a matter of law."

On August 28, 1992, the Ninth Circuit overturned the district court's verdict and ruled that Accolade's decompilation of the Sega software constituted fair use. The court's written opinion followed on October 20 and noted that the use of the software was non-exploitative, despite being commercial, and that the trademark infringement, being required by the TMSS for a Genesis game to run on the system, was inadvertently triggered by a fair use act and the fault of Sega for causing false labeling. As a result of the verdict being overturned, the costs of the appeal were assessed to Sega. The injunction remained in force, however, because Sega petitioned the appeals court to rehear the case.

On January 8, 1993, with Sega's petition for a rehearing still pending, the court took the unusual step of amending its October 20, 1992 opinion and lifted the injunction preventing Accolade from developing or selling Genesis software. This was followed by a formal denial of Sega's petition for a rehearing on January 26. As Accolade's counterclaim for false labeling under the Lanham Act was declined by the Ninth Circuit, this essentially left "each party as free to act as it was before the issuance of preliminary injunctive relief" while the district court considered the counterclaim. Sega and Accolade ultimately settled on April 30, 1993. As a part of this settlement, Accolade became an official licensee of Sega, and later developed and released "<a href="Barkley%20Shut%20Up%20and%20Jam%21">Barkley Shut Up and Jam!</a>" while under license. The terms of the licensing, including whether or not any special arrangements or discounts were made to Accolade, were not released to the public. The financial terms of the settlement were also not disclosed, although both companies agreed to pay their own legal costs.

In an official statement, Sega of America chairman David Rosen expressed satisfaction with the settlement. According to Rosen, "This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also turned a corner in our association with Accolade and now look forward to a healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future." Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and <a href="Game%20Gear">Game Gear</a> systems throughout the world." Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.

"Sega v. Accolade" has been an influential case in matters involving reverse engineering of software and copyright infringement, and has been cited in numerous cases since 1993. The case has redefined how reverse engineering with unlicensed products is seen in legal issues involving copyright. Legally, the decision concurred that the nature of Accolade's work in reverse engineering the Sega Genesis was to access ideas that were deemed unprotected by copyright law, and could only be accessed by decompiling. By the verdict, the console's functional principles were established not to be protected by copyright, and that when no other means were available, reverse engineering the copyrighted software to access information about the console's functional principles is protected by the fair use doctrine. One such example of the <a href="precedent">precedent</a> set by this case is "<a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Connectix%20Corporation">Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation</a>", which cited "Sega v. Accolade" in deciding that reverse engineering the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">Sony PlayStation</a> <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> was protected by fair use and was non-exploitative.

Among the influences of the verdict include "Sega v. Accolade"'s effect on the criteria for fair use and the responsibilities of trademark holders in legal examinations. Although Accolade had copied entire Genesis games in order to identify the TMSS, the court gave little weight to the criterion on the amount of the copyrighted work being copied, in light of the fact that Accolade had done so in order to create their own compatible software. Likewise, the nature of the work was also given less weight, essentially establishing a two-factor approach to evaluating fair use in the purpose of use and impact on the market. It was also the first time that the Lanham Act was interpreted to mean that confusion resulting from the placement of one's trademark on another work by means of a security program is the fault of the original registrant of the trademark.

"Sega v. Accolade" also served to help establish that the functional principles of computer software cannot be protected by copyright law. Rather, the only legal protection to such principles can be through holding a <a href="patent">patent</a> or by trade secret. This aspect of the verdict has received criticism as well, citing that though the functional principles are not protectable under copyright law, the TMSS code is protectable, and that by allowing reverse engineering as fair use despite this security, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has encouraged the copying of legally protected programs for the exploration of unprotected functionality.

Discharged from the Permanent Air Force at the end of the war, Waddy took a commission in the RAAF Reserve, leading the organisation as a <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in the early 1950s. He was active in business and in veterans' groups, and was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1955. As the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Division%29">Liberal</a> <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Kirribilli">Member for Kirribilli</a> from 1962 to 1976, he held cabinet posts in the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Parliament">New South Wales Parliament</a>, including Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare (later Youth and Community Services), <a href="Minister%20for%20Health%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Health</a>, and <a href="Minister%20for%20Police%20and%20Emergency%20Services%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Police</a> and <a href="Minister%20for%20Police%20and%20Emergency%20Services%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Services</a>. He retired from politics in 1976, and he died in 1987 at the age of seventy.

Born in Sydney on 10 December 1916, Waddy was the son of <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>er Edgar Lloyd Waddy and his wife Lottchen, and great-grandson of General Sir Richard Waddy, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">KCB</a>. His four siblings included a sister and three brothers. Edgar Waddy established the real estate firm of E.L. Waddy & Son in <a href="Rose%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rose Bay</a>, which John joined as a clerk after completing his education at the <a href="King%27s%20School%2C%20Parramatta">King's School, Parramatta</a>. He married Vera Nellie May (Ve) Dengate on 21 July 1938. The couple had a son, Lloyd, and two daughters, Denise and Rosalind.

Waddy enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in late 1940, learning to fly under the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> (EATS) in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>. His two older brothers, Edgar and Richard, were also pilots. Edgar had taken a short-service commission with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in the 1930s, while Richard trained in Canada with EATS during the war prior to active duty in Britain, where he was killed flying a single-engined <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> in 1941. Waddy's elder sister, Lett, was commissioned into the Women's Volunteer Naval Reserve, and his younger brother Rowen served as an officer with <a href="Z%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSpecial%20Unit">Z Special Unit</a> in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>.

Completing his training in June 1941, <a href="Pilot%20Officer">Pilot Officer</a> Waddy was posted to the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African theatre</a> with <a href="No.%20250%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 250 (Fighter) Squadron RAF</a>, operating <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk%20variants">P-40 Tomahawks</a> and, later, Kittyhawks. He was befriended and mentored by the RAAF's top-scoring <a href="Flying%20ace">ace</a>, <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive "Killer" Caldwell</a>, who became godfather to Waddy's daughter. Waddy's first operational <a href="sortie">sortie</a> was as Caldwell's <a href="wingman">wingman</a>; he found the ensuing dogfight so fast and confusing that he had no idea what was happening and afterwards had to ask the more experienced pilot how things had gone. On 9 December, he registered his first victory—in a Tomahawk that had previously been Caldwell's personal mount—when he shared in the destruction of a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> twin-engined fighter near <a href="Gamal%20Abdul%20El%20Nasser%20Air%20Base">El Adem</a>.

By the end of April 1942, Waddy had scored four-and-a-half victories over enemy aircraft. Promoted <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>, he achieved four "kills" in a single sortie on 12 May 1942, destroying two <a href="Junkers%20Ju%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B52">Junkers Ju 52</a> cargo planes and two escorting Bf 110s from a German air transport convoy operating between <a href="Crete">Crete</a> and North Africa. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC) for this action, <a href="The%20London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 2 October. The citation praised his "masterly airmanship as a fighter pilot" and his "great courage and devotion to duty". Shortly after claiming a victory over a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> on 22 May, Waddy was posted to another RAF unit, <a href="No.%20260%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 260 Squadron</a>, flying Kittyhawks. He accounted for two enemy aircraft in June, before being assigned to <a href="4%20Squadron%20SAAF">No. 4 Squadron</a>, <a href="South%20African%20Air%20Force">South African Air Force</a>, with which he destroyed a Bf 109 in September. In October, Waddy began flying <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire Vs</a> in <a href="No.%2092%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 92 Squadron RAF</a>. He claimed a further three victories with his latest unit before being posted back to Australia on 19 November 1942. His final tally of fifteen-and-a-half victories made him one of the most successful Allied fighter pilots in the Desert War, and second only to Caldwell among the RAAF contingent.

In February 1943, Waddy took charge of the Spitfire Squadron of <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit</a> (No. 2 OTU), based at <a href="Mildura">Mildura</a>, Victoria. He was quoted in "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>" that April offering his message of congratulation to the RAF on the 25th anniversary of its foundation: "You should not have many more birthdays before '<a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20for%20Germans">Jerry</a>' and the <a href="Jap">Jap</a>s are shot clean out of the skies. Here's hoping." Fellow aces and Desert War veterans Clive Caldwell, <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilf Arthur</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a> were also <a href="Flight%20instructor">instructors</a> at No. OTU prior to their combat postings in the South West Pacific; in December 1943, Caldwell and Waddy nearly collided when they crossed paths during an <a href="aerobatics">aerobatics</a> display at <a href="No.%205%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Service Flying Training School</a> in <a href="Uranquinty">Uranquinty</a>, New South Wales. Waddy undertook a staff course the following year, and was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>. He was posted to <a href="Noemfoor">Noemfoor</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> in September 1944 to command <a href="No.%2080%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 80 Squadron</a>; his unit was part of <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 (Fighter) Wing</a> of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> (No. 1 TAF), led by Air Commodore <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>. Operating Kittyhawks, No. 80 Squadron undertook dive bombing and <a href="strafing">strafing</a> missions against Japanese targets, but saw little air combat.

In April 1945, Waddy joined Caldwell, Arthur, Gibbes and four other senior pilots of No. 1 TAF in an action that became known as the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>". The eight attempted to resign their commissions in protest at the relegation of the RAAF's fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground attack missions. Earlier that month, Waddy had asked his intelligence officer to produce a "profit and loss statement" for No. 80 Squadron, covering the period 1 October 1944 to 31 March 1945, in order to "bring out the fact that the expenditure by the squadron was not compensated for by the achievements of the Squadron". In that time, Waddy had lost eleven pilots with the unit, including seven to enemy action. Arthur had produced a similar "balance sheet" for No. 81 Wing. Both had become frustrated with the lack of attention paid by superior officers to their concerns regarding the usefulness of No. 1 TAF operations. At the subsequent inquiry into events on Morotai, Justice <a href="John%20Vincent%20Barry">John Vincent Barry</a> cleared the pilots of fault over the incident, finding their motives in tendering their resignations to be sincere. Waddy continued to lead No. 80 Squadron until handing over command on 1 June 1945. For his service in the Pacific, he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> and awarded the US <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a>, the former promulgated on 25 June 1946 and the latter on 1 July 1948.

With the end of the Pacific War, Waddy was discharged from the Permanent Air Force (PAF) as an acting <a href="wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in September 1945. He joined the Rose Bay branch of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Division%29">Liberal Party</a>, and accepted a commission in the RAAF Reserve, also known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He also worked as a sales executive in the import-export firm of Falkiner, Caldwell Pty Ltd, run by Clive Caldwell and businessman George Falkiner. Promoted <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, Waddy led the CAF from 1950 through 1954, becoming its first member to take a seat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the RAAF's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>. During his tenure, CAF squadrons continued to operate aircraft and were expected to act as home defence in the absence of PAF forces serving overseas, roles they would lose by the end of the 1950s.

Retiring from the CAF in 1954, Waddy established his own real estate and travel agency, John L. Waddy Pty Ltd, and served as <a href="Aide-de-camp">Honorary Aide-de-camp</a> to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">the Queen</a> until 1957. He was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1955 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. The Australian delegate to the <a href="World%20Veterans%20Federation">World Veterans Federation</a> from 1956 to 1963, he was President of the New South Wales Division of the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> and Royal Australian Air Force Association throughout the 1950s, becoming an honorary life member in 1958. In October 1956, he joined former Chiefs of the Air Staff Air Marshals <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Sir Richard Williams</a> and <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Sir George Jones</a> in calling for greater investment in the local aircraft industry, warning that unless prompt action was taken the situation would deteriorate to the same level as before World War II.

After an unsuccessful bid to become <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Sydney">Lord Mayor of Sydney</a> that saw him defeated by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20Branch%29">Labor Party</a>'s <a href="Pat%20Hills">Pat Hills</a>, Waddy was elected to the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Legislative%20Assembly">New South Wales Legislative Assembly</a> as the Liberal member for the newly created seat of <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Kirribilli">Kirribilli</a>, on Sydney's <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Sydney%29">North Shore</a>, in March 1962. He sold his interest in John L. Waddy Pty Ltd the same year. Appointed <a href="Parliamentary%20Secretary">Parliamentary Secretary</a> to the <a href="Department%20of%20Education%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Education</a> in 1967, he was an Assistant Minister from February 1969 until March 1971, when he became a <a href="Minister%20of%20the%20Crown">Minister of the Crown</a> in charge of Child Welfare and Social Welfare in <a href="Premier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Premier</a> <a href="Robert%20Askin">Robert Askin</a>'s cabinet, succeeding <a href="Frederick%20Hewitt">Frederick Hewitt</a>. His <a href="Ministry%20%28government%20department%29">portfolio</a> included responsibility for <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal affairs</a>; in 1972 he founded the Aboriginal Lands Trust, staffed by a council of nine elected <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a>, to assume <a href="Freehold%20%28law%29">freehold title</a> of former government reserves in New South Wales as a precursor to granting <a href="land%20rights">land rights</a>.

Waddy's position was changed to Minister for Youth and Community Services in January 1973. In September he piloted a bill to reorganise the Ministries of Child Welfare and Social Welfare as the Department of Youth and Community Services; the move was designed to "revitalise" and re-focus welfare services, and to remove "overtones of charity and paternalism" inherent in the earlier titles. Waddy was succeeded by <a href="Dick%20Healey">Dick Healey</a> on 3 December 1973, and took over as <a href="Minister%20for%20Health%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Health</a> from <a href="Harry%20Jago">Harry Jago</a>. On 3 January 1975, he was appointed <a href="Minister%20for%20Police%20and%20Emergency%20Services%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Police</a> and <a href="Minister%20for%20Police%20and%20Emergency%20Services%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Minister for Services</a> under new Premier <a href="Tom%20Lewis%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Tom Lewis</a>, serving until 23 January the following year. In this portfolio he sponsored an amendment to the Parliamentary Electorates and Elections Bill, including provisions to close polling booths at 6 pm rather than 8 pm to expedite the reporting of results, and to change the term "Christian name" to "Given name" on candidate nominations to reflect changing community attitudes. He also put through a bill to hold a referendum on whether to make daylight saving a permanent fixture in New South Wales, following trials that had commenced in 1971.

Described by one of his parliamentary colleagues as a "mixture of "bon vivant" and conservatism", Waddy was also known for an occasionally quick temper; his staff were said to "start making motions as though they were bombing and strafing the enemy" when their boss got "wound up". <a href="Charles%20Cutler">Charles Cutler</a>, New South Wales Deputy Premier from 1965 to 1975, reflecting on the bond between ex-servicemen in the political arena, recalled Waddy as "a great bloke, but inclined to be a bit pompous when speaking in the house ...", while <a href="John%20David%20Booth">John Booth</a> found him to have an "old-fashioned sense of service to the community". Waddy was named a <a href="List%20of%20Honorary%20Freemen%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">Freeman of the City of London</a> in 1972, and <a href="Australian%20Father%20of%20the%20Year%20award">Australian Father of the Year</a> in 1973. Having held his state seat in Kirribilli for fourteen years and four re-election campaigns—in 1965, 1968, 1971 and 1973—he was denied preselection by the Liberal Party for the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20state%20election%2C%201976">1976 contest</a>. He resigned from the party and stood as an Independent, but was defeated by future Liberal leader <a href="Bruce%20McDonald%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Bruce McDonald</a>. His parliamentary career was over but, in the words of a later Deputy Premier, <a href="Ian%20Armstrong%20%28politician%29">Ian Armstrong</a>, Waddy had "refused to retreat to political obscurity", and "went out fighting". He was permitted to continue to use the title "Honourable" on his retirement. After eleven years in power in New South Wales, the sitting Liberal government itself lost office in the 1976 poll, to <a href="Neville%20Wran">Neville Wran</a>'s Labor Party.

Waddy maintained his interest in aviation during and after his political career. He flew a <a href="Beechcraft%20King%20Air">Beechcraft King Air</a> twin-engined <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> in the 1969 England-to-Australia Air Race, taking second prize in the New South Wales Government division. As Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare with responsibility for Aboriginal affairs in 1971, he piloted his own light plane on three of the longest legs of his tour of government reserves in rural New South Wales. Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Australian and British Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators in 1977–78, he was an honorary member of the American Fighter Aces Association, and became director of a private airline, Aquatic Airways, in 1979. He also raised cattle on his farm near <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a>, New South Wales.

Following several bouts of serious illness in his later years, John Waddy died on 11 September 1987, at the age of seventy. He was survived by his wife and three children, and given a funeral at <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Sydney">St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney</a>. His pallbearers included Clive Caldwell and Tom Lewis. Waddy's son Lloyd served in the RAAF Reserve from 1979 to 1995, and was appointed <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a> in 1988 and later a Justice of the <a href="Family%20Court%20of%20Australia">Family Court of Australia</a>. He was also a co-founder and National Convenor of <a href="Australians%20for%20Constitutional%20Monarchy">Australians for Constitutional Monarchy</a>. Waddy's widow Ve died in 2006, at the age of ninety-six.

Suillus spraguei

Suillus spraguei is a species of <a href="fungus">fungi</a> in the family <a href="Suillaceae">Suillaceae</a>. It is known by a variety of <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s, including the painted slipperycap, the painted suillus or the red and yellow suillus. "Suillus spraguei" has had a complex <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> history, and is also frequently referred to as "Suillus pictus" in the literature. The readily identifiable <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> have <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that are dark red when fresh, dry to the touch, and covered with mats of hairs and scales that are separated by yellow cracks. On the underside of the cap are small, yellow, angular pores that become brownish as the mushroom ages. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a> bears a grayish cottony <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>, and is typically covered with soft hairs or scales.

"Suillus spraguei" grows in a <a href="mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> association with several <a href="pine">pine</a> species, particularly <a href="eastern%20white%20pine">eastern white pine</a>, and the fruit bodies grow on the ground, appearing from early summer to autumn. It has a <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct distribution</a>, and is found in eastern Asia, northeastern North America, and Mexico throughout the range of the host tree. The mushroom is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>; opinions about its quality vary. The mushroom bears a resemblance to several other "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" species, including the closely related "<a href="Suillus%20decipiens">S. decipiens</a>"; the species can be differentiated by variations in color and size.

"Suillus spraguei" has had a complex <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history. The first specimen was originally collected in <a href="New%20England">New England</a> in 1856 by <a href="Charles%20James%20Sprague">Charles James Sprague</a>, and a formal scientific <a href="species%20description">description</a> was published in 1872 when <a href="Miles%20Joseph%20Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a> and <a href="Moses%20Ashley%20Curtis">Moses Ashley Curtis</a> called it "Boletus spraguei". In a publication that appeared the following year, American mycologist <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> named the species "Boletus pictus". Berkeley and Curtis had also described what they believed to be a new species—"Boletus murraii"—although this was later considered by <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> to be merely a younger version of their "Boletus spraguei". Peck's description appeared in print in 1873, but the date stamp on the original publication revealed that he had sent his documents to the printer before the appearance of the 1872 Berkeley and Curtis publication, thus establishing nomenclatural <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">priority</a> under the rules of <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">fungal naming</a>. In 1945 Singer reported that the name "Boletus pictus" was illegitimate because it was a <a href="homonym">homonym</a>, already being used for a <a href="polypore">polypore</a> mushroom described by <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Schultz">Carl Friedrich Schultz</a> in 1806. The name was officially switched to "Suillus spraguei" in 1986 (<a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> had previously transferred the taxon to "Suillus" in 1898).
A 1996 <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular analysis</a> of 38 "Suillus" species used the sequences of their <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a>s to infer <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationships and clarify the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of the genus. The results indicate that "S. spraguei" is most closely related to "<a href="Suillus%20decipiens">S. decipiens</a>". The species "<a href="Suillus%20granulatus">S. granulatus</a>" and "<a href="Suillus%20placidus">S. placidus</a>" lie on a branch sister to that containing "S. spraguei". These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various "Suillus", including "S. spraguei". The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. "S. spraguei" and "S. decipiens" were each other's closest relatives, and the <a href="clade">clade</a> that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: "S. decipiens", U.S. "S. spraguei", China (<a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>) "S. spraguei", and China (<a href="Jilin">Jilin</a>) "S. spraguei".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "spraguei" is an homage to the collector Sprague, while "pictus" means "painted" or "colored". "Suillus spraguei" is <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as the "painted slipperycap", the "painted suillus", or the "red and yellow suillus". It is also called the "eastern painted Suillus" to contrast with the "western painted Suillus" ("<a href="Suillus%20lakei">Suillus lakei</a>").

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> is in diameter, and depending on its age, is either conic to convex, to somewhat flattened at maturity. The cap margin is initially rolled downward before straightening out, often with hanging remnants of partial veil (<a href="wikt%3Aappendiculate">appendiculate</a>). The cap surface is covered with densely matted filaments that are rough and scale-like. The scales are pink to brownish red, fading to a pale brown-gray or dull yellow in maturity. Under the scales, the cap surface is yellow to pale yellow-orange. While many other "<a href="Suillus">Suillus</a>" species have a sticky or slimy cap, "S. spraguei" is dry. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is yellow.

The pores on the underside of the cap are yellowish and angular, measuring wide, and formed by tubes that extend deep. These pores have a slightly <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a> attachment to the stem (extending down its length). Young specimens have a whitish fibrous <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that protects the developing pores; as the cap expands it rips the veil, which remains as a grayish ring on the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>. The stem is long, and thick, roughly cylindrical in shape, or sometimes with a bulbous bottom so as to be somewhat club-shaped. The stem surface is <a href="tomentose">tomentose</a>, with scales at the top, and a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the upper half of the stem. Below the ring the stem is fibrillose, covered with a mat of soft hairs. Its color at the top is yellow, but with wine-red to reddish-brown scales below, underlaid with a pale yellow to grayish color. The stem is usually solid, rarely hollow. The tissue of all parts of the fruit body—cap, pores, and stem—will turn brownish shortly after being bruised or injured.

In deposit, such as with a <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>, the <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> of "S. spraguei" appear olive-brown in color; this changes to clay or tawny-olive after drying. Microscopically, the spores have smooth surfaces, measuring 9–11 by 3–4.5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>; in side profile they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore attaches to the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>), while in face view they appear oblong. The spores are not <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a>, meaning that they do not absorb <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when stained with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells in the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) are thin-walled, four-spored, and have dimensions of 17–19 by 5–7.8 µm. In the presence of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, they appear <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer's reagent.

Various parts of the mushroom display characteristic color reactions to <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests</a> commonly used in mushroom identification. The <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> will turn a blackish color with the application of a drop of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH), <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">iron sulfate</a> (FeSO) solution, or <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish black with a drop of FeSO, and olive to greenish black with KOH or NHOH.

"Suillus spraguei" is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a>. Its taste is not distinctive, and the odor has been described as "slightly fruity". It turns a blackish color when cooked, and some consider it choice, and "among the better edibles in the genus "Suillus"". In contrast, another source on mushrooms of <a href="Qu%C3%A9bec">Québec</a> described the mushroom as a poor edible (""comestible médiocre""), and warned of a slightly acidic taste and disagreeable flavor. Michael Kuo's 2007 book "100 Edible Mushrooms" rates the taste as mediocre, suggesting "its sluglike consistency has all the palatability of unflavored gelatin." The book recommends frying the thinly sliced mushroom in butter or oil until it acquires a crispy texture.

"S. spraguei" is a popular edible among novice mushroom hunters as it is readily identifiable due to both its appearance and its association with white pine. This renders it unlikely to be confused with other species, but it shares similar characteristics with several other "Suillus" species. "S. spraguei" bears some resemblance to the rosy larch bolete ("<a href="Suillus%20ochraceoroseus">S. ochraceoroseus</a>"), but the latter species has a darker spore print, a thicker stem, and grows in association with <a href="larch">larch</a>. "<a href="Suillus%20cavipes">S. cavipes</a>", another associate of larch trees, is more brownish and has a hollow stalk. "<a href="Suillus%20lakei">S. lakei</a>" is less brightly colored than "S. spraguei", has a shorter stalk, and usually grows with <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a>. "<a href="Suillus%20decipiens">S. decipiens</a>" has a less intensely red cap when young, but the color of older specimens fade and can resemble "S. spraguei". "S. decipiens" generally has a smaller stature, with a cap ranging from in diameter, and stem that is typically long by thick. Further, its pores are irregular in shape, measuring 0.5–1 mm in diameter at maturity, and stain a shade of <a href="hazel%20%28color%29">hazel</a> rather than reddish to brownish. It is found in the southeastern United States, from <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> south to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and west to <a href="Texas">Texas</a>.

In nature, "Suillus spraguei" forms <a href="mycorrhizal">ectomycorrhizal</a> relationships with five-needled <a href="pine">pine</a> species. This is a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutually beneficial</a> relationship where the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e of the fungus grow around the roots of the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. "S. spraguei" produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with <a href="Pinus%20classification">white pine</a>, a grouping of trees classified in <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Strobus" of the genus "Pinus". Under controlled <a href="pure%20culture">pure culture</a> conditions in the laboratory, "S. spraguei" has also been shown to form associations with <a href="red%20pine">red pine</a>, <a href="pitch%20pine">pitch pine</a>, and <a href="loblolly%20pine">loblolly pine</a>. Asian populations have been associated with <a href="Korean%20pine">Korean pine</a>, <a href="Chinese%20white%20pine">Chinese white pine</a>, <a href="Siberian%20dwarf%20pine">Siberian dwarf pine</a> and <a href="Japanese%20white%20pine">Japanese white pine</a>. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other <a href="bolete">bolete</a>s, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), but they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be <a href="parasitism">parasitized</a> by the fungus "<a href="Hypomyces%20completus">Hypomyces completus</a>". In the <a href="asexual%20reproduction">asexual</a> stage of "H. completus", it appears initially as patches of whitish <a href="mold">mold</a> on the surface of the cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce <a href="conidia">conidia</a> (asexual spores). In the <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual</a> stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes <a href="perithecia">perithecia</a>, <a href="ascus">asci</a>-containing sexual structures that produce <a href="ascospore">ascospore</a>s. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.
A Japanese field study found that "S. spraguei" was the dominant fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean pine, both in terms of ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage of <a href="biomass%20%28ecology%29">biomass</a> present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of <a href="dry%20matter">dry weight</a> of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of "S. spraguei" fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that "S. spraguei" prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low <a href="forest%20floor">litter</a> accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetative</a> growth (extension of underground <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a>), rather than by colonization of spores.

"Suillus spraguei" has a <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct distribution</a> and is known from several localities in Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. In North America, its range extends from eastern Canada (<a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>) south to the <a href="Carolinas">Carolinas</a>, and west to <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>. It has also been collected in Mexico (<a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a> and <a href="Durango">Durango</a>). Furthermore, the species has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to Europe (Germany, <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a>; <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>).

United States v. Lara

United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193 (2004), was a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case which held that both the United States and a <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> (Indian) tribe could prosecute an Indian for the same acts that constituted crimes in both jurisdictions. The Court held that the United States and the tribe were separate <a href="Sovereignty">sovereigns</a>; therefore, separate tribal and federal prosecutions did not violate the <a href="Double%20Jeopardy%20Clause">Double Jeopardy Clause</a>.

In the 1880s, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> passed the <a href="Major%20Crimes%20Act">Major Crimes Act</a>, divesting tribes of criminal jurisdiction in regard to several <a href="felony">felony</a> crimes. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled in "<a href="Duro%20v.%20Reina">Duro v. Reina</a>" that an Indian tribe did not have the authority to try an Indian criminally who was not a member of that tribe. The following year, Congress passed a law that stated that Indian tribes, because of their inherent <a href="Tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">sovereignty</a>, had the authority to try non-member Indians for crimes committed within the tribe's territorial jurisdiction.

The defendant, Billy Jo Lara, was charged for acts that were criminal offenses under both the <a href="Spirit%20Lake%20Sioux%20Tribe">Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe</a>'s laws and the federal <a href="United%20States%20Code">United States Code</a>. Lara pleaded guilty to the tribal charges, but claimed <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> against the federal charges. The Supreme Court ruled that double jeopardy did not apply to Lara since "the successive prosecutions were brought by separate and distinct sovereign bodies".

The <a href="Sioux%20people">Sioux people</a> consist of three main groups, the <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a> in the west, the <a href="Western%20Dakota">Western Dakota</a> in the center, and the <a href="Eastern%20Dakota">Eastern Dakota</a> in the east. In the east, the Santee was originally from the <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> area. The <a href="Ojibwe%20people">Chippewa</a> or Ojibwe people were also from the same general area. The two tribes had been at war from at least 1736 and by 1750 the Chippewa had forced the Santee to the west into the prairie. The war between the tribes continued until at least the 1850s. Only after 1862, when the Santee rose up against the whites and were subsequently removed to the <a href="Dakota%20Territory">Dakota Territory</a>, did the fighting cease. In 1872, the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of the Santee signed a treaty that resulted in their moving to the Spirit Lake Reservation.

Originally, crimes committed by Indians against Indians were not subject to federal or state jurisdiction, but were handled by tribal law. In 1881, a <a href="Brul%C3%A9">Brulé</a> Lakota named <a href="Crow%20Dog">Crow Dog</a> shot and killed another Indian, <a href="Spotted%20Tail">Spotted Tail</a>, on the <a href="Great%20Sioux%20Reservation">Great Sioux Reservation</a> in <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>. Crow Dog was tried in federal court for murder, found guilty, and sentenced to hang. He petitioned for a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" to the Supreme Court, and in "<a href="Ex%20parte%20Crow%20Dog">Ex parte Crow Dog</a>" the Supreme Court found that the federal government did not have jurisdiction to try the case. Crow Dog was ordered released, having made restitution under tribal law to Spotted Tail's family.

In response to "Ex Parte Crow Dog", <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> passed the <a href="Major%20Crimes%20Act">Major Crimes Act</a> in 1885. The Act provided that the federal government had <a href="exclusive%20jurisdiction">exclusive jurisdiction</a> over certain Indian-on-Indian crimes when the crimes were committed in "Indian country." In 1886, the Act was upheld by the Supreme Court in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Kagama">United States v. Kagama</a>".

In 1990, the Supreme Court held in "<a href="Duro%20v.%20Reina">Duro v. Reina</a>" that an Indian tribe did not have <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> to try an Indian of another tribe. Tribal leaders urged Congress to fix the problem that the "Duro" decision created. In 1991, Congress amended the <a href="Indian%20Civil%20Rights%20Act">Indian Civil Rights Act</a> (ICRA) to recognize that Indian tribes had inherent power to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all Indians. This legislation became known as the ""Duro" fix", and was based on tribal sovereignty rather than a federal delegation of power.

Billy Jo Lara was an enrolled member of the <a href="Turtle%20Mountain%20Band%20of%20Chippewa%20Indians">Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians</a> located in northern <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> near the Canada–U.S. border. The <a href="Spirit%20Lake%20Reservation">Spirit Lake Reservation</a> is approximately south of the <a href="Turtle%20Mountain%20Indian%20Reservation">Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation</a>. Lara had married a member of the Spirit Lake Santee tribe and had resided on the Spirit Lake Reservation with her and their children until he was banished from the reservation due to several serious misdemeanors. Lara returned to the reservation, where he was arrested and charged with <a href="public%20intoxication">public intoxication</a>. After the arrest, <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA) officer Bryon Swan took Lara to the police station where Lara was informed of a Sioux order excluding him from the reservation. Lara then struck Swan, who as a BIA officer was considered both a tribal officer and a federal law enforcement officer.

Following his arrest, the tribal court of the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe charged Lara with assaulting the arresting officers, along with four other charges. Lara pleaded guilty to the tribal charge of "violence to a policeman". Soon after, federal prosecutors charged Lara with assault on a federal officer and a federal grand jury indicted him. Lara moved to dismiss the charge based on double jeopardy and other constitutional grounds. The <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20North%20Dakota">Federal District Court</a>, with Magistrate Judge Alice R. Senechal sitting by consent, denied the motions and Lara entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal. Senechal noted that two other trial courts in the circuit had already ruled that double jeopardy did not apply, that the ICRA only recognized the inherent sovereignty of the tribes and did not delegate prosecutorial power to the tribe. She further noted that another circuit court had ruled the same way. Lara also argued that the "Petite" doctrine, if applied, would preclude his prosecution, and that since it was never applied to federal prosecutions following convictions in tribal court, it discriminated against Indians. Senechal denied this motion, noting that Lara had shown no examples of other races not being prosecuted for like offenses.

Lara appealed the denial of his motion to dismiss to the <a href="U.S.%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Eighth%20Circuit">Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, arguing that the Tribal Court obtained its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the "Duro" decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the "Petite" claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.

Lara then requested a rehearing "<a href="en%20banc">en banc</a>" by the full court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed the decision of the three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>, which granted <a href="certiorari">certiorari</a> to hear the case.

<a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">Solicitor General</a> <a href="Theodore%20Olson">Ted Olson</a> argued that Congress, in response to the "Duro" decision, acted to "recognize and affirm" the <a href="Tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian tribe's inherent power</a> to enforce its criminal laws against Indians of other tribes. Olson noted that the "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Wheeler%20%281978%29">United States v. Wheeler</a>" decision clearly stated that a tribe could prosecute a tribal member for a crime and that the Federal government could subsequently prosecute for the same criminal acts without invoking double jeopardy if the actions of the accused violated Federal law. Olson noted that the <a href="legislative%20history">legislative history</a> of the "Duro" fix bill clearly indicated that Congress intended to restore, not delegate, authority to prosecute non-member Indians by a tribe. The government argued that the limitation in "Duro" was a statutory limitation of the tribe's sovereignty, not a constitutional limit, and that Congress had the authority to remove that limitation. He noted that a <a href="tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">tribe's sovereignty</a> has allowed prosecution of non-member Indians for centuries, until it was limited by Congress. The United States was supported by amicus briefs filed by the State of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and seven other states, the State of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> and five other states, the <a href="National%20Congress%20of%20American%20Indians">National Congress of American Indians</a>, and eighteen Indian tribes.

Alexander F. Reichert was appointed by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an Indian tribe had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing "Duro", "Wheeler", and "<a href="Oliphant%20v.%20Suquamish%20Indian%20Tribe">Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe</a>" to support his argument. He stated that it was the place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution in the same manner as any other citizen. Reichert stated that "Duro" was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" briefs filed by the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Criminal%20Defense%20Lawyers">National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers</a>, <a href="Lewis%20County%2C%20Idaho">Lewis County</a>, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).

Justice <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> delivered the opinion of the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.

Breyer stated that the <a href="Commerce%20Clause">Indian Commerce Clause</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> granted Congress "plenary and exclusive" power to legislate in respect to the Indian tribes. He noted that the Indian Treaty Clause did not specifically grant Congress the right to legislate, but that treaties made pursuant to the clause could grant Congress the authority to legislate in regards to treaty matters.

These powers included the ability to both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. Congress has done both, such as in the withdrawal of federal recognition of the <a href="Menominee">Menominee tribe</a> with the <a href="Indian%20termination%20policy%23Menominee%20Termination%20Act">Menominee Termination Act</a> in 1954, and the <a href="Menominee%20Restoration%20Act">Menominee Restoration Act</a> to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in "Duro", "Wheeler", and "Oliphant" dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in "Duro" was one of federal <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, and it is clear that Congress has the power to change that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.

Breyer noted Lara's other arguments, but as the double jeopardy issue was dispositive, he declined to address those issues. He did note that "we are not now faced with a question dealing with potential constitutional limits on congressional efforts to legislate far more radical changes in tribal status." The decision allowed both courts to prosecute Lara. Since separate <a href="sovereign">sovereign</a> bodies had filed the charges, double jeopardy did not apply to Lara's case. The decision of the Eighth Circuit Court was reversed in the 7-2 decision.

Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> wrote a <a href="concurring%20opinion">concurring opinion</a> that argued that the Indian tribes have a stronger claim on inherent sovereign powers than do individual states. He noted that the Indian tribes governed themselves since before Columbus arrived, and that most states never governed themselves outside of the United States.

Justice <a href="Anthony%20Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a> wrote a concurrence which stated that Congress was very careful to base the changes to the statute on inherent tribal powers and not on a delegation of authority. Kennedy states that is all that is needed to decide the case, but that the Court went further than was necessary when it decided that Congress had the power under the constitution to authorize tribes to prosecute non-member Indians. Finally, Kennedy was concerned that the court did not address the question of the <a href="Equal%20Protection%20Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a>. He would have reversed the Eighth Circuit without going into the additional detail.

Justice <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> wrote a concurring opinion stating that it was time to re-examine the entire concept of tribal sovereignty. He noted that doubtful precedents stated that Congress, and not another part of the government had the power to regulate everything that a tribe could or could not do, which renders tribal sovereignty a "nullity." Thomas did not believe that Congress has the constitutional authority to set the "metes and bounds of tribal sovereignty." He noted that such authority was not in the Indian Treaty Clause nor the Indian Commerce Clause.
" In <nowiki>[his]</nowiki> view, the tribes either are or are not separate sovereigns, and our federal Indian law cases untenably hold both positions simultaneously." Thomas further questioned the law ending the practice of making treaties with the tribes, noting that this was the one clear constitutional provision that provides for dealing with other sovereigns. Thomas noted that a delegation of prosecutorial power is always to an executive branch and that the tribes are not part of any executive branch of the Federal government. Therefore, the case hinges on the tribes' inherent sovereignty, and based on precedent, the tribes possess that power.

Justice <a href="David%20Souter">David Souter</a> wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice <a href="Antonin%20Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a>. Souter referenced prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Kagama">United States v. Kagama</a>", to the opinion made in "<a href="South%20Dakota%20v.%20Bourland">South Dakota v. Bourland</a>". Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with <a href="precedent">precedent</a> established in previous cases. Since "Duro" held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, the only way for the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. "Bourland" was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.

Souter wrote that this dissonance in court decisions will lead to confusion, stating: "And confusion, I fear, will be the legacy of today's decision, for our failure to stand by what we have previously said reveals that our conceptualizations of sovereignty and dependent sovereignty are largely rhetorical." Souter concluded that he would stand by the decisions made in "Duro" and "Oliphant".

Lara was released from federal prison on August 19, 2005, about a year and four months after the Supreme Court delivered their decision.

This case has been the subject of numerous <a href="law%20review">law review</a> articles since the decision was made. Points raised include:

The case has been widely covered in books and news media. Tribal court authority has been altered by the U.S. government for decades, affecting jurisdictional powers. In Justice Thomas's conclusion at the end of this case, he stated, "History points in both directions." Thomas further stated, "Federal Indian policy, is, to say the least, schizophrenic." Thomas's statements directly address the Supreme Court's confusion on both present and future <a href="Federal%20Indian%20Policy">Federal Indian Policy</a>. As Justice Souter stated in his dissent, this remains "an area peculiarly susceptible to confusion."

Kent, Ohio

Kent is a city in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and the largest city in <a href="Portage%20County%2C%20Ohio">Portage County</a>. It is located along the <a href="Cuyahoga%20River">Cuyahoga River</a> in <a href="Northeast%20Ohio">Northeast Ohio</a> on the western edge of the county. The population was 28,904 in the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a> and was estimated at 29,915 in 2017. The city is counted as part of the <a href="Akron%20metropolitan%20area">Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area</a> and the larger <a href="Cleveland%E2%80%93Akron%E2%80%93Canton%20Combined%20Statistical%20Area">Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area</a>.

Part of the <a href="Connecticut%20Western%20Reserve">Connecticut Western Reserve</a>, Kent was settled in 1805 and was known for many years as Franklin Mills. Settlers were attracted to the area due to its location along the Cuyahoga River as a place for water-powered mills. Later development came in the 1830s and 1840s as a result of the settlement's position along the route of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20and%20Ohio%20Canal">Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal</a>. Leading up to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Franklin Mills was noted for its activity in the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. With the decline of the canal and the emergence of the railroad, the town became the home of the <a href="Atlantic%20and%20Great%20Western%20Railroad">Atlantic and Great Western Railroad</a> maintenance shops through the influence of <a href="Marvin%20Kent">Marvin Kent</a>. In 1864 the town was renamed Kent in honor of and in gratitude for Marvin Kent's efforts. It was incorporated as a village in 1867 and became a city after the <a href="1920%20United%20States%20Census">1920 Census</a>. Today Kent is a <a href="college%20town">college town</a> best known as the home of the main campus of <a href="Kent%20State%20University">Kent State University</a>, founded in 1910, and as the site of the 1970 <a href="Kent%20State%20shootings">Kent State shootings</a>.

Historically a manufacturing center, education is the city's largest economic sector with Kent State University the city's, and one of the region's, largest employers. The <a href="Kent%20City%20School%20District">Kent City School District</a> and the <a href="Kent%20Free%20Library">Kent Free Library</a> provide additional education opportunities and resources. Many of Kent's demographic elements are influenced by the presence of the university, particularly the median age, median income, and those living below the poverty level. The city is governed by a <a href="council-manager%20government">council-manager system</a> with a <a href="city%20manager">city manager</a>, a nine-member city council, and a mayor. Kent has nearly 20 parks and preserves and hosts a number of annual festivals including ones related to <a href="Earth%20Day">Earth Day</a>, folk music, and the U.S. <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a>. In addition to the <a href="Kent%20State%20Golden%20Flashes">Kent State athletic teams</a>, the city also hosts a number of amateur and local sporting events at various times during the year. Kent is part of the Cleveland-Akron media market and is the city of license for three local radio stations and three television stations and includes the regional affiliates for <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a> (NPR) and the <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">Public Broadcasting Service</a> (PBS). Local transportation infrastructure includes a <a href="Portage%20Area%20Regional%20Transportation%20Authority">public bus service</a> and hike-and-bike trails. As the home of the <a href="Davey%20Tree%20Expert%20Company">Davey Tree Expert Company</a>, Kent is known as "The Tree City" while residents are referred to as "<a href="List%20of%20people%20from%20Kent%2C%20Ohio">Kentites</a>". The city has produced a number of notable individuals, particularly in politics, athletics, and the entertainment industry.

The region was originally inhabited by various tribes of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indians</a>, including the early <a href="Mound%20builder%20%28people%29">Mound Builders</a>. Around 1780, Captain <a href="Samuel%20Brady">Samuel Brady</a> achieved notoriety for his activities in the area, including his famous leap of over the <a href="Cuyahoga%20River">Cuyahoga River</a> to avoid capture by an unknown band of American Indians. The site, known as Brady's Leap, is now a city park. Settlement by Europeans began in the late 1790s and early 19th century. As part of the <a href="Connecticut%20Western%20Reserve">Connecticut Western Reserve</a>, the area was divided into <a href="survey%20township">survey township</a>s in 1798 and almost all of what is now Kent was originally part of Town 3 Range 9, which would eventually be known as <a href="Franklin%20Township%2C%20Portage%20County%2C%20Ohio">Franklin Township</a>. <a href="Aaron%20Olmsted">Aaron Olmsted</a>, a wealthy <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a> merchant, had purchased the township and named it for his son Aaron Franklin Olmsted.

Franklin Township was surveyed in 1803 and settled in November 1805 when John Haymaker and his family moved west from <a href="Warren%2C%20Ohio">Warren</a> to the banks of the Cuyahoga River. They were joined by John's brother George and their father Jacob Haymaker and their families early the next year, and built a <a href="gristmill">gristmill</a> in 1807. Initial growth in the area was slow, but eventually two small villages would develop due to the potential for power generated by the Cuyahoga River that could be used in gristmills and manufacturing. The first village, known as Franklin Mills, or locally as the "Lower Village", developed mostly around the original Haymaker property. In 1818, Joshua Woodard arrived in the area and began constructing buildings just north of the village forming the "Upper Village" that would come to be known briefly as Carthage.
In the 1820s, Franklin Mills was included in the route of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20and%20Ohio%20Canal">Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal</a> (P & O Canal). When construction began on the canal in the mid-1830s, land speculation was rampant in many areas of northeast Ohio along the canal, including Franklin Mills. As a result, an industrial and business region was established along the east side of the river in what is now downtown Kent. Factories and mills were either planned or constructed along the Cuyahoga River, some of which either were never built or ultimately failed, due mostly to effects of the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. A lock and attached arch dam, however, was completed in 1836. The canal officially opened in 1840, but would only operate into the 1860s. By the 1870s the canal was completely shut down.

In the era leading up to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Franklin Mills was an active stop on the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>, giving fugitive slaves shelter on their escape to <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. There were three notable stops in Franklin Mills, one of which still stands as of 2010. During this period, from 1835 to 1839, noted American abolitionist <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> moved to the village, operating a tannery along the Cuyahoga River with Zenas Kent.

In 1863 the <a href="Atlantic%20and%20Great%20Western%20Railroad">Atlantic and Great Western Railroad</a> was constructed through Franklin Mills, due largely to the efforts of local businessman <a href="Marvin%20Kent">Marvin Kent</a>, son of Zenas Kent. Marvin Kent had started his own railroad company, the <a href="Atlantic%20and%20Great%20Western%20Railroad">Franklin and Warren Railroad</a>, in 1851 after Franklin Mills, already home to several Kent family ventures and properties, was bypassed by the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad that same year. Kent was also successful in getting the village named as the location of the railroad's maintenance yards and shops in 1864. The geographic location along the railroad and being home to the shops reinvented and revitalized the village as an important stop on the east-west line between <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The shops would open in 1865 and the railroad would play an important part of Kent's industry and development through the early 20th century before the shops were completely shut down in 1930. To honor Marvin Kent, the village was renamed Kent in 1864, although this change was not official until the village was incorporated on May 6, 1867.

<a href="John%20Davey%20%28tree%20surgeon%29">John Davey</a> came to Kent in 1881 as head grounds keeper at Standing Rock Cemetery, and planted several trees, landscaped the cemetery, and performed experiments on trees. In 1901, he published his theories on <a href="Arboriculture">tree surgery</a> with his book "The Tree Doctor", and later established the <a href="Davey%20Tree%20Expert%20Company">Davey Tree Expert Company</a> in 1909. The efforts of Davey and the presence of Davey Tree led to the establishment of "The Tree City" as a nickname for Kent, which is reflected in the city's seal. The company continues to be headquartered in Kent and serves as the city's largest private employer.

After a fire destroyed the Seneca Chain Company in 1909, one of the city's main industries at the time, city leaders created the Kent Board of Trade in 1910, a forerunner to the Chamber of Commerce. The new Board was successful later that year in having Kent selected out of twenty northeastern Ohio cities as the site of a new teacher training college, which became known as the "<a href="Ohio%20State%20Normal%20College%20At%20Kent">Kent State Normal School</a>". The site for the school was on of land donated by William S. Kent, son of Marvin Kent, on what was then the eastern edge of town. By 1929 the school was renamed Kent State College after the establishment of a college of liberal arts and degrees in the arts and sciences and in 1935 was renamed <a href="Kent%20State%20University">Kent State University</a> after it was given authorization to grant advanced graduate degrees. The bill giving Kent State university status was signed into law by Ohio governor and Kent native <a href="Martin%20L.%20Davey">Martin L. Davey</a>, son of tree surgeon John Davey. During the 1950s and 1960s the growth of Kent State University combined with the effects of <a href="suburbanization">suburbanization</a> resulted in significant population growth for the city, rising from just over 12,000 residents at the 1950 census to over 28,000 by 1970. <a href="Black%20squirrel">Black squirrel</a>s were brought to the campus from Canada in 1961 by Kent State University head groundskeeper Larry Woodell. The squirrels have become an icon for both KSU and the city and are often used as unofficial mascots and symbols.

In early May 1970, protests began on the campus of Kent State University over the United States' <a href="Cambodian%20Campaign">invasion of Cambodia</a> in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. These protests and demonstrations, which included rioting in downtown Kent on May 2, culminated in the <a href="Kent%20State%20shootings">Kent State shootings</a> on May 4, 1970, where four students were killed and nine were wounded by the <a href="Ohio%20Army%20National%20Guard">Ohio Army National Guard</a>. Several memorials have been placed at the site over the years and commemorations have been held annually since 1971. In 2010 the entire site was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. Also during the late 1960s and into the 1970s, construction of <a href="Ohio%20State%20Route%2059%23Haymaker%20Parkway">Haymaker Parkway</a>, completed in 1975, brought changes to the city's layout while eliminating ongoing problems with traffic congestion and blocked rail crossings.

In 1995, Kent received national attention when the city's water was named "Best Tasting Municipality Water" at the <a href="Bath%20%28Berkeley%20Springs%29%2C%20West%20Virginia">Berkeley Springs International Water Tasting</a>. The water and mayor <a href="Kathleen%20Chandler">Kathleen Chandler</a> were featured on the March 3 episode of "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>". Since then, Kent has placed in the top five a total of six times with the most recent being a fifth-place finish in 2011. In 2003, the 1836 arch dam was bypassed to meet water quality standards set by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. To preserve the historic dam, a small park was built behind the dam and the river was rerouted through the old canal lock. During warm-weather months, water is pumped over the dam. The park, known as Heritage Park, was formally dedicated in May 2005.

Beginning in 2008, several redevelopment projects in the downtown area, some of which had been discussed for decades, were put into motion and resulted in nearly $110 million in total investment from public and private sources. The first of these was the Phoenix Project, a development privately financed by Kent resident Ron Burbick that renovated and expanded a section of commercial space along East Main Street. Included in the project was construction of a pedestrian alleyway lined with small shops, eventually known as Acorn Alley, which opened in 2009. A second phase of Acorn Alley opened in late 2011. Other aspects of the redevelopment, which include a 360-space parking deck and bus transfer station, a hotel and conference center, and three separate mixed-use buildings, began to take shape in 2010 following the demolition of several buildings in a four block area. New offices for <a href="Ametek">Ametek</a> and the <a href="Davey%20Tree%20Expert%20Company">Davey Tree Expert Company</a> opened in late 2012 along with several new small businesses on the first floors of each building. The hotel, operated by Kent State University, opened in June 2013 and the new parking garage, operated by the <a href="Portage%20Area%20Regional%20Transportation%20Authority">Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority</a> (PARTA) opened April 30, 2013, as the Kent Central Gateway. In addition to parking, the facility functions as PARTA's main bus transfer station and has storefronts on the ground level facing East Erie Street. Included in the redevelopment was the purchase and renovation of the old <a href="Franklin%20Hotel%20%28Kent%2C%20Ohio%29">Kent hotel</a>, which first opened in 1920. After being mostly vacant since 1979 and completely vacant since 2000, it re-opened on April 1, 2013, as the new home to the Kent location of <a href="Buffalo%20Wild%20Wings">Buffalo Wild Wings</a> and also houses offices, a wine and jazz bar, and apartments. A five-story mixed-use building called The Landmark was completed in 2014 and construction started in November 2015 on an additional five-story mixed-use building featuring <a href="microapartment">microapartment</a>s, scheduled to be completed in 2016. The developments attracted the attention of "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and earned the city and university the 2013 Larry Abernathy Award from the International Town–Gown Association in recognition of the positive town–gown cooperation and collaboration.
Additional development has been ongoing on the campus of Kent State University and the largely residential neighborhood located between downtown Kent and the western edge of campus. The university began buying properties in that neighborhood in 2007 and by December 2012 had acquired 43. Construction of the University Esplanade extension, designed to link campus with downtown, started in August 2012 after several of the buildings in the area, most of which had been rental homes, were demolished or moved. The Esplanade extension continued a segment of the Portage Hike and Bike Trail that extends to <a href="Dix%20Stadium">Dix Stadium</a> and was completed in October 2013. Kent State constructed a $48 million, facility for the College of Architecture and Environmental Design along the Esplanade extension and also relocated the former home of May Prentice, the first female faculty member at Kent State, to the extension as the home for the Wick Poetry Center. Construction on the architecture building started in October 2014 and was completed in August 2016. In total, there are plans totaling approximately $150 million for several other facilities and upgrades across campus, including a new building for the College of Applied Engineering, Sustainability and Technology and a renovation and reorganization of the facilities for the School of Art. The city and county have also seen developments in the same area. A new county municipal courthouse on East Main Street was completed in April 2014, and in 2015, Kent City Council approved the sale of the city hall complex to a private developer for construction of a five-story apartment building on the site, which opened in August 2016.

Kent is located in west-central <a href="Portage%20County%2C%20Ohio">Portage County</a> in <a href="Northeast%20Ohio">Northeast Ohio</a> approximately northeast of <a href="Akron%2C%20Ohio">Akron</a> and southeast of <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>. It is bordered by Franklin Township on the north and east, <a href="Brimfield%20Township%2C%20Portage%20County%2C%20Ohio">Brimfield Township</a> on the south, and <a href="Stow%2C%20Ohio">Stow</a> on the west. Other nearby communities include <a href="Brady%20Lake%2C%20Ohio">Brady Lake</a> and <a href="Ravenna%2C%20Ohio">Ravenna</a> to the east and <a href="Sugar%20Bush%20Knolls%2C%20Ohio">Sugar Bush Knolls</a> and <a href="Streetsboro%2C%20Ohio">Streetsboro</a> to the north. It is included in the <a href="Akron%2C%20OH%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area">Akron Metropolitan Statistical Area</a> and the larger <a href="Northeast%20Ohio">Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area</a>.

Located on the western end of the <a href="Glaciated%20Allegheny%20Plateau">Glaciated Allegheny Plateau</a>, the topography of Kent includes rolling hills and varied terrain. The Cuyahoga River passes through the city, cutting a gorge with a drop of nearly adjacent to the downtown area. The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> lists the city's elevation at above sea level at a point near Kent's geographic center. Elevations vary slightly within the city limits with several buildings on the Kent State University campus at altitudes in excess of and points as high as . According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, as of 2010 the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Kent's climate is classified as a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> in the "Dfa" <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> meaning it typically has very warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters with moderate and variable spring and autumn seasons. The record high temperature is , set on July 7, 1988, with the record low of recorded January 17, 1982. During the spring and summer months, thunderstorms are fairly common and the area is susceptible to <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es, though the last recorded tornado in Kent occurred in 1973. Effects from tropical systems can also be felt, usually taking the form of increased humidity, rain, and wind, such as with the remnants of <a href="Hurricane%20Ike">Hurricane Ike</a> in September 2008. During the winter months, snowfall is common and can occur in large quantities with considerable <a href="cloud%20cover">cloud cover</a>. Kent is not considered part of the Lake Erie <a href="snowbelt">snowbelt</a>, though <a href="lake-effect%20snow">lake-effect snow</a> does occur at times. The city is in what is referred to as the "secondary snowbelt", meaning it will receive heavier snowfall totals from lake-effect snow when certain wind directions are more prevalent, but typically sees far less snowfall than areas to the north closer to <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>. While temperatures below the <a href="Melting%20point">freezing point</a> are typical in the winter months, <a href="Thaw%20%28weather%29">thaw</a> periods where temperatures exceed and even are not uncommon in January and February.

As a <a href="college%20town">college town</a>, Kent's demographic and population statistics are greatly affected by the presence and growth of Kent State University. As a result, several statistics are noticeably higher or lower than state and national averages including median age and the percentage of residents in the 18–24 age bracket, individuals below the poverty line, and percentage of residents with a college degree.

Initial population growth in Kent was influenced by the location on the Cuyahoga River which led to the development of industrial and manufacturing jobs. Early settlers mainly came from the northeastern United States and were largely of <a href="Germans">German</a> descent. After the arrival of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in 1863, growth was steady into the early 20th century with the village battling <a href="Ravenna%2C%20Ohio">Ravenna</a> for the position of Portage County's largest city. By the 1930 Census, Kent had passed Ravenna as the county's most populous city with even larger population growth in the 1950s and 1960s rising from 12,148 in 1950 to 28,183 by 1970. As of 2010, Kent remains the county's largest city. Most recent population measurements of the city have shown the effect of changes in the city's overall population coinciding with changes in the number of students living on campus as well as a reduction in the number of persons per housing unit.

As of the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>, there were 28,904 people residing in the city for a <a href="population%20density">population density</a> of 3,150.5 people per square mile (1,216.4/km²). There were 11,174 housing units at an average density of 1,218.0 per square mile (470.3/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 83.1% <a href="White%20American">White</a>, 9.6% <a href="African%20American">African American</a>, 3.7% <a href="Asian%20American">Asian</a>, 0.2% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>, 0.1% <a href="Pacific%20Islander%20American">Pacific Islander</a>, 0.5% from <a href="Race%20and%20ethnicity%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Census%23Race">other races</a>, and 2.9% from two or more races. 2.2% of the population is <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic or Latino</a> of any race. Though slightly below the national averages for diversity, Kent is very close to the averages for Ohio and above the averages for the surrounding area. Between the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the city saw slight increases in the number of minority residents. The 2015 estimate placed the population at 29,810.

There were 10,288 households in 2010 out of which 20.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.5% were <a href="Marriage">married couples</a> living together, 12.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 56.3% were non-families. 33.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size in Kent was 2.2 and the average family size was 2.86, which compares with the national average of 2.58 for a household and 3.14 for a family and the state average household size of 2.44 and average family size of 3.01.

In the city the population was spread out with 29.4% ages 19 years and under, 44.1% from 20 to 39, 15.9% from 40 to 59, 8.0% from 60 to 79, and 2.5% who were 80 years of age or older. The median age was 22.7 years, which was well below both the median age for Ohio (38.8) and the United States (35.3). The city's population was 46.3% male and 53.7% female. The rate differs slightly from the national average of 49.2% male and 50.8% female and the state average of 48.8% male and 51.2% female. It contrasts with neighboring Franklin Township, which has a population that is 51.3% male and 48.7% female.

The mean income for a household in the city was $46,848, well below the mean household incomes for Ohio ($61,397) and the United States ($70,116) in the 2010 Census. The median household income in Kent was $28,958, compared to $46,563 for Ohio and $51,222 for the U.S. For families, the mean income in Kent was $71,817 with a median income of $59,936, both of which were closer to the state ($73,084 mean, $58,566 median) and national ($81,568 mean, $62,112 median) averages. Males had a median income of $35,316 versus $35,255 for females. The <a href="per%20capita%20income">per capita income</a> for workers in the city was $18,339. 10.4% of families and 29.3% of the population were below the <a href="poverty%20line">poverty line</a>, including 21.1% of those under age 18 and 6.6% of those age 65 or over. While the number of individuals below the poverty line is significantly higher than both the state and national averages, with 14.8% of individuals in Ohio and 14.4% in the United States being below the poverty line, the percentage of families below the poverty line is slightly below the state (10.5%) and national (10.8%) averages. Measures of high poverty rates in similar college towns, however, is not uncommon across the U.S.

Educationally, Kent is above the national, state, and local averages for residents who have attained a bachelor's, master's, or above a master's degree. At the 2010 Census, 41.9% of Kent's population above the age of 25 had obtained a college degree compared to 24.9% of the same population in Portage County, 24.1% statewide, and 27.9% nationally.

Kent's location along the Cuyahoga River and later the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal and multiple railroad lines made it attractive initially for the establishment of small <a href="gristmills">gristmills</a> for the production of flour and various factories. Progressively larger factories later developed due to increased power available from the river and eventually due to the ease and lower cost of transportation of goods to other markets. During the latter half of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the city's largest employers were all industrially based, including the <a href="Atlantic%20and%20Great%20Western%20Railroad">Atlantic and Great Western Railroad</a> and its successors, which operated its main maintenance shops in the village; the Seneca Chain Company; and bus manufacturer <a href="Twin%20Coach">Twin Coach</a> among others. A disastrous fire at the Seneca Chain Company in 1909 led to the creation of the Kent Board of Trade—an early Chamber of Commerce—which was successful in getting Kent selected in 1910 as the site of what would become Kent State University.

Changes in the structure of the railroad and declines in the manufacturing sector during the mid-20th century combined with the rapid growth of Kent State University following World War II led to the university becoming the city's largest employer and influenced the development of other areas of the city's economy. Beginning in the late first decade of the 21st century, the university, along with the city and private investors, began to play a more active role in the redevelopment of downtown Kent and has aided in the development of local high tech companies. Kent State operates Centennial Research Park, along <a href="Ohio%20State%20Route%2059">Ohio State Route 59</a> in Kent's <a href="Joint%20Economic%20Development%20District">Joint Economic Development District</a> with Franklin Township, which houses two <a href="high%20tech">high tech</a> start-up companies in the <a href="liquid%20crystal">liquid crystal</a> industry. Kent has an additional Joint Economic Development District with <a href="Brimfield%20Township%2C%20Portage%20County%2C%20Ohio">Brimfield Township</a>. Through the Kent Regional Business Alliance, the city also supports two <a href="business%20incubator">business incubator</a>s.
As of 2010, the educational, health, and social services fields were the city's largest sector, and employed over 33.5% of well as <a href="Robinson%20Memorial%20Hospital">Robinson Memorial Hospital</a>, which operates an <a href="outpatient%20surgery">outpatient surgery</a> center and general medical facility. 16.3% of the workforce is employed in arts, entertainment, and food service, with 12.2% employed in retail. Manufacturing accounts for 7.1% of the workforce with a <a href="Land%20O%27%20Lakes">Land O' Lakes</a> plant being the largest employer in the sector. <a href="Smithers-Oasis">Smithers-Oasis</a>, a <a href="floristry">floristry</a> developer and manufacturer, was founded in Kent in 1954 and operates a plant in the city, with plans to return corporate offices to Kent by September 2013. Kent is also home to the corporate headquarters of the <a href="Davey%20Tree%20Expert%20Company">Davey Tree Expert Company</a>, which serves as the city's largest private employer. In 2010 Davey Tree announced plans to relocate staff from its Davey Resource Group, who were previously in neighboring Stow, to Kent as part of a planned downtown development and has stated long-term goals include having all corporate offices in Kent. The office, which included some office staff already in Kent at the main corporate headquarters, opened in August 2012.

75.1% of those employed commuted alone to work by way of a car, truck, or van with another 7.1% <a href="carpool">carpool</a>ing. 10.6% of workers walked to work with 1.9% using <a href="public%20transport">public transport</a>ation. The average commute time was 22 minutes. 13.0% of the workforce was unemployed in 2010, above the 9.8% for the state and 9.0% nationally. the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> estimated the unemployment rate in Kent at 7.9% in 2010 and 6.6% in October 2011.

Cultural elements in Kent include various arts, environmental, and entertainment events during the year, as well as the Kent State University Museum. The Kent Heritage Festival is held every July in the downtown area, coinciding with the U.S. <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a>. The festival includes crafts, booths, entertainment, train rides, 5K and 10K races, and fireworks, drawing approximately 25,000 people each year. In October, Kent hosts the homecoming festivities for Kent State University, including a parade down East Main Street as well as other events and activities both on campus and around the city. Also in October, the downtown area hosts an annual, yet unofficial, <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> celebration, which usually takes place the last Saturday of October. The event typically draws thousands, largely Kent State students, and includes many who dress in costume. In 2007 Main Street Kent, a local organization that promotes downtown Kent, created a family-oriented Halloween event downtown that precedes the unofficial celebration. Since 2007, Kent has hosted an annual environmental festival known as "Who's Your Mama?" which takes place in conjunction with <a href="Earth%20Day">Earth Day</a>. The festival has events at various locations in the city, such as a <a href="Veganism">vegan</a> chef competition, concerts, a film festival, guest speakers, and booths on environment-based topics.

The building was financed mainly from a $20 million <a href="Transportation%20Investment%20Generating%20Economic%20Recovery">Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery</a> (TIGER) grant received in February 2010 and construction began in April 2011.

Hospital care is provided mainly through <a href="University%20Hospitals%20Portage%20Medical%20Center">University Hospitals Portage Medical Center</a>, affiliated with <a href="University%20Hospitals%20of%20Cleveland">University Hospitals of Cleveland</a>, which operates the UH Kent Health Center in the southern part of the city. The UH Kent Health Center includes an emergency services building with 24-hour emergency room and an urgent care center, adjacent to a medical arts building housing a medical imaging center and family medicine doctors. The 150-bed main hospital is located in Ravenna and the system operates additional facilities throughout Portage County. <a href="Free%20clinic">Free clinic</a>s include the AxessPointe Community Health Center, located just east of the city limits in the <a href="Joint%20Economic%20Development%20District">Joint Economic Development District</a> with Franklin Township, and a clinic in the downtown area operated by social agency Townhall II.

The earliest organized religious services in Kent were held in 1815 when a <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> group was formed, followed by a <a href="Congregational%20Christian%20Churches%23Congregationalism">Congregational</a> church in 1819. The first religious meetinghouse in Kent, which also served as the first schoolhouse, was built in 1817 and was used by several different denominations. Later, the Methodists built another building in 1828 that was also used by multiple denominations. The oldest church building in Kent still used as a place of worship is the <a href="Unitarian%20Universalist%20Church%20of%20Kent%20Ohio">Unitarian Universalist Church</a> on Gougler Avenue, which was dedicated in 1868. The former home of the Congregational Church was dedicated in 1858 and still stands along Gougler Avenue very near the Unitarian Universalist Church. It served as the home of the First Congregational Church—which became the Kent <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Christ">United Church of Christ</a> in 1964—until 1955. It was later purchased by a local business and is used as their corporate headquarters.

As of 2010, within the city are two <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> parishes affiliated with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Youngstown">Diocese of Youngstown</a>, one a family parish and one a <a href="Newman%20Centre">Newman Center</a>, as well as congregations of the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>, <a href="African%20Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">African Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, <a href="Free%20Methodist%20Church">Free Methodist Church</a>, United Church of Christ, <a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod">Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod</a>, <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Brethren">Church of the Brethren</a>, the <a href="Christian%20Church%20%28Disciples%20of%20Christ%29">Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a>, <a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20%28USA%29">Presbyterian Church</a>, <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Church of Christ</a>, <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a>, and <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>. There are also Unitarian Universalist, <a href="Non-denominational%20Christianity">non-denominational Christian</a>, and <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a> congregations. Although there are no Jewish <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s or temples, there is a Jewish student center on the campus of Kent State University which serves students at both Kent State and the <a href="University%20of%20Akron">University of Akron</a>. Just outside the city limits in Franklin Township are the Kent congregations of the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nazarene">Church of the Nazarene</a>, <a href="Assemblies%20of%20God">Assemblies of God</a>, as well as <a href="Baptists">Baptist</a> and <a href="Free%20Will%20Baptist">Free Will Baptist</a> churches. The <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic Society of Akron and Kent operates a <a href="mosque">masjid</a> and school on its main campus in Cuyahoga Falls, west of Kent. It was founded in Kent in 1979 and maintains an additional masjid in the city. Kent is also part of a <a href="Ward%20%28LDS%20Church%29">ward</a> of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> in <a href="Rootstown%20Township%2C%20Portage%20County%2C%20Ohio">Rootstown</a> that was first organized in Kent and includes most of southern Portage County.

Kent has produced and been home to a number of notable individuals in varying fields. Its natives and residents are referred to as "Kentites". <a href="John%20Davey%20%28tree%20surgeon%29">John Davey</a>, a pioneer in <a href="tree%20surgery">tree surgery</a> and founder of the Davey Tree Expert Company moved to Kent in the 1880s.

Bronwyn Bancroft

Bronwyn Bancroft (born 1958) is an <a href="Australian">Australian</a> artist, notable for being amongst the first Australian fashion designers invited to show her work in Paris. Born in <a href="Tenterfield">Tenterfield</a>, New South Wales, and trained in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> and <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Bancroft worked as a fashion designer, and is an artist, illustrator, and arts administrator.

In 1985, Bancroft established a shop called Designer Aboriginals, selling fabrics made by Aboriginal artists including herself. She was a founding member of <a href="Boomalli%20Aboriginal%20Artists%20Cooperative">Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative</a>. Art work by Bancroft is held by the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a> and the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Western%20Australia">Art Gallery of Western Australia</a>. She has provided art work for more than 20 children's books, including "Stradbroke Dreaming" by writer and activist <a href="Oodgeroo%20Noonuccal">Oodgeroo Noonuccal</a>, and books by artist and writer <a href="Sally%20Morgan%20%28artist%29">Sally Morgan</a>. She has received design commissions, including one for the exterior of a sports centre in Sydney.

Bancroft has a long history of involvement in community activism and arts administration, and has served as a board member for the National Gallery of Australia. Her painting "Prevention of AIDS" (1992) was used in a campaign to raise awareness of <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> in Australia. Bancroft has served on the boards of copyright collection agency Viscopy and Tranby Aboriginal College, and the Artists Board at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Sydney">Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney</a>.

A <a href="Bundjalung%20people">Bundjalung</a> woman, Bancroft was born in Tenterfield, a town in rural New South Wales, in 1958. She was the youngest of seven children of Owen Cecil Joseph Bancroft, known as "Bill"—an Aboriginal Australian from the <a href="Djanbun">Djanbun</a> clan—and Dot, who is of <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a>–<a href="Polish%20Australian">Polish</a> ancestry. Bancroft has said that her great-great-great-grandmother Pemau was one of only two or three survivors from her clan, the rest murdered when their land was settled by a white farmer. Her grandfather and uncle worked in local goldmines. She recalled that her father's education was obstructed by discrimination because he was Aboriginal. His lack of formal training meant that he had to work away from home cutting <a href="Railroad%20tie">railway sleepers</a>, while her mother worked at home as a dressmaker. Bancroft's father was an engineer during World War II, managing barges at <a href="Madang">Madang</a> and <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>.

Following her father's advice on the importance of getting an education or a trade, Bancroft completed high school in Tenterfield before moving to Canberra in 1976 with her husband-to-be <a href="Ned%20Manning">Ned Manning</a>, who had also been her teacher. There Bancroft completed a Diploma of Visual Communications through the Canberra School of Art, followed by a Master of Studio Practice and a Master of Visual Arts (Paintings) at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. She never returned to live in Tenterfield, although her three sisters were living there in 2004. Her father died around 1990. Bancroft has three children: Jack was born in 1985, Ella in 1988. She separated from Manning when they were very young; her third child Rubyrose was born in 1999. Jack was awarded NSW Young <a href="Australian%20of%20the%20Year">Australian of the Year</a> in 2010 for his work arranging the mentoring of Indigenous school students.

Bancroft was a founding member of the <a href="Boomalli%20Aboriginal%20Artists%20Co-operative">Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative</a>, one of Australia's oldest <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Indigenous%20art%20movements%20and%20cooperatives">Indigenous-run artists' organisations</a>, established in 1987. She served in the roles of chairperson, director, and treasurer during its first two decades. In 1985, she opened a shop in Sydney called Designer Aboriginals, selling the work of designers including her own fabrics, and staffed by her Indigenous female students. Bancroft, <a href="Euphemia%20Bostock">Euphemia Bostock</a> and <a href="Mini%20Heath">Mini Heath</a> were the first Australian fashion designers invited to show their works in Paris, where Bancroft's painted designs on cloth were exhibited at the 1987 Printemps Fashion Parade. Two years later, in 1989, she contributed to a London exhibition, "Australian Fashion: The Contemporary Art". Despite these successes, she moved away from the fashion industry, telling an interviewer in 2005 that she had not done fabric design for 15 years. Described as "an instinctive colourist", Bancroft has since worked primarily as a painter, and has developed "a glowing style reminiscent of stained glass windows". She has cited as influences the American painter <a href="Georgia%20O%27Keeffe">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, European painters <a href="Joan%20Mir%C3%B3">Joan Miró</a>, <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a>, and <a href="Marc%20Chagall">Marc Chagall</a>, and Australian Indigenous artists such as <a href="Emily%20Kngwarreye">Emily Kngwarreye</a>, <a href="Rover%20Thomas">Rover Thomas</a>, and Mary MacLean.

Although initially known as a fabric and textile designer, Bancroft has worked with many artistic media, including "jewellery design, painting, collage, illustration, sculpture and interior decoration". Art works by Bancroft are held by the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>, the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20Western%20Australia">Art Gallery of Western Australia</a> and the <a href="Queensland%20Art%20Gallery">Queensland Art Gallery</a>. The National Gallery holds one of her screenprints, "Entrapped", created in 1991. Between 1989 and 2006, Bancroft held eight solo exhibitions and participated in at least 53 group exhibitions, including shows at the <a href="Australian%20Museum">Australian Museum</a> in Sydney, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> in Canberra, and the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>. Her art has been exhibited in Indonesia, New Zealand, the USA, France, and Germany.

In 2004, Bancroft was commissioned to design a large mural covering the exterior of a sports centre housing two basketball courts at Tempe Reserve in <a href="Marrickville">Marrickville</a>, New South Wales. The mural depicts a snake, a man, and a woman, representing both biblical and Indigenous Australian creation stories. It also includes the <a href="goanna">goanna</a>, the ancestral totem of the Marrickville area's original inhabitants, the <a href="Wangal%20people">Wangal people</a>.

Bancroft ventured into illustrating children's books in 1993, when she provided the artwork for "Fat and Juicy Place" written by Dianna Kidd. The book was shortlisted for the <a href="Children%27s%20Book%20Council%20of%20Australia">Children's Book Council of Australia</a>'s Book of the Year and won the Australian Multicultural Children's Book Award. In the same year, she illustrated "Stradbroke Dreamtime" by Indigenous activist and writer <a href="Oodgeroo%20Noonuccal">Oodgeroo Noonuccal</a>. She was the third artist to have provided images for successive editions of the book, of which the first edition was released in 1972. Bancroft has since contributed artwork for over 20 children's books, including some by prominent Australian writer and artist <a href="Sally%20Morgan%20%28artist%29">Sally Morgan</a>, whom she regards as a mentor and friend. These books include "Dan's grandpa" (1996) and "Sam's bush journey" (2009). The two artists collaborated on an exhibition of prints at <a href="Warrnambool">Warrnambool</a> Art Gallery in Victoria in 1991. Researcher and museum curator Margo Neale has described the art of both Bancroft and Morgan as depicting "their relationship to country and family in generally high-keyed works, celebrating and commemorating through personal or collective stories in mainly figurative narratives."

As well as working with established writers, Bancroft has created a number of children's books in her own right, including "An Australian 1 2 3 of Animals" and "An Australian ABC of Animals", which have been favourably reviewed as imaginative and well-illustrated. Her style of illustration has been described as "bold and mysterious", and as "traditional Australian Aboriginal representation rendered in bright, eye-catching colors." In 2009 Bancroft received the <a href="Dromkeen%20Medal">Dromkeen Medal</a> for her contribution to children's literature. In May 2010, the Governor-General of Australia <a href="Quentin%20Bryce">Quentin Bryce</a> launched Bancroft's latest book, "Why I Love Australia". A long-time supporter of Bancroft's work, Ms Bryce said: ""Why I love Australia" is a work and title that, again, speaks volumes of its author and illustrator. It simply and exquisitely rejoices in telling a story of this magnificent, sacred land we share: the mountains, rivers and gorges; seas and coral reefs; grasslands and bushlands; saltpans and snow; houses and streets; the jewelled night sky, and so much more."

Bancroft's art has also appeared in the publications of a number of other individuals and organisations, including as cover art for books from the Australian Museum and the <a href="Department%20of%20Education%20and%20Training%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">New South Wales Education Department</a>, for <a href="Larissa%20Behrendt">Larissa Behrendt</a>'s novel "Home", and for <a href="Roberta%20Sykes">Roberta Sykes</a>'s controversial autobiographical narratives "Snake Cradle" and "Snake Dancing", among others.

Bancroft has been active in arts organisations, and served two terms on the board of the National Gallery of Australia during the 1990s. She was chair of the Visual Arts Board of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Department%20of%20the%20Arts%2C%20Sport%20and%20Recreation">New South Wales Ministry for the Arts</a>, and of the National Indigenous Arts Advocacy Organisation from 1993 to 1996. In the lead-up to the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> in Sydney, Bancroft was a member of the design committee that advised on the development of the games' official logo, and has acted as a judge for the $35,000 Country Energy Art Prize. Bancroft was a member of the board of directors of the Australian <a href="List%20of%20copyright%20collection%20societies">copyright collection agency</a>, Viscopy, and while serving in that position has been an advocate of <a href="Droit%20de%20suite">resale royalty rights</a> for artists. She has observed that "resale royalties are an intrinsic link to the improvement of the inherent rights of Australian artists to a fair income". She was a member of the Sydney Museum of Contemporary Art's Artist Advisory Group in 2005, and is a member of the Museum's Artists Board. She has served on the board of the Indigenous training organisation, Tranby Aboriginal College.

Within and beyond her artistic works, Bancroft has demonstrated concern for a range of social issues, particularly those affecting Indigenous Australians. Her painting "Prevention of AIDS" (1992) was reproduced on posters and postcards aimed at raising awareness of <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Australia">HIV/AIDS</a>, and was one of several of her images commissioned by the federal <a href="Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Ageing">Department of Health</a> to highlight issues regarding the disease in the Indigenous community. In 2000, two years after the death of activist <a href="Mum%20%28Shirl%29%20Smith">Mum (Shirl) Smith</a>, Bancroft and the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Indigenous%20art%20movements%20and%20cooperatives">Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative</a> organised a fund-raising exhibition of art works in Smith's honour.

Bancroft is a director of the Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience, a not-for-profit organisation that aims to increase senior high school and university admission rates for Indigenous students. She has taught and mentored Indigenous school students such as Jessica Birk, a winner of the <a href="Australia%20Council%20for%20the%20Arts">Australia Council</a>'s inaugural Emerging and Young Artist Award in May 2009.

Lycoperdon echinatum

Lycoperdon echinatum, commonly known as the spiny puffball or the spring puffball, is a type of <a href="puffball">puffball</a> mushroom in the genus "<a href="Lycoperdon">Lycoperdon</a>". The <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species has been found in Africa, Europe, Central America, and North America, where it grows on soil in <a href="temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous woods</a>, glades, and pastures. It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, "Lycoperdon americanum", but this suggestion has not been followed by most authors. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular analysis</a> indicates that "L. echinatum" is closely related to the puffball genus "<a href="Handkea">Handkea</a>".

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of "L. echinatum" are wide by tall, supported by a small base, and densely covered with spines that are up to long. The spines can fall off in maturity, leaving a net-like pattern of scars on the underlying surface. Initially white in color, the puffballs turn a dark brown as they mature, at the same time changing from nearly round to somewhat flattened. Young specimens of "L. echinatum" resemble another edible spiny puffball, "<a href="Lycoperdon%20pulcherrimum">Lycoperdon pulcherrimum</a>", but the latter species does not turn brown as it ages. The fruit bodies are <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> when young, when the interior is white and firm and before it has turned into a powdery brown mass of <a href="spore">spore</a>s. Laboratory tests have shown that <a href="extract">extract</a>s of the fruit bodies can inhibit the growth of several bacteria that are <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic to humans.

The species was first described by <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1797. It was later reduced to a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "Lycoperdon gemmatum" (as "L. gemmatum" var. "echinatum"; "L. gemmatum" is now known as "<a href="Lycoperdon%20perlatum">Lycoperdon perlatum</a>") by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a>, but American mycologist <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a>, who extensively studied the North American distribution of the genus, raised it again to species level in 1879. He thought it worthy of status as a species distinct from "L. gemmatum" because of the different character of its warts, its much spinier appearance, and the smoother surface of the <a href="peridium">peridium</a> underneath the spines. <a href="Miles%20Joseph%20Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Edmund%20Broome">Christopher Edmund Broome</a> wrote of the fungus in 1871, but believed their specimen, collected from <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a>, by Hoyle, represented a new species, which they called "Lycoperdon Hoylei". They wrote that their specimen agreed "exactly with an authentic specimen of Persoon's "L. echinatum" externally, who could, however, scarcely have overlooked the lilac spores." Despite the apparent difference in spore color, "L. Hoylei" is currently considered <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with "L. echinatum". "Utraria echinata", named by <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1873, is another synonym for "L. echinatum".

In 1972, <a href="Vincent%20Demoulin">Vincent Demoulin</a> described the species "Lycoperdon americanum" on the basis of a specimen found in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. Although he believed it to be a unique species, several authors consider it synonymous with "L. echinatum". <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis of the <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequence</a> and <a href="secondary%20structure">secondary structure</a> of the <a href="ribosomal%20RNA">ribosomal RNA</a> (rRNA) genes coding for the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> units suggests that "Lycoperdon echinatum" forms a <a href="clade">clade</a> with the puffball genus "<a href="Handkea">Handkea</a>", separate from the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "<a href="Lycoperdon">Lycoperdon</a>", "Lycoperdon perlatum". In previous analyses that used only the rRNA sequences for phylogenetic comparison, "L. echinatum" formed a clade with "<a href="Lycoperdon%20mammiforme">L. mammiforme</a>", "<a href="Lycoperdon%20foetidum">L. foetidum</a>", and "Bovistella radicata" (now known as "<a href="Lycoperdon%20radicatum">Lycoperdon radicatum</a>"), but separate from "<a href="Lycoperdon%20pyriforme">L. pyriforme</a>".

The species is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the "spiny puffball" or the "spring puffball"; Peck referred to the species as the "echinate puff-ball". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "echinatum" is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> word "echinos" (εχινος) meaning "hedgehog" or "sea-urchin".

The <a href="Basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> of "L. echinatum" are wide by tall, and are roughly spherical, or pear-shaped. The exterior surface is crowded with spines that may be up to long. According to <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a>, American specimens have more slender spines than European ones. Initially white and becoming dark brown in maturity, the spines are often joined at the tips in groups of three or four. In this form the puffballs resemble acorn caps of <a href="burr%20oak">burr oak</a>, with which they may readily be confused. The spines slough off in age, revealing a somewhat net-like or reticulated surface. The fruit body has a small base that is an off-white or purple-gray color, and it may be attached to the <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">growing surface</a> by thin white cords (<a href="rhizomorphs">rhizomorphs</a>). The internal contents of the puffball contain the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, a mass of <a href="spore">spore</a>s and associated spore-producing cells. In young specimens the gleba is white and firm, but as the puffball ages, it turns yellowish and then brown to purple-brown and powdery. Mature specimens develop a pore at the top of the fruit body through which spores are released when hit by falling raindrops.

The spores of "L. echinatum", roughly spherical with warts on the surface, have diameters between 4 and 6 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. The capillitia (coarse thick-walled <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e in the gleba) are elastic, brown in color, contain small pores, and are 5–8 µm thick. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (the spore-bearing cells) may be attached to two to four spores, and the <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> (tapered spine-like projections from the basidia that attach the spores) are up to 5 µm long.

Like most other puffball species, "L. echinatum" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> when still young and while the gleba is still white and firm. Consumption of older specimens with a non-white gleba, or where the gleba has turned into a powdery spore mass, may cause stomach upsets. This species has a mild taste, and no distinguishable odor, although one source describes the smell of dried fruit bodies as similar to "old ham". One source notes that it is "well flavoured and tender when cooked", while another describes the texture (of edible puffballs in general) as "somewhat like French toast". <a href="Antonio%20Carluccio">Antonio Carluccio</a> recommends <a href="saut%C3%A9e">sautée</a>ing puffballs with other mushrooms. To avoid possible confusion with potentially deadly "<a href="Amanita">Amanita</a>" species, it is recommended to slice young puffballs with a longitudinal cut to ensure that the flesh is devoid of any internal structures.

"Lycoperdon pulcherrimum" closely resembles "L. echinatum", but its spines are stouter, do not turn brown in age, and the surface of the fruit body underneath the spines is smooth, not pitted. <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> noted that in youth, they are "difficult if not impossible to distinguish from each other, but this will cause no inconvenience to those collecting for the table, since both are edible." In some areas the two species appear to <a href="intergrade">intergrade</a>, as specimens may be found whose spines turn brown but do not fall off. Young specimens of "<a href="Lycoperdon%20pedicellatum">L. pedicellatum</a>" may also be difficult to distinguish from "L. echinatum", but the former has a smooth outer surface when mature, and has spores attached to a pedicel (a narrow extension of the basidium on which the sterigmata and spores are formed) that is about 4–5 times as long as the spore. "<a href="Lycoperdon%20compactum">Lycoperdon compactum</a>", found only in New Zealand, also resembles "L. echinatum" in appearance, but differs in having smaller spores, capillitia that are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) and septate (with partitions that divide the capillitia into compartments).

"Lycoperdon echinatum" can be found either solitary or in small groups. It typically grows on the ground in <a href="temperate%20deciduous%20forest">deciduous forests</a> and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on <a href="moss">moss</a>, <a href="humus">humus</a>, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for <a href="beech">beech</a> woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens are more likely to be overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of dead leaves and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family <a href="Phoridae">Phoridae</a>) as <a href="larvae">larval</a> food.

This species has been collected from eastern central Africa, China, Costa Rica, Iran, Japan, and Europe (including Britain, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Italy, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland). In North America, it is "locally frequent" east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

It is considered a <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a> in the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a> of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in <a href="beech">beech</a> woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in <a href="topsoil">topsoil</a>s with <a href="soil%20pH">soil pH</a> levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to <a href="soil%20acidification">soil acidification</a> during the last several decades. Fruit bodies collected near <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>-contaminated sites have been shown to <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> arsenic, largely in the form of <a href="arsenobetaine">arsenobetaine</a>.

Using a <a href="Kirby-Bauer%20antibiotic%20testing">standard laboratory method</a> to determine <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> susceptibility, <a href="methanol">methanol</a>-based <a href="extract">extract</a>s of "Lycoperdon umbrinum" fruit bodies were shown in a 2005 study to have "significant" antibacterial activity against various human <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic bacteria, including "<a href="Bacillus%20subtilis">Bacillus subtilis</a>", "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>", "<a href="Salmonella%20typhimurium">Salmonella typhimurium</a>", "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>", "<a href="Streptococcus%20pyogenes">Streptococcus pyogenes</a>", and "<a href="Mycobacterium%20smegmatis">Mycobacterium smegmatis</a>". An earlier study (2000) had identified weak antibacterial activity against "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecium">Enterococcus faecium</a>" and "Staphylococcus aureus". Although the specific compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity have not been identified, chemical analysis confirms the presence of <a href="terpenoid">terpenoid</a>s, a class of widely occurring organic chemicals that are being investigated for their potential use as antimicrobial drugs.

The Battle of Alexander at Issus

The Battle of Alexander at Issus (German: Alexanderschlacht) is a 1529 <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> by the German artist <a href="Albrecht%20Altdorfer">Albrecht Altdorfer</a> (c. 1480–1538), a pioneer of <a href="landscape%20art">landscape art</a> and a founding member of the <a href="Danube%20school">Danube school</a>. It portrays the 333 BC <a href="Battle%20of%20Issus">Battle of Issus</a>, in which <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> secured a decisive victory over <a href="Darius%20III%20of%20Persia">Darius III of Persia</a> and gained crucial leverage in his campaign against the <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian Empire</a>. The painting is widely regarded as Altdorfer's masterpiece, and is one of the most famous examples of the type of Renaissance landscape painting known as the <a href="world%20landscape">world landscape</a>, which here reaches an unprecedented grandeur.

<a href="William%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke William IV of Bavaria</a> commissioned "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" in 1528 as part of a set of historical pieces that was to hang in his <a href="Munich">Munich</a> residence. Modern commentators suggest that the painting, through its abundant use of <a href="anachronism">anachronism</a>, was intended to liken Alexander's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. In particular, the defeat of <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Vienna">Siege of Vienna</a> may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer. A religious undercurrent is detectable, especially in the extraordinary sky; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a> and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending <a href="apocalypse">apocalypse</a>. "The Battle of Alexander at Issus " and four others that were part of William's initial set are in the <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a> art museum in Munich.

<a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Macedon">Alexander III of Macedon</a> (356–323 BC), best known as Alexander the Great, was an <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> king of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a> who reigned from 336 BC until his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history, and is presumed undefeated in battle. Renowned for his military leadership and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle. By conquering the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> and unifying <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, Egypt and <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, he forged the largest empire of the <a href="ancient%20world">ancient world</a> and effected the spread of <a href="Hellenization">Hellenism</a> throughout Europe and Northern Africa.

Alexander embarked on his expedition to conquer the Persian Empire in the spring of 334 BC, having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might. During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, <a href="Darius%20III%20of%20Persia">Darius III</a> – king of Persia – largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000 men. The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Granicus">Battle of the Granicus</a>, fought in May, was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the <a href="satrap">satrap</a>ies in his path. He continued inland, travelling northeast through <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> before turning southeast toward <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. After passing the <a href="Cilician%20Gates">Cilician Gates</a> in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">Tarsus</a>. Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000) and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the <a href="Amanus%20Mountains">Amanus Mountains</a>. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Issus">Gulf of Issus</a> from <a href="Mallus%20%28city%29">Mallus</a> via <a href="Issus%20%28town%29">Issus</a>, the two armies inadvertently passed one another on opposite sides of the mountains. This was decidedly to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus. It was not until Alexander had encamped at <a href="Myriandrus">Myriandrus</a>, a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of İskenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the <a href="Pinarus%20River">Pinarus River</a>, just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank. The Battle of Issus ensued.

Darius' initial response was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned himself in the centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army. A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by <a href="Nabarsanes">Nabarsanes</a> occupied the Persian right.

Alexander made a cautious and slow advance, intending to base his strategy on the structure of the Persian force. He led a flank of his <a href="Companion%20cavalry">Companion cavalry</a> on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware of the importance of the foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.

When within missile range of the enemy, Alexander gave the order to charge. He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian left wing, commanded by <a href="Parmenion">Parmenion</a>, was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central <a href="Phalanx%20formation">phalanx</a> crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander and the rest of his army. When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's left wing.

Upon realising that the onslaught of Alexander's Companion cavalry was unstoppable, Darius and his army fled. Many were killed in the rush, trampled by those who fled with them or collapsed with their horses. Some escaped to regions as remote as Egypt, and others reunited with Darius in the north. The onset of darkness ended the chase after approximately ; Alexander then recalled his army and set about burying the dead. Darius' family were left behind in the Persian camp; it is reported that Alexander treated them well and reassured them of Darius' safety. Darius' royal chariot was found discarded in a ditch, as were his bow and shield.

Ancient sources present disparate casualty figures for the Battle of Issus. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> and <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, in contrast with the 450 Macedonian deaths reported by <a href="Quintus%20Curtius%20Rufus">Quintus Curtius Rufus</a>. In any case, it is probable that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle; <a href="Ptolemy%20I">Ptolemy I</a>, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.

The Macedonian conquest of Persia continued until 330 BC, when Darius was killed and Alexander took his title as king. Alexander died in 323 BC, having recently returned from campaigning in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. The <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great%23Death">cause of death</a> remains a subject of debate.

<a href="Albrecht%20Altdorfer">Albrecht Altdorfer</a> is regarded as one of the founders of Western <a href="landscape%20art">landscape art</a>. He was a painter, <a href="etcher">etcher</a>, architect, and <a href="engraver">engraver</a>, and the leader of the <a href="Danube%20school">Danube school</a> of German art. As evidenced by such paintings as "<a href="Saint%20George%20and%20the%20Dragon">Saint George and the Dragon</a>" (1510) and "" (1531), much of Altdorfer's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them; "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" epitomises this facet of his style. With reference to "St George and the Dragon" in particular, art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that "The accessory material of landscape [in Altdorfer's work] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment". Inspired by his travels around the <a href="Austrian%20Alps">Austrian Alps</a> and the <a href="Danube%20River">Danube River</a>, Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all, including "" (c. 1516) and "" (c. 1522–25). These were the first "pure" landscapes since antiquity. Most of Altdorfer's landscapes were made with a vertical format, in contrast with the modern conception of the genre. The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer's <a href="Flemish">Flemish</a> contemporary <a href="Joachim%20Patinir">Joachim Patinir</a> and his followers.

Altdorfer also produced a great deal of religious artwork, in reflection of his devout Catholicism. His most frequent subjects were the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> and the life and <a href="crucifixion%20of%20Christ">crucifixion of Christ</a>. As in "The Battle of Alexander at Issus", these paintings often feature settings of great majesty and use the sky to convey symbolic meaning. This meaning is not uniform throughout Altdorfer's corpus – for example, the visage of the setting sun connotes loss and tragedy in "", but serves as "the emblem of power and glory" in "The Battle of Alexander at Issus".

Larry Silver of "<a href="The%20Art%20Bulletin">The Art Bulletin</a>" explains that "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" is both similar to and in direct contrast with Altdorfer's previous work: "Instead of the peaceful landscape of retreat for Christian events or holy figures, this panel offers just the opposite: a battleground for one of ancient history's principal epoch-making encounters ... Yet despite its global or cosmic dimensions, the "Battle of Issus" still "looks like" Altdorfer's earlier, contemplative liminal landscapes of retreat, complete with craggy peaks, bodies of water, and distant castles."

Although the "Battle of Alexander" is atypical of Altdorfer in its size and in that it depicts war, his "Triumphal Procession" – a 1512–16 <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a> commissioned by <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire</a> – has been described as a conceptual antecedent. The "Procession" was produced in parallel with the "Triumph of Maximilian", a series of 137 <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s collaboratively executed by Altdorfer, <a href="Hans%20Springinklee">Hans Springinklee</a>, <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a>, <a href="Leonhard%20Beck">Leonhard Beck</a> and <a href="Hans%20Leonhard%20Sch%C3%A4ufelein">Hans Schäufelein</a>.

Altdorfer's most significant contemporary influence was <a href="Matthias%20Gr%C3%BCnewald">Matthias Grünewald</a> (c. 1470–1528). Art historian <a href="Horst%20W.%20Janson">Horst W. Janson</a> remarked that their paintings "show the same 'unruly' imagination". Elements of "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" – particularly the sky – have been compared to Grünewald's "Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child", which forms part of his masterpiece, the <a href="Isenheim%20Altarpiece">Isenheim Altarpiece</a>. <a href="Lucas%20Cranach%20the%20Elder">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> (1472–1553), also associated with the Danube school, was another important influence for Altdorfer. According to Roskill, works by Cranach from about 1500 "give a prominent role to landscape settings, using them as mood-enhancing backgrounds for portraits, and for images of hermits and visionary saints", and seem to play a "preparatory role" for the onset of pure landscape. Altdorfer owed much of his style, particularly in his religious artwork, to <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> (1471–1528); Larry Silver writes that Altdorfer's "use of convincing German landscapes in combination with celestial phenomena for his religious narrative" is "firmly tied" to a tradition "modeled by Albrecht Dürer."

<a href="William%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">William IV, Duke of Bavaria</a> commissioned "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" in 1528. Altdorfer was approximately 50 at the time, and was living in the <a href="Free%20Imperial%20City">Free Imperial City</a> of <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>. As a result of over a decade of involvement with the Regensburg city council, Altdorfer was offered the position of <a href="Burgomaster">Burgomaster</a> on 18 September 1528. He declined; the council annals reported his reasoning as such: "He much desires to execute a special work in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord, Duke [William]." William probably wanted the painting for his newly built summer "Lusthaus" ("pleasure house") in the grounds of <a href="Munich%20Residence">his palace</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, approximately south of Regensburg. There, it was to hang alongside seven other paintings with a similar format and subject matter, including <a href="Ludwig%20Refinger">Ludwig Refinger</a>'s "The Matyrdom of Marcus Curtius", <a href="Melchior%20Feselen">Melchior Feselen</a>'s "<a href="Battle%20of%20Alesia">The Siege of Alesia</a> by Caesar", and the painting of "<a href="Battle%20of%20Cannae">Battle of Cannae</a>" by <a href="Hans%20Burgkmair">Hans Burgkmair</a> (1473–1531). Another eight, each portraying a famous woman from history, were later added to the set, probably at the behest of the Duke's wife, Jacobaea of Baden. Altdorfer's "Susanna and the Elders" (1526) was among these.

Earlier depictions of the Battle of Issus are few. "Battle of Issus", a <a href="fresco">fresco</a> by <a href="Philoxenus%20of%20Eretria">Philoxenus of Eretria</a>, is probably the first such. It was painted sometime around 310 BC for <a href="Cassander">Cassander</a> (c. 350–297 BC), who was one of Alexander the Great's successors. Alexander and Darius – each within a lance's length of the other – are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers. While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence, fear is etched in Darius' face, and his charioteer has already turned to rein his horses and escape. Roman author and natural philosopher <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> claimed that Philoxenus' portrayal of the battle was "inferior to none". Some modern critics posit that "Battle of Issus" might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece, she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the <a href="Temple%20of%20Peace%2C%20Rome">Temple of Peace</a> during the time of <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>.

The <a href="Alexander%20Mosaic">Alexander Mosaic</a>, a <a href="floor%20mosaic">floor mosaic</a> dating from c. 100 BC, is believed to be a "reasonably faithful" copy of "Battle of Issus", though an alternative view holds it might instead be a copy of a work painted by <a href="Apelles%20of%20Kos">Apelles of Kos</a>, who produced several portraits of Alexander the Great. It measures , and consists of approximately 1.5 million <a href="tesserae">tesserae</a> (coloured tiles), each about square. The mosaicist is unknown. Since the mosaic was not rediscovered until 1831, during excavations of <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>'s <a href="House%20of%20the%20Faun">House of the Faun</a>, Altdorfer could never have seen it. It was later moved to the <a href="Naples%20National%20Archaeological%20Museum">Naples National Archaeological Museum</a> in <a href="Naples">Naples, Italy</a>, where it currently resides.

"The Battle of Alexander at Issus" is painted on a <a href="limewood">limewood</a> <a href="panel%20painting">panel</a> measuring , and portrays the moment of Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made to be the same size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.

Thousands of horse and foot soldiers immersed in a sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre.

Beyond is the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and the island of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Here, a transition in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in the lower half of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The <a href="Nile%20River">Nile River</a> meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>. South of Cyprus is the <a href="Sinai%20Peninsula">Sinai Peninsula</a>, which forms a <a href="land%20bridge">land bridge</a> between Africa and Southwest Asia. The <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.

A fierce sky caught in the dichotomy between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates more than a third of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the <a href="Tower%20of%20Babel">Tower of Babel</a> are cloaked in shadow.

The painting's subject is explained in the tablet suspended from the heavens. The wording, probably supplied by William's court historian <a href="Johannes%20Aventinus">Johannes Aventinus</a>, was originally in German but was later replaced by a Latin inscription. It translates:
Alexander the Great defeating the last Darius, after 100,000 infantry and more than 10,000 cavalrymen had been killed amongst the ranks of the Persians. Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1,000 horsemen, his mother, wife, and children were taken prisoner.
No date is provided for the battle alongside these casualty figures. The lower left-hand corner features Altdorfer's <a href="monogram">monogram</a> – an 'A' within an 'A' – and the lower edge of the tablet is inscribed with "" ("Albrecht Altdorfer from Regensburg made [this]"). Tiny inscriptions on their chariot and harness identify Darius and Alexander, respectively. Each army bears a banner that reports both its total strength and its future casualties.

Anachronism is a major component of "The Battle of Alexander at Issus". By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict. In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> <a href="Siege%20of%20Vienna">laid siege</a> to the <a href="Austria">Austria</a>n city of <a href="Vienna%2C%20Austria">Vienna</a>, then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.

In his "Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time", historian <a href="Reinhart%20Koselleck">Reinhart Koselleck</a> discusses Altdorfer's representation of time in a more philosophical light. After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting's contemporary context, he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis argues: "... for [Altdorfer], 4th-century Persians look like 16th-century Turks not because he does not know the difference, but because the difference does not matter ... The "Alexanderschlacht", in other words, exemplifies a premodern, "untemporalized" sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness ... Altdorfer's historical overlays evince an <a href="eschatology">eschatological</a> vision of history, evidence that the 16th century (and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) remained locked in a static, constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same ... In such a system there can be no "event" as such: anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history, which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated ..."

Featured alongside the anachronism in "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" is a genuine lack of historicity. Altdorfer demonstrates minimal hesitance in neglecting the painting's historical integrity for the sake of its heroic style, in spite of the pains he took to research the battle. That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear, and the relative positioning of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded. According to art critic Rose-Marie Hagen, "The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him, when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition." Hagen also notes the historically baseless inclusion of women on the battlefield, attributing it to Altdorfer's "passion for invention" and saying they "look like German courtly ladies, dressed for a hunting party" in their feathered <a href="toque">toque</a>s.

Altdorfer's primary point of reference in his research was probably <a href="Hartmann%20Schedel">Hartmann Schedel</a>'s "<a href="Nuremberg%20Chronicle">Nuremberg Chronicle</a>" ("Schedelsche Weltchronik"), an illustrated world history published in <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his "Chronicle" was one of the first books produced on the <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the <a href="Six%20ages%20of%20the%20world">seven ages</a> of human history, from <a href="Creation%20according%20to%20Genesis">Creation</a> to the birth of Christ and ending with the <a href="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>. Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in "The Battle of Alexander at Issus": the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist. Since the "Chronicle" describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">Apostle</a> <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a>, which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal. Another source may have been the writings of <a href="Quintus%20Curtius%20Rufus">Quintus Curtius Rufus</a>, a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.

The sky bears overt metaphorical significance and is the centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, a symbol of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>. Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents <a href="Christendom">Christendom</a>'s victory over the <a href="Islamism">Islamism</a> of the Ottomans. <a href="eschatology">Eschatological</a> meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a>, is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, <a href="Daniel%207">Daniel 7</a> predicts the rise and fall of four kingdoms before the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a>; these were thought to be <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance. The battle also marked a progression toward the <a href="Eschatology">end of the world</a> – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the <a href="papacy">papacy</a>. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh. It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.

"The Battle of Alexander at Issus" remained part of the royal collection of the Dukes of Bavaria for centuries. By the late 18th century, it was regularly featured in public galleries at the <a href="Schleissheim%20Palace">Schleissheim Palace</a>. The painting was one of 72 taken to Paris in 1800 by the invading armies of <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon I</a> (1769–1821), who was a noted admirer of Alexander the Great. The <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> held it until 1804, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France and took it for his own use. When the <a href="Prussian">Prussian</a>s captured the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Saint-Cloud">Château de Saint-Cloud</a> in 1814 as part of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">War of the Sixth Coalition</a>, they supposedly found the painting hanging in Napoleon's bathroom.

"The Battle of Alexander at Issus" and 26 others taken in the 1800 invasion were subsequently restored to the <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">King of Bavaria</a> in 1815. Five of the paintings in William IV's original set of eight – including "The Battle of Alexander at Issus" – later passed from the royal collection to the <a href="Alte%20Pinakothek">Alte Pinakothek</a> art museum in <a href="Munich%2C%20Germany">Munich, Germany</a>, where they remain; the other three are in the <a href="Nationalmuseum">National Museum of Fine Arts</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, having been looted by the Swedish army in the <a href="Thirty%20Years%20War">Thirty Years War</a> of 1618–1648. "Susannah and the Elders" is the only other work by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek.

Contextually, the painting forms part of the <a href="Northern%20Renaissance">Northern Renaissance</a>, a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Renaissance induced a new kind of social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of the painting's commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: "During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them."

Altdorfer was not only a pioneer of landscape, but also a practitioner of early incarnations of the <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and <a href="expressionism">expressionism</a> which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Grünewald and <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Bosch</a>, "They are what we now call 'expressionist' artists, a term which is not as worthless as it sounds, because, in fact, the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent, and we find in the work of these early 16th-century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as <a href="van%20Gogh">van Gogh</a>, <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a>, <a href="Graham%20Sutherland">Graham Sutherland</a> and <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>." According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, "Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale" in the "Battle of Alexander at Issus", and his "spiritual and aesthetic affinities with <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and Modern art (in particular, <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionism</a>)", "have been especially singled out for praise".

"The Battle of Alexander at Issus" is typically considered to be Altdorfer's <a href="masterpiece">masterpiece</a>. Cuneo states that the painting is usually "considered in splendid isolation from its fifteen other companion pieces, based on the assumption that it either metonymically stands in for the entire cycle, or that its perceived aesthetic predominance merits exclusive focus." German writer <a href="Karl%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Schlegel">Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel</a> (1772–1829) was one of many who saw the painting in the Louvre and marvelled, calling it a "small painted <a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". Reinhart Koselleck comments that Altdorfer's depiction of the thousands of soldiers was executed with "a mastery previously unknown", and Kathleen Davis describes the painting as "epochal in every sense".

Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg

Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg (26 June 1760 – 25 March 1799) was an Austrian military commander. He achieved the rank of <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> and died at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Battle of Stockach</a>.

The third son of a <a href="cadet%20branch">cadet branch</a> of the House of <a href="House%20of%20F%C3%BCrstenberg%20%28Swabia%29">Fürstenberg</a>, at his birth his chances of inheriting the family title of "<a href="F%C3%BCrst">Fürst</a> zu Fürstenberg" were slight; he was prepared instead for a military career, and a tutor was hired to teach him the <a href="military%20science">military science</a>s. He entered the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> military in 1777, at the age of seventeen years, and was a member of the field army in the short <a href="War%20of%20the%20Bavarian%20Succession">War of the Bavarian Succession</a> (1778–79). His career progressed steadily during the <a href="Austro-Turkish%20War%20%281788%E2%80%931791%29">Habsburg War with the Ottoman Empire</a>. In particular he distinguished himself at <a href="%C5%A0abac">Šabac</a> in 1790, when he led his troops in storming the fortress on the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> river.

During the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, he fought with distinction again for the <a href="First%20Coalition">First Coalition</a>, particularly at <a href="Ketsch">Ketsch</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Froeschwiller%20%281793%29">Frœschwiller</a>, and in 1796 at <a href="Battle%20of%20Emmendingen">Emmendingen</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Schliengen">Schliengen</a> and <a href="Siege%20of%20Kehl%20%281796%E2%80%9397%29">Kehl</a>. He was stationed at key points to protect the movements of the Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a> at <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a>, and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at <a href="Bellheim">Bellheim</a>; his troops also overran <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a> without any losses. By the end of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a>, he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Ostrach">Ostrach</a> on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a regiment of <a href="grenadiers">grenadiers</a>, he was hit by French <a href="Canister%20shot">case shot</a> and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward.

As the third son of a cadet (junior) branch of the Fürstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was prepared for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and came into contact with important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as "Kreis-Obristen", or Colonel of the <a href="Imperial%20Circle">Imperial Circle</a>, by the time he was ten years old. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister <a href="Count%20Franz%20Moritz%20von%20Lacy">Count Franz Moritz von Lacy</a> and <a href="Baron%20Ernst%20Gideon%20von%20Laudon">Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon</a>; he was also invited to dine with <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Joseph II</a>. He started his service in 1777 as a "<a href="F%C3%A4hnrich">Fähnrich</a>" (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Bavarian%20Succession">War of the Bavarian Succession</a> (1777–78), although he was not involved in any battles.

In 1780, at the age of twenty years, he was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a>, and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment, also known as the "Anton Esterházy", named for <a href="Paul%20II%20Anton%20Esterh%C3%A1zy">Paul II Anton Esterházy</a>, the general of cavalry, <a href="field%20marshal">field marshal</a> of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, and ambassador to Britain. While he was assigned to this unit, he participated in the border conflicts between the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and the Habsburgs, 1787–92, and stormed the fortress at <a href="%C5%A0abac">Šabac</a> (German: "Schabatz") on the <a href="Sava">Sava River</a> in Serbia on 27 April 1788. For his action at Šabac, he was personally commended by the Emperor; on the following day, he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> and given command of a <a href="grenadier">grenadier</a> battalion.

On 1 January 1790, at Laudon's explicit request, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was promoted to <a href="Major%20General">major general</a>; at the end of June of that year, he received the coveted position of second colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment "Anton Esterhazy", where he served as the executive officer for <a href="Anton%20%28Antal%29%2C%20F%C3%BCrst%20Esterh%C3%A1zy%20de%20Gal%C3%A1ntha">Antal, Prince Esterházy de Galántha</a>, the 34th Hungarian Regiment's <a href="Proprietor%20%28Inhaber%29">Colonel and Proprietor</a>. This was a customary appointment in which a less prominent officer completed the day-to-day administrative duties of the Colonel and Proprietor, who was usually a noble and was often posted in a different assignment, sometimes a different staff location. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg also received the <a href="Chivalric%20order">confraternal</a> <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20St.%20Hubert">Order of Saint Hubert</a> from the <a href="Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke of Bavaria</a> and married the "elegant" Princess Elisabeth of <a href="Thurn%20und%20Taxis">Thurn und Taxis</a> (1767–1822), that year.

While Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois class—the <a href="Estates%20General%20%28France%29">First</a> and <a href="Estates%20General%20%28France%29">Third</a> estates—led a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold</a> succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French "émigré" nobles and <a href="Frederick%20William%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William II</a> of Prussia, he issued the <a href="Declaration%20of%20Pillnitz">Declaration of Pillnitz</a>, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the <a href="French%20National%20Convention">French National Convention</a> declared war on Austria. In the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> (1792–1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.

In the early days of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg remained as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps, approximately 10,000 men, under the overall command of <a href="Anton%20%28Antal%29%2C%20F%C3%BCrst%20Esterh%C3%A1zy%20de%20Gal%C3%A1ntha">Anton, Prince Esterházy</a>. He was stationed in the <a href="Breisgau">Breisgau</a>, a Habsburg territory between the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> and the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the <a href="Cantons%20of%20Switzerland">Swiss Cantons</a>, or north-central Germany. His brigade defended <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a>, a small village immediately across the Rhine from <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north, in present-day Belgium, near the cities of <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a> and <a href="Trier">Trier</a>, and at <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> on the <a href="Main%20River">Main River</a>.

In the second year of the war, Fürstenberg was transferred to the cavalry of <a href="Dagobert%20Sigmund%20von%20Wurmser">Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser</a>, in the Army of the Upper Rhine, and placed in charge of the advance guard near <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a>, which was still held by the French. On 30 March, he crossed the Rhine by <a href="Ketsch">Ketsch</a> at the head of the advance guard, which included 9,000 men. He took the city of Speyer on 1 April, in the absence of the commander of the city, <a href="Adam-Philippe%20de%20Custine">Adam-Philippe de Custine</a>, who was away with most of his troops; those that remained behind simply abandoned the city. On the following day, Fürstenberg occupied the town of <a href="Germersheim">Germersheim</a>. His first combat action of the war occurred on 3 April, when Custine's infantry attacked him in a bayonet charge near the villages of <a href="Bellheim">Bellheim</a>, <a href="H%C3%B6rdt">Hördt</a> and <a href="Leimersheim">Leimersheim</a>, and afterward at <a href="Landau">Landau</a> and <a href="Lauterburg">Lauterburg</a>. During these attacks, he lost all the ground he had gained in the days before. After these events, he was again transferred, this time to the command of the Regiment "Count von Kavanagh", where he continued to distinguish himself during the French counter-offensive of October–November 1793. In the action around <a href="Geudertheim">Geidertheim</a>, on the <a href="Zorn%20River">Zorn River</a>, he assisted Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Gabriel%20Anton%2C%20Baron%20Spl%C3%A9ny%20de%20Mih%C3%A1ldy">Gabriel Anton, Baron Splény de Miháldy</a>, in repelling a French counter-attack. Shortly afterward, he became very ill and, in December 1793, was sent to the <a href="Hagenau">Hagenau</a> to recover. On 22 December, he rejoined Wurmser's Corps for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Froeschwiller%20%281793%29">Battle of Froeschwiller</a> against <a href="Lazare%20Hoche">Lazare Hoche</a> and <a href="Charles%20Pichegru">Charles Pichegru</a>. After the French retreated over the Rhine at <a href="H%C3%BCningen">Hüningen</a>, near <a href="Basel%2C%20Switzerland">Basel</a>, he directed the construction of its new fortifications.

In June 1796, Fürstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions, 13 artillery pieces, and the "<a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>" (Volunteers) "Gyulay" and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and <a href="Rastatt">Rastatt</a>. On 26 June 1796, the French troops of the <a href="Army%20of%20Rhin-et-Moselle">Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle</a> crossed the Rhine and chased the <a href="Swabian%20Circle">Swabian Circle's military contingent</a> out of Kehl. In June 1796, <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a> added the contingent to Fürstenberg's command, making him the <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n's "Feldzeugmeister", or General of Infantry. Fürstenberg's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived, and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the <a href="Danube">Upper Danube Valley</a>. The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July, and Fürstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter-offensive. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Emmendingen">Battle of Emmendingen</a> on 19 October 1796, his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory. General <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Marie%20Moreau">Jean Victor Marie Moreau</a>'s Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. Fürstenberg held <a href="Kenzingen">Kenzingen</a>, north of <a href="Riegel%20am%20Kaiserstuhl">Riegel</a> on the <a href="Elz%20%28Rhine%29">Elz River</a>. Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was ordered to <a href="feint">feint</a> against Riegel, to protect the primary Austrian positions at <a href="Rust%2C%20Germany">Rust</a> and <a href="Kappel-Grafenhausen">Kappel</a>.

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Schliengen">Battle of Schliengen</a> (24 October 1796), Fürstenberg commanded the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed the force of General of Division <a href="Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">Gouvion Saint-Cyr</a>, holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While <a href="Maximilian%20Anton%20Karl%2C%20Count%20Baillet%20de%20Latour">Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour</a>, engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal Fürstenberg the command of the forces besieging <a href="H%C3%BCningen">Hüningen</a>, which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. Charles' confidence in his young field marshal was well-placed. On 27 November, Fürstenberg's chief engineer opened and drained the water-filled moat protecting the French fortifications. Fürstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead, General of Brigade <a href="Jean%20Charles%20Abbatucci">Jean Charles Abbatucci</a>, the opportunity to surrender, which he declined. In the night of 30 November to 1 December, Fürstenberg's force stormed the bridgehead twice, but was twice repulsed. In one of these attacks, the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December. Fürstenberg maintained the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kehl%20%281796%E2%80%9397%29">Siege of Kehl</a> while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl.

After the French capitulation at Kehl (10 January 1797), Fürstenberg received additional forces with which he could end the siege at Hüningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding Hüningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division <a href="Georges%20Joseph%20Dufour">Georges Joseph Dufour</a>, the new French commander, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, Fürstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as <a href="Proprietor%20%28Inhaber%29">Colonel and Proprietor</a> of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799.

The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun%20%281792%29">Verdun</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Neerwinden%20%281793%29">Neerwinden</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mainz">Mainz</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Amberg">Amberg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>, but in northern Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a>. The efforts of <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in northern <a href="Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">Italy</a> pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at <a href="Peace%20of%20Leoben">Leoben</a> on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal <a href="Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Treaty of Campo Formio</a>, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.

When the war ended, Fürstenberg stayed at the <a href="Donaueschingen">Donaueschingen</a> estate of his cousin, Karl Joachim Aloys, who had recently inherited the family title as "Fürst zu Fürstenberg". Later in 1797, he traveled to Prague and remained with his family until May 1798, when he received a posting to a new division in <a href="Linz">Linz</a>. His daughter, Maria Anna, was born after he left, on 17 September 1798.

Despite the longed-for peace, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Ferdinand IV of Naples</a> refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the <a href="Parthenopaean%20Republic">Parthenopaean Republic</a>. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the <a href="Swiss%20Confederation">Swiss Confederation</a> and the establishment of the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a>. On his way to <a href="Napoleon%27s%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a> in Spring 1798, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> had stopped on the <a href="Malta%23History">Island of Malta</a> and removed the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Hospitallers</a> from their possessions. This angered <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul, Tsar of Russia</a>, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281798%E2%80%931800%29">French occupation</a> of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a> was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.
As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean Baptiste Jourdan</a> and his 25,000-man <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Danube">Army of the Danube</a> crossed the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a>. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, <a href="Generalissimo">Generalissimo</a> <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Alexander Suvorov</a>. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.

At the outbreak of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory, just north of the <a href="Free%20imperial%20city">free and Imperial</a> city of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. Fürstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg, crossing the <a href="Lech%20River">Lech River</a>.

The French advanced guard arrived in <a href="Ostrach">Ostrach</a> on 8–9 March, and over the next week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts, while the rest of the French army arrived. Jourdan disposed his 25,000 troops along a line from <a href="Salem%20Abbey">Salem Abbey</a> and <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a> to the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> river, centered in Ostrach. He established his command headquarters at the imperial city of <a href="Pfullendorf">Pfullendorf</a>, overlooking the entire Ostrach valley. Jourdan was expecting <a href="Dominique%20Vandamme">Dominique Vandamme</a>'s troops to arrive in time to support his far north flank near the river, but Vandamme had gone to <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a> to investigate a rumored presence of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the main army. Consequently, the French left flank, under command of <a href="Laurent%20de%20Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">Gouvion Saint-Cyr</a>, was thinly manned. Jourdan thought he had more time, expecting Charles would need still three or four days to move his troops across the Lech, and march to Ostrach, but by the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000 mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at <a href="Kempten">Kempten</a>, the center near <a href="Memmingen">Memmingen</a>, and the right flank extended to <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>.

By 21 March, the French and Austrian outposts overlapped, and skirmishing intensified. Charles had divided his force into four columns. Fürstenberg covered the northern flank of the Archduke's main force. Fürstenberg's force pushed the French out of <a href="Davidsweiler">Davidsweiler</a>, and then advanced on <a href="Ruppersweiler">Ruppersweiler</a> and <a href="Einhard">Einhard</a>, 5 kilometers (3 mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr did not have the manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with Fürstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal. Fürstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of the northern part of the French line. After their success in driving the French back from <a href="Ostrach">Ostrach</a>, and then from the heights of <a href="Pfullendorf">Pfullendorf</a>, the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach, and then another five miles or so to <a href="Engen%2C%20Germany">Engen</a>.

On the morning of what they suspected would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the <a href="Holy%20Sacraments">sacraments</a> because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, with the possible exception of <a href="Dominique%20Vandamme">Dominique Vandamme</a>, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.

In the course of the battle, Jourdan's forces were supposed to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left, center and right of the Austrian line. On the French right, <a href="Joseph%20Souham">Souham</a>'s and Ferino's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back. Having stopped Souham's and Ferino's assault, Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre's force. At that point, Vandamme's men moved into action. Because Souham's assault at the center had been stalled, Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat, but the Austrians were hard pressed and the action furious. At one point, Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action, to the dismay of the old soldiers. Fürstenberg reportedly said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the head of the grenadiers) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight. As Fürstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French. Although he was carried alive off the field, he died almost immediately. Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle, and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French. After the battle, someone removed Fürstenberg's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague, with news of his death; Fürstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach, and his cousin erected a small monument there, but in 1857, his body was moved to the family cemetery, "Maria Hof" at Neudingen, near Donaueschingen.

Upon the death of Prosper Ferdinand, Count Fürstenberg, in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, in 1704 the Fürstenberg inheritance was divided between the count's two youngest sons, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic. The family of Fürstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716, with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, as the first Prince ("Fürst") of Fürstenberg (German: "Fürst zu Fürstenberg"). The first prince had three sons, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (1728–1783), Karl Borromäus Egon (1729–1787), and Prosper Maria, who died in infancy. The title passed through the line of the first son, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (as second prince), to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl (third prince, who died in 1796) and then to another son of the second prince, Karl Joachim Aloys (fourth prince). The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue. Consequently, the title passed to the male line of first prince's second son. This son, Karl Borromäus Egon, had died in 1787. 
Karl Borromäus Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 – 14 July 1759), died as a small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 – 5 June 1790), married in 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von Fürstenberg (sister of the third and fourth princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but died at the age of 15 years. The other children of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of Fürstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the <a href="agnatic%20primogeniture">agnatic</a> male descendants of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg.

In 1803, two of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's children were still living. Karl Egon, as the surviving son, inherited the title Prince of Fürstenberg; he and his eldest sister lived into adulthood and produced families.

Children of Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and <a href="Elisabeth%20zu%20F%C3%BCrstenberg">Elizabeth, Princess of Thurn und Taxis</a>, were:

1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt

The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt took place from March to June 1937 in the Canadian <a href="Provinces%20of%20Canada">province</a> of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>. It was a rebellion against Premier <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a> by a group of <a href="backbencher">backbench</a> (not part of the cabinet) members of the Legislative Assembly (<a href="Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly">MLAs</a>) from his <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Social Credit League</a>. The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with <a href="C%24">C$</a>25 monthly dividends through <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a> as he had promised before his 1935 election. When the government's 1937 budget made no move to implement the dividends, many MLAs revolted openly and threatened to defeat the government in a <a href="confidence%20vote">confidence vote</a>.

The revolt took place in a period of turmoil for Aberhart and his government: besides the dissident backbenchers, half of the cabinet resigned or was fired over a period of less than a year. Aberhart also faced criticism for planning to attend the <a href="Coronation%20of%20George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">coronation of George VI</a> at the province's expense and for stifling a <a href="recall%20election">recall</a> attempt against him by the voters of his constituency.

After a stormy debate in which the survival of the government was called into question, a compromise was reached whereby Aberhart's government relinquished considerable power to a committee of backbenchers. This committee, dominated by insurgents, recruited two British social credit experts to come to Alberta and advise on the implementation of social credit. Among the experts' first moves was to require a loyalty pledge from Social Credit MLAs. Almost all signed, thus ending the crisis, though most of the legislation the experts proposed was ultimately <a href="disallowance%20and%20reservation">disallowed</a> or <a href="judicial%20review">struck down</a> as unconstitutional.

In the midst of the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20Canada">Great Depression</a>, <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> schoolteacher and radio evangelist William Aberhart became a convert to a British economic theory called <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a>. Believing it could end the depression and restore prosperity, he began to promote it around Alberta. When the provincial government proved resistant to adopting it, Aberhart resolved to field social credit candidates in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 provincial election</a>. These candidates won 56 of the province's 63 seats, and Aberhart became <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a>.

In the runup to the campaign, Aberhart promised to increase Albertans' <a href="purchasing%20power">purchasing power</a> by providing monthly dividends to all citizens in the form of non-negotiable "credit certificates". While he did not commit to any specific dividend amount, he cited $20 and, later, $25 per month as reasonable figures. Though he noted that these figures were given "only for illustrative purposes", he repeated them so often that, in the assessment of his biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller, "it would have been impossible for any regular listener not to have gained the impression that Aberhart was promising him $25 a month if Social Credit should come to power."

Aberhart had been in some conflict with <a href="C.%20H.%20Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a>, social credit's British originator. Douglas, while assiduously avoiding specific comment on the Albertan proposals, submitted them to his Social Credit Secretariat for review; it found them to be "fallacious from start to finish."

By the end of 1936, Aberhart's government had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected on the promise of dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, <a href="Samuel%20A.%20Barnes">Samuel Barnes</a>, had been expelled from the Social Credit <a href="caucus">caucus</a> and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.

In December 1936, <a href="John%20Hargrave">John Hargrave</a>, the leader of the <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">Social Credit Party of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>, visited Alberta. While he had been disowned by Douglas, many MLAs frustrated with Aberhart saw Hargrave as their saviour. On arrival in Alberta, he met with Aberhart and his cabinet, who told him that the <a href="Canadian%20constitution">Canadian constitution</a> (which made banking a matter of federal, rather than provincial, jurisdiction) was an obstacle to their introducing social credit. Hargrave proposed a plan for implementing social credit in Alberta; while he acknowledged that it was unconstitutional, he believed that the federal government would not dare enforce its jurisdiction in the face of broad popular support for social credit. After he presented his plan to a group of Social Credit MLAs, the news media began to report that Aberhart intended to implement a radical and unconstitutional set of laws. Aberhart immediately disavowed any "intention of drastic legislation" and, after studying Hargrave's plan, announced that neither he nor his cabinet supported it.

Despite this statement, the Social Credit caucus invited Hargrave to explain his plan, which he did to the approval of many caucus members. Attorney-General <a href="John%20Hugill">John Hugill</a> pointed out that the plan was unconstitutional, to which Hargrave replied that he was "not interested in legal arguments." Two weeks later, Hargrave left the province, telling the press that he "found it impossible to co-operate with a government which [he considered] a mere vacillating machine." In this message, some MLAs found confirmation of their misgivings about Aberhart. A group of them, reported as numbering anywhere from five ("soon joined by eight or ten others") to 22, began to hold meetings in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>'s Corona Hotel to, as <a href="Brian%20Brennan%20%28author%29">Brian Brennan</a> puts it, "plot Aberhart's downfall". Brennan identifies their leader as <a href="Pembina%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Pembina</a>'s <a href="Harry%20Knowlton%20Brown">Harry Knowlton Brown</a>, while <a href="Tim%20Byrne">T. C. Byrne</a> names <a href="Ronald%20Ansley">Ronald Ansley</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Unwin">Joseph Unwin</a>, and <a href="Albert%20Blue">Albert Blue</a>.

To make matters worse for Aberhart, Minister of Lands and Mines <a href="Charles%20Cathmer%20Ross">Charles Cathmer Ross</a> resigned late in 1936, followed by Provincial Treasurer <a href="Charles%20Cockroft">Charles Cockroft</a> on January 29, 1937. Neither minister's resignation was directly related to the dissidents' complaints: Ross resigned over disagreements with Aberhart on oil policy, while Cockroft left over a combination of ill health, clashes with Aberhart over the issue of a federal-provincial loan council, government investment policies, and Aberhart's approach to <a href="patronage">patronage</a>. Nevertheless, the resignations were the public's first clue of dissent in Social Credit's ranks. Cockroft's resignation was followed by that of his deputy, J. F. Perceval, and there were rumours that Hugill and Minister of Agriculture and Trade and Industry <a href="William%20Chant">William Chant</a> would soon follow. This left Minister of Health <a href="Wallace%20Warren%20Cross">Wallace Warren Cross</a>, Minister of Public Works and Railways and Telephones <a href="William%20Fallow">William Fallow</a>, and Provincial Secretary <a href="Ernest%20Manning">Ernest Manning</a> as Aberhart's only indisputably loyal ministers, and Manning was away from the legislature, ill with <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. On February 19, <a href="William%20Carlos%20Ives">William Carlos Ives</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Alberta">Supreme Court of Alberta</a> dealt the government another blow when he struck down key provincial legislation, including one act reducing the interest paid on the province's bonds by half (though this was only a technical defeat, since the government had been defaulting on its bond payments since the previous April).

On February 25, a new session of the legislature opened with the <a href="speech%20from%20the%20throne">speech from the throne</a>, delivered by Chief Justice <a href="Horace%20Harvey">Horace Harvey</a> in the absence of <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20of%20Alberta">Lieutenant-Governor</a> <a href="Philip%20Primrose">Philip Primrose</a>. Its commitment to social credit was limited to a vaguely worded promise to pursue "a new economic order when social credit becomes effective." Three days later, on his weekly radio program, Aberhart acknowledged that he had been unable to implement the monthly dividends during the eighteen-month period he had set as his deadline, and asked Social Credit <a href="constituency%20association">constituency association</a> presidents to convene meetings of all Social Credit members to decide whether he ought to resign. He suggested that, in light of poor spring road conditions in rural areas, these meetings be delayed until early June, during which time he would remain in office.

The media objected to Aberhart's plan to place his government's future in the hands of the 10% of Albertans who were Social Credit members; the "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>" called for an immediate election. To many Social Credit MLAs, Aberhart's greater offense was bypassing them, the people's elected representatives. This was especially irksome in view of social credit's political philosophy, which favoured <a href="Technocracy%20%28bureaucratic%29">technocratic</a> rule and held that elected representatives' only legitimate function was channelling the public desire; by appealing directly to Social Credit members, Aberhart appeared to be denying the MLAs even this role. In the legislature, <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservative</a> leader <a href="David%20Milwyn%20Duggan">David Duggan</a> called for Aberhart's resignation; in a move that Brennan reports shocked the assembly, his call was endorsed by Social Credit backbencher Albert Blue.

On March 11 or 12, Cockroft's replacement as Provincial Treasurer, <a href="Solon%20Low">Solon Low</a>, introduced the government's budget. It included no implementation of social credit, and was attacked by the opposition parties as "the default budget" and by insurgent Social Crediters as a "banker's budget" (a harsh insult given Social Credit's dim view of the banking industry). Ronald Ansley rose immediately to attack it as containing "not one single item that even remotely resembled Social Credit." Blue, again echoing Duggan, threatened on March 16 to vote against the government's interim <a href="supply%20bill">supply bill</a>, the defeat of which, under the conventions of the <a href="Westminster%20parliamentary%20system">Westminster parliamentary system</a>, would force the government's resignation. In response, Aberhart praised Blue's courage in speaking his mind, and called him a worthy Social Crediter.

Surprised by Aberhart's refusal to be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to reassess their strategy. They got that time when, on March 17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>ed against the budget. <a href="Albert%20Bourcier">Albert Bourcier</a> opened debate, and was followed by, among others, <a href="Edith%20Rogers%20%28Alberta%20politician%29">Edith Rogers</a>, Ansley, and <a href="Wilson%20Cain">Wilson Cain</a>. On March 24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a <a href="vote%20of%20non-confidence">vote of non-confidence</a> in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, that he would do so if the budget itself was defeated.

Though the bulk of the revolt took place in and around the legislature over the issue of social credit and government fiscal policy, Aberhart was also under attack on other fronts. He had been invited to attend the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth</a>, set for May 1937 in London, and planned to go. Douglas, challenged by Hargrave for the leadership of the social credit movement and under attack by some of his own followers for his lack of cooperation with the world's first social credit government, offered to host Aberhart, and a member of Douglas's social credit secretariat was planning a speaking tour for Aberhart. In the same speech in which he threatened to bring down the government on the supply motion, Blue attacked the trip as an extravagance that depression-ridden Alberta could ill afford. Faced with a political insurgency at home, Aberhart reluctantly decided at the end of March to cancel his trip, inaccurately claiming that he had never definitely decided to go.

Such a retreat was not an option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles. One of Social Credit's 1935 promises had been the introduction of <a href="Recall%20election">recall</a> for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act. As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own <a href="Okotoks-High%20River">Okotoks-High River</a> riding, where he had been elected in a <a href="by-election">by-election</a> shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed themselves of the legislation. On April 9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association, and by fall it had gathered the signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate. In response, the Social Crediters repealed the "Recall Act" retroactive to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their workers into signing the petition, and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.

On March 29, in the aftermath of the insurgent victory on Brown's adjournment motion, Aberhart gave notice of <a href="cloture">closure</a> on the budget debate. Belatedly realizing that this move would be risking his government in a vote that he might very well lose, he then announced that he would seek the consent of the legislature to withdraw his closure motion and move an interim supply motion instead. The unanimous consent needed to withdraw the closure motion was refused, and the motion itself was defeated. That evening, Aberhart negotiated with the insurgents for four hours until a compromise was accepted: the insurgents would support the supply bill, in exchange for which the cabinet would introduce a bill amending the "Social Credit Measures Act" to establish a board of MLAs empowered to appoint a commission of "experts" to implement social credit.

On March 31 the insurgents kept their part of the agreement by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be <a href="hoist%20%28motion%29">hoisted</a> for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed that it was not as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24 hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March 31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.

On April 8 or 12, the government capitulated. Low's "Alberta Social Credit Act" delivered what the insurgents wanted, including the creation of "Alberta credit" in the amount of "the unused capacity of industries and people of Alberta to produce wanted goods and services", the establishment of "credit houses" to distribute this credit, and the creation of a Social Credit Board. The bill was passed, and the insurgents were placated, though Brown warned during a cross-province speaking tour that they were determined to see social credit implemented, and "if anyone gets in our way, he's going to get into trouble ... we must choose between principles and party, between Social Credit and Premier Aberhart."

The <a href="Social%20Credit%20Board">Social Credit Board</a> comprised five backbenchers. Insurgent <a href="Glenville%20MacLachlan">Glenville MacLachlan</a> was chair, and Aberhart loyalist <a href="Floyd%20M.%20Baker">Floyd Baker</a> was secretary. The other three members were insurgents <a href="Selmer%20Berg">Selmer Berg</a>, <a href="James%20L.%20McPherson">James L. McPherson</a>, and <a href="William%20E.%20Hayes">William E. Hayes</a>. The Board was empowered to appoint a commission of between three and five experts to implement social credit; the commission was to be responsible to the Board.

Historians have taken different approaches to analyzing the effect of the Board on traditional Westminster parliamentary governance. <a href="C.%20B.%20MacPherson">C. B. MacPherson</a> emphasized "the extent to which the cabinet had abdicated in favour of a board composed of a few private members of the legislature", Byrne agrees that "in some respects, the powers granted to the board superseded those of the Executive Council" but notes that "Aberhart was permitted to carry on with regular government operations." Elliott and Miller take a similar approach to MacPherson's, suggesting that "Aberhart and his cabinet ... were in a position, strange in a cabinet system of government, of being ruled in the matter of economic policy by a board of private members that would be under the influence of Social Credit 'experts'." Barr disagrees, arguing that the Board was "still under the control of cabinet" and pointing out that "the cabinet was left with the power", through its privileged position in introducing legislation, "to supplement or alter the provisions of the "Alberta Social Credit Act"" under which terms the board was constituted.

Whatever the relative influence of the Board and cabinet, the latter disavowed any ownership of the act that established the former. Though it was a government bill, sponsored by Solon Low, the Provincial Treasurer explained that he took no responsibility for it, as it was drawn up by a committee of insurgents "without the interference of the cabinet". Though some insurgents complained that the version of the bill introduced by the government was different than that drafted by the committee, MacLachlan insisted that there had been no material changes. The bill was passed April 13, and the legislature adjourned the following day.

Immediately after, MacLachlan invited Douglas to come to Alberta and take the head of the expert commission. Douglas suggested that MacLachlan come to London to discuss the matter; MacLachlan left April 29, arrived in London May 9, and proceeded to meet with Douglas at his fishing lodge. Douglas refused to come to Alberta himself, but provided two of the "experts" the Board was charged with finding. The first was L. D. Byrne, who was in the insurance business, was an expert on social credit, and was appointed to do most of the substantive work. The second, tire salesman George Frederick Powell, was expected to handle the commission's public relations. Powell arrived in Edmonton June 10 with MacLachlan, while Byrne followed several weeks later.

While MacLachlan was in England finding his experts, feuding continued in Alberta. Aberhart fired William Chant, a known Douglasite, from his cabinet after he refused to resign. Both sides accused one another of subservience to the banking industry, the Social Credit League's sworn enemy. Baker, the board's sole Aberhart loyalist, travelled the province defending his premier; at one 4,000 person meeting in Calgary, he was shouted down by angry supporters of the insurgency. A petition calling for Aberhart's resignation circulated among backbenchers, and proved to be a plant by the cabinet to test MLAs' loyalty. Outwardly, however, the Social Crediters showed a united front as they awaited the promised experts; in the first recorded vote after the legislature reconvened June 7, all insurgents present voted with the government, though 13 were absent.

One of Powell's first actions on arriving in Edmonton was to prepare a "loyalty pledge" committing its signatories "to uphold the Social Credit Board and its technicians." Most Social Credit MLAs signed, and the six who did not wrote to Powell assuring him of their loyalty to Douglas's objectives (though one, former Provincial Treasurer Cockroft, later left the Social Credit League and unsuccessfully sought re-election as an "Independent Progressive"). The insurgency was over.

Byrne and Powell prepared three acts for the implementation of social credit: the "Credit of Alberta Regulation Act", the "Bank Employees Civil Rights Act", and the "Judicature Act Amendment Act". The first required all bankers to obtain a license from the Social Credit Commission and created a directorate for the control of each bank, most members of which would be appointed by the Social Credit Board. The second prevented unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions. The third prevented any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta's laws in court without receiving the approval of the <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20in%20Council">Lieutenant-Governor in Council</a>. All three acts were quickly passed. New Lieutenant-Governor <a href="John%20C.%20Bowen">John C. Bowen</a>, asked to grant <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a>, called Aberhart and Attorney-General Hugill to his office. He asked Hugill if, as a lawyer, he believed that the proposed laws were constitutional; Hugill replied that he did not. Aberhart said that he would take responsibility for the bills, which Bowen then signed. As they left the meeting, Aberhart asked Hugill for his resignation, which he received. Shortly after, the federal government <a href="Disallowance%20and%20reservation">disallowed</a> all three acts. Powell was not discouraged, stating that the acts "had been drawn up mainly to show the people of Alberta who were their "real" enemies, and in that respect they succeeded admirably."

Soon after the bills were introduced, Social Credit MLAs were subjected to a new loyalty pledge, this one shifting the target of their loyalty from the Social Credit Board to the cabinet. Six MLAs—including former cabinet ministers Chant, Cockroft, and Ross—refused to sign, and were ejected from caucus.

In the fall, Aberhart re-introduced the three disallowed acts in altered form, along with two new acts. The "Bank Taxation Act" increased provincial taxes on banks by 2,230%, while the "<a href="Accurate%20News%20and%20Information%20Act">Accurate News and Information Act</a>" gave the chairman of the Social Credit Board a number of powers over newspapers, including the right to compel them to publish "any statement ... which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government or Province" and to require them to supply the names of sources. It also authorized cabinet to prohibit the publication of any newspaper, any article by a given writer, or any article making use of a given source. Bowen <a href="disallowance%20and%20reservation">reserved</a> approval of the bills until the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> could comment on them; all were ruled unconstitutional in "<a href="Reference%20re%20Alberta%20Statutes">Reference re Alberta Statutes</a>".

During the fall session in which the offending bills were proposed, police raided an Edmonton office of the Social Credit League and confiscated 4,000 copies of a pamphlet called "The <a href="Bankers%27%20Toadies%20incident">Bankers' Toadies</a>", which urged its readers as follows: "My child, you should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies. God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous and poisonous things. NEVER, therefore, abuse them—just exterminate them!" The pamphlet also listed eight alleged toadies, including Conservative leader Duggan, former Attorney-General <a href="John%20Lymburn">John Lymburn</a>, and <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senator</a> <a href="William%20Antrobus%20Griesbach">William Antrobus Griesbach</a>. Powell and Social Credit <a href="whip%20%28politics%29">whip</a> <a href="Joe%20Unwin">Joe Unwin</a> were charged with <a href="criminal%20libel">criminal libel</a> and counsel to murder. Both were convicted of the former charge. Unwin was sentenced to three months hard labour; Powell was sentenced to six months and deported.

Aberhart's government was re-elected in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201940">1940 election</a> with a reduced majority of 36 of 63 seats. Among the defeated incumbents were dissident leader Brown, the convicted Unwin, the expelled Barnes, and the Provincial Treasurer Low. Aberhart won re-election by running in <a href="Calgary%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Calgary</a>; his replacement as Social Credit candidate in Okotoks–High River was soundly defeated. Aberhart died in 1943 and was replaced as Premier by Ernest Manning, who steered the Social Credit League in a more conservative and conventional direction until his 1968 retirement.

Though the disallowance of banking bills put an end to any real chance of social credit being implemented at the provincial level, the Social Credit Board persisted until 1948, when it was dissolved in response to a number of its <a href="anti-semitism">anti-semitic</a> pronouncements and its suggestion that the <a href="secret%20ballot">secret ballot</a> and <a href="political%20parties">political parties</a> be eliminated.

Telopea oreades

Telopea oreades, commonly known as the Gippsland-, mountain- or Victorian waratah, is a large shrub or small tree in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. Native to southeastern Australia, it is found in wet <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest and <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> on rich <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soils</a> high in organic matter. No <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, though a northern isolated population <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridises</a> extensively with the Braidwood waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20mongaensis">T. mongaensis</a>"). Reaching a height of up to , "T. oreades" grows with a single trunk and erect <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a>. It has dark green leaves with prominent veins that are long and wide. The red flower heads, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appear in late spring. Each is composed of up to 60 individual flowers.

In the garden, "T. oreades" grows in soils with good drainage and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s that are hybrid forms with "<a href="Telopea%20speciosissima">T. speciosissima</a>" have been developed, such as the 'Shady Lady' series. The timber is hard and has been used for making furniture and tool handles.

"Telopea oreades" grows as a large shrub or narrow tree high with a trunk reaching in diameter. Greyish brown, the trunk is thin in relation to the tree's height and not <a href="buttress%20root">buttressed</a>. Its surface is smooth with horizontal <a href="lenticel">lenticel</a>s and warty protuberances. Smaller branches are more brown and smooth. Young plants have a much more erect <a href="Habit%20%28biology%29">habit</a> than other members of the genus "<a href="Waratah">Telopea</a>" and their stems have a distinct reddish tinge. The shiny dark green leaves are <a href="phyllotaxis">arranged alternately</a> along the stems. The leaves are narrow-<a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> to <a href="wikt%3Aspathulate">spathulate</a>, and measure long and wide. They have a sunken midrib on the upperside (and corresponding ridge on the underside) with four to six pairs of lateral veins visible at a 45 degree angle to the midline. They veer and converge to form an easily seen vein that runs around inside the leaf margin. The undersurface is paler and greyer. When dried, the leaves appear to have a granular texture.

Flowering occurs between October and December in its native range, with plants at higher elevations flowering later than ones at lower altitude. The crimson flowerheads, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are about in diameter. They are composed of 36 to 60 individual flowers with green to pink <a href="bract">bract</a>s, which may be up to long. Each flower is encased in a long <a href="perianth">perianth</a>, which is a much brighter red on the surface facing the centre of the flower than the surface facing outwards. <a href="Anthesis">Anthesis</a>, or the opening of the flowers, begins with those at the centre of the flowerhead and moves to the edges or base. The individual flower bears a sessile <a href="stamen">anther</a> (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a> at the end of the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29%23Style">style</a>. The <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29">ovary</a> lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the <a href="gynophore">gynophore</a>, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped <a href="Nectar%23Floral%20nectaries">nectary</a> lies at the base of the gynophore.

After flowering, the curved leathery to woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop; these are long, which somewhat resemble a boat in shape. These ripen the following May to September, and split open to reveal (and spill) 10–16 seeds. Arranged in two columns, the winged, flat brown seeds are around long with a roughly rectangular wing long. New shoots often grow through flowerheads.

It can be difficult to distinguish "T. oreades" from "<a href="Telopea%20mongaensis">T. mongaensis</a>" though the leaves of the latter species are more prominently veined, and mostly (but not always) narrower than wide. "Telopea oreades" flowers around a month earlier than "T. mongaensis" in areas where both are present.

The Gippsland waratah was first formally <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by the Victorian Government Botanist <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Mueller">Ferdinand von Mueller</a> in 1861 in "<a href="Fragmenta%20Phytographiae%20Australiae">Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae</a>". The <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type material</a> was collected in rugged mountainous country around Nungatta Creek, a tributary of the <a href="Genoa%20River">Genoa River</a> in south-eastern New South Wales. Mueller had been surveying the mountainous eastern part of the state since the 1850s. The species name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "oreos" "mountain" and hence means "of or relating to a mountain". The only alternative scientific name proposed was in 1891, when <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> named it as "Hylogyne oreades", but it was rejected as an <a href="illegitimate%20name">illegitimate name</a>. Common names applies to the species include Gippsland-, Victorian-, mountain-, and tree waratah.

"Telopea oreades" is one of five species from southeastern Australia that make up the genus "Telopea". No <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised. It has been difficult to distinguish from the similar "T. mongaensis", but microscopic analysis has revealed that "T. oreades" has features termed <a href="Ground%20tissue%23Sclereids">sclereids</a> while "T. mongaensis" does not. The two are <a href="Sister%20group">sister</a> species, and their next closest relative is the Tasmanian waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20truncata">T. truncata</a>").

A <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct</a> northern population of "T. oreades" grows together with "T. mongaensis" in the southern <a href="Monga%20Valley">Monga Valley</a> in southern New South Wales, with some <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>s reported. Crisp and Weston concluded that the two species for the most part did not <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridise</a> there. However, a genetic study using microsatellites found there was extensive hybridisation, with much of the presumed pure "T. oreades" showing a close relation to "T. mongaensis". The populations of waratahs are thought to have grown and shrunk with the ebb and flow of ice ages in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, finally stranding a population of "T. oreades" located alongside "T. mongaensis" as conditions suitable for waratahs changed in southeastern Australia.

The genus lies in the subtribe <a href="Embothriinae">Embothriinae</a>, along with the tree waratahs ("<a href="Alloxylon">Alloxylon</a>") from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis</a>" and Chilean firetree ("<a href="Embothrium%20coccineum">Embothrium coccineum</a>") from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance must predate the splitting of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago.

"Telopea oreades" occurs in moist forests and temperate <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s of coastal ranges and tableland <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a>s in two disjunct areas of southeastern <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The first is centred on <a href="East%20Gippsland">East Gippsland</a> in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, from <a href="Orbost">Orbost</a> to the vicinity of <a href="Eden%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Eden</a> across the border in far southeastern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. There is a more northerly population around the Monga Valley near <a href="Braidwood%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Braidwood, New South Wales</a> extending to <a href="Moss%20Vale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Moss Vale</a>. There are unconfirmed reports of the species in the vicinity of <a href="Brown%20Mountain%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Brown Mountain</a> and <a href="Glenbog%20State%20Forest">Glenbog State Forest</a> in southern New South Wales, which lie between the two areas. Plants in Victoria are found at altitudes ranging from in <a href="Lind%20National%20Park">Lind National Park</a> to on <a href="Mount%20Ellery">Mount Ellery</a>. Wetter eastern and southern slopes are favoured habitats, and the annual rainfall ranges from .

"T. oreades" grows in <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soil</a> that is high in nutrients and organic matter. Associated tree species in Victoria include shining gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20nitens">Eucalyptus nitens</a>"), messmate "(<a href="Eucalyptus%20obliqua">E. obliqua</a>)", mountain grey gum "(<a href="Eucalyptus%20cypellocarpa">E. cypellocarpa</a>"), cut-tail ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20fastigata">E. fastigata</a>"), silvertop ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20sieberi">E. sieberi</a>"), southern sassafras ("<a href="Atherosperma%20moschatum">Atherosperma moschatum</a>"), black oliveberry ("<a href="Elaeocarpus%20holopetalus">Elaeocarpus holopetalus</a>"), blanket leaf ("<a href="Bedfordia%20arborescens">Bedfordia arborescens</a>"), Australian blackwood ("<a href="Acacia%20melanoxylon">Acacia melanoxylon</a>"), privet mock‐olive ("<a href="Notelaea%20ligustrina">Notelaea ligustrina</a>"), banyalla ("<a href="Pittosporum%20bicolor">Pittosporum bicolor</a>"), Errinundra plum pine ("<a href="Podocarpus">Podocarpus</a>" sp. Goonmirk Rocks), Errinundra pepper ("<a href="Tasmannia%20xerophila">Tasmannia xerophila</a>" subsp. "robusta") and soft tree fern ("<a href="Dicksonia%20antarctica">Dicksonia antarctica</a>").

"Telopea oreades" is not listed under <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Commonwealth environmental legislation</a> and is not considered by respective state authorities to be rare or <a href="Threatened%20species">threatened</a> in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the <a href="Flora%20and%20Fauna%20Guarantee%20Act">Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act</a>, and it is a component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet <a href="Sclerophyll">Sclerophyll</a> Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of "T. oreades" escaping into <a href="Kunzea%20ericoides">kanuka</a> scrub from the trout hatchery gardens on the <a href="Tongariro%20River">Tongariro River</a> south of <a href="Lake%20Taupo">Lake Taupo</a>.

The prominent position and striking colour of "Telopea oreades" and many of its relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae—both in Australia and South America—strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. Birds recorded visiting the flowers for their nectar include <a href="red%20wattlebird">red wattlebird</a> ("Anthochaera carunculata"), <a href="eastern%20spinebill">eastern spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris"), <a href="crescent%20honeyeater">crescent honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris pyrrhopterus"), <a href="yellow-faced%20honeyeater">yellow-faced honeyeater</a> ("Lichenostomus chrysops"), <a href="brown-headed%20honeyeater">brown-headed honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus brevirostris"), <a href="white-naped%20honeyeater">white-naped honeyeater</a> ("Melithreptus lunatus") and <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis").

"T. oreades" has a central <a href="taproot">taproot</a> and few lateral roots. Like most Proteaceae, it has fine <a href="Cluster%20root">proteoid roots</a> that arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia.

"T. oreades" has a swollen woody base largely under the soil known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>. The wet forests in which it grows seldom catch fire. When they do, the <a href="plant%20community">plant community</a> becomes a more open sclerophyll <a href="woodland">woodland</a> until slow-growing plants with larger leaves take over. New shoots grow from the lignotuber, which survives bushfire as the rest of the plant above ground is burnt. The seed also germinates and grows in post-bushfire soil, which is higher in nutrients and more open with fewer competing plant species. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (several metres) from the parent plants.

"Telopea oreades" needs a well-drained location as well as reliable moisture to thrive. Soil with some <a href="clay">clay</a> content is beneficial. It is more shade-tolerant than the more popular New South Wales waratah, preferring part-shade but tolerating sunny aspects. It tolerates moderate <a href="frost">frost</a>s. Plants can be hard-<a href="Pruning">pruned</a>—lopping old stems and branches can rejuvenate mature plants. Plants can benefit from low-phosphorus fertilizer applied in spring and autumn. Propagation is by seed, the germination rates of which fall significantly after several months' storage unless refrigerated, or by <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a> of new growth that has just hardened. <a href="Cultivar">Cultivar</a>s must be propagated by cutting to make daughter plants identical to the parent.

"T. oreades" has been grown successfully in England. The plant was first cultivated there by Canon Arthur Townsend Boscawen at <a href="Ludgvan">Ludgvan</a> in Cornwall from seed that he obtained in 1910. He had succeeded in bringing the plant into flower by 1915, providing material for illustration in <a href="Curtis%27s%20Botanical%20Magazine">Curtis's Botanical Magazine</a> in 1916. A plant in Cornwall reached in height, while another at <a href="Wakehurst%20Place">Wakehurst Place</a> reached in the late 1980s. Although thriving at Wakehurst, the species can be very sensitive to English soils. The <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a> awarded the species an <a href="Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit">Award of Merit</a> in 1916.

A selected white-flowered form from the <a href="Errinundra%20Plateau">Errinundra Plateau</a>, which was originally known as 'Plateau View Alba' or 'Plateau View White', was registered by the <a href="Australian%20Cultivar%20Registration%20Authority">Australian Cultivar Registration Authority</a> in 1990 as 'Errindundra White'. <a href="Plantsman">Plantsmen</a> have also developed several <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> with "<a href="Telopea%20speciosissima">T. speciosissima</a>", looking to combine the hardiness of "T. oreades" with the showier flowerheads of the latter. Red-, pink- and even white-flowered cultivars are available.


The timber is fairly hard and resembles silky oak ("<a href="Grevillea%20robusta">Grevillea robusta</a>"). It is durable and can be readily polished and worked with, making it amenable for use in furniture, picture frames and tool handles.

The Human Centipede (First Sequence)

The Human Centipede (First Sequence) is a 2009 Dutch <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> written, directed, and co-produced by <a href="Tom%20Six">Tom Six</a>. The film tells the story of a <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="surgeon">surgeon</a> who kidnaps three tourists and joins them <a href="Surgery">surgically</a>, mouth to <a href="human%20anus">anus</a>, forming a "human <a href="centipede">centipede</a>", a conjoined triplet. It stars <a href="Dieter%20Laser">Dieter Laser</a> as the creator of the centipede, Dr. Josef Heiter, with <a href="Ashley%20C.%20Williams">Ashley C. Williams</a>, <a href="Ashlynn%20Yennie">Ashlynn Yennie</a>, and <a href="Akihiro%20Kitamura">Akihiro Kitamura</a> as his victims. According to Six, the concept of the film arose from a joke he made with friends about punishing a <a href="child%20sexual%20abuse">child molester</a> by stitching his mouth to the anus of a "fat truck driver". Inspiration for the film also came from <a href="Nazi%20human%20experimentation">Nazi medical experiments</a> carried out during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, such as the crimes of <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a> at the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>.

When approaching investors prior to filming, Six did not mention the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of "The Human Centipede" did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete. The film received generally mixed reviews from film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film received a <a href="Limited%20release">limited theatrical release</a> in the United States on 30 April 2010. Two sequels, titled "<a href="The%20Human%20Centipede%202%20%28Full%20Sequence%29">Full Sequence</a>" and "<a href="The%20Human%20Centipede%203%20%28Final%20Sequence%29">Final Sequence</a>", also written and directed by Six, were released in 2011 and 2015, respectively. The entire trilogy was compiled into a single film in 2016, titled "Complete Sequence", which Six described as a "movie centipede" due to each "Sequence" leading into its successor, while simultaneously working as a separate standalone film.

Lindsay (<a href="Ashley%20C.%20Williams">Ashley C. Williams</a>) and Jenny (<a href="Ashlynn%20Yennie">Ashlynn Yennie</a>), two American tourists in Germany, are drugged and involuntarily detained by crazed surgeon Dr. Josef Heiter (<a href="Dieter%20Laser">Dieter Laser</a>) when they seek help at his house after they get a flat tire. The women awake in a makeshift medical ward. They witness Heiter kill a kidnapped truck driver after Heiter informs him he is "not a match". Heiter secures a new male captive, <a href="Japanese%20people">Japanese</a> tourist Katsuro (<a href="Akihiro%20Kitamura">Akihiro Kitamura</a>). The doctor explains that he is a world-renowned expert at separating <a href="Siamese%20twins">Siamese twins</a>, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing people together. He describes in detail how he will surgically connect his three victims <a href="mouth">mouth</a>-to-<a href="anus">anus</a>, so that they share a single <a href="Digestion">digestive system</a>.
After Lindsay tries to escape, Heiter decides to make her the middle part of the centipede, the most painful position. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead. He removes the front teeth of both women and mutilates the buttocks of Katsuro and Lindsay to provide access to the rectums, to which he grafts their mouths. He severs the <a href="ligaments">ligaments</a> of his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl.
Once the operation is complete, Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet, often belittling Katsuro with <a href="racism">racist</a> insults and beating him with a <a href="Crop%20%28implement%29">crop</a> when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro <a href="Defecation">defecates</a>, Lindsay is forced to <a href="Coprophagia">swallow his excrement</a> while the doctor watches in delight. However, he eventually becomes irritated after being kept awake by the constant screaming of Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak) and the realization that Jenny is dying from <a href="Sepsis">septicemia</a>. 

When two detectives, Kranz (Andreas Leupold) and Voller (Peter Blankenstein), visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the tourists, Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation; a four-segment centipede. He offers the two detectives water spiked with sedatives in hopes of knocking the two unconscious. After being given the water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. 

When the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter in the process. Their attempt to escape ultimately fails. Katsuro confesses to the doctor that he deserves his fate because he had treated his own family poorly, then commits suicide by slitting his throat with a glass shard.

Upon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives forcefully conduct separate searches as Heiter, injured, hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the scalpel pulled from his leg during Katsuro's attack. Upon finding Voller dead, Kranz is shot by Heiter with Voller's sidearm. Kranz responds by shooting Heiter in the head before dying. Back in the house, Jenny and Lindsay hold hands as Jenny dies. Lindsay sobs as she is left alone in the house, trapped between her deceased fellow captives. Her fate is left unknown. The film ends with the sounds of her sobbing while the camera pans to the roof of the house.


The inspiration for the film's plot came from a joke that writer/director <a href="Tom%20Six">Tom Six</a> once made to his friends about punishing a child molester they saw on TV by stitching his mouth to the anus of an overweight truck driver. Six saw this as the concept for a great horror film, and he began to develop the idea. He has said he was heavily influenced as a filmmaker by the early works of <a href="David%20Cronenberg">David Cronenberg</a> and <a href="Japanese%20horror">Japanese horror films</a>. Six has said he prefers horror films that are more realistic over "unbelievable" monster films, and that he gets "a rash from too much political correctness." A major influence for "The Human Centipede" was <a href="Pier%20Paolo%20Pasolini">Pier Paolo Pasolini</a>'s controversial 1975 Italian drama film "<a href="Sal%C3%B2%2C%20or%20the%20120%20Days%20of%20Sodom">Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</a>", which was notable for its scenes depicting intensely graphic violence, sadism, and sexual depravity, as was the work of Japanese director <a href="Takashi%20Miike">Takashi Miike</a>. Six has also expressed his love of the works of <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a>. Further inspiration came from Six's previous role as a director on the <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Netherlands%29">Dutch series</a> of "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28TV%20series%29">Big Brother</a>", where he had been able to observe people who "did crazy things when they were alone and thought they were not (being) watched."

Six has stated that "The Human Centipede" is, to an extent, a reflection on fascism. <a href="Dieter%20Laser">Dieter Laser</a>, who played the antagonist Dr Heiter, said during the promotion of the film that he felt the guilt of Nazi actions during the war had haunted ordinary Germans for generations, and that as a German whose father participated in the war, he often felt "like a child whose father is in jail for murder." The inclusion of a German villain came from this, with Six citing both the <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20the%20Netherlands">German invasion of the Netherlands</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and the <a href="Nazi%20medical%20experiments">Nazi medical experiments</a> as inspiration. Laser stated in an interview with Clark Collis for "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" that he considered the film a "grotesque [parody] about the Nazi psyche". Heiter's name was an amalgamation of several Nazi war criminals, his surname (literally meaning "cheerful" in German) a combination of the names of Nazi doctors Fetter and Richter, and his first name coming from <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a>, who carried out <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp%23Medical%20experiments">experiments on prisoners</a> at the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a>. World War II also played an influence on the nationality of the other main characters who were American and Japanese. Six includes many horror film clichés in the first act, such as a broken-down car, lack of <a href="Mobile%20phone%20signal">phone signal</a> and very naïve victims. Six did this in an attempt to lull audiences into thinking they are watching a conventional horror film, therefore making Dr Heiter's treatment of his victims more shocking.

Six placed a Japanese male at the front of the centipede to create a <a href="language%20barrier">language barrier</a> between the doctor and the centipede. Throughout the film the characters (with the exception of Heiter who for the most part speaks to the centipede in English) speak in their native languages only (subtitled for the viewer into English where necessary). Katsuro, as the front part of the centipede, can only speak Japanese and therefore cannot speak with either the doctor or Jenny and Lindsay. Secondly, Katsuro's position in the centipede sets up the opportunity for the doctor and the male victim of the centipede to fight toward the climax of the film. Six stated in the director's commentary for "The Human Centipede" that he has a personal fear of hospitals and doctors, so he stretched out the scene where Heiter explains how he will create the centipede and the subsequent procedure to create his "own nightmare."

While seeking funding for the film, Six pitched the idea of a surgeon who sewed people together. He did not initially reveal that the victims would be joined mouth-to-anus, as he believed this idea would stand no chance of receiving investments. His backers felt that the idea of a surgeon sewing people together was original and Six received funding. However, they did not learn the exact details of the film until it had been completed. Six claimed that they were very happy with the finished film. Before signing on, the actors were given an outline of the <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> rather than a complete script. They were also shown sketches of how the centipede would be formed.

Although "The Human Centipede" is set in Germany, <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> took place in the Netherlands due to the neighboring countries' similar landscapes. Heiter's home, where most of "The Human Centipede" takes place, was a villa in the Netherlands found by the production team. The property was in a residential area and not surrounded by woodland as it appears in the film, but by other houses. This meant the filmmakers had some difficulty ensuring that the other houses did not appear in shot. Some conversion of the property took place prior to filming, for example, a cinema room was converted to form Heiter's basement operating theatre, with real hospital beds and intravenous drips rented from a local hospital. The paintings of <a href="conjoined%20twins">conjoined twins</a> that were displayed throughout the house were painted by Tom Six, which he felt contributed to the atmosphere in the house. The hotel room scene near the beginning of the film was filmed in a hotel suite at a location near <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence, which Yennie stated helped the actors to develop their characters throughout the film. The opening scene, which only featured Laser and de Wit, was shot on the last day of filming.

Laser remained in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting at the rest of the cast on set, and wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also happy for the other actors in "The Human Centipede" to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene where Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting.

The Nazi influence behind Heiter led to the use of classical music when the doctor is "training" his centipede. The music was deliberately played at low quality to simulate the music coming from a loudspeaker, in much the same way as music was sometimes played in <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>. Many of the sound effects in "The Human Centipede" were created by manipulating meat. For example, the sound of a nose being broken was made by snapping bones within cuts of raw meat. Due to the discomfort of spending long periods on their hands and knees, the actors playing the centipede were given massages at the end of each day of filming. Yennie stated that she and Williams experienced jaw pain from holding a <a href="Bit%20%28horse%29">bit</a> in their mouths during filming, but overall she did not feel that the physical side of filming had been excessively difficult.

"The Human Centipede" contains relatively few gory images; little of the surgical procedure is depicted directly, no excrement is shown on screen, and according to Kim Newman in "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>", it is "never quite as outrageous as it threatens to be." Six stated that he wanted the film to be as authentic as possible and claimed to have consulted a Dutch surgeon during the creation and filming process, resulting in the film being "100% medically accurate." Six said that the surgeon initially wanted nothing to do with his film, as he felt Six was "crazy" and the idea had "nothing to do with medical science." However, the surgeon changed his mind and decided that he in fact liked the idea, and so came up with a method of creating a human centipede. Six has claimed that the central and rear members of the centipede could survive for years by supplementing their diet with an <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">IV drip</a>. The special effects team was led by Rob and Erik Hillenbrink, father and son. They designed the final composition of the centipede from sketches provided by the consulting surgeon. The actors who made up the centipede wore hardened underwear, compared by Yennie to shorts, which had a rubber grip for the actors to wear, and for the actor behind to bite, creating the illusion of the mouth-to-anus connection. Six kept secret how the centipede would be formed as long as possible, and Yennie claimed that even her make-up artist did not know, asking Yennie what kind of "suit" the actors would be wearing.

When Heiter is operating on his victims, Jenny's teeth were digitally removed in post-production. However, other effects were relatively simple to create. Heiter's "three dog" was created by <a href="Photo%20manipulation%23Photoshopping">photoshopping</a> an image of three Rottweilers to create an image of dogs joined together. <a href="Color%20grading">Colour grading</a> was used extensively throughout the production of "The Human Centipede". For example, at the end of the film when Lindsay is left between the dead bodies of Jenny and Katsuro, their skin tones were lightened to further emphasise that they were dead and Lindsay was still alive.

The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car breaks down was added digitally in post-production. The filmmakers had not been granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, the use of a <a href="tracking%20shot">tracking shot</a> through the window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.

During promotion for "The Human Centipede", press materials claimed that the film was "100% medically accurate". Six and the producers frequently stated that the film had been described as "the most horrific film ever made," and many writers, such as Karina Longworth of "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" magazine and Jay Stone of the "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>", described the film as <a href="torture%20porn">torture porn</a>. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, writing in the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>", stated that he felt the film had been "deliberately intended to inspire incredulity, nausea and hopefully outrage." However, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", David Cox noted that he had been unable to trace the source of this quote as the "most horrific film ever made" and had contacted Six to attempt to ascertain the origin of the judgement. Six claimed that the statement had originally been made by "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" newspaper in the United Kingdom. However, Cox was unable to trace any article making this claim. When asked by Cox as to what Six regarded as the "most horrific" film, Six stated he in fact believed it to be Pier Paolo Pasolini's "<a href="Sal%C3%B2%2C%20or%20the%20120%20Days%20of%20Sodom">Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</a>".

"The Human Centipede" was released in the United States without an <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">MPAA rating</a>. It was released theatrically in New York City on 30 April 2010 and had a limited release in the US shortly afterward, distributed by <a href="IFC%20Films">IFC Films</a>. Throughout 2009, the film was included in several <a href="film%20festival">film festival</a>s around the world including the <a href="London%20FrightFest%20Film%20Festival">London FrightFest Film Festival</a>, <a href="Leeds%20International%20Film%20Festival">Leeds International Film Festival</a>, <a href="Sitges%20Film%20Festival">Sitges Film Festival</a>, and <a href="Screamfest%20Horror%20Film%20Festival">Screamfest Horror Film Festival</a>. Six remarked on how many film festival audiences reacted strongly to the film, sometimes almost vomiting in the cinema aisles. To Six's amusement, Spanish audiences often found the film funny, and laughed throughout screenings. Six claimed that the "buzz" surrounding the film led to several studios approaching him to discuss its distribution. IFC Films has a history of releasing unconventional horror films, having previously distributed the Norwegian Nazi-zombie feature "<a href="Dead%20Snow">Dead Snow</a>" and the 2009 release "<a href="Antichrist%20%28film%29">Antichrist</a>". "The Human Centipede"s US gross was $181,467, and worldwide takings amounted to $252,207.

The film was passed uncut by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a> (BBFC) and released with an <a href="18%20%28British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification%29">18 certificate</a>, receiving a limited run in the UK on 20 August 2010. It was distributed by Bounty Films.

"The Human Centipede" was released in the United Kingdom on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> and <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray</a> on 4 October 2010, and in the US the following day, where, as of September 2011, DVD sales have totalled $2,113,186.

"The Human Centipede" received mixed reviews. <a href="Review%20aggregator">Review aggregator</a> web site <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave the film a 49% approval rating, based upon 91 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1 out of 10; the general consensus states: "Grotesque, visceral and hard to (ahem) swallow, this surgical horror doesn't quite earn its stripes because the gross-outs overwhelm and devalue everything else." At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 33, based on 15 reviews, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".

Giving the film three stars out of five, "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" writer Kim Newman stated that "underneath an extremely repulsive concept, this is a relatively conventional horror movie." "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety Magazine</a>" writer Peter DeBurge criticised the film's lack of social commentary, stating that it could not "be bothered to expand upon its unpleasant premise, inviting audiences to revel in its sick humor by favoring Dr. Heiter ... and characterizing the victims as shallow expendables." Writing in "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", Clark Collis was broadly positive about Dieter Laser's performance as the Doctor, and praised Six's direction, saying Six "has put together his nightmare yarn with <a href="David%20Cronenberg">Cronenbergian</a> care and precision." Collis said "The Human Centipede" was "without question one of the most disgusting horror films ever made." Writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> gave the film three out of five, saying that, whilst "entirely deplorable and revolting," the film was "sort of brilliant". "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>" writer Jamie Russell gave the film four stars out of five, calling it "Shocking, funny, disturbing... a throwback to the glory days of Cronenberg."

Sukhdev Sandhu of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" was generally negative about the film, stating, ""The Human Centipede" has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen holes in the plot as well as by reams of exposition," and that it was "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." Writing in the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun%20Times">Chicago Sun Times</a>", <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine."

Critics and a doctor have dismissed Six's claim that the film was "100 percent medically accurate" as "ludicrous" and "rubbish". Dr John Cameron, speaking to <a href="TV3%20%28New%20Zealand%29">TV3</a> News in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, gave an interview about the feasibility of a human centipede, stating how he believed it would be difficult for a join between different people to heal and form a connection, and how the centipede would quickly die from lack of nutrition. John Martin, a former Hollywood film executive and CEO of <a href="Alamo%20Drafthouse%20Cinemas">Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas</a>, said Six's claims of 100 percent medical accuracy should be viewed with reference to the kind of shock gimmicks that film producers had long used to attract attention. Martin compared Six's claims to those of <a href="Kroger%20Babb">Kroger Babb</a> and <a href="William%20Castle">William Castle</a>, who had also made "grand promises" about what they were putting on screen, in a bid to lure audiences.

Despite mixed reviews, the film won several awards in 2009 during advance screenings at various international horror film festivals, including Best Picture/Movie at <a href="Fantastic%20Fest">Fantastic Fest</a> (<a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>, Texas), <a href="Screamfest%20Horror%20Film%20Festival">Screamfest Horror Film Festival</a> (Los Angeles), and the Sainte Maxime International Horror Film Festival. Laser won Best Actor in the horror category at Fantastic Fest and the film won the award for Best Ensemble Cast at the South African Horrorfest Film Festival.

When Tom Six began creating the "Human Centipede" sequels, he envisioned a trilogy that works as a "movie centipede". Each sequel opens with the ending of the previous film, as the events of that film influence said sequel. Although every film works as a standalone movie, they can all be connected to form a single 4.5 hour-long film.

While promoting "The Human Centipede", Six stated that he had started work on a <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to "First Sequence", titled "<a href="The%20Human%20Centipede%202%20%28Full%20Sequence%29">The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)</a>". Shooting on a similar budget to the first film, Six stated the sequel would be a much more graphic, disturbing and even "shittier" film; "First Sequence" being ""<a href="My%20Little%20Pony">My Little Pony</a>" compared with part two." Yennie stated at the May 2010 <a href="Fangoria%27s%20Weekend%20of%20Horrors">Weekend of Horrors</a> that the sequel would contain "the blood and shit" that viewers did not see in the first film. The plot of "Full Sequence" involved a centipede made from twelve people, featured a largely British cast, and was given the tag-line ""100% medically inaccurate"".

The plot of "Full Sequence" involves a man who, after becoming sexually obsessed with a DVD recording of "First Sequence", decides to create his own human centipede. The film had been planned for a DVD release in the United Kingdom. However, upon submitting the film to the BBFC for classification, the film was rejected due to content that was "sexually violent and potentially obscene". The BBFC's report criticised the film as making "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised, degraded and mutilated for the amusement and arousal of the central character, as well as for the pleasure of the audience," and that the film was potentially in breach of the <a href="Obscene%20Publications%20Act">Obscene Publications Act</a>, meaning its distribution in the UK would be illegal. Bounty Films, the UK distributor, appealed the decision, and the film was eventually passed with an <a href="18%20%28British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification%29">18 certificate</a> in October 2011. To achieve the 18 rating, thirty-two cuts were made from the film, removing two minutes and thirty-seven seconds from the original version.

The third and final film in the trilogy, "The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)", received a limited theatrical release on 22 May 2015. The film features the largest human centipede in the series, composed of five hundred victims, as Six says, "each film is a reaction to the other. And the film got so big, it was a pop culture phenomenon, and people wanted more: a bigger centipede, helicopters and things… it had to be bigger and bigger. And what I did, I used the idea and almost made a parody on the human centipede films itself." As "Full Sequence" was intended to make "First Sequence" look like "My Little Pony" in comparison, "Final Sequence" was intended to make "Full Sequence" resemble a <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Disney</a> film. The movie features the tag-line ""100% Politically Incorrect"". Both Dieter Laser and "Full Sequence" star <a href="Laurence%20R.%20Harvey">Laurence R. Harvey</a> returned in starring, albeit different, roles.

"The Human Centipede (Final Sequence)" was nominated for two <a href="36th%20Golden%20Raspberry%20Awards">Golden Raspberry Awards</a> in the categories of "Worst Director" and "Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off, or Sequel", respectively. It was also named the second worst movie of 2015 by "Entertainment Weekly" and "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>". In 2016, a compilation film of the entire trilogy titled "The Human Centipede (Complete Sequence): The Movie Centipede" was released, running a total of 275 minutes.

A number of parodies of the film have been made. A pornographic parody, directed by <a href="Lee%20Roy%20Myers">Lee Roy Myers</a> and titled "<a href="The%20Human%20Sexipede">The Human Sexipede</a>", was released in September 2010. It starred <a href="Tom%20Byron">Tom Byron</a> as Heiter, who joined three people mouth-to-genitals. The "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" episode "<a href="HumancentiPad">HUMANCENTiPAD</a>" saw character <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle Broflovski</a> unwittingly agreeing to become a part of a "Human CENT<a href="iPad">iPAD</a>" after failing to read the full details of an <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> <a href="Software%20license%20agreement">user license agreement</a>. The website "<a href="Funny%20or%20Die">Funny or Die</a>" featured a sketch where the freed victims of a human centipede, now separated, but scarred physically and mentally, argue at a survivors' meeting. "<a href="The%20Human%20Centipede%203%20%28Final%20Sequence%29">The Human Centipede 3 (Final Sequence)</a>" actress <a href="Bree%20Olson">Bree Olson</a> starred in a parody of the franchise that was directed by Graham Rich.

Ramaria botrytis

Ramaria botrytis, commonly known as the clustered coral, the pink-tipped coral mushroom, or the cauliflower coral, is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species of <a href="coral%20fungus">coral fungus</a> in the family <a href="Gomphaceae">Gomphaceae</a>. Its robust <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> can grow up to in diameter and tall, and resembles some <a href="coral">marine coral</a>. Its dense branches, which originate from a stout, massive base, are swollen at the tips and divided into several small branchlets. The branches are initially whitish but age to <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> or <a href="tan%20%28color%29">tan</a>, with tips that are pink to reddish. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thick and white. The <a href="spore">spore</a>s, yellowish in <a href="spore%20print">deposit</a>, are <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a>, feature longitudinal striations, and measure about 13.8 by 4.7 <a href="micrometre">micrometers</a>.

The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Ramaria">Ramaria</a>", "R. botrytis" was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> scientifically in 1797 by mycologist <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a>. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l with <a href="broadleaf%20trees">broadleaf trees</a>, and fruits on the ground in wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to "R. botrytis", and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> is often sufficient for identification, sometimes <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of "Ramaria botrytis" are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of <a href="laxative">laxative</a> effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several <a href="chemical%20compounds">chemical compounds</a> with "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" <a href="biological%20activity">biological activity</a>, and fruit bodies have <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> activity against several species and strains of <a href="drug-resistant">drug-resistant</a> bacteria that <a href="pathogen">cause disease</a> in humans.

The species was first named as "Clavaria botrytis" in 1797 by <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a>. In 1821, <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> the genus name "<a href="Clavaria">Clavaria</a>", and treated "<a href="Ramaria">Ramaria</a>" as a <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> of "Clavaria". It was given its current name in 1918 by <a href="Adalbert%20Ricken">Adalbert Ricken</a>. Obsolete historical <a href="Synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a> include <a href="Gotthold%20Hahn">Gotthold Hahn</a>'s 1883 "Corallium botrytis" and <a href="A.%20A.%20Pearson">A. A. Pearson</a>'s <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "Clavaria botrytis" var. "alba", which is no longer recognized as an independent <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. Currie Marr and <a href="Daniel%20Elliot%20Stuntz">Daniel Stuntz</a> described the variety "R. botrytis" var. "aurantiiramosa" in their 1973 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of western <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> "Ramaria"; Edwin Schild and G. Ricci described variety "compactospora" from Italy in 1998. In 1950, <a href="E.J.H.%20Corner">E.J.H. Corner</a> published <a href="George%20F.%20Atkinson">George F. Atkinson</a>'s 1908 "Clavaria holorubella" as "R. botrytis" var. "holorubella", but this taxon is now known as the independent species "Ramaria holorubella".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "botrytis" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word ("botrus") meaning "bunch of grapes". The species is <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as the "cauliflower coral", the "pink-tipped coral mushroom", or the "rosso coral". In the <a href="Cofre%20de%20Perote">Cofre de Perote</a> region of <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, Mexico, "R. botrytis" is known by the local names "escobea", meaning "little broom", or "pechuga", meaning "breast meat of chicken".

"Ramaria botrytis" was designated the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "Ramaria" in 1933 by <a href="Marinus%20Anton%20Donk">Marinus Anton Donk</a>. Modern <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis indicates that "Ramaria" is a <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a> assemblage of species with <a href="clavarioid%20fungi">clavarioid</a> fruit bodies. According to the infrageneric <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> scheme proposed by Marr and Stuntz, "R. botrytis" is included in the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Ramaria", which includes species that have grooved spores, <a href="clamp%20connections">clamps</a> present in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e, and fruit bodies with a large, profusely branched cauliflower-like appearance. <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis of nuclear <a href="28S%20ribosomal%20RNA">large subunit</a> <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> suggests that "R. botrytis" is closely related to "<a href="Ramaria%20rubripermanens">R. rubripermanens</a>" and "<a href="Ramaria%20rubrievanescens">R. rubrievanescens</a>", and that these species form a <a href="cladistics">clade</a> that is <a href="sister%20group">sister</a> (sharing a recent <a href="common%20descent">common ancestor</a>) to the <a href="false%20truffle">false truffle</a> genus "<a href="Gautieria">Gautieria</a>", the most <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> group within the studied <a href="taxon">taxa</a>.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> produced by the fungus are wide and tall. They are fleshy cauliflower-like masses with a stout central stem that splits into a few lower primary branches before branching densely above. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is short and thick—between in diameter—and tapers downward. Initially white, in age both the stem and branches turn pale yellow to <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> to <a href="tan%20%28color%29">tan</a>. Old fruit bodies can fade to become almost white, or may be <a href="ochre">ochre</a> due to fallen spores. The branching pattern is irregular, with the primary branches few and thick—typically —and the final branches slender (2–3 mm), and usually terminated with five to seven branchlets. The branchlet tips are pink to purplish-red. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is solid and white, and has an odor described variously as indistinct or pleasant. A drop of <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a> applied to the stem tissue reveals a weak <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a> staining <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">reaction</a> that often requires more than 30 minutes to develop. This reaction can be used to help distinguish "R. botrytis" from other similar fungi.

<a href="Basidiospore">Spore</a>s are produced by <a href="basidia">basidia</a> on the outer surface of the branches. Viewed in <a href="spore%20print">deposit</a>, the spores are pale yellow. Microscopically, they have fine longitudinal or oblique striations that often fuse together in a vein-like network. They range in shape from roughly cylindrical to sigmoid (curved like the letter "S"), and their dimensions are 12–16 by 4–5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. Basidia are four-spored (occasionally two-spored), and measure 59–82 by 8–11 µm. The <a href="sterigma">sterigma</a>ta (slender projections of the basidia that attach to the spores) are 4–8 µm long. The <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> and subhymenium (the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium) combined are about 80 µm thick. Hyphae comprising the subhymenium are interwoven, 2.5–4.5 µm in diameter, thin-walled, and clamped.

The variety "R. botrytis" var. "aurantiiramosa" is distinguished from the more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches. Variety "compactospora" tends to show a more pronounced wine-red, purple, or reddish color in the branch tips, and has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4 µm.

Distinctive features of "Ramaria botrytis" include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7 µm, and a weak amyloid staining reaction of the stem tissue. "<a href="Ramaria%20rubripermanens">R. rubripermanens</a>" has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from "R. botrytis" by its much shorter spores. Other species with which "R. botrytis" may be confused include: "<a href="Ramaria%20formosa">R. formosa</a>", which has branches that are pinker than "R. botrytis", and yellow-tipped; "<a href="Ramaria%20caulifloriformis">R. caulifloriformis</a>", found in the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; "<a href="Ramaria%20strasseri">R. strasseri</a>", which has yellow to brown branch tips; "<a href="Ramaria%20rubrievanescens">R. rubrievanescens</a>", which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and "<a href="Ramaria%20botrytoides">R. botrytoides</a>", which is most reliably distinguished from "R. botrytis" by its smooth spores. The European species "<a href="Ramaria%20rielii">R. rielii</a>", often confused with "R. botrytis" and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: "R. reilii" lacks the clamped hyphae of "R. botrytis", its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species "<a href="Ramaria%20araiospora">R. araiospora</a>", though superficially similar to "R. botrytis", has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a>; it has reddish to <a href="magenta">magenta</a> branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7 µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to reddish, "<a href="Ramaria%20subbotrytis">R. subbotrytis</a>" has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5 µm.
An <a href="mycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizal</a> species, "Ramaria botrytis" forms <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> associations with <a href="broadleaf%20tree">broadleaf tree</a>s, particularly <a href="beech">beech</a>. In a study to determine the effectiveness of several edible ectomycorrhizal fungi in promoting growth and nutrient accumulation of <a href="large-fruited%20red%20mahogany">large-fruited red mahogany</a> ("Eucalyptus pellita"), "R. botrytis" was the best at improving root colonization and <a href="macronutrient">macronutrient</a> uptake. Records of associations with <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s probably represent similar species. Fruit bodies grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in small groups among leaves in woods. They can also grow in <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. "Ramaria botrytis" is a "<a href="snowbank%20fungus">snowbank fungus</a>", meaning it commonly fruits near the edges of melting snowbanks in the spring. In Korea, it is prevalent at sites that also produce the choice edible species "<a href="Tricholoma%20matsutake">Tricholoma matsutake</a>".

"Ramaria botrytis" is found in Africa (<a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>), Australia, Asia (including the eastern <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> of India, Nepal, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, China, the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Far East of Russia</a>, and Turkey) and Europe (including the Netherlands, France, Portugal, Italy, Bulgaria, and Spain). It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala. Widely distributed in North America, it is most common in the southeast and along the <a href="Pacific%20Coast">Pacific Coast</a>. The variety "R. botrytis" var. "aurantiiramosa", limited in distribution to <a href="Lewis%20County%2C%20Washington">Lewis County, Washington</a>, associates with <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> ("Pseudotsuga menziesii") and <a href="western%20hemlock">western hemlock</a> ("Tsuga heterophylla"). Variety "compactospora" is known from <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, Italy, where it has been found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising <a href="Arbutus%20unedo">strawberry tree</a> ("Arbutus unedo"), <a href="tree%20heath">tree heath</a> ("Erica arborea"), and <a href="holm%20oak">holm oak</a> ("Quercus ilex").

"Ramaria botrytis" is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species, and some rate it as choice. Its taste is "slight", or "fruity", and has been likened to <a href="sauerkraut">sauerkraut</a>, green peanuts (fresh harvested peanuts that have not been dehydrated), or pea pods. Older fruit bodies develop an acidic flavor. It is sold in food markets in Japan as "Nedzumi-take", and harvested from the wild in Korea and Nepal. The thick base and main branches require longer cooking than the smaller branchlets. In the <a href="Garfagnana">Garfagnana</a> region of central Italy, the mushroom is stewed, or <a href="pickling">pickled</a> in oil. Fruit bodies can be preserved by slicing thinly and drying. One field guide rates the edibility as "questionable", warning of the possible danger of confusing specimens with the poisonous "Ramaria formosa". Other authors warn that some individuals may experience <a href="laxative">laxative</a> effects from consuming the mushroom. Caution is advised when collecting fruit bodies near polluted areas, as the species is known to <a href="bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a> toxic <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>.

Chemical analysis shows "R. botrytis" to have a <a href="food%20energy">food energy</a> value of 154 <a href="kilojoule">kilojoule</a>s per 100 grams of fresh fruit bodies, which is comparable to the 120–150 kJ range reported for commercially grown edible mushrooms. As a percentage of <a href="dry%20matter">dry matter</a>, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a>, 1.4% <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, 50.8% <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, and 8.8% <a href="Ash%20%28analytical%20chemistry%29">ash</a>. The majority of the lipid content comprises <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic</a> (43.9%), <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic</a> (38.3%), and <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic</a> (9.9%) <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s.

<a href="Extract">Extract</a>s of the fruit body of "Ramaria botrytis" have been shown to favorably influence the growth and development of <a href="HeLa">HeLa</a> cells grown in <a href="tissue%20culture">tissue culture</a>. The mushroom contains <a href="nicotianamine">nicotianamine</a>, an <a href="ACE%20inhibitor">ACE inhibitor</a> (<a href="angiotensin-converting%20enzyme">angiotensin-converting enzyme</a>). Nicotianamine is a <a href="chelation">metal-chelating</a> compound essential in iron metabolism and utilization in plants. Several <a href="sterol">sterol</a>s have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22"E")-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, <a href="ergosterol%20peroxide">ergosterol peroxide</a>, <a href="cerevisterol">cerevisterol</a>, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown <a href="ceramide">ceramide</a> (2"S",2"R",3"R",4"E",8"E")-"N"-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.

<a href="Kirby-Bauer%20antibiotic%20testing">Laboratory tests</a> show that fruit bodies have <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> activity against several strains of <a href="drug%20resistance">drug-resistant</a> bacteria that are <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic in humans. Extracts <a href="bacteriostatic%20agent">inhibit</a> the growth of the <a href="Gram-negative%20bacteria">Gram-negative</a> bacteria "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecalis">Enterococcus faecalis</a>" and "<a href="Listeria%20monocytogenes">Listeria monocytogenes</a>", and <a href="bactericide">kill</a> the <a href="Gram-positive%20bacteria">Gram-positive</a> species "<a href="Pasteurella%20multocida">Pasteurella multocida</a>", "<a href="Streptococcus%20agalactiae">Streptococcus agalactiae</a>" and "<a href="Streptococcus%20pyogenes">S. pyogenes</a>". A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against "<a href="Proteus%20vulgaris">Proteus vulgaris</a>".

In a 2009 study of 16 Portuguese edible wild mushroom species, "R. botrytis" was shown to have the highest concentration of <a href="phenolic%20acid">phenolic acid</a>s (356.7 <a href="milligram">mg</a> per <a href="kilogram">kg</a> of fresh fruit body), made up largely of <a href="protocatechuic%20acid">protocatechuic acid</a>; it also had the highest <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> capacity.

Accurate News and Information Act

The Accurate News and Information Act was a statute passed by the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, in 1937, at the instigation of <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>'s <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Social Credit</a> government. It would have required newspapers to print "clarifications" of stories that a committee of Social Credit legislators deemed inaccurate, and to reveal their sources on demand.

The act was a result of the stormy relationship between Aberhart and the press, which dated to before the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 election</a>, in which the Social Credit League was elected to government. Virtually all of Alberta's newspapers—especially the "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>"—were critical of Social Credit, as were a number of publications from elsewhere in Canada. Even the American media had greeted Aberhart's election with derision.

Though the act won easy passage through the Social Credit-dominated legislature, <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20of%20Alberta">Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Bowen">John C. Bowen</a> <a href="disallowance%20and%20reservation">reserved</a> <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> until the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> evaluated the act's legality. In 1938's "<a href="Reference%20re%20Alberta%20Statutes">Reference re Alberta Statutes</a>", the court found that it was unconstitutional, and it never became law.

<a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>'s <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Social Credit League</a>, running candidates for the first time, won a large majority in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 Alberta election</a> on the strength of promises to use a new economic theory called <a href="Social%20Credit">social credit</a> to end <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20Canada">depression</a> conditions in the province. It did so against the almost uniform opposition of the news media. Some of the province's major newspapers were loyal to one of the traditional parties: the "<a href="Edmonton%20Bulletin">Edmonton Bulletin</a>", for example, had supported the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberals</a> since its inception.

Aberhart initially laid out his economic agenda in only vague terms, and by early 1935 his opponents, including Premier <a href="Richard%20Gavin%20Reid">Richard Gavin Reid</a> of the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a>, were trying to force him to commit to a specific plan. The "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>" took up this call, going so far as to offer Aberhart a full page to lay out his approach in detail. Aberhart refused, on the grounds that he considered the "Herald"'s coverage of him to be unfair. He frequently attacked the newspaper in speeches around the province, and on April 28 suggested that his followers boycott it and other unfriendly newspapers. The boycott was successful to the extent that it drove at least one newspaper out of business. The "Herald" responded to the boycott by asking "Is everyone opposed to the political opinions and plans of Mr. Aberhart to be boycotted? He has invoked a most dangerous precedent and has given the people of this province a foretaste of the Hitlerism which will prevail if he ever secures control of the provincial administration."

Shortly before the election, the "Herald" began to run cartoons by <a href="Stewart%20Cameron">Stewart Cameron</a>, a virulently anti-Aberhart cartoonist. The day before the election, it ran one featuring a car, labelled "the people", travelling along "Aberhart Highway No. 1" and arriving at a railway crossing. A train, labelled "common sense", was approaching from around the bend, along tracks labelled "fundamental facts". Aberhart leans out the "S.C. Signal Tower" advising the car "All's clear. Don't stop, look or listen."

Though the "Herald" was the most strident in its opposition to Aberhart and Social Credit, the "Bulletin", the "<a href="Edmonton%20Journal">Edmonton Journal</a>", the "<a href="Medicine%20Hat%20News">Medicine Hat News</a>", the "<a href="Lethbridge%20Herald">Lethbridge Herald</a>", and many smaller papers all, in the words of <a href="Athabasca%20University">Athabasca University</a> historian Alvin Finkel, "attacked Social Credit viciously as a chimera which, if placed in power, would wreck Alberta's chances for economic recovery." Of the province's major papers, only the "Calgary Albertan" provided even lukewarm support.

So frustrated were the Social Crediters with the newspapers' hostility that in 1934 they founded their own, the "Alberta Social Credit Chronicle", to spread their views. The "Chronicle", in addition to acting as Aberhart's mouthpiece, carried guest editorials by such figures as British <a href="fascism">fascist</a> leader <a href="Oswald%20Mosley">Oswald Mosley</a> and <a href="anti-semitism">anti-semitic</a> priest <a href="Charles%20Coughlin">Charles Coughlin</a>.

Media reaction to Social Credit's 1935 victory, in which it won 56 of 63 seats in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>, was almost uniformly negative. The "Herald" opined that "the people of Alberta have made a most unfortunate decision and may soon see the folly of it." Even the "Albertan" expressed its wish that social credit be first tried in "Scotland, or Ethiopia or anywhere but Alberta." Reaction across Canada was also negative; the "<a href="St.%20Catharines%20Standard">St. Catharines Standard</a>" called the results "a nightmare that passeth all understanding" and the "<a href="Montreal%20Star">Montreal Star</a>" accused Albertans of voting for "an untried man and a policy whose workings he ostentatiously refused to explain before polling day." American newspapers were less restrained: the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" asked "Greetings to the Canadians. Who's loony now?" and the "<a href="Boston%20Herald">Boston Herald</a>"'s headline screamed "Alberta goes crazy".

The relationship did not improve once Aberhart took office. In January 1935, H. Napier Moore wrote two articles for "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" casting doubt on Aberhart's honesty and his ability to follow through on his election promises. The American "<a href="Collier%27s%20Weekly">Collier's Weekly</a>" ran a profile that mocked Aberhart's appearance, taking note of his "vast colorless face" and his "narrow, left slanted mouth with soft, extra-heavy, bloodless lips which don't quite meet and through which he breathes wetly." Finkel, finding fault with both sides of the Aberhart-press feud, states
The major newspapers of the province opposed virtually everything the government did. Virtually every reform instituted was made to sound more draconian than it actually was. The conservative views of the owners and editors often interfered with the objective presentation of news reports, although perhaps not to the extent that the government claimed. In many cases, the papers simply concentrated on the very real chaos and confusion in government ranks and required few embellishments to make the government look bad.
The "Herald" lured Stewart Cameron away from working on <a href="Walt%20Disney">Disney</a>'s "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>" to make him its first ever staff cartoonist; Cameron devoted himself full-time to the ridicule of Aberhart. Though Social Credit staffer turned journalistic historian John Barr argues that the media's unswerving hostility to Aberhart may have benefited him politically by allowing him to "depict the press as a mere tool of Eastern financial and commercial interests", by January 1936 Aberhart was telling the listeners of his weekly gospel radio show that he was "glad there will be no newspapers in heaven."

To help combat the negative press, Aberhart resolved to gain control of the "Albertan", the one paper of note to show him any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a <a href="Christian%20radio">gospel</a> program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the "Albertan" became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.

Aberhart reacted bitterly to the media's hostility. In a September 20, 1937, radio broadcast, he said of the press "these creatures with mental hydrophobia will be taken in hand and their biting and barking will cease." Four days later, a special session of the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a> opened, with the "Accurate News and Information Act" figuring prominently on its <a href="order%20paper">order paper</a>.

The <a href="1937%20Social%20Credit%20backbenchers%27%20revolt">1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt</a> had forced Aberhart to abdicate a portion of his power to the newly created <a href="Social%20Credit%20Board">Social Credit Board</a>, which consisted of five Social Credit backbenchers charged with supervising a commission of experts. While the initial plan was to have this commission headed by <a href="C.%20H.%20Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a>, social credit's British founder, Douglas did not like Aberhart and did not view his approach to social credit as consistent with its true form. He refused to come. Instead, he sent two subordinates, L. D. Byrne and G. F. Powell. These surrogates were charged with recommending legislation to implement social credit in Alberta. Their first round of proposals, which included measures imposing government control on banks and prohibiting any person from challenging the constitutionality of any Alberta law in court without receiving the approval of the <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20in%20Council">Lieutenant-Governor in Council</a>, was <a href="disallowance%20and%20reservation">disallowed</a> by the federal government. The second round included the "Accurate News and Information Act".

The act empowered the chair of the Social Credit Board to require a newspaper to reveal the names and addresses of its sources, as well as the names and addresses of any writers, including of unsigned pieces. Non-compliance would result in fines of up to $1,000 per day, and prohibitions on the publishing of the offending newspaper, of stories by offending writers, or of information emanating from offending sources. The act also required newspapers to print, at the instruction of the chair of the Social Credit Board, any statement "which has for its object the correction or amplification of any statement relating to any policy or activity of the Government of the Province."

The act was attacked by opposition politicians as evidence of the government's supposed fascism, and alienated even the "Albertan". The international press was also cutting: one British paper referred to Aberhart as "a little Hitler". Later commentators have been no more favourable: Finkel calls the act evidence of the "increasingly authoritarian nature of the Aberhart regime", and even Barr, generally sympathetic to Social Credit, calls it "a harsh blow to free speech".

<a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20of%20Alberta">Lieutenant-Governor</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Bowen">John C. Bowen</a>, mindful of the federal government's disallowance of the Social Credit Board's earlier legislation, <a href="disallowance%20and%20reservation">reserved</a> <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> of the act and its companions until their legality could be tested at the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>. This was the first use of the power of reservation in Alberta history, and in the summer of 1938 Aberhart's government announced the elimination of Bowen's <a href="Government%20House%20%28Alberta%29">official residence</a>, his government car, and his secretarial staff. Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller and <a href="Ernest%20Manning">Ernest Manning</a> biographer <a href="Brian%20Brennan%20%28author%29">Brian Brennan</a> attribute this move to revenge for Bowen's reservation of assent.

Bowen put a stop to the "Accurate News and Information Act", at least temporarily, but Aberhart's fight against the press continued: on March 25, 1938, a resolution of the Social Credit-dominated legislature ordered that Don Brown, a reporter for the "Edmonton Journal", be jailed "during the pleasure of the assembly" for allegedly misquoting Social Credit backbencher <a href="John%20Lyle%20Robinson">John Lyle Robinson</a> on the inclusion of <a href="chiropractors">chiropractors</a> in the "Workman's Compensation Act". Brown was never actually jailed; the next day, in response to negative publicity from across Canada, the legislature passed another resolution, ordering "the release of Mr. Don C. Brown from custody." In Barr's view, "the government was made to look less ominous than silly."

Around the same time, the Supreme Court ruled on the "<a href="Reference%20re%20Alberta%20Statutes">Reference re Alberta Statutes</a>". It found that the "Accurate News and Information Act", along with the others submitted to it for evaluation, was "<a href="ultra%20vires">ultra vires</a>" (beyond the powers of) the Alberta government. In the case of the "Accurate News and Information Act", the court found that the <a href="Canadian%20constitution">Canadian constitution</a> included an "<a href="implied%20bill%20of%20rights">implied bill of rights</a>" that protected freedom of speech as being critical to a parliamentary democracy.

For its leadership in the fight against the act, the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a> committee awarded the "Edmonton Journal" a bronze plaque, the first time it honoured a non-American newspaper. Ninety-five other newspapers, including the "Calgary Albertan", "Edmonton Bulletin", "Calgary Herald", "Lethbridge Herald", and "Medicine Hat News", were presented with engraved certificates.

Garnet Malley

Garnet Francis Malley, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (2 November 1892 – 20 May 1961) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of World War I, credited with six aerial victories. He was an aviation adviser to <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>'s government in China during the 1930s, and an intelligence officer in World War II.

Born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Malley first saw service in World War I as an artilleryman with the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a>. He transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> in 1917, and the following year flew <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s with <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Malley was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for his achievements in combat, and his subsequent work as a flying instructor in England earned him the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>.

After a spell in civilian life following the war, Malley joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1925, serving with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>. He became an aviation adviser to China in 1931, and worked closely with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, <a href="Soong%20Mei-ling">Soong Mei-ling</a>, from 1937. Malley was able to observe air tactics in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Sino-Japanese War</a> at first hand, though his reports were given little weight in Australia. Returning home in 1940, he served in intelligence roles with the RAAF and later the Commonwealth government. After the war he bought a plantation in Fiji, where he died in 1961.

Garnet Francis Malley, the second youngest of six children of Clara Ellen Merritt and Francis Malley, was born in <a href="Mosman%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mosman</a>, a suburb of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, on 2 November 1892. His father, an ironworker originally from <a href="Gosford">Gosford</a>, founded the <a href="Major%20appliance">whitegoods</a> firm Malley's. He later served two terms as <a href="alderman">alderman</a> of <a href="Municipality%20of%20Mosman">Mosman Council</a>. Garnet Malley attended the Church of England Preparatory School in Mosman, <a href="The%20School%2C%20Mount%20Victoria">The School</a> in <a href="Mount%20Victoria%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mount Victoria</a>, and <a href="Hawkesbury%20Agricultural%20College">Hawkesbury Agricultural College</a> in <a href="Richmond%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Richmond</a>. At the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20I">outbreak of World War I</a> he was an apprentice mechanic at Malley's.

Malley joined the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 12 October 1915. He departed <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> for Egypt as a gunner with reinforcements of the <a href="1st%20Regiment%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Artillery">1st Field Artillery Brigade</a> aboard <a href="HMAT%20Wandilla">HMAT "Wandilla"</a> on 9 November. In March 1916, he was posted to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in France, and joined his unit in May. The 1st Brigade took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battles of Pozières</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Mouquet%20Farm">Mouquet Farm</a> in July and August 1916. Malley transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) as a mechanic in April 1917, before undertaking flying instruction at the <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> air school. He was commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 9 October and assigned to <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a>, then based in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>.

Equipped with <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> fighters, No. 4 Squadron deployed to <a href="Bruay-la-Buissi%C3%A8re">Bruay</a>, France, in December 1917, and commenced operations on 9 January 1918. That same day Malley, nicknamed "Garnie" (or "George", by No. 4 Squadron's leading ace, <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>), was promoted <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. On 16 March, he achieved his first aerial victory, sending a fighter belonging to <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>'s Red Circus out of control above <a href="Annoeullin">Annoeullin</a>, near <a href="Douai">Douai</a>. Early reports identified the German plane as an <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a>, but later sources record it as a <a href="Pfalz%20D.III">Pfalz D.III</a>. Malley claimed two Albatroses on 23 March 1918, during an attack on German positions in <a href="Vaulx-Vraucourt">Vaulx-Vraucourt</a>, near <a href="Bapaume">Bapaume</a>. Three days later he was promoted <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> and appointed a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight commander</a>.
The <a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">official history of Australia in the war</a> credits Malley with the destruction of a Pfalz over Wytschaete on 10 May, though it does not appear in other accounts of his final tally. Four days later, he and Lieutenant <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a> each claimed a German two-seater spotting for artillery between <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> and <a href="Bailleul%2C%20Nord">Bailleul</a>. On 30 May, Malley and Cobby led their flights on a bombing mission in the <a href="Leie">Lys</a> region, after which they each destroyed a German observation balloon over <a href="Estaires">Estaires</a>. Malley's final victory, over the Lys on 1 June, was a Pfalz D.III. His official tally was six German aircraft destroyed—four fighters, an observation balloon, and an unidentified observation plane—and he was wounded in action twice, by a bullet through the leg in March, and by shrapnel from anti-aircraft fire in May. He was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> on 22 June. The citation was promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>":

Malley took temporary command of No. 4 Squadron at the end of June 1918, overseeing its move from <a href="Clairmarais%20aerodrome">Clairmarais North</a> to a new airfield at <a href="Reclinghem">Reclinghem</a>. In August, he was posted to <a href="No.%205%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 (Training) Squadron AFC</a> at <a href="Minchinhampton">Minchinhampton</a>, England. The squadron was part of the <a href="No.%201%20Wing%20RAAF">1st Training Wing</a>, led by Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Oswald%20Watt">Oswald Watt</a>. Malley's rotation to home establishment was in accordance with <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> policy requiring pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. Known for flying a white Camel trainer, he received the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> for his instructional work; the award was promulgated on 3 June 1919.

No. 5 Squadron was disbanded in May 1919. Along with many other Australian Flying Corps personnel, including Colonel Watt, Major King, and Captain <a href="Les%20Holden">Les Holden</a>, Malley returned to Australia aboard the troopship "Kaisar-i-Hind", disembarking in Sydney on 19 June. He subsequently toured the country to promote the <a href="Peace%20Loan">Peace Loan</a>. On 24 August, while travelling from Melbourne to Sydney to commence his series of demonstration flights around New South Wales, Malley crashed his <a href="Avro%20504">Avro 504</a>K during takeoff from <a href="Benalla">Benalla</a>, Victoria. He was uninjured but had to return to Melbourne and eventually made his way north by train. Resuming his aerial program, he was reported on 17 September as having "thrilled" lunch-time crowds in Sydney the previous day with "three daring spiral dives" over <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park</a>. Malley was discharged from the AIF on 4 October 1919, and commissioned a captain in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Commonwealth Military Forces</a> Reserve on 1 July 1920. He rejoined Malley's as a warehouse manager in 1921. In May that year, he served with Les Holden and other veteran pilots as a pall-bearer at Watt's funeral in <a href="Randwick%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Randwick</a>. On 25 January 1922, Malley married Phyllis Kathleen Dare in Mosman. The union would produce one son, Maldon. Malley was acknowledged as both a source and a reviewer by F.M. Cutlack in the latter's volume on the Australian Flying Corps, first published in 1923 as part of the official history of Australia in the war.
Malley relinquished his appointment in the Commonwealth Military Forces on 18 June 1925. The following day, he was commissioned a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in the Citizen Air Force, the part-time active reserve of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He served as a pilot with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>s and <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s. Formed at <a href="RAAF%20Williams">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, the squadron transferred to the newly opened <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Richmond</a>, New South Wales, on 30 June. From 1925 to 1928, Malley was vice president of the Australian Flying Corps Association. In January 1928, he was promoted to honorary <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, and temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron in March–April. That year, he gave up his position with Malley's to become an aviation consultant to <a href="Australian%20National%20Airways%20%281930%29">Australian National Airways</a> (ANA), as well as a director of the company. In January–February 1929, he again temporarily commanded No. 3 Squadron. That April, he was a member of the citizens' committee responsible for organising and funding the search for the "<a href="Southern%20Cross%20%28aircraft%29">Southern Cross</a>" and its crew, <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ulm">Charles Ulm</a>, who had force-landed in <a href="North%20West%20Australia">North West Australia</a> during a flight from Richmond to England. Les Holden eventually located the missing airmen near the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> region. In 1930, Malley transferred to the (inactive) <a href="RAAF%20Reserve">RAAF Reserve</a>.

By 1931, ANA was in financial difficulties and Malley travelled to China to take up a position as an aviation adviser to <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>'s government in <a href="Guangdong">Kwangtung</a>. Details of Malley's exact duties over the next five years—a time of civil war and Japanese infiltration—remain uncertain. He spent some time in Australia on holiday in 1936, after which he returned to his advisory role in China. On 1 February 1937, through the influence of the British <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign Office</a>, Malley's status was enhanced when he was made an honorary <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> in the RAAF Reserve. He was by now serving as adviser to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, <a href="Soong%20Mei-ling">Soong Mei-ling</a>, in her capacity as secretary-general of the aeronautical commission that directed <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20Air%20Force">China's air force</a>; May-Ling extended to Malley her "warmest congratulations" for his "well deserved" promotion. One of the tasks she assigned him was investigating corrupt procurement practices in the government. Malley found that the air ministry was being defrauded by foreign agents and Chinese officials colluding to charge inflated prices for military equipment.

Malley's stay increasingly involved him in the <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">fighting in China</a>; his wife would relate three years of night-time air raids to her friends upon the couple's return to Australia in 1940. In May 1938, he advised the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice-Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>: "there is a first-class war on here, which must eventually affect Australia and its defence schemes". Williams and other members of the RAAF may, however, have perceived Malley as exaggerating the importance of his role in China, particularly given his apparent delight in its ceremonial aspects. In one letter, he regaled Williams with stories of an inspection tour around the country, declaring: "I ... can just imagine how much you would have enjoyed it – landing on aerodromes that were all polished up for inspection. Being met by provincial dignitaries and lavishly entertained. I had to drink every conceivable Chinese wine that was ever made, and to eat foods unheard of in Australia!" At any rate, Malley's reports of Japanese air tactics, and the value his observations might have held for Australia in the event of war in the Pacific, were largely discounted by his home government.

Malley was recalled to Australia in July 1940, departing China with a note of thanks from May-Ling for his "loyal service" before rejoining the RAAF on active service as a squadron leader in October. He became the Air Force representative at the Combined Operational Intelligence Centre (COIC), Melbourne, a <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">tri-service</a> organisation responsible for intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination. Drawing on his knowledge of Japanese raids on Chinese airfields in the 1930s, Malley visited several RAAF stations in northern Australia to advise on protective measures; it became evident in the wake of the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">attack on Darwin</a> in February 1942 that none of his recommendations had been implemented. COIC primarily handled naval intelligence, so Army and Air Force participation was part-time initially. By April 1941, Malley had been assigned a full-time role, and the RAAF was maintaining a round-the-clock presence. He was promoted to honorary wing commander in October 1941, and two months later succeeded Commander <a href="Rupert%20Long">Rupert Long</a> as Director of COIC. Malley was raised to acting <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> on 1 July 1942, but ill health forced him to relinquish his post on 3 October. He was discharged from the Air Force as medically unfit on 9 June 1943. General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> praised Malley for his "foresight, planning, and organizational ability". The former aviator went on to work as officer-in-charge of the Chinese section at the <a href="Commonwealth%20Police">Commonwealth Security Service</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> from January 1944 to March 1947 as an honorary group captain.
In 1948, Malley's war service was recognised by the United States with the award of the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>. By 1949, he had procured a yacht, the "Royal Flight", which was used as a setting in the film "<a href="The%20Blue%20Lagoon%20%281949%20film%29">The Blue Lagoon</a>". The following year, the family bought a coconut plantation on <a href="Vanua%20Balavu">Vanua Balavu</a>, Fiji. In September 1951, Malley and his wife toured the world, visiting <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, <a href="Guadaloupe">Guadaloupe</a>, <a href="Cura%C3%A7ao">Curaçao</a>, <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>, and <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>. They subsequently returned to live on their Fijian plantation, and rode out the <a href="1953%20Suva%20earthquake">1953 Suva earthquake and tsunami</a>.

Garnet Malley died of a heart attack on 20 May 1961. Survived by his wife and son, he was buried at sea in an Anglican ceremony. The commander-in-chief of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20Air%20Force">Taiwanese air force</a> sent condolences, paying tribute to the "invaluable" contribution Malley had made during his decade in China, which would "be long remembered".

John Linton Treloar, <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> (10 December 1894 – 28 January 1952) was an Australian <a href="archivist">archivist</a> and the second director of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> (AWM). During World War I he served in several <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">staff</a> roles and later headed the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a>'s (AIF) record-keeping unit. From 1920 Treloar played an important role in establishing the AWM as its director. He headed an <a href="Australian%20Government">Australian Government</a> department during the first years of World War II, and spent the remainder of the war in charge of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian military's</a> history section. Treloar returned to the AWM in 1946, and continued as its director until his death.

Treloar's career was focussed on the Australian military and its history. Prior to World War I he worked as a clerk in the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a> and, after volunteering for the AIF in 1914, formed part of the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> officer <a href="Brudenell%20White">Brudenell White</a>'s staff for most of the war's first years. He was appointed commander of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Records%20Section">Australian War Records Section</a> (AWRS) in 1917. In this position, he improved the AIF's records and collected a large number of artefacts for later display in Australia. Treloar was appointed the director of what eventually became the AWM in 1920, and was a key figure in establishing the Memorial and raising funds for its permanent building in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. He left the AWM at the outbreak of World War II to lead the Australian Government's <a href="Department%20of%20Information%20%28Australia%29">Department of Information</a>, but was effectively sidelined for much of 1940. In early 1941 he was appointed to command the Australian military's Military History and Information Section with similar responsibilities to those he had held during World War I. He attempted to intervene in the management of the AWM during his absence, however, to the increasing frustration of its acting director. Treloar worked intensely in all his roles and suffered periods of ill-health as a result. Following the war, he returned to the Memorial in 1946 but his performance deteriorated over time, possibly due to exhaustion. He died in January 1952.

Treloar continues to be regarded as an important figure in Australian <a href="military%20history">military history</a>. His principal achievements are seen as gathering and classifying Australia's records of the world wars and successfully establishing the AWM. The street behind the Memorial and its main storage annex were named in Treloar's honour following his death.

Treloar was born in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 10 December 1894. His father was a sales representative for <a href="Carlton%20%26amp%3B%20United%20Breweries">Carlton & United Breweries</a> and his mother was a strict <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>. Treloar was educated at Albert Park State School and became a trained <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> teacher. He was not able to attend university, but sought self-education in Melbourne's museums and libraries. Treloar also participated in his school's <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadet unit</a>, and believed that the military offered a means to follow his ambition for a career in a field other than small business. He was also a capable footballer, cricket player, and athlete and was invited to train with the <a href="Sydney%20Swans">South Melbourne Football Club</a>. He took his father's advice to wait until he was 21 before playing senior games, however, and instead took a job with the Department of Defence after he left school in 1911. In this position he worked as a clerk for <a href="Brudenell%20White">Brudenell White</a>, who was later a leading Australian staff officer of World War I and the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28Australia%29">commander</a> of the Australian Army during the early months of World War II.

On 16 August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Treloar enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) and became a staff sergeant working for White in the headquarters of the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a>. He <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landed at Anzac Cove</a> with the rest of the 1st Division's Headquarters during the morning of 25 April 1915, and subsequently participated in the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>. Treloar's duties were mainly clerical, and included typing reports, orders and dispatches from senior officers. He frequently worked from 7 am to midnight, and this took a toll on his health. He contracted <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> in late August, and was evacuated to Egypt on 4 September. Treloar came close to dying from this disease, and was returned to Australia to recuperate. He arrived in Melbourne on 4 December 1915. During his convalescence, Treloar resumed a pre-war friendship with Clarissa Aldridge and the couple became engaged. Treloar's older brother William also enlisted in the AIF during April 1915, and was one of the few members of the <a href="Mesopotamian%20Half%20Flight">Mesopotamian Half Flight</a> to survive captivity after being captured by Turkish forces.

When he recovered his health, Treloar returned to the military. An attempt to rejoin Brudenell White's staff was unsuccessful, and he instead was posted to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) with the rank of <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. In February 1916, Treloar was assigned to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron AFC</a> in Egypt and served as its equipment officer until July 1916, when he was transferred to France to become White's confidential clerk in the headquarters of <a href="I%20Anzac%20Corps">I Anzac Corps</a>. At the time of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a> in late July Treloar was in charge of the corps headquarters' Central Registry, which was responsible for communications within the headquarters as well as distributing orders to its subordinate units. During his staff roles Treloar gained a good understanding of military record-keeping. In May 1917, he was selected by White to command the newly established Australian War Records Section (AWRS), and was promoted to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a>. At the time he knew nothing of the Section's role, and was unable to find any information about it.

Treloar assumed command of the AWRS on 16 May 1917. At this time the Section comprised four enlisted soldiers and occupied two rooms in the British <a href="Public%20Record%20Office">Public Record Office</a>'s (PRO) building in London. Established upon the urging of the official Australian war correspondent <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a>, the unit was responsible for gathering records to serve as source material for the <a href="official%20history">official histories</a> that were to be written after the war. At this stage Australia did not have a <a href="Archive">national archive</a> or public records office, and the AWRS was the first organisation set up to preserve any <a href="Australian%20Government">Commonwealth Government</a> records. 
Treloar's first challenge was to improve the quality of the <a href="War%20diary">war diaries</a> kept by AIF units. These diaries were meant to be maintained by each element of the AIF as a record of its activities for later use by historians, but at the time most units recorded few details. To this end, Treloar met with many of the officers responsible for units' war diaries and frequently provided written advice and feedback on the quality of the records submitted to the Section; these methods had previously been used by the <a href="Canadian%20Forces">Canadian military</a>. Treloar also sought to motivate relevant personnel by demonstrating that the diaries were valued and would be important in ensuring that their unit received recognition for its achievements after the war. In August 1917 the AWRS expanded its activities to include collecting artefacts from the French battlefields. Its tasks increased further in September when it took over responsibility for supervising the <a href="Australian%20official%20war%20artists">official war artists</a> as well as producing and keeping records of non-official publications such as regimental magazines. Individual soldiers were encouraged to contribute artefacts and records, and the AWRS provided <a href="museum%20label">museum label</a>s to combat units to encourage them to record the significance and origins of items they submitted. The AWRS established field offices in France and Egypt, and reached a strength of about 600 soldiers and civilians in November 1918. From November 1917 until August 1918 the war correspondent <a href="Henry%20Gullett">Henry Gullett</a> commanded the AWRS subsection in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>; in this role he reported directly to Treloar. As a result of the AWRS' expansion, in March 1918 its headquarters moved from the PRO building to a larger office on <a href="Horseferry%20Road">Horseferry Road</a> opposite the main offices of the AIF Administrative Headquarters.

As commander of the AWRS, Treloar worked enthusiastically and at times had to be ordered to take holidays. He told Bean that he was motivated "to do something really worthwhile for Australia" by bringing together the records covering Australia's role in the war. He actively pursued records and artefacts covering a wide range of the AIF's activities. While Bean was impressed by Treloar's achievements, he believed that the young man was pushing himself too hard and was in danger of a breakdown. Although they shared accommodations in London for a period in 1918, the two men were not close. Treloar was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) on 3 June 1918 for "services in connection with the war" and was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> in December 1918. While this promotion recognised his achievements as commander of the AWRS, it was mainly intended to improve his status when he attended meetings of the War Trophies Commission; the British representative on this commission was a <a href="major%20general">major general</a>. Treloar arranged for Clarissa Aldridge to travel to Britain in 1918, and they were married in London on 5 November. The couple eventually had two daughters and two sons.

Following the war, Treloar continued to organise the records the AWRS had collected. In the months after the war the Section was assigned a large number of soldiers to assist with this task. The AWRS also continued to gather artefacts, and by February 1919 it had a collection of over 25,000 items; Treloar regarded this as "a good collection" but still not sufficient. He sought to collect records and memorabilia relevant to all aspects of Australia's experience in World War I, including material concerning the worst aspects of the Australian military. In doing so, Treloar deliberately did not make judgments on the historical value of the records and items submitted to the AWRS as he believed that this task should be left to others. On 3 June 1919 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), for "valuable services rendered in connexion with the war". Treloar arrived back in Australia on 18 July 1919.

The large quantity of artefacts and records which the AWRS had gathered were also returned to Australia in 1919, though work on organising them into an archive was not completed until 1932. The Australian War Museum was formed in 1919 on the basis of the Section's collection, and Treloar joined the Museum at some stage during the year. Henry Gullett was appointed the War Museum's first director on 11 August 1919 after Bean turned down the position so that he could focus on editing and writing the "<a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918</a>". Treloar was appointed the Museum's deputy director on the same date. Bean, Gullet and Treloar were subsequently the key figures in the establishment of the AWM.

Treloar became the acting director of the Australian War Museum in 1920 after Gullett resigned from the position and became head of the Australian Immigration Bureau. Gullet later wrote the official history of Australia's involvement in the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>. Treloar was 26 years of age at the time he became director of the Museum and was responsible for the difficult task of establishing the institution. Between 1920 and 1922 he personally undertook much of the work associated with developing the Museum's first major exhibition, which opened in Melbourne's <a href="Royal%20Exhibition%20Building">Royal Exhibition Building</a> on <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> 1922. During this period the staff of the Australian War Museum were also responsible for providing administrative support for a program to distribute captured German equipment as <a href="War%20trophy">war trophies</a> to the Australian states. Treloar was a member of the committee overseeing this effort, and the associated administrative load came close to overwhelming him.

Treloar continued to expand the Australian War Museum's collections during the 1920s. For instance, in 1921 he wrote to all the <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20Victoria%20Cross%20recipients">Australian Victoria Cross recipients</a> of World War I or their families to ask that they donate their wartime diaries or other personal items. The Museum also actively sought the wartime diaries and letters written by other members of the AIF; Treloar hoped that these records would allow a psychological study to be conducted on the men who had joined the AIF. Taking up an idea of Bean's, Treloar oversaw the development of several <a href="diorama">diorama</a>s depicting key Australian battles of the war and engaged professional artists to make the models. Several of the dioramas produced in the 1920s remain on display in the AWM and are among its most popular exhibits. Treloar also oversaw the completion of the artworks which had been commissioned from the official war artists during World War I and, in collaboration with Bean, ordered additional works. The institution was renamed the "Australian War Memorial Museum" in 1923, most likely on the suggestion of Treloar.

During its early years the AWM existed in a parlous state, and Treloar raised funds and advocated construction of a permanent building to house its records and collection of artefacts. Treloar and Bean convinced the Museum's governing committee that it needed to raise funds so that the Museum was not entirely dependent on Government funding for its permanent building. To this end, Treloar established a sales section in the Museum in 1921 and recruited salesmen to sell books, reproductions of artworks and photographs as well as surplus items from the collection such as German <a href="helmet">helmet</a>s and rifle <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">cartridges</a>. The Government was slow to commit to building a permanent home for the Museum's collection, however, and Treloar considered resigning in July 1922 to take up a position in the <a href="Department%20of%20Immigration%20and%20Citizenship">Department of Immigration</a>. He ultimately decided against doing so, however. In mid-1923 he was temporarily released from the Museum and travelled to London as the secretary of Australia's contribution to the <a href="British%20Empire%20Exhibition">British Empire Exhibition</a>. He returned to Australia in early 1925. During Treloar's absence the Museum moved to <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, where its collection was housed in the <a href="Sydney%20Exhibition%20Building">Sydney Exhibition Building</a> from April 1925. The institution's title was also simplified to the "Australian War Memorial" during this year, and following the passage of the "Australian War Memorial Act" by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament of Australia</a> in September was formally established as the national memorial to the Australians killed during World War I. This act specified that the Memorial would be overseen by a twelve-person Board of Management whose members were appointed by the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Australia">Governor General of Australia</a>. Treolar reported to this board, but it generally allowed him to run the Memorial as he saw fit. Treloar travelled to London again in 1927 to work on the British Empire Exhibition scheduled for that year, but returned after a few months when it was cancelled. On 8 December 1927 Treloar and the rest of the War Memorial's staff were appointed permanently to their positions; prior to this date they had been employed under temporary arrangements and Treloar had technically been a member of the Army's headquarters. Treloar took a brief leave of absence in 1931 to help organise the Empire Exhibition that was planned for Sydney.
The construction of a permanent building for the Memorial was delayed by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. In January 1924 the Commonwealth Government's <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a> approved a proposal to construct the War Memorial at the foot of <a href="Mount%20Ainslie">Mount Ainslie</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. An architectural competition was subsequently held, and Treloar was responsible for selecting the final designs to be considered after the judging panel had reduced the number of entries from 69 to 29. None of these designs met all the necessary criteria, but two of the architects responsible for highly placed designs agreed to collaborate to produce a final design. Plans for the Memorial building were approved by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Commonwealth Parliament</a> in 1928, but funds for construction work were not available due to the impact of the Great Depression. Work finally began on the building in 1933, and it was completed in 1941. Until 1935, Treloar and the Memorial's administrative staff were located in Melbourne while the collection was split between Sydney and Melbourne. In that year, Treloar, along with 24 other Memorial staff, moved into the uncompleted building in Canberra and the Memorial in Sydney was closed to enable the collection to be relocated.

Treloar continued to seek commercial opportunities to raise funds for the Memorial during the 1920s and 1930s. As well as selling guidebooks, reproductions of artworks and surplus items, the Memorial raised substantial amounts of money from placing an admission fee on <a href="Will%20Longstaff">Will Longstaff</a>'s painting "<a href="Menin%20Gate%20at%20Midnight">Menin Gate at Midnight</a>" when it went on display in 1929. This painting proved so popular that Treloar engaged ex-servicemen to sell reproductions of it door to door. In 1931 Treloar ensured that the Memorial took over responsibility for the publication and distribution of the "Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918" when the project suffered financial difficulties due to poor sales. As sales continued to be slow, Treloar actively promoted the series to <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">RSL</a> branches and members of the <a href="Australian%20Public%20Service">Australian Public Service</a>; a scheme he developed in which public servants purchased the books through regular pay deductions proved particularly successful. Treloar also engaged more salesmen to sell the series to households. These efforts led to a large increase in sales, and Bean remarked that not only had Treloar been more successful in selling the books than <a href="Angus%20%26amp%3B%20Robertson">Angus & Robertson</a>, its original publisher, but that "he would do better than [the department store] <a href="David%20Jones%20Limited">David Jones</a> selling shirts". This sales work was in addition to Treloar's regular duties as the Memorial's director, and he received an <a href="honorarium">honorarium</a> for it.

Treloar would typically work for six days each week, and normally stayed until late at night. In accordance with his Methodist beliefs, he did not work on Sundays. He continued to expand the Memorial's collections by encouraging individuals to donate letters and diaries to supplement the official records. Treloar also placed an emphasis on safeguarding the collection; in 1933 he personally investigated the theft of the <a href="SMS%20Emden%20%281908%29">German cruiser "Emden"</a>'s bell from the Memorial in Sydney after the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Force">New South Wales Police</a> broke off its investigation. With Treloar's assistance the bell was recovered later that year. In May 1937 Treloar was among the senior public servants who were awarded a Coronation Medal to mark King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>'s accession to the throne. Despite his enthusiasm, Treloar became frustrated by the repeated delays in opening the Memorial during the 1930s and believed that it would not be as successful as he had hoped. As a result, he began actively looking for a new career at the end of 1938, starting by applying to be the secretary of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>.

Shortly before the outbreak of World War II Treloar wrote to the members of the AWM's board to with proposals for how the Memorial should respond to another major war. This letter suggested that if hostilities occurred, the Memorial should suspend most of its activities and reorient its focus to become a memorial to all the wars in which Australia had taken part rather than just World War I. He further proposed that the Memorial building be used as a store and for government offices during the war, and that its staff establish a war records section similar to the AWRS. These proposals "ran counter to all that had been planned in the preceding years" and were rejected by the AWM board in October 1939. The board did decide, however, to offer the Department of Defence assistance with collecting records and artefacts. Accordingly, work continued on the Memorial throughout World War II, though in February 1941 the board decided to extend its scope to include the new war.

Treloar left his position at the Memorial for the duration of World War II. In September 1939 Treloar's close friend Henry Gullett, who at the time was the Minister for Information, appointed him the inaugural <a href="Departmental%20Secretary">secretary</a> of the Department of Information (DOI). The DOI was the first of 17 new Australian Government departments to be established during the war, and was responsible for both censorship and disseminating government <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>. Treloar ran the department in line with traditional Australian Public Service practices and took steps to prevent the its work from being politicised. To achieve this, he implemented tight internal controls over the DOI's procedures and information dissemination functions and instructed subordinates to not defend the government from criticism. He remained the departmental secretary after Gullett was moved to a different ministry in March 1940, but lost status when <a href="Keith%20Murdoch">Keith Murdoch</a> was appointed to the new position of Director-General of Information in June that year. Murdoch's appointment was part of a government campaign to generate public support for increased armaments production following the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">fall of France</a>, and he placed a stronger emphasis on generating propaganda. Treloar was troubled by the use of the DOI's photographers to produce publicity photographs instead of images with historical value. Gullet was killed in the <a href="1940%20Canberra%20air%20disaster">Canberra air disaster</a> on 13 August 1940. Treloar regained full control of the DOI in December that year when Murdoch resigned, though its photographers were still mainly tasked with taking publicity photos.

At some point in 1940 or early 1941, Treloar requested that he be appointed to command the War Records Section, which formed part of the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a>'s administrative headquarters. The Cabinet agreed to this during February 1941. Treloar's responsibilities in this role were to coordinate and control the collection of material to be included in the AWM as well as to supervise the official war artists and photographers; these duties were similar to those he and Bean had undertaken during World War I. While Treloar was appointed to the rank of <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>, he primarily worked for the AWM, which reimbursed the Army for his salary and allowances. This arrangement gave Treloar less influence with the Army than he had enjoyed as head of the AWRS during World War I. General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, the commander of the AIF, subsequently redesignated the War Records Section the Military History and Information Section (MHIS) on the grounds that its original name had not adequately described the unit's role. In contrast to the DOI's propaganda activities, the MHIS focused on collecting records, images and items that would be useful to historians.

After assuming his new position, Treloar was sent to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>. While en route to the Middle East he visited <a href="British%20Malaya">Malaya</a>. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.
Following the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in December 1941, most elements of the AIF were returned to Australia. While MHIS teams accompanied the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th</a> and <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Divisions</a> when they departed the Middle East in early 1942, Treloar remained in Egypt until May that year as he was initially unable to secure space on board ships for the Section's extensive collections. He eventually reached Australia in mid-1942 and was based in Melbourne for the remainder of the war. At the time, the front line of the Pacific War was in the islands just to the north of Australia. As Treloar argued in a letter to Blamey, Australia had the "opportunity and responsibility to provide the world with the most nearly complete and authoritative 'source' record" of the fighting. Blamey accepted this view, and in July 1942, the MHIS was renamed the Military History Section (MHS) in recognition of its emphasis on military history rather than propaganda. On 26 June 1942 Treloar received a <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mention in Despatches</a> for his service in October 1941.

The MHS continued the MHIS' role of facilitating the production of high-quality paper records and photographs of the war and collecting the resulting documents and images. The section had two field teams in April 1943 (one in Australia and the other in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>), and was expanded to nine teams by the end of 1944. Treloar also focused on the official war artist program, and succeeded in fostering a high-quality collection from a range of artistic styles. He placed a relatively low emphasis on collecting artefacts, however, and did not visit New Guinea even though it was the main Australian battlefield for most of the Pacific War. This concerned Bean, who wrote an unanswered letter to Treloar in July 1943 offering to help organise the collection of more items. In August 1943 Treloar's son Ian was reported missing while serving as a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a> attached to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. It was determined after the war that he had been killed in action. Treloar's other son, Alan, served in the Second AIF and won a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> after the war.

By early 1944 Treloar was overworked and unhappy to be in Melbourne instead of at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with the way in which Bean and the AWM's acting director <a href="Arthur%20Bazley">Arthur Bazley</a> were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.

One of Treloar's duties throughout much of the war was to compile and edit service annual books, which were compilations of articles written by military personnel and published by the AWM. He first proposed this in mid-1941 as an equivalent of "<a href="The%20Anzac%20Book">The Anzac Book</a>", which was a collection of anecdotes written by Australian soldiers during the Gallipoli Campaign. The first of these books, entitled "Active Service", was printed during late 1941 and early 1942 and eventually sold 138,208 copies. Seventeen service annual books were produced during and after the war, with combined sales of 1,907,446 copies. These books were sold at a profit and earned the Memorial large amounts of money. Treloar's editorial role came on top of his full-time duties as head of the MHS and was one of the main causes of his exhaustion and anxiety in the final years of the war.

Treloar returned to the AWM on 2 September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed he was suffering from bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with <a href="Leslie%20Bowles">Leslie Bowles</a> and <a href="William%20Dargie">William Dargie</a>. While Treloar was a <a href="Teetotalism">teetotaler</a> and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.

The main challenges for the Memorial in the post-war years were integrating the World War II collections with those from World War I and securing funding to expand its building. Treloar did not seek to increase the Memorial's holdings of World War II artefacts beyond supporting the completion of works commissioned from the official war artists. As a result, the Memorial's collection of World War II memorabilia was inferior to that assembled during and after World War I, and many of its best-known items such as the bomber <a href="G%20for%20George">G for George</a> were acquired as donations from the Government rather than through Treloar's efforts. It was not until October 1948 that the Government agreed to fund an expansion of the AWM after lobbying by Treloar and the Memorial's board.

Treloar experienced difficulties managing the Memorial and its staff in the years after World War II. While the AWM had few difficulties recruiting staff, it struggled to retain them due to housing shortages in Canberra and the way in which the Memorial was run. Treloar's working style contributed to these problems; although he was personally friendly and took an interest in the wellbeing of his employees, he did not delegate tasks and it was difficult for AWM staff to meet with him in person to discuss their responsibilities. This made it difficult for staff to complete urgent tasks, and contributed to delays in key projects such as the construction of the Memorial's Hall of Memory. <a href="Tom%20Hungerford">Tom Hungerford</a>, who worked for the AWM between 1948 and 1949, wrote in his memoirs that Treloar was "most dedicated, most incredibly hard-working, most unfailingly kind and most ineffectual". Treloar increasingly obsessed over relatively minor details and gained a reputation for indecisiveness.
Treloar's work patterns took a toll on his health, and the deterioration in his performance after 1946 was possibly the result of exhaustion. Despite this, the Memorial's board did not intervene in the institution's management and allowed Treloar to remain in his position. In January 1952, Dawn found him ill in bed after noticing that he had not signed the attendance book. Treloar was subsequently admitted to the <a href="Royal%20Canberra%20Hospital">Canberra Community Hospital</a> where he died on 28 January as a result of an intestinal haemorrhage. His funeral was held two days later at Reid Methodist Church in Canberra, and he was subsequently buried in the returned soldiers section of <a href="Woden%20Cemetery">Woden Cemetery</a>.

Treloar's death left the AWM in a state of crisis. Due to his close control over the Memorial, none of its staff knew what his plans had been and it was unclear how to continue key tasks such as completing the Roll of Honour, classifying and displaying items collected during World War II and managing the Memorial's finances. In addition, two fifths of the AWM's staff positions were vacant as Treloar had chosen to delay filling these vacancies. Jim McGrath, who had been the Memorial's Assistant Director (Administration) since May 1951, became acting director when Treloar was hospitalised and was confirmed in this position on 15 May 1952; Bazley had also applied for this job but lost to McGrath despite having Bean's support. Under the direction of Bean, who had been appointed the Chairman of the Memorial's Board in June 1951, McGrath established a committee to develop strategies for both completing and further developing the Memorial. Bean also personally reviewed the Memorial's collection of World War I artefacts during 1952 and 1953, and found that the register of these items was inadequate and it was not possible to locate many of them. He attributed this to the movement of the collection between Melbourne, Sydney and Canberra and the changes of directorship during periods in which Treloar was absent.

Following his death, Treloar was praised for the personal sacrifices he had made to establish the AWM, as well as for the high quality of the Memorial. The Memorial's storage and display annex at <a href="Mitchell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Mitchell, Australian Capital Territory</a>, was subsequently named the <a href="Treloar%20Resource%20Centre">Treloar Resource Centre</a> in Treloar's honour and a commemorative plaque was located outside the AWM's archival research centre until 1985. In 1956 the street behind the Memorial's main building was named Treloar Crescent. In addition, the AWM named a grant it provided to researchers the 'John Treloar Grant'.

Treloar continues to be regarded as an important figure in Australian military history. "The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History" states that "there is little doubt that the Australian War Memorial would have foundered had it not been for Treloar's tireless and selfless labours, which almost certainly shortened his life" and that he was "Australia's first great museum professional". The collection of World War I records he organised is still used by historians and researchers, and is labelled an "archival record of remarkable detail and accessibility" in his <a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a> entry. In 1993 Alan Treloar published the diary his father had kept during World War I.

Lad, A Dog

Lad: A Dog is a 1919 American novel written by <a href="Albert%20Payson%20Terhune">Albert Payson Terhune</a> and published by <a href="E.%20P.%20Dutton">E. P. Dutton</a>. Composed of twelve short stories first published in magazines, the novel is based on the life of Terhune's real-life <a href="Rough%20Collie">Rough Collie</a>, Lad. Born in 1902, the real-life Lad was an unregistered collie of unknown lineage originally owned by Terhune's father. Lad's death in 1918 was mourned by many of the story's fans, particularly children.

Through the stories of Lad's adventures, Terhune expresses his views on parenting, obtaining perfect obedience without force and the nature and rights of the "well-bred". Terhune began writing the stories in 1915 at the suggestion of his "<a href="Redbook">Red Book Magazine</a>" editor. They gained in popularity and, as Terhune was under contractual obligation to submit something to <a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday-Page</a>, he collected them into novel form. After Doubleday rejected the novel, he solicited other publishers until it was picked up by Dutton. After a slow start, the novel became a best seller in the adult fiction and children's fiction markets, having been repositioned as a young adult novel by <a href="Grosset%20and%20Dunlap">Grosset and Dunlap</a> in the 1960s and 1970s. Selling over one million copies, it is Terhune's best-selling work and the one that propelled him to fame. It has been reprinted over 70 times by Dutton and republished by a variety of publishers since its original release, including at least six international translations.

Contemporaneous critics praised Terhune's writing style and the overall story appeal, while dog breeders criticized his unrealistic canine characters. In retrospective reviews, critics considered that the novel had aged badly and that Terhune displayed little actual writing skill, but noted that the novel was able to hold long-lasting appeal as it triggered the reader's desire to have such an ideal dog. Terhune himself considered the novel "hack writing" and did not understand why it was so popular. Because of its reception, he went on to publish two additional novels featuring Lad and one featuring Lad's son, Wolf, as well as many other fictional stories featuring dogs. <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> released a film adaptation in June 1962. A series of four children's <a href="picture%20books">picture books</a> based on three of the stories from the novel were published by Margo Lundell between 1997 and 1998.


A Rough Collie named Lad lives at the Place with his Master, Mistress, and his mate, Lady. When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded at the Place, Lady begins ignoring Lad in favor of the newcomer. During a romp in the forest with Knave, Lady is caught in a <a href="leghold%20trap">leghold trap</a>. Knave leaves her there and returns home, but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>. The Master starts to whip her, but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.

On a cold October day, the Mistress falls into the lake and develops pneumonia. As the house must be kept quiet during her recovery, the dogs are sent to a <a href="boarding%20kennel">boarding kennel</a>, except Lad who is ordered to keep quiet. One night a thief breaks into the house, hoping to take advantage of the absence of the dogs. After he climbs through a window, Lad silently attacks him. During the ensuing fight Lad is cut with a knife before sending the man crashing back through the window. The noise wakes the humans of the house and the thief is arrested. After Lad's wound is treated, he enjoys praise from the Mistress, then travels some distance from home to enjoy a lengthy session of barking.

One spring, a relative of the Mistress brings her invalid toddler, Baby, to the Place in the hope that the weather will help her grow stronger. Lad immediately befriends the girl and becomes her constant companion. By summer, Baby is growing healthier, though she is still unable to walk. One afternoon, the mother sits the child near the lake, then leaves her to go meet the Master and Mistress, who are returning from town. Lad saves the baby from a <a href="Agkistrodon%20contortrix">copperhead</a>, but the distraught mother only sees Lad throw her backwards and begins beating him. To protect her friend, Baby manages to shakily walk to her mother and explain what happened. While the humans fuss over the occurrence, Lad sneaks off and spends four days buried in marsh mud to draw out the snake's poison.

Lady gives birth to three puppies, but after two die of unexplained causes, Lady lavishes all her attention on the surviving pup, Wolf. She later develops <a href="Canine%20distemper">distemper</a> and is taken away by the veterinarian, so Lad takes over the raising of his son, solemnly teaching him the Law of the Place. Wolf comes to love and respect his father and soon forgets his mother, though Lad continues to search for her daily. A month later, Wolf falls through the ice of the semi-frozen lake, and Lad nearly drowns while saving him. When Lad staggers to shore, he is ecstatically greeted by the recovered Lady.

The Master and Mistress enter Lad in the <a href="Westminster%20Dog%20Show">Westminster Dog Show</a> in New York, much to Lad's abject misery as he dislikes the preparatory bathing and brushing. Dismayed to learn that Lad will have to stay chained to a small bench for all four days of the event, his owners begin to regret bringing him. To their joy, Lad wins the <a href="blue%20ribbon">blue ribbon</a> in both the Novice and Winner classes, and they decide not to subject him to the four-day stay. When they let Lad know he is going home, he joyfully perks up.

Due to city regulations, the Master and Mistress are forced to <a href="Muzzle%20%28device%29">muzzle</a> Lad when they take him from the show. During the drive out of the city, Lad falls out of the car and is left behind. After he realizes he is lost, Lad starts towards home. Along the way he is chased by the police and a crowd of people, who presume he is <a href="rabid">rabid</a>, but he escapes them by swimming across the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>. Later he is attacked by a mongrel guard dog, but he refuses to run from the battle. He initially struggles to defend himself while muzzled, but then the other dog inadvertently bites through the strap holding the muzzle on, allowing Lad to quickly defeat him. When the Master and Mistress return from searching for Lad, they find him waiting on the porch.

Glure, a wealthy neighbor who considers himself <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, stops at the Place for a night while on the way to a livestock show with a flock of expensive sheep. During the night, Glure's "Prussian sheep dog", Melisande, worries the sheep and they break free from the pen. Though Lad has never seen sheep, he instinctively herds them together while keeping Melisande under control. When the humans arrive to take the sheep home, Glure's herdsman apologizes for having earlier insulted Lad and Glure offers to trade Melisande for Lad.

Tired of his high-priced imported livestock losing in local shows, Glure concocts a dog show with a special gold cup event that is limited to collies that are both <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> blue ribbon winners and capable of completing the tasks of a British working sheepdog trial. Initially, it seems like the only dog who meets the requirements is Glure's recently purchased <a href="Merle%20%28coat%20colour%20in%20dogs%29">blue-merle</a> champion, Lochinvar III; however, the Mistress is able to command Lad through the motions of the trial. Lochinvar works primarily by hand signal, so when Glure accidentally burns his fingers on his cigar while going through the trial, the dog stops working and waits for Glure's hand-shaking to be explained. The dog is disqualified and Lad is declared the winner. The Master and Mistress donate the gold cup to the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> in his name.

Glure tries to encourage the Master to support the "war effort" by killing his non-utilitarian animals, including his dogs. The Master quickly points out that Glure himself did not "sacrifice" his dogs, but lost them to distemper. Pointing out that Lad had just chased off a trespasser from the Place, he fiercely argues that his dogs are his home's best protection. A few days later during a livestock show, Lad attacks Glure's new groom, recognizing him as the trespasser he chased away earlier. Lad's attack frees a vicious bull, which goes into homicidal rage. Lad abandons his attack of the groom to protect him from the bull. The bull chases Lad over the river and consequently gets stuck in the mud. The Master quickly determines why Lad attacked the man and Glure grudgingly thanks them.

Lad is accused of killing eight sheep owned by a neighbor. When the Master refuses to believe the accusations, they are taken to court where the neighbor's farmhand testifies that he saw Lad kill two of the sheep. The Master successfully shows the improbability of a single dog carrying off six sheep in two nights and that the two dead sheep left behind were clearly cut with a knife, not teeth. After Lad is given a 24-hour parole, the Master asks the judge to accompany him to the neighbor's house that night, where they discover that the farmhand was actually stealing the sheep, then killing one from each batch to put the blame on Lad.

Wolf, the companion and friend of the Boy, is highly intelligent and an excellent guard dog. The Boy is upset that he is not allowed to enter the dog shows, though he understands that Wolf does not meet the <a href="Breed%20standard%20%28dogs%29">breed standards</a>. While the family is at a dog show with Bruce and Lad, Wolf is poisoned by an intruder. Having only eaten part of the tainted meat, Wolf is still alive when the thief returns to the house that night and is shot twice while protecting the Place. The thief escapes, but is later apprehended by the police while being treated for his bites. Wolf recovers and is given a "Hero Cup" trophy, to the Boy's delight.

On a cold, snowy day, thirteen-year-old Lad feels snubbed when the three-year-old Wolf does not invite him to join him and Rex, a five-year-old collie and <a href="bull%20terrier">bull terrier</a> mix, for a run in the woods. Later, Lad goes for a walk, following their path. When he meets them on the trail, rather than letting Lad pass, Rex viciously attacks him. With his teeth dulled by old age, Lad is unable to really fight back. Refusing to just run, he defends himself as best he can while moving backwards towards home, half a mile away. Though Wolf betrays him and joins Rex in the life-or-death fight, Lad manages to get close enough to the house for Bruce to hear the battle and alert the Master and Mistress. The Master is forced to kill Rex after the crazed dog turns on him. After four weeks recovering from his wounds, Lad is able to go outside again and Wolf steps aside for him, acknowledging he is still the leader of the Place's dogs.

The Lad stories tended to follow a persistent formula that Terhune used throughout most of his fiction. The main character was a "noble, almost saintly character" that could engage in battle, exact vengeance as needed, and displayed supernatural intelligence, loyalty, and understanding of the needs of his owners. Lad generally did battle with some villain, human or another dog, in defense of a helpless human or animal. Within each story, Terhune would speak in a positive, authoritative tone while dispensing various tidbits of information about canine behavior and thought processes. Injecting himself and his wife, Anice, into the novel, Terhune positioned the character of the "Master" as a "just, strict, well-intentioned but often rather bumbling man" who could be overly sentimental and was balanced by the "wise, calm, and patient" "Mistress".

One core theme of "Lad: A Dog" is the obtaining of perfect obedience without the use of force. Through the story characters' attempts at explaining Lad's inexplicable actions using "mythologies of <a href="atavism">atavism</a>", Terhune reflects his own views of an ideal relationship between a parent and child, namely an "ideology of noble instinct tempered by inflexible training". An unknown third-person narrator also reflects Terhune's perspective and values regarding violence, which is both repelled and embraced. Reflecting <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a> and the idea of a living creature that obeys unquestioningly and unhesitatingly, the novel indicates that "perfect obedience and submission to a master's will" can be obtained without needing violence or force. Indeed, Terhune regularly decries the use of physical punishment to gain obedience. For example, in the story "His Little Son", Lad takes over the raising of his son, using an even tempered, rational training system that reflects "discipline and firm kindliness". In the end, Lad is stated to have a stronger, love-based relationship with his son versus that of the pup with his mother, the temperamental Lady. Lady raised their son using physical force to impose her will, and thus after she leaves for a period, she is forgotten by him as he holds no love for her.

Within the novel, the Law forbids violence between the inhabitants of the Place. Despite its seemingly unyielding nature, it is in fact broken several times, though always with "good reason". In the story "His Mate", Lad meets and later must win the heart of his mate, Lady. Lad is clearly "enthralled" by the adult Lady's sexual appeal. As Terhune seems reluctant to note the facts of canine mating, Lady is never stated to actually go into heat. Instead the relationship is framed within the context of a "human courtly love triangle" when the "showy" Knave comes to the Place and Lady forgets Lad and fawns on the new arrival. When Lady is believed to have destroyed a beloved mounted <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>, the Master breaks the rules against violence and intends to beat her. Lad, in turn, breaks the rules of perfect obedience and growls, becoming the object of punishment and taking the beating in her stead. At the end of the story, when the Master realizes he was mistaken, he apologizes to Lad for beating the wrong dog. Despite the novel's overall theme of nonviolence, the Master's "unreasonable attachment to the bird" becomes the motivation for his "cruelty toward the helpless dogs", yet Lad perceives the Master's actions as "reasonable and functional". Though the numerous tenets of the Law forbid violence in various forms, if the dogs harm something of sentimental value it is deemed justifiable to treat them with "any amount of violence." This change is seen as reflecting a lack of maturity in the Master, and his having a "childish fixation on having his own way", showing a desire to have control and order over that which can never be perfectly ordered: everyday life. Throughout many of the stories, a consistent theme is the Master's imposition of will, behind which is the "blind rage of a child who cannot get exactly what he wants."

The dogs of the Place are trained and commanded to control any violent outbursts against the Place's occupants or guests, yet Lad's engaging acceptable targets is written to "glamorize" the use of violence. Throughout the novel, Lad is victorious in battles against two thieves, a runaway bull, an "invading Negro", and four other dogs, including a battle against two dogs at once. Each of the battles is referred to as a death match, with intricate detail on the tactics and strengths of a fighting collie. Terhune paints him as a "noble savage" who is "human-like, but better than human" and who worships, and is worshiped by, his humans.

Another theme frequently reflected is that of "breeding", in several senses: "pedigree, an inborn sense of manners and behavior, and, elliptically, sex." Showcasing contemporary views of "entitlement and "noblesse oblige", the novel reflects Terhune's place as a member of the aristocracy and attempts to "justify the natural rights of the well-bred." The Place is owned by a rich family, that needs to be guarded against threats by foreigners, thieves of all varieties, Negroes, poachers and the homeless. Within the novel, Terhune notes the provisions of the "Guest Law", which reflect a fear of "the flotsam of the American polity". In the character Hamilcar Q. Glure, shows his dislike for the "<a href="nouveaux%20riche">nouveaux riche</a>s", those with "new money", over those born and bred into wealth.

The novel also focuses on competition in the venues of the dog shows and combat. Within the novel, despite disliking shows and being an "old style" collie, Lad's "sheer noble nature" enables him to win despite the going preferences for "more superficial qualities". Lad obeys the Law in part because of his heredity as a purebred, and the Master considers himself a thoroughbred due to his having certain "race characteristics that are ingrained in his blood." Frequently, Terhune references <a href="atavism">atavism</a>, attributing Lad's calling upon hereditary instincts to the presence of "a strain of wolf" in the brains of all collies. This idea also reflects the power of humans over nature.

Albert Payson Terhune was an established newspaperman and author of several books in various genres—including histories and thrillers—when he penned his first canine short story, "His Mate". Ray Long, then editor for "<a href="Redbook">Red Book Magazine</a>", had jokingly suggested he write a story about Lad one afternoon, when the reticent dog put his head on Long's knee after having snubbed the familiar visitor for the last year. Having already tried to market the idea of his writing dog stories to magazines for several years, Terhune readily agreed. The first story featured three <a href="Rough%20Collie">Rough Collie</a>s, Lad, Lady and Knave, and used a similar formula to his previous works: an average male (Lad) protects a beautiful female (Lady) from a larger villain (Knave). Long purchased the work for "Red Book" for $200 and it was published in the January 1916 issue. Four magazines requested similar stories, and Terhune complied, finding them easy to write and sell. Additional stories, all featuring Lad and titled "Lad Stories", were published in the "<a href="Saturday%20Evening%20Post">Saturday Evening Post</a>", "<a href="Ladies%27%20Home%20Journal">Ladies' Home Journal</a>", "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>", and the "<a href="Atlantic%20Monthly">Atlantic Monthly</a>", though "Red Book" remained his most consistent publisher. By 1918, the stories had grown in popularity and Terhune was paid an average of $1,000 each for the tales, with some selling for as much as $2,500. Though marketed as fiction, even people who were acquainted with the Terhunes and Lad reportedly believed that the stories were real.

In 1918, Long began urging Terhune to publish a book of his dog stories, though Terhune himself was not convinced at first. He considered them to be nothing more than "hack writing" and inferior to his other works. Even after Long convinced him of the public's love of the works, Terhune initially did nothing towards the goal. Later that year, <a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday-Page</a>, which had published Terhune's last novel "Fortune", wrote asking to see his next book while reminding him that their contract gave them first refusal rights to it. Wanting to escape from that publisher due to the dismal performance of "Fortune", Terhune decided to follow Long's suggestion so he could use the book of dog stories to fulfill his contractual obligation. After he collected together the twenty "Lad" stories he had written so far, he reorganized them into chapters and submitted the book. He was unsurprised that it was rejected, but in the rejection letter the company referred to <a href="Alfred%20Ollivant%20%28writer%29">Alfred Ollivant</a>'s 1898 novel "<a href="Owd%20Bob">Owd Bob</a>" and <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a>'s 1903 novel "<a href="The%20Call%20of%20the%20Wild">The Call of the Wild</a>" as "superior pieces of work". As Terhune himself considered both authors to be unimpressive writers, he became determined that "Lad: A Dog" would be published. <a href="E.%20P.%20Dutton">E. P. Dutton</a>'s John Macrae, who was a known dog lover, found the stories "simple but charming" and felt the public would like them greatly.

"Lad: A Dog" was published by Dutton in April 1919, a year after the real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of "<a href="Bruce%20%28novel%29">Bruce</a>" and "<a href="His%20Dog">His Dog</a>" in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work "Across the Line", a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to "Lad: A Dog". Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month for the rest of her life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.

Available evidence indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902 and passed through the hands of at least two owners before coming to Sunnybank. An article in a Terhune family scrapbook indicates that he was likely a mature dog by the time he arrived, possibly not until after Albert Payson Terhune had purchased the <a href="Pompton%20Lakes%2C%20New%20Jersey">Pompton Lakes</a>, New Jersey property from his mother in 1909.

Unlike the fictional Lad, he was not registered with the American Kennel Club and was not a <a href="show%20dog">show dog</a>. His pedigree was reportedly lost by one of his previous owners, though there was no doubt he was a purebred collie. At one point, Terhune's wife Anice claimed Lad had twenty champion collies in his pedigree, but this has never been confirmed. On July 4, 1917, Lad was entered into a dog show despite having no papers on his pedigree. It was the only show he ever attended and he won the Veteran Cup. As in the novel, Lad was extremely, even "hostile[ly] reserved" with strangers, wanting little to do with anyone outside of the family.

Terhune donated some of the earnings from the magazine stories to the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> and the <a href="The%20Blue%20Cross">Blue Cross</a> in Lad's name, earning the collie the Honorary Crosses of both groups. When Lad was fifteen, he lost his hearing, after which the other dogs in residence began ignoring him and vice versa. Lad died on September 3, 1918, having had a tumor in his heart for five years before his death. Lad's obituary was carried on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of "<a href="Field%20and%20Fancy">Field and Fancy</a>" magazine. He was buried near the driveway of Sunnybank, with the Honorary Crosses he was awarded. He was mourned by thousands of fans who had read Terhune's stories, with dozens of readers, primarily children, visiting Sunnybank to see Lad's grave. In one season, over 1,700 visitors came to see Lad's grave, prompting Terhune to close the place to visitors for the day.

After the Terhunes died, Sunnybank slowly deteriorated, with the house and much of the grounds destroyed. Large chunks of the property were sold by the Albert Payson Terhune, Inc, an organization set up in the wills of Bert and Anice Terhune to provide funds for a charitable organization, the Terhune Foundation. The last ten acres of the property were eventually sold to a housing developer, which included the house, the graves of the Terhune collies and the dogs' old kennels. In 1967, this remaining chunk of Sunnybank was condemned by Wayne Township. The next year, the township made the remaining acres a historical park, <a href="Terhune%20Memorial%20Park">Terhune Memorial Park</a>. The Van Riper-Hopper Historic House Museum, located several miles away, displays Terhune's writings, the awards won by the Sunnybank collies and other memorabilia. The graves of Lad, Lady, Wolf and the other Sunnybank dogs are preserved there and available for viewing by visitors. Clippings of Lad's coat are stored at the Library of Congress, having been donated by Anice. Annual gatherings to Sunnybank are organized by the <a href="Collie%20Health%20Foundation">Collie Health Foundation</a> on the third weekend in August, during which speakers familiar with Terhune and his dogs speak, seminars and tours are conducted and various collie-focused events and competitions are conducted. In 2005, Marilyn R. Horowitz published a Sunnybank calendar, the proceeds of which were used by the <a href="Terhune%20Sunnybank%20Memorial">Terhune Sunnybank Memorial</a> to restore Lad's grave, which had fallen into disrepair, and to aid in maintaining the grounds of Sunnybank.

The original Lad stories were well received by readers of their respective magazines. After the appearance of "His Mate" in "Red Book", the readers began demanding further stories. Editor Ray Long, who initially purchased "His Mate", considered the story "In the Day of Battle" to be one of the top twenty to appear in "Red Book" during his time as its editor. The success of the stories propelled Terhune to fame, enabling him to purchase Sunnybank from his mother and quit a loathed job working for a newspaper to become a full-time freelance writer. Although the novel was initially ignored by critics, within weeks it had become a hit. According to Terhune biographer Kurk Unkelbach, it received praise from most of the important critics of the time. The American Kennel Club "Gazette" reported that Terhune earned over $32,000 from the publication of the Lad stories. Originally aimed towards adults, the novel was a best-seller and gained critical acclaim in the adult fiction market. By the end of the year, the book had gone through 18 printings and by 1935, over 250,000 copies had been sold. In 1939 an anniversary edition was released, marking its 71st printing. During World War II, the novel was republished as a paperback for mass distribution to servicemen as part of the <a href="Armed%20Services%20Editions">Armed Services Editions</a>. In the 1960s and 70s, the novel was repositioned into the young adult market, by dint of its animal subject matter. Grosset and Dunlap reprinted the novel in new editions that were prominently featured on their children's book lists. By 1970, these new editions had sold over 650,000 copies and overall "Lad: A Dog" has sold over 1 million copies and remains Terhune's highest seller. Considered the novel that "propelled Terhune to fame", it has been translated into and published in at least six different languages. <a href="Recorded%20Books">Recorded Books</a> released an unabridged <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> edition in 1997 on <a href="cassette%20tape">cassette tape</a>. In 2006, Alcazar AudioWorks released a CD version.

Veteran <a href="dog%20breeder">dog breeder</a>s of the times were the primary critics of the novel, chastising Terhune's depiction of an unrealistically perfect collie that would mislead the public into believing such a dog could exist. The anniversary and subsequent editions, featuring a sable-and-white collie, also drew criticism from loyal readers as it did not resemble Lad. "<a href="New%20York%20Times%20Book%20Review">New York Times Book Review</a>" reviewer Alden Welch felt the full novel would "surely appeal not only to all lovers and masters of dogs, but to many who have never owned any and who have no general and indiscriminate liking for them." He found the stories "interesting" and a "most welcome addition to dog-literature", praising the novel as the most "delightfully written" of Terhune's works to date. In 1968, "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>"s Robert H. Boyle stated that Terhune's stories were responsible for many of the active collie breeders at the time getting involved in the sport. Calling the author a "godlike figure" and the hero of "goggle-eyed youngsters of the 1920s, '30s and even into the '40s." In comparing the work to popular collie character <a href="Lassie">Lassie</a>, Boyle noted that rather than having Lassie's seeming immortality, Terhune's dogs "led epic lives and they had epic deaths".

In the Fall 1996 issue of "<a href="Raritan%20Quarterly%20Review">Raritan Quarterly Review</a>", <a href="Stephen%20D.%20Cox">Stephen D. Cox</a>, freely admitting to never having read the book, nonetheless called Terhune a "hack writer" who lacked "storytelling skill" and denounced "Lad: A Dog" as non-<a href="literature">literature</a> with "sentences [that] are insufferably stilted and hammy" and "have a tendency to wander off on long romps with his personal obsessions." Terming it a "socially interesting" work, he concedes that the novel has maintained "intense and long-lasting" interest from readers due to its successfully playing on their emotions and "desire to have a collie dog." He quotes Irving Litvag, author of Terhune's biography "The Master of Sunnybank", stating that Lad "became the dog we always wanted to have and never did. Maybe even more than that—maybe he became the friend we always waited to find, or even the brother, or the father." In "You're Only Young Twice: Children's Literature and Film", Timothy Morris felt the novel had "dated badly" due to changes in American society, and while he stated that he enjoyed the work, in comparing it to <a href="Anna%20Sewell">Anna Sewell</a>'s "<a href="Black%20Beauty">Black Beauty</a>" he faults "Lad: A Dog" for lacking an "autobiographical frame" and for leaving readers guessing as to what is happening.

Building on the success of "Lad: A Dog", Terhune went on to pen thirty additional canine novels, including two featuring Lad. "<a href="Further%20Adventures%20of%20Lad">Further Adventures of Lad</a>", which includes the stories of his arrival at the Place and his death, was published in George H. Doran in 1922. Like the first, it went on to become a best seller, praised by both new readers and existing fans. Critics, however, gave it more mixed reviews. Though some praised the stories and Lad, others felt Lad was unbelievable and harshly denounced Terhune's writing style. "Lad of Sunnybank" was released in 1929 by <a href="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a>, and included another selection of stories about Lad's life. Two of the collies that appear in "Lad: A Dog", Lad's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce, both received their own novels. "Bruce" was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and "Wolf" was published by Doran in 1925.

Published by <a href="Scholastic%20Corporation">Scholastic</a> as part of its "Hello reader!" series, Margo Lundell adapted three stories from the novels into a series of 48 page <a href="picture%20book">picture book</a>s with illustration by Don Bolognese. The first book, "Lad, a Dog: Lad to the Rescue", was released in August 1997 and adapts the story of Lad saving the baby from a venomous snake. The next two, "Lad, a Dog: Best Dog in the World" (December 1997) and "Lad, a Dog: Lad is Lost" (February 1998) focus on Lad's first dog show and subsequently becoming lost. The final book, "Lad, a Dog: The Bad Puppy", released in May 1998, details Lad's raising of Wolf.

In the 1960s, <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> purchased the film rights for the novel from Max J. Rosenberg, of <a href="Vanguard%20Productions">Vanguard Productions</a>, who had purchased them from E. P. Dutton. They later negotiated with Anice Terhune for the rights to the two follow up novels, hoping to produce a sequel and television series if the first film proved successful. Starring <a href="Peter%20Breck">Peter Breck</a>, <a href="Peggy%20McCay">Peggy McCay</a>, <a href="Carroll%20O%27Connor">Carroll O'Connor</a>, and <a href="Angela%20Cartwright">Angela Cartwright</a>, the film blended several of the novel's stories with some modifications to make a flowing narrative. <a href="Aram%20Avakian">Aram Avakian</a> was initially selected to be the film's director, but his refusal to create a sentimental dog story resulted in his firing; he was replaced by <a href="Leslie%20H.%20Martinson">Leslie H. Martinson</a>. The film was released on June 6, 1962. Although it was praised by fans and modern reviewers, contemporary critiques felt Terhune's work did not translate well to film and it was considered a low budget <a href="B-movie">B-movie</a>.

Lightning (Final Fantasy)

Claire Farron, better known by the codename , is a <a href="fictional%20character">fictional character</a> from <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>'s "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series. She first appeared as a <a href="Player%20character">playable character</a> and <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> in the <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>", in which she features as a resident of the artificial world of Cocoon. After her sister <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Serah%20Farron">Serah</a> is declared an enemy of Cocoon, Lightning attempts to save her. She and others are then chosen by the fal'Cie, a divided race of demigods who rule the worlds of Gran Pulse and Cocoon, to destroy Cocoon. Lightning reappears as a supporting character in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a>", acting as protector of the Goddess Etro. She is the sole playable character in "", wherein she sets out to save her world, which is destined to end in thirteen days. Outside the "XIII" series, Lightning has been featured in multiple "Final Fantasy" games and had <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>s in other video games.

Lightning was created by <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a>, the director and scenario writer of "XIII", and designed by <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, a regular character artist for the "Final Fantasy" series. Their idea was to create a <a href="Strong%20female%20character">strong female protagonist</a> who was adept at combat and less feminine than previous "Final Fantasy" heroines. Aspects of her early design and personality were later altered, or transferred to other characters. After "XIII", Lightning's design was revised several times to reflect her role and development in each game, particularly in "Lightning Returns". Her name in Japanese, , was originally a <a href="Placeholder%20name">placeholder</a>. Because of its similarity to the name of a pastry, her first name was changed to "Claire" in other countries.

Lightning has received mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her cold personality, which was compared to that of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>"'s protagonist <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud Strife</a>. She was criticized for her relative absence in "XIII-2". Her role in "Lightning Returns" met with mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by <a href="video%20game">video game</a> publications, of the best characters in the "Final Fantasy" series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>", Square Enix, and other organizations.

Lightning was created by <a href="Motomu%20Toriyama">Motomu Toriyama</a>, the director of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>". Her character design was by regular "Final Fantasy" artist <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a>, who had previously served as the character designer for "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a>" and "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">X</a>". Nomura has said that multiple designs—including some by staff members other than himself—were considered for Lightning, while Toriyama has claimed that Nomura's first draft "looked so cool and strong that there was no need for any retakes." Because of the <a href="Video%20game%20graphics">graphical capacities</a> of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>"s prospective platforms, Nomura was able to include far more detail in Lightning's design than in his previous character designs, such as her cape and facial features. This necessitated far more effort on his part. Commenting on an early form of her design, Nomura explained that she is essentially a "cool character", in that she is serious and unforgiving. However, he could not make the character too masculine for fear of losing player empathy. Characteristics from earlier versions of the design included blond or silver hair and <a href="Asian%20people">Asian</a>-looking facial features. Her final art was made less Asian-looking than these early drafts and her hair color changed to pink, while <a href="Hope%20Estheim">Hope Estheim</a> was given silver hair. Lightning's final hair color and hairstyle were intended to reflect her femininity, and to counterbalance her athletic body. Creating her promotional CG render was fairly easy due to the number of details available concerning her.

Lightning's real name is Claire Farron in English and in Japanese. During the early stages of production, Lightning's real name was Averia: "Eclair" was used to keep this name secret, but it was eventually chosen as her official name. Her English name, Claire, was chosen because the name "Eclair" is closely associated with a type of pastry. The name "Lightning" was not chosen by Nomura but by other members of the development team: Nomura had wanted to abandon the tradition of <a href="Recurring%20elements%20in%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20series%23Art%20design">naming "Final Fantasy" protagonists</a> after weather events, and was surprised by the choice. Several models of Lightning's house were constructed for "XIII" but were removed due to space issues. Her weapon in "XIII", the Blazefire Saber (known as in the Japanese version) was designed to mirror the ability of the game's <a href="Recurring%20elements%20in%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20series%23Recurring%20mechanics">summoned monsters</a>, the Eidolons, to transform into animal-, human- and vehicle-like shapes. The game's version of Odin, Lightning's Eidolon and a recurring summoned monster in the "Final Fantasy" series, was intended to present Lightning as a knight on horseback. He was written as a father figure for Lightning. In later games in the "XIII" series, Odin was developed into a friend to whom Lightning could show her deeper feelings. <a href="Daisuke%20Watanabe">Daisuke Watanabe</a>, while writing the script for "XIII", paid particular attention to fleshing out Lightning's non-romantic relationship with <a href="Snow%20Villiers">Snow Villiers</a> and to showing her development as a person while protecting Hope.

Due to global demand and the development staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to "XIII". The game tackles the question of whether Lightning is happy after the events of "XIII". Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in "XIII-2" was designed by <a href="Isamu%20Kamikokuryo">Isamu Kamikokuryo</a>. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. Nomura "fought hard" to create the draft design. The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a <a href="Cheongsam">qipao</a> and a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the <a href="valkyrie">valkyrie</a>s of <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>. The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.

Her outfit in "Lightning Returns" was designed by Nomura. He was told by Toriyama to create something representative of her final battle, with "strength" as the main guideline. The resultant outfit, which resembles a leather <a href="bodysuit">bodysuit</a>, has spinal column patterns on its sleeves and is primarily colored red and white. Nomura later commented that he felt "a strong reaction within [himself]" while creating Lightning's final look. Nomura's design was Kamikokuryo's favorite out of the many outfits created for the character. Her other outfits for the game were designed by Kamikokuryo, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Toshitaka Matsuda: many of them drew inspiration from the character designs of regular "Final Fantasy" artist <a href="Yoshitaka%20Amano">Yoshitaka Amano</a>. In addition to the new costumes, Lightning's in-game model was rebuilt from the ground-up. Her breasts were enlarged and several of her outfits were designed to present her in a more feminine way. For the game's epilogue, Toriyama wished for Lightning to appear in an everyday setting and normal clothes. The team considered ending the game with Lightning either meeting or speaking with her allies, but Toriyama wished the story to begin and end with her alone. He has claimed that Lightning, with her solo role in "Lightning Returns", was the "Final Fantasy" series' "first female protagonist".

Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a type of female character previously unseen in "Final Fantasy" games, one with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature. His guideline to Nomura was to make her strong, beautiful, and "like a female version of <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud Strife</a> from "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>"". Commenting on the resemblance, Toriyama stated that the similarities between the characters only extend to their cold personalities and their military backgrounds, and that otherwise "Lightning really [is] her own person." Nomura compared the two shortly before the Japanese release of "Lightning Returns", saying that he had "desired for her to be carefully developed and loved for a long time, like Cloud." Toriyama has said that, among the characters he had been involved in creating, Lightning was his favorite female character from a video game, alongside <a href="Yuna%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Yuna</a> from "Final Fantasy X" and Yoyo from "<a href="Bahamut%20Lagoon">Bahamut Lagoon</a>".

In contrast to other characters in the "Final Fantasy" series, whose personality traits were molded to fit a story, Toriyama conceived Lightning's basic personality before "XIII"s narrative had been finalized. She has a cold demeanor, which was meant to clash in an entertaining way with Snow's outspokenness. Nomura commented that Lightning has "a strong element of mystery about her character". She originally had a flirtatious aspect to her personality, which was transferred to <a href="Oerba%20Yun%20Fang">Oerba Yun Fang</a> when Fang was changed from male to female. For "Lightning Returns", the developers wanted to portray Lightning in several different lights, in contrast to her static personalities in prior appearances. One of their highest priorities was to make Lightning a character who had lost much in her life and become deeply vulnerable as a result. Designer Yuji Abe elaborated that, because of her losses and newfound vulnerability, Lightning came across as darker, slightly numbed to her surroundings, and "like a puppet, like someone who doesn't quite have her real self inside." He elaborated that this effect shows "the kind of vulnerability she has, and it's the point from which she starts to change afterward." The decision to expand her personality in this way was originally suggested by <a href="Yoshinori%20Kitase">Yoshinori Kitase</a>, who was concerned that Lightning's coolness in previous games had made it difficult for players to bond with her.

Across her speaking appearances, Lightning is voiced by <a href="Ali%20Hillis">Ali Hillis</a> in English and <a href="Maaya%20Sakamoto">Maaya Sakamoto</a> in Japanese. Sakamoto was impressed by Lightning, whom she called "cold" and "strong". She was asked to portray Lightning's strength and to betray the character's hidden vulnerabilities. She initially found it strange to voice Lightning, as she was used to gentler roles such as <a href="Aerith%20Gainsborough">Aerith Gainsborough</a>, a central character in "Final Fantasy VII" and its <a href="Compilation%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20VII">companion media</a>. Commenting on the difficulty of balancing Lightning's depiction as a woman and a professionally trained warrior, Kitase noted that Sakamoto's acting helped to bring out Lightning's femininity. Hillis was given the role of Lightning after speaking a few of the character's lines during audition, and was then given a book about the "Final Fantasy XIII" universe, which she found a little "overwhelming" when she read it. One of the challenges Hillis faced was recapturing the emotion and energy of Sakamoto's Japanese performance in the character's English rendition. She tried to help the staff of the "XIII" games portray Lightning as a real person: "I think that was my main priority, to make sure that Lightning had every single layer of who she was as a person, not just a game character, but a real person with layers and history and relationships to every single character in the game...even the Chocobo!" Over the course of the "XIII" trilogy, Hillis felt that Lightning becomes "a little more sarcastic ... a little more hardened to everything that's going on around her and ... [evolves] into a real warrior".

Lightning, along with her sister Serah, is a resident of Cocoon, an artificial world hovering above the planet Gran Pulse. Each of these regions is controlled by a sect of the fal'Cie, a race of demigods whose two factions, the "Sanctum" population on Cocoon and the "Pulse" fal'Cie from Gran Pulse, are hostile toward one another. In "Final Fantasy XIII: Episode Zero: Promise", a novel set before the events of "XIII", it is revealed that Lightning and Serah's parents died when their children were young, and that Lightning resolved to become her sister's protector but ended up neglecting her in the process. She grows to resent Snow's romantic relationship with Serah and the anti-government activities of his group NORA. Lightning discovers too late that Serah has been branded as a l'Cie—a human cursed with magical powers and a task to complete—by the Gran Pulse fal'Cie Anima: Lightning initially thinks that Serah is using her condition as an excuse to marry Snow and drives her away. When Serah is taken prisoner by Anima, Lightning resigns from the service as a member of the Guardian Corps and volunteers herself for the Purge, a forced relocation of citizens believed to have come into contact with Anima, to save her sister.

In "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a>", Lightning, accompanied by <a href="Sazh%20Katzroy">Sazh Katzroy</a>, reaches Anima along with Snow, Hope and <a href="Oerba%20Dia%20Vanille">Oerba Dia Vanille</a>, two surviving Purge exiles. When they find Serah, she turns to crystal. Then Lightning and the party fight Anima and are marked as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's main military force, destroys Anima. Skeptical of Snow's resolve to save her sister, Lightning abandons him and Serah, both of whom are then rescued by <a href="Oerba%20Yun%20Fang">Oerba Yun Fang</a> and a rogue Cocoon military force called the Cavalry. Splitting up from Sazh and Vanille, Lightning ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, Lightning inadvertently summons Odin and unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow as she protects and mentors him. Throughout the game, Lightning struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story. After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her. When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, Lightning, Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives as Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.

"Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I", a short novel set immediately after "XIII", shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or not. She leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself caught in a dark void, but she decides to keep moving forward.

In "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIII-2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a>", Lightning has disappeared, and all but Serah believe that she died with Vanille and Fang to save Cocoon. In reality, Lightning was brought to Valhalla, capital of the Unseen Realm ruled by the Goddess Etro, as a direct result of Etro releasing her and the others from their fate as l'Cie. These events had distorted time and erased Lightning from history after Cocoon's fall. Hoping to atone for the deaths she caused as a l'Cie, Lightning chooses to stay in Valhalla and protect the dying Etro from <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Caius%20Ballad">Caius Ballad</a>, an immortal man with a grudge against the goddess. Lightning eventually asks <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Noel%20Kreiss">Noel Kreiss</a> and Serah to help her stop Caius from ending time, which he plans to do by releasing "Chaos", a supernatural energy controlled by Etro, into the mortal world. Serah and Noel travel forward in time to fix distortions in history caused by Caius' interference, and Serah eventually dies when history is restored. In the <a href="Downloadable%20content">DLC</a> episode "Requiem of the Goddess", Lightning is defeated by Caius and loses hope after learning of her role in Serah's death. Lightning is comforted by Serah's spirit, who asks not to be forgotten. Vowing to preserve Serah's memory, Lightning turns to crystal, which prevents her from being affected when Etro's death releases chaos and merges the mortal and unseen realms together.

In "", Lightning is revived after 500 years by the god <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Bhunivelze">Bhunivelze</a>. The world is set to end in thirteen days, and Lightning is chosen as the Savior, a <a href="Psychopomp">spiritual guide</a> for humanity, which has ceased to age due to the influence of chaos. In return for Lightning's help, Serah will be resurrected. Aided by Hope, Lightning frees her former allies of their emotional burdens, reunites with Odin in the form of a white <a href="Chocobo">Chocobo</a>, and frequently crosses paths with <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Final%20Fantasy%20XIII%20series%23Lumina">Lumina</a>, the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities. Lightning begins to doubt her humanity, and, when she learns that Bhunivelze stole Serah's soul and manipulated Lightning's memories, she plans to betray him after he has finished building the new world. When the end of the world arrives, Lightning fights Bhunivelze, who wants to transform humanity into his ideal image and has been shaping Lightning to become Etro's replacement. Although she is prepared to fulfill her new role and abandon her human life, Lightning instead chooses to call for help and accept Lumina as a part of herself. Everyone she has saved, including Serah, unites with her and defeats Bhunivelze. Lightning then witnesses the creation of a new universe, into which she goes with her allies and the souls of humanity. In the epilogue, she is seen traveling to reunite with one of her friends.

Beyond the "XIII" games, Lightning has appeared in several spin-offs within the "Final Fantasy" franchise. In the fighting game "<a href="Dissidia%20012%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</a>", Lightning is one of the warriors summoned by the goddess Cosmos. She was meant to debut in "<a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a>", but the idea was scrapped as "Final Fantasy XIII" had yet to be released and Square Enix did not want to reveal her abilities ahead of time. During "Dissidia 012", Lightning's group is confronted by beings called Manikins, which inflict permanent death on those they defeat, thereby threatening the world's cycle of rebirth. She leads an expedition to the portal from which the Manikins are emerging, and the group sacrifice their lives to close it. Lightning has three alternate outfits in the game. She again appeared as a playable character in the 2015 <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a> title, and its home console version "<a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy%20NT">Dissidia Final Fantasy NT</a>".

The character was featured in a series of special in "": Lightning and monsters from her world appeared in the land of Eorzea while she was in crystal stasis between "XIII-2" and "Lightning Returns". It is hinted that she was sent to Eorzea by Bhunivelze to hone her skills in preparation for future battles in her world. After the events were completed, Lightning met up with the player one last time, saying that she was thankful for the time spent in Eorzea. As she was summoned back to her world, she asked the player to remember her time there. Players who participated in the events received gear and outfits modeled after items, weapons and clothing from the "XIII" games. Lightning also plays a role as an ally in "<a href="World%20of%20Final%20Fantasy">World of Final Fantasy</a>", appearing in her "Lightning Returns" outfit. Lightning was also featured in both Japanese and international versions of the mobile title "<a href="Mobius%20Final%20Fantasy">Mobius Final Fantasy</a>" as part of a special story event titled ""Lightning Resurrection"".

In the <a href="rhythm%20game">rhythm game</a> "<a href="Theatrhythm%20Final%20Fantasy">Theatrhythm Final Fantasy</a>" and its sequel "", Lightning is a playable character representing the "Final Fantasy XIII" games. She is featured, sporting her "XIII-2" design, in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Airborne%20Brigade">Final Fantasy Airborne Brigade</a>". Lightning is a playable character in the mobile crossover games "" and "Final Fantasy: Record Keeper", a powered-up character form in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Explorers">Final Fantasy Explorers</a>", a <a href="Chibi%20%28term%29">chibi</a> figure in "<a href="Fortune%20Street">Final Fantasy in Itadaki Street Mobile</a>", and a character card in "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Artniks">Final Fantasy Artniks</a>". In response to speculation about her continued role in the "Final Fantasy" series after "Lightning Returns" release, Kitase clarified in 2013 that she would appear in spin-off titles, but that her role in the main series had ended.

Outside the "Final Fantasy" franchise, Lightning features in a minigame in "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20coded">Kingdom Hearts Re:coded</a>", was part of a collaboration between the "Final Fantasy" series and "<a href="Puzzle%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Puzzle & Dragons</a>" alongside other established series characters, and versions of her outfit from "XIII" may be worn by protagonist <a href="Aya%20Brea">Aya Brea</a> in "<a href="The%203rd%20Birthday">The 3rd Birthday</a>" and a character from arcade shooter "<a href="Gunslinger%20Stratos">Gunslinger Stratos 2</a>". Maaya Sakamoto, who portrays both Aya and Lightning, voiced Aya to sound like Lightning when the outfit is equipped.

Lightning has been featured in "Final Fantasy XIII"-themed merchandise produced by Square Enix. The two pieces directly inspired by the character are necklaces and a mild perfume called "Lightning eau de toilette". Action figures of Lightning in her three main iterations were produced by Play Arts Kai, a company often hired to make figurines of characters and creatures from the "Final Fantasy" series. Cards depicting the character are available in the "Final Fantasy" Trading Card Game. Lightning appears in a live-action <a href="PlayStation">PlayStation</a> commercial titled "Michael", alongside characters such as <a href="Nathan%20Drake%20%28character%29">Nathan Drake</a>, <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> and <a href="Cole%20McGrath">Cole McGrath</a>. An actress portrayed the character at the "Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Event" during <a href="Asia%20Game%20Show">Asia Game Show</a> 2013. She was portrayed again in a Japanese live-action/CGI TV commercial for "Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII". In April 2012, Lightning and other characters from "XIII-2" were used to showcase <a href="Prada">Prada</a> designs in a 12-page section in the male fashion magazine "<a href="Arena%20Homme%20%2B">Arena Homme +</a>". To promote "Lightning Returns", Lightning was featured on the packaging of snacks produced by <a href="Ezaki%20Glico">Ezaki Glico</a>. In 2015, she was used in a CGI advertising video by French fashion house <a href="Louis%20Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>. The video was animated by Visual Works, designed by Nomura and directed by Louis Vuttion’s Nicolas Ghesquière.

While "Final Fantasy XIII" was in development, Todd Ciolek of <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a> was unimpressed by Lightning, whom he called a "businesslike blank". Reviewing the finished game, Ciolek opined that Lightning is initially "far too distant and cold, as though the writers were so intent on creating a tough, competent heroine that they forgot to make her at all compelling". However, he admitted that Lightning becomes a more appealing lead character by the game's end. Wesley Yin-Poole of VideoGamer.com simply referred to Lightning as a female version of Cloud. <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s Jeremy Parrish commented that, barring scenes in which Lightning shows a thoughtful side, she is "your typical, sullen [Square Enix] protagonist". Conversely, <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Kevin VanOrd called Lightning a "likeable, strong-willed beauty". Martin Robinson of <a href="IGN">IGN UK</a> said that Lightning "instantly endears herself" in comparison with Hope or Snow, but he found that, when Lightning's backstory "gets bogged down in generic swash", Sazh becomes the more appealing character. <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>'s Carolyin Gudmundson was unenthusiastic: she opined that, while Lightning's narrative has its merits, it "certainly isn't above and beyond what we'd typically expect". She commented that this lack of originality makes Lightning "one-dimensional and boring". <a href="Gamasutra">Gamasutra</a> writer Christian Nutt believed that Lightning's relationships with the cast add humanity to the narrative.

For "XIII-2", "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Joe Juba was disappointed that Lightning had been transferred to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> found that the story suffers without the driving force of Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd was disappointed that Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.

In "Lightning Returns", Juba criticized Lightning's lack of personal growth during the narrative, and IGN's Marty Silva felt that her increased coldness makes her "downright unlikable." VanOrd argued that Lightning is not "interesting in and of herself" and that she had turned into "a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices", whose stoicism makes it difficult for the player to connect with her. Parrish, writing for <a href="Eurogamer">USGamer</a>, stated that Lightning had become "downright apathetic", showing "no personality whatsoever", and that this clashed with the ability to dress her in costumes. By contrast, Parkin commented that certain <a href="Quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">side quests</a>, such as herding sheep or retrieving a girl's doll, helped to humanize Lightning and make her likable. Similarly, <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>'s Dale North found that the costumes and dialogue lighten her character: he argued that these elements make her less "flat and lifeless now, which is a big improvement." Dave Riley of Anime News Network felt that Lightning's stoic attitude, although out of place in "XIII" and "XIII-2", fit her role as a god's servant in "Lightning Returns". Tech Reviewer, in a feature about the portrayal of female characters in video games, was impressed with the character's depth and portrayal.

In a VideoGamer.com list of the ten best "Final Fantasy" characters, Lightning was placed sixth; writer Yin-Poole found her interesting in her own right despite her similarities to Cloud. In 2011, IGN ranked Lightning among the best characters in the "Final Fantasy" series, saying that she demonstrated that "a delicate balance can exist between strength and tenderness, even in the midst of ... incredible acrobatic feats." Lightning was ranked eighth in a similar list by GameZone's Heath Hooker: points of praise were her visual appearance and determination, which made her "one of the strongest female leaders of the "Final Fantasy" series" in Hooker's opinion. Cheat Code Central listed her as one of the top ten "badass" women of video games for her independence, which the writer felt distanced her from previous "Final Fantasy" heroines. Lightning ranked second in <a href="AfterEllen">AfterEllen</a>'s list of the "hottest" video game characters. In "Game Informer"s list of top ten heroes of 2010, Lightning was ranked eighth and praised as the only protagonist in "Final Fantasy XIII" who "seemed capable of taking on the corrupt government of Cocoon": another comment was that her "no-nonsense approach to her mission makes her the game's standout hero". She was included in two lists by "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>", which ranked her as the 19th greatest "Final Fantasy" character and the 39th greatest heroine in video game history.

In 2010, Lightning placed 34th in a "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" poll regarding the most popular video game character in Japan. She was voted the best-liked female "Final Fantasy" character in a 2013 poll by Square Enix, and, in that year's "<a href="Dengeki%20PlayStation">Dengeki PlayStation</a>" Awards, she was voted best video game character of the year for her appearance in "Lightning Returns". She came first in a <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> poll to determine the most popular character of the "Final Fantasy XIII" games. In 2014, readers of IGN voted her the best character in "XIII". At <a href="Penny%20Arcade%20Expo">PAX</a> Prime 2013, she took third place in a list, compiled by journalists and game developers, of the top female characters in western and Japanese <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s. In a "Famitsu" poll from 2017, Lightning was voted as the second most wanted character fans expect to be featured in another Square Enix's franchise, "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>", being surpassed only by <a href="Noctis%20Lucis%20Caelum">Noctis Lucis Caelum</a> from "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XV">Final Fantasy XV</a>".

A Rugrats Chanukah

"A Rugrats Chanukah", titled onscreen as simply "Chanukah" and sometimes called the "Rugrats Chanukah Special", is a <a href="television%20special">special</a> episode of <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>'s <a href="animated%20cartoon">animated</a> <a href="television%20series">television series</a> "<a href="Rugrats">Rugrats</a>". The first episode of the show's fourth season and the sixty-sixth overall, it tells the story of the <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> holiday <a href="Hanukkah">Chanukah</a> through the eyes of <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Babies%20and%20kids">the Rugrats</a>, who imagine themselves as the main characters. Meanwhile, <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters">Grandpa Boris</a> and his long-time rival, Shlomo, feud over who will play the lead in the local <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>'s Chanukah play. Since most American children's television programs have <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> specials, this is the first <a href="Hanukkah">Chanukah</a> episode of a children's television series.

Raymie Muzquiz directed "A Rugrats Chanukah" from a script by J. David Stem and <a href="David%20N.%20Weiss">David N. Weiss</a>. In 1992, Nickelodeon executives had <a href="Pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitched</a> the idea of a Chanukah special to the production team, but the concept was revised and became the 1995 special, "<a href="A%20Rugrats%20Passover">A Rugrats Passover</a>". After production of the Passover episode wrapped, the crew returned to the Chanukah idea. Nickelodeon broadcast "A Rugrats Chanukah" on December 4, 1996; the episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 7.9 and positive reviews from television critics. Along with other "Rugrats" episodes featuring Boris and his wife, the special attracted controversy when the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> compared the character designs to <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> drawings from a 1930s <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> newspaper.

On Chanukah, <a href="List%20of%20Rugrats%20characters%23Adults">Grandma Minka</a> reads a book about the meaning of the holiday to the babies <a href="Tommy%20Pickles">Tommy</a>, <a href="Chuckie%20Finster">Chuckie</a>, <a href="Phil%20and%20Lil%20DeVille">Phil, and Lil</a>. The babies imagine that they are the story's characters; <a href="Judas%20Maccabeus">Judah</a> (Tommy) is outraged by <a href="Antiochus%20IV">King "Antonica"</a>, who has taken over <a href="Judea">the Jewish kingdom</a> and forced <a href="Hellenization">Greek culture</a> on its inhabitants. Judah leads an army of Jewish <a href="Maccabees">Maccabees</a> to war against Antonica's <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, emerging victorious. The story is left unfinished as Minka stops to help make <a href="potato%20pancakes">latkes</a> in the kitchen with her daughter Didi.

Meanwhile, Grandpa Boris is furious that Shlomo, a rival from his youth in Russia, is pictured in the local newspaper for playing the Greek king in the local synagogue's Chanukah play, where Boris is portraying Judah. The babies find out about Shlomo and form the impression that he truly is the Greek king, whom they dub the "Meanie of Chanukah". At the play that night, they attempt to storm on stage to defeat the "Meanie of Chanukah", but are stopped and taken into the synagogue's nursery. Angelica is in the nursery already and, vehement in her desire to watch a Christmas special that is airing that night, convinces the babies to help her break out and steal a television set from the custodian's office.

Boris and Shlomo begin fighting on stage during the play, interrupting the production and inciting an intermission. Backstage, Shlomo, and Boris argue once more, with Boris mentioning Shlomo's dedication to his business pursuits over familial values. Shlomo informs Boris that he and his late wife were unable to bear children, making Boris feel sympathy for his rival. Angelica sprints backstage, bumping into Shlomo and inadvertently destroying the television set. Shlomo unsuccessfully tries to console her, but eventually lets Boris take over. Tommy hands Shlomo the Chanukah story book Minka read to the babies earlier; Boris convinces Shlomo to read it to the children. In the conclusion of the story, the Maccabees rededicate the <a href="Holy%20Temple">Holy Temple</a>, and discover that there is only enough oil to light the Temple's eternal flame for one day; miraculously, it remains lit for eight. Shlomo's reciting dissolves both the babies' assertion of him as the "Meanie of Chanukah" and his and Boris' rivalry.

Nickelodeon executives first <a href="Pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitched</a> the idea of making a Chanukah special to the "Rugrats" production team in 1992. <a href="Paul%20Germain">Paul Germain</a>, the show's co-creator, responded with the concept of a <a href="Passover">Passover</a> special instead, as he considered it to be a "funny idea" and of "historical interest". "<a href="A%20Rugrats%20Passover">A Rugrats Passover</a>" was completed in 1995; the show was one of the first animated television series to produce a special for a Jewish holiday. After production wrapped on "A Rugrats Passover", the crew considered creating the Chanukah special that Nickelodeon had originally pitched. The episode was written by , and directed by Raymie Muzquiz. By the time Weiss came to write the teleplay, he had abandoned <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> and converted to <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>.

<a href="Paramount%20Home%20Video">Paramount Home Video</a> finished production of the home media version in July 1997; originally scheduling a release date of October that year, Paramount instead pushed the official <a href="VHS">VHS</a> release into 1998 . In time for Christmas 1997, Paramount released the video "Nickelodeon Holiday", which featured "A Rugrats Chanukah" and other holiday specials, such as "<a href="Hey%20Arnold%21">Hey Arnold!</a>'s Christmas" for . On August 31, 2004, Paramount also released a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> compilation titled "Rugrats Holiday Celebration", which featured several holiday-themed episodes of "Rugrats", including "A Rugrats Chanukah". Sarah Willson adapted the episode into the book, "The Rugrats' Book of Chanukah", illustrated by Barry Goldberg and published by <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> in 1997.

"A Rugrats Chanukah" was originally broadcast on December 4, <a href="1996%20in%20television">1996</a>, on Nickelodeon. It was repeated twice that same night, the episode received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 7.9 in the show's target demographic of children aged 2–11. On December 1, <a href="2001%20in%20television">2001</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> broadcast the episode for the first time on its network, at 8:30 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time">Eastern Time</a>. Carrying a <a href="TV-Y">TV-Y</a> parental rating, it followed the "Rugrats" <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> special, "The Santa Experience". Nickelodeon has aired the episode throughout subsequent holiday seasons.

"A Rugrats Chanukah" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from television critics, and is one of the most popular episodes of "Rugrats." Delia O'Hera of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" called it a "multigenerational tale". Judith Pearl, in her book "The Chosen Image: Television's Portrayal of Jewish Themes and Characters", described the episode as a "fun [treatment] of Chanukah". Chuck Barney of <a href="Knight%20Ridder">Knight Ridder</a> and the <a href="Tribune%20News%20Service">Tribune News Service</a> considered the episode a "hilariously imaginative take on the Chanukah legend".

In a 1999 issue of "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>", "A Rugrats Chanukah" was listed at number 5 in their "10 Best Classic Family Holiday Specials". "TV Guide" later wrote that "Nickelodeon's "Rugrats" secured its place in television history" with the episode, opining that it could "entertain a child of any religious denomination". Ted Cox of the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28Arlington%20Heights%29">Daily Herald</a>" said that although the episode was not as good as the show's Passover special—which he considered "among the best holiday TV specials ever produced"—it was "still noteworthy". <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> reviewer Francis Rizzo III wrote that the special "has a great historical opening". In "Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim", Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin said that the special was "... a richer meal, even, for parents than for tykes".

"A Rugrats Chanukah", along with other "Rugrats" episodes featuring Boris and his wife, Minka, attracted controversy when the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL) charged that the two characters resembled <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semitic</a> drawings that were featured in a 1930s <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> newspaper. Nickelodeon's then-president, <a href="Albie%20Hecht">Albie Hecht</a> (himself Jewish), professed bewilderment and called the accusation absurd. The controversy resurfaced in 1998 after the ADL made the same claims about Boris' appearance in a "Rugrats" <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> that ran in newspapers during the <a href="Jewish%20New%20Year">Jewish New Year</a>. The organization was also offended by the character's recitation of the <a href="Kaddish%23Mourners.27%20Kaddish">Mourner's Kaddish</a> in the strip. Unlike Hecht, Nickelodeon's new president, <a href="Herb%20Scannell">Herb Scannell</a>, agreed with the criticism and apologized, promising never to run the character or the strip again.

The Volcano (British Columbia)

The Volcano, also known as Lava Fork volcano, is a small <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a> in the <a href="Boundary%20Ranges">Boundary Ranges</a> of the <a href="Coast%20Mountains">Coast Mountains</a> in northwestern <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada. It is located approximately northwest of the small community of <a href="Stewart%2C%20British%20Columbia">Stewart</a> near the head of <a href="Lava%20Fork">Lava Fork</a>. With a summit elevation of and a <a href="topographic%20prominence">topographic prominence</a> of , it rises above the surrounding rugged landscape on a remote mountain ridge that represents the northern flank of a glaciated <a href="U-shaped%20valley">U-shaped valley</a>.

Lava Fork volcano is associated with a small group of related volcanoes called the <a href="Iskut-Unuk%20River%20Cones">Iskut-Unuk River Cones</a>. This forms part of the much larger <a href="Northern%20Cordilleran%20Volcanic%20Province">Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province</a>, which extends from the <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>–<a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> border to near the port city of <a href="Prince%20Rupert%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince Rupert, British Columbia</a>. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400 years; this is well after the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>, which ended about 10,000 years ago.

The Volcano is the southernmost of 10 volcanoes comprising the Iskut-Unuk River Cones <a href="volcanic%20field">volcanic field</a>, as well as the most recent to erupt. Its structure is poorly formed and has been reduced by <a href="erosion">erosion</a> from alpine glacial ice found at its elevation and latitude. It represents one of the few historically active volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, with a base elevation estimated to be . Like most cinder cones, The Volcano consists of a pile of loose <a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a>, <a href="lapilli">lapilli</a>-sized <a href="tephra">tephra</a> and <a href="volcanic%20bomb">volcanic bomb</a>s. These were deposited during periods of <a href="lava%20fountain">lava fountain</a> activity. The vent area contains volcanic bombs up to long and small deposits of <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> precipitated from <a href="volcanic%20gas">volcanic gas</a>es.

Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has its origins in <a href="continent">continent</a>al <a href="rift">rift</a>ing—a long rupture in the Earth's <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a> where the <a href="lithosphere">lithosphere</a> is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed as a result of the <a href="Pacific%20Plate">Pacific Plate</a> sliding northward along the <a href="Queen%20Charlotte%20Fault">Queen Charlotte Fault</a>, on its way to the <a href="Aleutian%20Trench">Aleutian Trench</a>. As the <a href="continental%20crust">continental crust</a> stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a>. <a href="Basalt">Basalt</a>ic <a href="magma">magma</a> rises along these fractures to create <a href="effusive%20eruption">effusive eruption</a>s. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9 million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the <a href="geologic%20province">province</a> are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. <a href="Tseax%20Cone">Tseax Cone</a>, which last erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while <a href="Prindle%20Volcano">Prindle Volcano</a> in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000 years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.

At least two phases of volcanic activity have been identified at The Volcano. Each event was followed by the eruption of lengthy basaltic <a href="lava">lava</a> flows that flowed down steep <a href="granite">granitic</a> flanks of the mountain ridge on which The Volcano lies. After this took place, they travelled through the Lava Fork valley for . Here, the flows crossed the British Columbia border into the U.S. state of Alaska and blocked the Blue River, a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="Unuk%20River">Unuk River</a>, forming several lakes. The lava flows in total are about long and still contain their original features from when they cooled, including <a href="pressure%20ridge%20%28lava%29">pressure ridges</a> and <a href="lava%20channel">lava channel</a>s. A series of large trees were engulfed by the lava flows during eruption. The bases of the trees burned and the upper trunks and branches collapsed into the solidifying lava, leaving the trees embedded on the surface of the lava flows. After the flows solidified, tree molds and <a href="lava%20tube">lava tube</a>s collapsed to form volcanic pits. At the southern end of one of the lava flows, it spreads into a broad terminal lobe on the flat <a href="alluvial%20plain">alluvial plain</a> of the Unuk River. Volcanic ash and lava from The Volcano still linger on small <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s near Mount Lewis Cass, a mountain near the Alaska-British Columbia border.

At least one lava flow from The Volcano was notified by a surveyor named Fremont Morse in 1905 during a survey for the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border%23International%20Boundary%20Commission%20%281925%29">International Boundary Commission</a>. In 1906, Morse wrote that the most recently erupted lava flow had "probably occurred within less than fifty years". Since Morse's report, <a href="Dendrochronology">tree ring</a> and <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> techniques have been used to establish the dates of The Volcano's two volcanic phases. The first is estimated to have occurred about 360 years ago and the latest possibly took place only 150 years ago. This indicates that The Volcano is the youngest known volcanic mountain in Canada and that its volcanic activity is recent compared to many other volcanoes in British Columbia. In several documents, the last eruption of The Volcano is written to have occurred in 1904. However, according to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="Global%20Volcanism%20Program">Global Volcanism Program</a>, this eruption is considered uncertain.

Although The Volcano is estimated to have last erupted 150 years ago, it is one of the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985. Others include <a href="Castle%20Rock%20%28volcano%29">Castle Rock</a> (two events), <a href="Hoodoo%20Mountain">Hoodoo Mountain</a> (eight events), <a href="Crow%20Lagoon">Crow Lagoon</a> (four events) and the <a href="Mount%20Edziza%20volcanic%20complex">Mount Edziza volcanic complex</a> (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a>s, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.

The name of the peak was suggested by an explorer named Chris Dickinson during the Cambridge Coast Mountains Expedition in 1979. It was adopted on November 24, 1980, and has been its official name since then. However, this name for the peak does not normally show up in any volcanological resources. Instead, it is informally referred to as Lava Fork or Lava Fork volcano due to its close association with the <a href="stream">creek</a> of the same name. The reason for this controversy is because "The Volcano" is generic. In speech it may not be obvious whether "The Volcano" or "the volcano" is intended, leading to confusion. Similar named volcanoes in Canada include <a href="Volcano%20Vent">Volcano Vent</a> in the <a href="Tuya%20volcanic%20field">Tuya volcanic field</a> of northwestern British Columbia and <a href="Volcano%20Mountain">Volcano Mountain</a> in the <a href="Fort%20Selkirk%20volcanic%20field">Fort Selkirk volcanic field</a> of central <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>. As of 2009, the unofficial terms for The Volcano continue to be used by <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Canada">Natural Resources Canada</a>.

The Volcano, its eruptive products and a large <a href="mineral%20spring">mineral spring</a> are protected in <a href="Lava%20Forks%20Provincial%20Park">Lava Forks Provincial Park</a>. Founded in 2001 as a Class A <a href="provincial%20park">provincial park</a>, this highly remote <a href="park">park</a> covers an area of . Lying within its boundaries are the <a href="Lava%20Lakes">Lava Lakes</a>, two lakes dammed by lava flows erupted from The Volcano. Located in asserted traditional territory of the <a href="Tahltan%20First%20Nation">Tahltan First Nation</a>, Lava Forks Provincial Park provides a location to study ecological processes associated with primary succession or the establishment of vegetation after a major disturbance. After 150 years of non-eruptive activity, vegetation has grown on the surface of the lava flows, including <a href="moss">moss</a>es and <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s. <a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">Western Hemlock</a>, <a href="Tsuga%20mertensiana">Mountain Hemlock</a> and <a href="Alpine%20tundra">Alpine tundra</a> biogeoclimatic subzones also occur in the area, which form part of the Boundary Ranges Ecosection.

Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. This is partly because it is located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the past few hundred years. As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a>s, <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s and <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have effects on the surrounding landscape. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of volcanoes in Canada.

At least seven eruptions have occurred in the Iskut-Unuk River volcanic field in the past 10,000 years. Since around 1600 all eruptions have occurred at The Volcano. Its total eruption volume is estimated to be . Future eruptions from The Volcano will probably be similar in character to those that have occurred throughout its 360-year eruptive history. There is a one in 200 chance per year of an eruption occurring in Canada and one in 220 chance per year of an effusive eruption. An eruption in the foreseeable future is probably more likely along the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province than in an unrelated volcanic zone outside the province. This is because the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which includes the Iskut-Unuk River Cones, is the most active volcanic zone in Canada.

A small range of effects are expected from future eruptions at The Volcano. Its remote uninhabited location makes <a href="volcanic%20hazards">volcanic hazards</a> less extreme and is therefore not very hazardous. Ash and rock fragments (tephra) ejected during lava fountain activity are unlikely to be high enough to disrupt regional air traffic. However, they could possibly endanger lower flying aircraft along the northern coastal corridor between <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and Alaska. The closest major air route is about to the east. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.

Lava flows emitted during future volcanic eruptions would likely be basaltic in nature based on the composition of its lavas produced during past volcanic activity. Basaltic lava flows are low in <a href="silica">silica</a> content and can have speeds extending from . The last eruption at The Volcano 150 years ago had a large impact on fish, plant and animal inhabitants in the valley the lava flows travelled through to cross the Canada – United States border. Because of these circumstances, future eruptions may again block the flow of local water courses if the volume of the erupted lavas are significant enough. This would again have disastrous consequences for fish habitats and spawning grounds. However, there are neither records of any impacts on people during this eruption, nor evidence that it was even witnessed by people. A repeat of <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s in the Lava Fork valley is also a possibility due to the existence of vegetation on and around the erupted lavas.

Henry Petre

Henry Aloysius Petre, <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a> (12 June 1884 – 24 April 1962) was an English <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> who became Australia's first military aviator and a founding member of the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>, the predecessor of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. Born in <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, Petre forsook his early legal career to pursue an interest in aviation, building his own aeroplane and gaining employment as an aircraft designer and pilot. In 1912, he answered the Australian <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Defence Department</a>'s call for pilots to form an aviation school, and was commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>. The following year, he chose the site of the country's first air base at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, and established its inaugural training institution, the <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a>, with <a href="Eric%20Harrison%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Eric Harrison</a>.

Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Petre was appointed commander of the <a href="Mesopotamian%20Half%20Flight">Mesopotamian Half Flight</a>, the first unit of the newly formed Australian Flying Corps to see active service. He led the Half Flight through the <a href="Battle%20of%20Es%20Sinn">Battles of Es Sinn</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Ctesiphon%20%281915%29">Ctesiphon</a>, and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kut">Siege of Kut</a>. His actions in the Middle East earned him the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, and four <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">mentions in despatches</a>. Transferring to the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> as a <a href="major">major</a> in 1918, he commanded <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 75 Squadron</a> before retiring from the military the following year. Petre resumed his legal practice in England, and continued to fly recreationally until his death in 1962, aged seventy-seven. He was married to racing driver <a href="Kay%20Petre">Kay Petre</a>.

Henry Aloysius Petre (pronounced "Peter") was born on 12 June 1884 at <a href="Ingatestone">Ingatestone</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>. He was the son of Sebastian Henry Petre and his wife Catharine, "née" Sibeth. Descended from the <a href="William%20Petre%2C%2011th%20Baron%20Petre">11th Baron Petre</a>, Henry was schooled at <a href="Mount%20St%20Mary%27s%20College">Mount St Mary's College</a>, <a href="Chesterfield">Chesterfield</a>, before following his father into law and becoming a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> in 1905. Impressed by <a href="Louis%20Bl%C3%A9riot">Louis Blériot</a>'s pioneering <a href="English%20Channel">cross-channel</a> flight in July 1909, Petre gave up his legal practice, borrowed <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>250, and proceeded to build his own aeroplane, with design assistance from his brother Edward, an architect. After spending six months on its construction, Petre crashed the machine on its maiden flight. Uninjured and undiscouraged, he borrowed a further £25, took flying lessons at <a href="Brooklands">Brooklands Airfield</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, and obtained <a href="Royal%20Aero%20Club">Royal Aero Club</a> <a href="List%20of%20pilots%20awarded%20an%20Aviator%27s%20Certificate%20by%20the%20Royal%20Aero%20Club%20in%201911">Aviator's Certificate No. 128</a> on 12 September 1911. He became an instructor at Brooklands' <a href="Deperdussin">Deperdussin School</a>, and later its head, prior to taking up employment as a designer and pilot with <a href="Handley%20Page">Handley Page Limited</a> in 1912. Characterised by <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) historian</a> Douglas Gillison as "quiet and academic by nature", and coming from a long line of <a href="Holy%20Orders%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Catholic clergy</a>, Petre was nicknamed "Peter the Monk". On Christmas Eve 1912, Edward Petre, who was known as "Peter the Painter", was killed in an accident at <a href="Marske-by-the-Sea">Marske-by-the-Sea</a>, Yorkshire, while attempting to fly from Brooklands to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.
In December 1911, the Australian Defence Department had advertised in the United Kingdom for "two competent mechanists and aviators" to establish a flying corps and school. From among fifty applications, Petre was chosen and commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>, his appointment on 6 August 1912 making him the nation's first military pilot. The other appointee, <a href="Eric%20Harrison%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Eric Harrison</a>, joined him later that year. Petre arrived in Australia in January 1913, his first task being to choose a site for the proposed <a href="Central%20Flying%20School%20RAAF">Central Flying School</a> (CFS), which he was to command. After travelling hundreds of kilometres on his motorcycle, and rejecting the government's preferred location near the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, he selected at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">Point Cook</a>, Victoria, to become, as RAAF historian <a href="George%20Odgers">George Odgers</a> described it, the "birthplace of Australian military aviation".

Unlike the alternative site near Duntroon, Point Cook was flat, close to the coast and not, in Petre's own words, "isolated in the bush". He and Harrison established the CFS over the following year with four mechanics, three other staff, and five aircraft including two Deperdussin monoplanes, two <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20B.E.2">Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2</a> biplanes, and a <a href="Bristol%20Boxkite">Bristol Boxkite</a> for initial training. Harrison made the unit's first flight in the Boxkite on Sunday, 1 March 1914. Eight days later Petre registered Australia's first military flying accident when he crashed a Deperdussin while trying to avoid telephone wires during landing; he escaped with bruising but the plane was wrecked. Petre was best man at Harrison's wedding in June. Its coterie of personnel by now being referred to as the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>, the CFS commenced its first flying course on 17 August 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of World War I. The four students included Captain <a href="Thomas%20White%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Thomas White</a> and Lieutenants <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, George Merz, and David Manwell; Harrison was responsible for initial training and Petre for advanced instruction. Petre was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>, so that his rank was the same as White's. In October, Petre chaired the first meeting of the <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Aero%20Club">Australian Aero Club</a>, held at Point Cook.

On 8 February 1915, the Australian government received a request from the <a href="British%20Raj">British Government of India</a> for aerial assistance in the <a href="Mesopotamian%20campaign">campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia</a>. Sufficient aircrew and supporting personnel were available for only half a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a>, so the unit, the AFC's first to see active service, became known as the <a href="Mesopotamian%20Half%20Flight">Mesopotamian Half Flight</a>. Petre was appointed the Half Flight's commanding officer and embarked for <a href="Basra">Basra</a> via <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> on 14 April, later to be joined by fellow pilots White, Merz and Lieutenant William Treloar, along with thirty-seven ground staff.

In Mesopotamia, Petre was required to lead the AFC contingent in <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> and <a href="sabotage">sabotage</a> missions, and had to deal with unreliable machines, hazardous terrain, and the threat of incarceration or death at the hands of hostile tribesmen. From 31 May to 4 June 1915, he took part in operations in the <a href="Amarah">Amara</a> area, for which he was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>. The obsolete aircraft supplied by the Indian Government, two <a href="Maurice%20Farman%20Shorthorn">Maurice Farman Shorthorn</a>s and a <a href="Maurice%20Farman%20Longhorn">Maurice Farman Longhorn</a>, were only capable of top speeds of 50 mph (80 km/h), while the desert wind (known as the "<a href="shamal%20%28wind%29">shamal</a>") could reach 80 mph (129 km/h), meaning that the aircraft often made no headway or were simply blown backwards. In July, the Half Flight's equipment was augmented by two <a href="Caudron%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BG.3">Caudron G.3</a> aircraft, a marginal improvement on the Farmans, but still prone to mechanical failure. Later that month, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory. Its crew, Merz and a New Zealand military officer, were never seen again; they were later reported killed by Arabs after a running gun battle over several miles.
On 24 August 1915, the Half Flight was augmented by four <a href="Martinsyde%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.1">Martinsyde S.1</a>s and redesignated <a href="No.%2030%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 30 Squadron</a>, <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC). The squadron moved into <a href="Kut">Kut</a> following the city's capture by the Allies during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Es%20Sinn">Battle of Es Sinn</a> in September; for his part in the operation, Petre was again mentioned in despatches. Over the following two months, both Treloar and White were captured and became <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>, leaving Petre as the only pilot remaining from the original Half Flight. Around the time of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ctesiphon%20%281915%29">Battle of Ctesiphon</a> in November, he devised an implement shaped like a small <a href="Rake%20%28tool%29">garden rake</a> that allowed him to accurately measure ground distances from the air to better map the desert terrain. During the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kut">Siege of Kut</a> between December 1915 and April 1916, he flew a series of missions using crude parachutes to airdrop grain supplies (and a <a href="millstone">millstone</a> for grinding), medical supplies, and equipment to the town's entrapped garrison, which included nine of his AFC mechanics.

Petre was awarded the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> on 14 January 1916, and was mentioned in despatches twice more over the course of the year. In May 1916 he contracted <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> and was sent to India for recuperation. He transferred out of No. 30 Squadron in December, and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> the same month. In February 1917, he was posted to France with <a href="No.%2015%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 15 Squadron RFC</a>, a reconnaissance unit operating B.E.2s. Two months later his youngest brother John, a squadron commander in the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> and a <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a> recipient, was killed in a flying accident. Petre subsequently returned to England and took charge of <a href="No.%205%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 Squadron AFC</a> (also known as No. 29 Squadron RFC), a training unit for Australian <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> pilots, particularly those destined for Palestine. He had hoped to command <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron AFC</a> in Palestine but received an adverse report concerning his leadership abilities, and the position went to Williams. Petre was discharged from the AFC as a <a href="major">major</a> on 31 January 1918, to take a commission with the RFC. In April that year, he transferred to the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, establishing and commanding <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 75 (Home Defence) Squadron</a>.

Petre retired from the RAF on 15 September 1919, and resumed practice as a solicitor in London. He married Kathleen Defries, a Canadian, in 1929. Petre introduced Kathleen to racing cars and, as <a href="Kay%20Petre">Kay Petre</a>, she became one of Britain's leading female drivers of the 1930s. Henry Petre maintained his interest in aviation for the rest of his life, taking up competitive gliding and, according to historian Alan Stephens, more than thirty years after his first flight in 1911 still enjoyed "taking an <a href="Auster">Auster</a> for a spin". Petre broke the British Gliding Duration Record in 1931, with a time of almost three-and-a-half hours, and served as gliding instructor with the <a href="Air%20Training%20Corps">Air Training Corps</a> between 1943 and 1948. In 1951, he received the Royal Aero Club's Silver Medal for his long record of active flying. He visited Australia for the first time in forty-five years in 1961, and was photographed sitting in the cockpit of the same Deperdussin—by then an exhibit at the <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a>—that he had flown at Point Cook in 1914. Having retired from his legal practice in 1958, Petre died in London on 24 April 1962, and was survived by Kay, who died in 1994. The couple had no children.

In a retrospective on the RAAF in November 1939, <a href="Flight%20International">"Flight"</a> magazine described Henry Petre and Eric Harrison as "the fathers of military aviation in Australia". Petre's obituary in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" called him "an air pioneer who founded the Australian Flying Corps". Though Harrison, through his longer association with Australian service flying as a founding member of the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921 and his career up until the end of World War II, was generally regarded as the "Father of the RAAF" until <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Richard Williams assumed that mantle, Douglas Gillison considered Petre "equally entitled" to such an accolade. In his volume on the Air Force for The Australian Centenary History of Defence in 2001, Alan Stephens noted that Petre made "the greater contribution to the establishment of Point Cook and the Central Flying School", concluding that "perhaps any judgement would not only be moot but also gratuitous, as by circumstance and achievement both men properly belong in the pantheon of the RAAF".

It is commonly known as the eastern North American destroying angel or just as the destroying angel, although the fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal white "<a href="Amanita">Amanita</a>" species, "<a href="Amanita%20ocreata">A. ocreata</a>", "<a href="Amanita%20verna">A. verna</a>" and "<a href="Amanita%20virosa">A. virosa</a>". The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are found on the ground in <a href="mixed%20coniferous">mixed coniferous</a> and <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a>s of eastern North America south to Mexico, but are rare in western North America; the fungus has also been found in pine plantations in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>. The mushroom has a smooth white <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> that can reach up to across, and a <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, up to long by thick, that has a delicate white skirt-like <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> near the top. The bulbous stipe base is covered with a membranous sac-like <a href="volva%20%28mycology%29">volva</a>. The white <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are free from attachment to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a> and crowded closely together. As the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">species name</a> suggests, "A. bisporigera" typically bears two <a href="spore">spore</a>s on the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, although this characteristic is not as immutable as was once thought.

"Amanita bisporigera" was <a href="species%20description">described</a> as a new species in 1906. It is <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> in the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Phalloideae" of the genus "Amanita" together with other <a href="amatoxin">amatoxin</a>-containing species. Amatoxins are <a href="cyclic%20peptide">cyclic peptide</a>s which <a href="enzyme%20inhibition">inhibit</a> the enzyme <a href="RNA%20polymerase%20II">RNA polymerase II</a> and interfere with various cellular functions. The first symptoms of poisoning appear 6 to 24 hours after consumption, followed by a period of apparent improvement, then by symptoms of <a href="acute%20liver%20failure">liver</a> and <a href="acute%20kidney%20injury">kidney failure</a>, and death after four days or more. "Amanita bisporigera" closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally deadly "A. virosa" and "A. verna". These species, difficult to distinguish from "A. bisporigera" based on visible field characteristics, do not have two-spored <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, and do not stain yellow when a dilute solution of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> is applied. The <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of "A. bisporigera" has been partially <a href="DNA%20sequencing">sequenced</a>, and the <a href="gene">gene</a>s responsible for the production of amatoxins have been determined.

"Amanita bisporigera" was first described scientifically in 1906 by American botanist <a href="George%20Francis%20Atkinson">George Francis Atkinson</a> in a publication by <a href="Cornell%20University">Cornell University</a> colleague Charles E. Lewis. The <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> was <a href="Ithaca%2C%20New%20York">Ithaca, New York</a>, where several collections were made. In his 1941 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of world "Amanita" species, <a href="%C3%89douard-Jean%20Gilbert">Édouard-Jean Gilbert</a> transferred the species to his new genus "Amanitina", but this genus is now considered <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with "Amanita". In 1944, <a href="William%20Murrill">William Murrill</a> described the species "Amanita vernella", collected from <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville, Florida</a>; that species is now thought to be synonymous with "A. bisporigera" after a 1979 examination of its type material revealed <a href="basidium">basidia</a> that were mostly 2-spored. "Amanita phalloides" var. "striatula", a poorly known taxon originally described from the United States in 1902 by <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a>, is considered by "Amanita" authority Rodham Tulloss to be synonymous with "A. bisporigera". <a href="Common%20name">Vernacular names</a> for the mushroom include "destroying angel", "deadly amanita", "white death cap", "angel of death" and "eastern North American destroying angel".

"Amanita bisporigera" belongs to <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Phalloideae" of the genus "Amanita", which contains some of the deadliest "Amanita" species, including "A. phalloides" and "A. virosa". This <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> has been upheld with <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section "Phalloideae" form a <a href="clade">clade</a>—that is, they derive from a common ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a> (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic "Amanita" species, most of which are found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing "A. bisporigera", "A. subjunquillea" var. "alba", "A. exitialis", and "A. virosa". The Guangzhou destroying angel ("Amanita exitialis") has two-spored basidia, like "A. bisporigera".

The <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is in diameter and, depending on its age, ranges in shape from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat flattened. The cap surface is smooth and white, sometimes with a pale tan- or cream-colored tint in the center. The surface is either dry or, when the environment is moist, slightly sticky. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thin and white, and does not change color when bruised. The margin of the cap, which is rolled inwards in young specimens, does not have striations (grooves), and lacks <a href="volva%20%28mycology%29">volval</a> remnants. The <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>, also white, are crowded closely together. They are either free from attachment to the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> or just barely reach it. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend all the way to the stipe) are numerous, and gradually narrow.

The white stipe is by thick, solid (i.e., not hollow), and tapers slightly upward. The surface, in young specimens especially, is frequently floccose (covered with tufts of soft hair), fibrillose (covered with small slender fibers), or squamulose (covered with small scales); there may be fine grooves along its length. The bulb at the base of the stipe is spherical or nearly so. The delicate <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the upper part of the stipe is a remnant of the <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that extends from the cap margin to the stalk and covers the gills during development. It is white, thin, membranous, and hangs like a skirt. When young, the mushrooms are enveloped in a membrane called the <a href="universal%20veil">universal veil</a>, which stretches from the top of the cap to the bottom of the stipe, imparting an oval, egg-like appearance. In mature fruit bodies, the veil's remnants form a membrane around the base, the volva, like an eggshell-shaped cup. On occasion, however, the volva remains underground or gets torn up during development. It is white, sometimes lobed, and may become pressed closely to the stipe. The volva is up to in height (measured from the base of the bulb), and is about 2 mm thick midway between the top and the base attachment. The mushroom's odor has been described as "pleasant to somewhat nauseous", becoming more <a href="wikt%3Acloying">cloying</a> as the fruit body ages. The cap flesh turns yellow when a solution of <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification%23Potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH, 5–10%) is applied (a common <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification%23Potassium%20hydroxide">chemical test</a> used in mushroom identification). This characteristic chemical reaction is shared with "A. ocreata" and "A. virosa", although some authors have expressed doubt about the identity of North American "A. virosa", suggesting those collections may represent four-spored "A. bisporigera". Tulloss suggests that reports of "A. bisporigera" that do not turn yellow with KOH were actually based on white forms of "<a href="Amanita%20phalloides">A. phalloides</a>". Findings from the <a href="Chiricahua%20Mountains">Chiricahua Mountains</a> of <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and in central Mexico, although "nearly identical" to "A. bisporigera", do not stain yellow with KOH; their taxonomic status has not been investigated in detail.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> of "A. bisporigera", like most "Amanita", is white. The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are roughly spherical, thin-walled, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>, and measure 7.8–9.6 by 7.0–9.0 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. The <a href="Pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> is made of partially gelatinized, filamentous interwoven <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e, 2–6 μm in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges from the center of the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose—composed of relatively thin branching, unclamped hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, are club-shaped, thin-walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34–45 by 4–11 μm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three- or four-spored forms have been found. Although the two-spored basidia are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four-spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses. The volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae, 2–10 μm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic. The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2–5 μm in diameter. The inflated cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2–3 by 15.7 μm. The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring 2–6 μm in diameter. The inflated cells are sparse, broadly elliptic to pear-shaped, and are rarely larger than 31 by 22 μm. <a href="wikt%3APleurocystidium">Pleurocystidia</a> and <a href="wikt%3Acheilocystidium">cheilocystidia</a> (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent, but there may be cylindrical to sac-like cells of the partial veil on the gill edges; these cells are hyaline and measure 24–34 by 7–16 μm.
In 1906 Charles E. Lewis studied and illustrated the development of the basidia in order to compare the <a href="cell%20nucleus">nuclear</a> behavior of the two-spored with that of the four-spored forms. Initially (1), the young basidium, appearing as a club-shaped branch from the subhymenium, is filled with <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> and contains two primary nuclei, which have distinct <a href="nucleolus">nucleoli</a>. As the basidium grows larger, the membranes of the two nuclei contact (2), and then the membrane disappears at the point of contact (3). The two primary nuclei remain distinct for a short time, but eventually the two nuclei fuse completely to form a larger secondary nucleus with a single secondary nucleolus (4, 5). The basidium increases in size after the primary nuclei fuse, and the nucleus migrates towards the end of the basidia (6, 7). During this time, the nucleus develops <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a>s "filled by the nuclear sap in the living cell". <a href="Chromosome">Chromosome</a>s are produced from the nucleolar threads, and align transversely near the apex of the basidium, connected by <a href="spindle%20apparatus">spindles</a> (8–10). The chromosomes then move to the poles, forming the daughter nuclei that occupy different positions in the basidium; the daughters now have a structure similar to that of the parent nuclei (11). The two nuclei then divide to form four nuclei, similar to fungi with four-spored basidia (12, 13). The four nuclei crowd together at some distance from the end of the basidium to form an irregular mass (14). Shortly thereafter, the sterigmata (slender projections of the basidia that attach the spores) begin to form (15), and cytoplasm begins to pass through the sterigmata to form the spores (16). Although Lewis was not able to clearly determine from observation alone whether the contents of two or four nuclei passed through the sterigmata, he deduced, by examining older basidia with mature spores, that only two nuclei enter the spores (16, 17).

"Amanita bisporigera" is considered the most toxic North American "Amanita" mushroom, with little variation in toxin content between different fruit bodies. Three subtypes of amatoxin have been described: <a href="alpha-Amanitin">α-</a>, <a href="beta-Amanitin">β</a>, and <a href="Gamma-Amanitin">γ-amanitin</a>. The principal amatoxin, α-amanitin, is readily absorbed across the intestine, and 60% of the absorbed toxin is excreted into <a href="bile">bile</a> and undergoes <a href="enterohepatic%20circulation">enterohepatic circulation</a>; the kidneys clear the remaining 40%. The toxin <a href="enzyme%20inhibition">inhibits</a> the enzyme <a href="RNA%20polymerase%20II">RNA polymerase II</a>, thereby interfering with <a href="DNA%20transcription">DNA transcription</a>, which suppresses RNA production and <a href="protein%20synthesis">protein synthesis</a>. This causes cellular <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a>, especially in cells which are initially exposed and have rapid rates of protein synthesis. This process results in severe acute liver dysfunction and, ultimately, <a href="liver%20failure">liver failure</a>. Amatoxins are not broken down by boiling, freezing, or drying. Roughly 0.2 to 0.4 <a href="milligram">milligram</a>s of α-amanitin is present in 1 gram of "A. bisporigera"; the <a href="lethal%20dose">lethal dose</a> in humans is less than 0.1 mg/kg body weight. One mature fruit body can contain 10–12 mg of α-amanitin, enough for a lethal dose. The α-amanitin concentration in the spores is about 17% that of the fruit body tissues. "A. bisporigera" also contains the <a href="phallotoxin">phallotoxin</a> phallacidin, structurally related to the amatoxins but considered less poisonous because of poor absorption. Poisonings (from similar white amanitas) have also been reported in domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and cows.

The first reported poisonings resulting in death from the consumption of "A. bisporigera" were from near <a href="San%20Antonio%20%28disambiguation%29">San Antonio</a>, Mexico, in 1957, where a rancher, his wife, and three children consumed the fungus; only the man survived. "Amanita" poisoning is characterized by the following distinct stages: the "incubation stage" is an <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> period which ranges from 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. In the "gastrointestinal stage", about 6 to 16 hours after ingestion, there is onset of abdominal pain, explosive vomiting, and diarrhea for up to 24 hours, which may lead to dehydration, severe <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> imbalances, and <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>. These early symptoms may be related to other toxins such as <a href="phalloidin">phalloidin</a>. In the cytotoxic stage, 24 to 48 hours after ingestion, clinical and biochemical signs of liver damage are observed, but the patient is typically free of gastrointestinal symptoms. The signs of liver dysfunction such as <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a>, <a href="hypoglycemia">hypoglycemia</a>, <a href="acidosis">acidosis</a>, and <a href="hemorrhage">hemorrhage</a> appear. Later, there is an increase in the levels of <a href="prothrombin">prothrombin</a> and blood levels of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>, and the signs of <a href="hepatic%20encephalopathy">hepatic encephalopathy</a> and/or <a href="kidney%20failure">kidney failure</a> appear. The <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a>s for mortality that have been reported are age younger than 10 years, short latency period between ingestion and onset of symptoms, severe <a href="coagulopathy">coagulopathy</a> (blood clotting disorder), severe <a href="hyperbilirubinemia">hyperbilirubinemia</a> (jaundice), and rising serum <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> levels.

The color and general appearance of "A. bisporigera" are similar to those of "<a href="Amanita%20verna">A. verna</a>" and "<a href="Amanita%20virosa">A. virosa</a>". "A. bisporigera" is at times smaller and more slender than either "A. verna" or "A. virosa", but it varies considerably in size; therefore size is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic. "A. virosa" fruits in autumn—later than "A. bisporigera". "<a href="Amanita%20elliptosperma">A. elliptosperma</a>" is less common but widely distributed in the southeastern United States, while "<a href="Amanita%20ocreata">A. ocreata</a>" is found on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a> and in the Southwest. Other similar toxic North American species include "<a href="Amanita%20magnivelaris">Amanita magnivelaris</a>", which has a cream-colored, rather thick, felted-submembranous, skirt-like ring, and "<a href="Amanita%20virosiformis">A. virosiformis</a>", which has elongated spores that are 3.9–4.7 by 11.7–13.4 μm. Neither "A. elliptosperma" nor "A. magnivelaris" typically turn yellow with the application of KOH; the KOH reaction of "A. virosiformis" has not been reported.

"<a href="Leucoagaricus%20leucothites">Leucoagaricus leucothites</a>" is another all-white mushroom with an annulus, free gills, and white spore print, but it lacks a volva and has thick-walled dextrinoid (staining red-brown in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>) egg-shaped spores with a pore. "A. bisporigera" may also be confused with the larger <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species "<a href="Agaricus%20silvicola">Agaricus silvicola</a>", the "horse-mushroom". Like many white amanitas, young fruit bodies of "A. bisporigera", still enveloped in the universal veil, can be confused with <a href="puffball">puffball</a> species, but a longitudinal cut of the fruit body reveals internal structures in the "Amanita" that are absent in puffballs. In 2006, seven members of the <a href="Hmong%20people">Hmong</a> community living in Minnesota were poisoned with "A. bisporigera" because they had confused it with edible paddy straw mushrooms ("<a href="Volvariella%20volvacea">Volvariella volvacea</a>") that grow in Southeast Asia.

Like most other "Amanita" species, "A. bisporigera" is thought to form <a href="mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a> relationships with trees. This is a <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutually beneficial</a> relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and giving the tree greater access to soil nutrients. Fruit bodies of "Amanita bisporigera" are found on the ground growing either solitarily, scattered, or in groups in <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forests">mixed</a> coniferous and deciduous forests; they tend to appear during summer and early fall. The fruit bodies are commonly found near <a href="oak">oak</a>, but have been reported in <a href="birch">birch</a>-<a href="aspen">aspen</a> areas in the west. It is most commonly found in eastern North America, and rare in western North America. It is widely distributed in Canada, and its range extends south to Mexico. The species has also been found in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, where it may have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> from trees exported for use in pine <a href="plantation">plantation</a>s.

The "Amanita" Genome Project was begun in Jonathan Walton's lab at <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a> in 2004 as part of their ongoing studies of "Amanita bisporigera". The purpose of the project is to determine the <a href="gene">gene</a>s and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The <a href="genome">genome</a> of "A. bisporigera" has been sequenced using a combination of automated <a href="Sanger%20sequencing">Sanger sequencing</a> and <a href="pyrosequencing">pyrosequencing</a>, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify the genes responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, "AMA1" and "PHA1". The cyclic peptides are synthesized on <a href="ribosomes">ribosomes</a>, and require <a href="proline">proline</a>-specific <a href="peptidase">peptidase</a>s from the <a href="prolyl%20oligopeptidase">prolyl oligopeptidase</a> family for <a href="Posttranslational%20modification">processing</a>.

The genetic sequence information from "A. bisporigera" has been used to identify molecular <a href="polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphisms</a> in the related "A. phalloides". These <a href="single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">single-nucleotide polymorphism</a>s may be used as population <a href="genetic%20marker">genetic marker</a>s to study <a href="phylogeography">phylogeography</a> and <a href="population%20genetics">population genetics</a>. Sequence information has also been employed to show that "A. bisporigera" lacks many of the major classes of secreted enzymes that break down the complex <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s of <a href="plant%20cell%20wall">plant cell wall</a>s, like <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>. In contrast, <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> fungi like "<a href="Coprinopsis%20cinerea">Coprinopsis cinerea</a>" and "<a href="Galerina%20marginata">Galerina marginata</a>", which break down <a href="organic%20matter">organic matter</a> to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.

Katsudō Shashin

, sometimes called the Matsumoto fragment, is a 1907 Japanese animated filmstrip that is the oldest known work of <a href="Anime">animation from Japan</a>. Its creator is unknown. Evidence suggests it was made before 1912, so it may predate the earliest displays of Western animated films in Japan. It was discovered in a collection of films and projectors in <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a> in 2005.

The three-second filmstrip depicts a boy who writes "", removes his hat, and bows. The frames were <a href="stencil">stencil</a>led in red and black using a device for making <a href="magic%20lantern">magic lantern</a> slides, and the filmstrip was fastened in a loop for continuous play.

"Katsudō Shashin" consists of a series of cartoon images on fifty frames of a <a href="celluloid">celluloid</a> strip and lasts three seconds at sixteen <a href="Frame%20rate">frames per second</a>. It depicts a young boy in a <a href="sailor%20suit">sailor suit</a> who writes the <a href="kanji">kanji</a> characters "" ("katsudō shashin", "moving picture") from <a href="Horizontal%20and%20vertical%20writing%20in%20East%20Asian%20scripts%23Japanese">right to left</a>, then turns to the viewer, removes his hat, and bows. "Katsudō Shashin" is a provisional title for the film, whose actual title is unknown.

Unlike in <a href="traditional%20animation">traditional animation</a>, the frames were not produced by photographing the images, but rather were impressed onto film using a <a href="stencil">stencil</a>. This was done with a "kappa-ban", a device for stencilling <a href="magic%20lantern">magic lantern</a> slides. The images were in red and black on a strip of <a href="35%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20film">35 mm film</a> whose ends were fastened in a loop for continuous viewing.

Early printed animation films for optical toys such as the <a href="zoetrope">zoetrope</a> predated projected film animation. German toy manufacturer <a href="Bing%20%28company%29">Gebrüder Bing</a> presented a <a href="cinematograph">cinematograph</a> at a toy festival in Nuremberg in 1898; soon other toy manufacturers sold similar devices. Live-action films for these devices were expensive to make; possibly as early as 1898 animated films for these devices were on sale, and could be fastened in loops for continuous viewing. Imports of these German devices appeared in Japan at least as early as 1904; films for them likely included animation loops.

Projected film technology arrived in Japan from the West in 1896–97. The earliest display of foreign animation in Japanese theatres that can be dated with certainty is of the French animator <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a>'s "The Nipper's Transformations" (1911), which premièred in Tokyo on 15 April 1912. Works by <a href="%C5%8Cten%20Shimokawa">Ōten Shimokawa</a>, <a href="Seitar%C5%8D%20Kitayama">Seitarō Kitayama</a>, and <a href="Jun%27ichi%20K%C5%8Duchi">Jun'ichi Kōuchi</a> in 1917 were the first Japanese animated films to reach theatre screens. The <a href="Lost%20film">films are lost</a>, but a few have been discovered in "toy movie" versions for viewing at home on hand-cranked projectors; the oldest to survive is "Hanawa Hekonai meitō no maki" (1917), titled "<a href="Namakura-gatana">Namakura-gatana</a>" in its home version.

In December 2004, a secondhand dealer in Kyoto contacted Natsuki Matsumoto, an expert in <a href="iconography">iconography</a> at the <a href="Osaka%20University%20of%20Arts">Osaka University of Arts</a>. The dealer had obtained a collection of films and projectors from an old Kyoto family, and Matsumoto arrived the next month to fetch them. The collection included three projectors, eleven 35mm films, and thirteen glass magic lantern slides.

When Matsumoto found "Katsudō Shashin" in the collection, the filmstrip was in poor condition. The collection included three Western animated filmstrips; "Katsudō Shashin" may have been made in imitation of such examples of German or other Western animation. Based on evidence such as the likely manufacture dates of the projectors in the collection, Matsumoto and animation historian determined the film was most likely made in the late <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji period</a>, which ended in 1912; historian Frederick S. Litten has suggested as a likely date, and that "a production date before 1905 or after 1912 is unlikely". At the time, movie theatres were rare in Japan; evidence suggests "Katsudō Shashin" was mass-produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors. The creator of the filmstrip remains unknown; to Matsumoto, the relatively poor quality and low-tech printing technique indicate it was likely from a smaller company.

The discovery was widely covered in Japanese media. Given its speculated date of creation, the film would have been contemporary to—or even have predated—early animated works by Cohl and the American animators <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BStuart%20Blackton">J. Stuart Blackton</a> and <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>. The newspaper "<a href="Asahi%20Shimbun">Asahi Shimbun</a>" acknowledged the importance of the discovery of Meiji-period animation, but expressed reservations about placing the film in the genealogy of Japanese animation, writing that it is "controversial that should even be called animation in the contemporary sense".

A waveguide filter is an <a href="electronic%20filter">electronic filter</a> that is constructed with <a href="waveguide%20%28electromagnetism%29">waveguide</a> technology. Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an <a href="electromagnetic%20wave">electromagnetic wave</a> may be transmitted. Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the <a href="passband">passband</a>), while others are rejected (the <a href="stopband">stopband</a>). Filters are a basic component of <a href="electronic%20engineering">electronic engineering</a> designs and have numerous applications. These include <a href="Selectivity%20%28electronic%29">selection</a> of <a href="Signal%20%28electrical%20engineering%29">signals</a> and limitation of <a href="Noise%20%28electronics%29">noise</a>. Waveguide filters are most useful in the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low <a href="insertion%20loss">loss</a>. Examples of <a href="microwave%20filter">microwave filter</a> use are found in <a href="satellite%20communications">satellite communications</a>, <a href="telephone%20network">telephone network</a>s, and <a href="television%20broadcasting">television broadcasting</a>.

Waveguide filters were <a href="Technology%20during%20World%20War%20II">developed during World War II</a> to meet the needs of <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="electronic%20countermeasure">electronic countermeasure</a>s, but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in <a href="microwave%20link">microwave link</a>s. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode <a href="cavity%20resonator">cavities</a> and novel materials such as <a href="ceramic%20resonator">ceramic resonator</a>s.

A particular feature of waveguide filter design concerns the <a href="normal%20mode">mode</a> of transmission. Systems based on pairs of <a href="Electrical%20conductor">conducting</a> wires and similar technologies have only one mode of transmission. In waveguide systems, any number of modes are possible. This can be both a disadvantage, as spurious modes frequently cause problems, and an advantage, as a dual-mode design can be much smaller than the equivalent waveguide single mode design. The chief advantages of waveguide filters over other technologies are their ability to handle high power and their low loss. The chief disadvantages are their bulk and cost when compared with technologies such as <a href="microstrip">microstrip</a> filters.

There is a wide array of different types of waveguide filters. Many of them consist of a chain of coupled resonators of some kind that can be modelled as a <a href="ladder%20network">ladder network</a> of <a href="LC%20circuit">LC circuit</a>s. One of the most common types consists of a number of coupled <a href="resonant%20cavity">resonant cavities</a>. Even within this type, there are many subtypes, mostly differentiated by the means of <a href="Coupling%20%28electronics%29">coupling</a>. These coupling types include apertures, irises, and posts. Other waveguide filter types include <a href="dielectric%20resonator">dielectric resonator</a> filters, insert filters, finline filters, corrugated-waveguide filters, and stub filters. A number of waveguide components have <a href="filter%20theory">filter theory</a> applied to their design, but their purpose is something other than to filter signals. Such devices include <a href="impedance%20matching">impedance matching</a> components, <a href="directional%20coupler">directional coupler</a>s, and <a href="diplexer">diplexer</a>s. These devices frequently take on the form of a filter, at least in part.

The common meaning of "waveguide", when the term is used unqualified, is the hollow metal kind, but other waveguide technologies are possible. The scope of this article is limited to the metal-tube type. The <a href="%23Post-wall%20waveguide">post-wall waveguide</a> structure is something of a variant, but is related enough to include in this article—the wave is mostly surrounded by conducting material. It is possible to construct <a href="waveguide%20%28optics%29">waveguides out of dielectric rods</a>, the most well known example being <a href="optical%20fibre">optical fibre</a>s. This subject is outside the scope of the article with the exception that dielectric rod resonators are sometimes used "inside" hollow metal waveguides. <a href="Transmission%20line">Transmission line</a> technologies such as conducting wires and microstrip can be thought of as waveguides, but are not commonly called such and are also outside the scope of this article.

In <a href="electronics">electronics</a>, <a href="Filter%20%28signal%20processing%29">filters</a> are used to allow signals of a certain band of <a href="frequency">frequencies</a> to pass while blocking others. They are a basic building block of electronic systems and have a great many applications. Amongst the uses of waveguide filters are the construction of <a href="duplexer">duplexer</a>s, <a href="diplexer">diplexer</a>s, and <a href="multiplexer">multiplexer</a>s; <a href="Selectivity%20%28electronic%29">selectivity</a> and <a href="Noise%20%28electronics%29">noise</a> limitation in <a href="Receiver%20%28radio%29">receivers</a>; and <a href="harmonic%20distortion">harmonic distortion</a> suppression in <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a>s.

<a href="Waveguide%20%28electromagnetism%29">Waveguide</a>s are metal conduits used to confine and direct radio signals. They are usually made of brass, but aluminium and copper are also used. Most commonly they are rectangular, but other <a href="Multiview%20orthographic%20projection%23Cross-section">cross-sections</a> such as circular or elliptical are possible. A waveguide filter is a filter composed of waveguide components. It has much the same range of applications as other filter technologies in electronics and radio engineering but is very different mechanically and in principle of operation.

The technology used for constructing filters is chosen to a large extent by the frequency of operation that is expected, although there is a large amount of overlap. Low frequency applications such as <a href="audio%20electronics">audio electronics</a> use filters composed of discrete <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>s and <a href="inductor">inductor</a>s. Somewhere in the <a href="very%20high%20frequency">very high frequency</a> band, designers switch to using components made of pieces of transmission line. These kinds of designs are called <a href="distributed%20element%20filter">distributed element filter</a>s. Filters made from discrete components are sometimes called <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped element</a> filters to distinguish them. At still higher frequencies, the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> bands, the design switches to waveguide filters, or sometimes a combination of waveguides and transmission lines.

Waveguide filters have much more in common with transmission line filters than lumped element filters; they do not contain any discrete capacitors or inductors. However, the waveguide design may frequently be equivalent (or approximately so) to a lumped element design. Indeed, the design of waveguide filters frequently starts from a lumped element design and then converts the elements of that design into waveguide components.

One of the most important differences in the operation of waveguide filters compared to transmission line designs concerns the mode of transmission of the <a href="electromagnetic%20wave">electromagnetic wave</a> carrying the signal. In a transmission line, the wave is associated with electric currents on a pair of conductors. The conductors constrain the currents to be parallel to the line, and consequently both the magnetic and electric components of the <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a> are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave. This <a href="transverse%20mode">transverse mode</a> is designated TEM (transverse electromagnetic). On the other hand, there are infinitely many modes that any completely hollow waveguide can support, but the TEM mode is not one of them. Waveguide modes are designated either TE (transverse electric) or TM (transverse magnetic), followed by a pair of suffixes identifying the precise mode.

This multiplicity of modes can cause problems in waveguide filters when spurious modes are generated. Designs are usually based on a single mode and frequently incorporate features to suppress the unwanted modes. On the other hand, advantage can be had from choosing the right mode for the application, and even sometimes making use of more than one mode at once. Where only a single mode is in use, the waveguide can be modelled like a conducting transmission line and results from transmission line theory can be applied.

Another feature peculiar to waveguide filters is that there is a definite frequency, the <a href="Cutoff%20frequency%23Waveguides">cutoff frequency</a>, below which no transmission can take place. This means that in theory <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a>s cannot be made in waveguides. However, designers frequently take a lumped element low-pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation. The filter is consequently low-pass by design and may be considered a low-pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application. The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode, so at a given frequency, the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others. Likewise, the <a href="guide%20wavelength">guide wavelength</a> (λ) and <a href="characteristic%20impedance">characteristic impedance</a> ("Z") of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode.

The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency of all the modes is called the dominant mode. Between cutoff and the next highest mode, this is the only mode it is possible to transmit, which is why it is described as dominant. Any spurious modes generated are rapidly attenuated along the length of the guide and soon disappear. Practical filter designs are frequently made to operate in the dominant mode.

In rectangular waveguide, the TE mode (shown in figure 2) is the dominant mode. There is a band of frequencies between the dominant mode cutoff and the next highest mode cutoff in which the waveguide can be operated without any possibility of generating spurious modes. The next highest cutoff modes are TE, at exactly twice the TE mode, and TE which is also twice TE if the waveguide used has the commonly used <a href="aspect%20ratio">aspect ratio</a> of 2:1. The lowest cutoff TM mode is TM (shown in figure 2) which is formula_1 times the dominant mode in 2:1 waveguide. Thus, there is an <a href="octave">octave</a> over which the dominant mode is free of spurious modes, although operating too close to cutoff is usually avoided because of phase distortion.

In circular waveguide, the dominant mode is TE and is shown in figure 2. The next highest mode is TM. The range over which the dominant mode is guaranteed to be spurious-mode free is less than that in rectangular waveguide; the ratio of highest to lowest frequency is approximately 1.3 in circular waveguide, compared to 2.0 in rectangular guide.

<a href="Evanescent%20wave%23Evanescent-wave%20coupling">Evanescent mode</a>s are modes below the cutoff frequency. They cannot propagate down the waveguide for any distance, dying away exponentially. However, they are important in the functioning of certain filter components such as irises and posts, described later, because energy is stored in the evanescent wave fields.

Like transmission line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple <a href="passband">passband</a>s, replicas of the lumped element <a href="prototype%20filter">prototype</a>. In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two in the case of <a href="band-stop%20filter">band-stop filter</a>s) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts. This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands. Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function. For this reason, true low-pass and <a href="high-pass%20filter">high-pass filter</a>s cannot exist in waveguide. At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter. But, similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency, the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest.

The range of frequencies over which waveguide filters are useful is largely determined by the waveguide size needed. At lower frequencies the waveguide needs to be impractically large in order to keep the cutoff frequency below the operational frequency. On the other hand, filters whose operating frequencies are so high that the wavelengths are sub-millimetre cannot be manufactured with normal <a href="machine%20shop">machine shop</a> processes. At frequencies this high, fibre-optic technology starts to become an option.

Waveguides are a low-loss medium. Losses in waveguides mostly come from <a href="Joule%20heating">ohmic</a> dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls. Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide and is usually the preferred format, but the TE circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications. Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls. In some applications which require rigorous filtering, the walls are plated with a thin layer of gold or silver to improve surface <a href="electrical%20conductivity">conductivity</a>. An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss, high selectivity, and linear group delay from their filters.

One of the main advantages of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies is the quality of their <a href="resonator">resonator</a>s. Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called <a href="Q%20factor">Q factor</a>, or just "Q". The "Q" of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators. The <a href="electrical%20resistance">resistance</a> of conductors, especially in wound inductors, limits the "Q" of TEM resonators. This improved "Q" leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater stop band rejection. The limitation to "Q" in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double "Q".

Waveguides have good power handling capability, which leads to filter applications in <a href="radar">radar</a>. Despite the performance advantages of waveguide filters, <a href="microstrip">microstrip</a> is often the preferred technology due to its low cost. This is especially true for consumer items and the lower microwave frequencies. Microstrip circuits can be manufactured by cheap <a href="printed%20circuit">printed circuit</a> technology, and when integrated on the same printed board as other circuit blocks they incur little additional cost.

The idea of a waveguide for electromagnetic waves was first suggested by <a href="Lord%20Rayleigh">Lord Rayleigh</a> in 1897. Rayleigh proposed that a <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial transmission line</a> could have the centre conductor removed, and waves would still propagate down the inside of the remaining cylindrical conductor despite there no longer being a complete electrical circuit of conductors. He described this in terms of the wave reflecting repeatedly off the internal wall of the outer conductor in a zig-zag fashion as it progressed down the waveguide. Rayleigh was also the first to realise that there was a critical wavelength, the cutoff wavelength, proportional to the cylinder diameter, above which wave propagation is not possible. However, interest in waveguides waned because lower frequencies were more suitable for long distance radio communication. Rayleigh's results were forgotten for a time and had to be rediscovered by others in the 1930s when interest in microwaves revived. Waveguides were first developed, in a circular form, by <a href="George%20Clark%20Southworth">George Clark Southworth</a> and J. F. Hargreaves in 1932.

The first <a href="analogue%20filter">analogue filter</a> design which went beyond a simple single resonator was created by <a href="George%20Ashley%20Campbell">George Ashley Campbell</a> in 1910 and marked the beginning of filter theory. Campbell's filter was a lumped-element design of capacitors and inductors suggested by his work with <a href="loading%20coil">loading coil</a>s. <a href="Otto%20Zobel">Otto Zobel</a> and others quickly developed this further. Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War II. A major paper on the subject was published by <a href="Warren%20P.%20Mason">Mason</a> and Sykes in 1937; a patent filed by Mason in 1927 may contain the first published filter design using distributed elements.
Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and <a href="balanced%20pair">balanced pair</a>s of wires, but other researchers later applied the principles to waveguides as well. Much development on waveguide filters was carried out during World War II driven by the filtering needs of radar and <a href="electronic%20countermeasure">electronic countermeasure</a>s. A good deal of this was at the <a href="MIT%20Radiation%20Laboratory">MIT Radiation Laboratory</a> (Rad Lab), but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved such as the <a href="Telecommunications%20Research%20Establishment">Telecommunications Research Establishment</a> in the UK. Amongst the well-known scientists and engineers at Rad Lab were <a href="Julian%20Schwinger">Julian Schwinger</a>, <a href="Nathan%20Marcuvitz">Nathan Marcuvitz</a>, <a href="Edward%20Mills%20Purcell">Edward Mills Purcell</a>, and <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>. Bethe was only at Rad Lab a short time but produced his aperture theory while there. Aperture theory is important for waveguide cavity filters, which were first developed at Rad Lab. Their work was published after the war in 1948 and includes an early description of dual-mode cavities by Fano and Lawson.

Theoretical work following the war included the commensurate line theory of <a href="Paul%20Richards%20%28scientist%29">Paul Richards</a>. Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. <a href="Richards%27%20transformation">Richards' transformation</a> allows any lumped element design to be taken "as is" and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation. In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as <a href="Kuroda%27s%20identities">Kuroda's identities</a>. These made Richard's work more usable in <a href="unbalanced%20line">unbalanced</a> and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic <a href="Series%20and%20parallel%20circuits">series</a> connected elements, but it was some time before Kuroda's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world. Another theoretical development was the <a href="network%20synthesis%20filter">network synthesis filter</a> approach of <a href="Wilhelm%20Cauer">Wilhelm Cauer</a> in which he used the <a href="Chebyshev%20approximation">Chebyshev approximation</a> to determine element values. Cauer's work was largely developed during World War II (Cauer was killed towards the end of it), but could not be widely published until hostilities ended. While Cauer's work concerns lumped elements, it is of some importance to waveguide filters; the <a href="Chebyshev%20filter">Chebyshev filter</a>, a special case of Cauer's synthesis, is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs.

Designs in the 1950s started with a lumped element prototype (a technique still in use today), arriving after various transformations at the desired filter in a waveguide form. At the time, this approach was yielding <a href="fractional%20bandwidth">fractional bandwidth</a>s no more than about . In 1957, Leo Young at <a href="Stanford%20Research%20Institute">Stanford Research Institute</a> published a method for designing filters which "started" with a distributed element prototype, the stepped impedance prototype. This filter was based on <a href="quarter-wave%20impedance%20transformer">quarter-wave impedance transformer</a>s of various widths and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an <a href="Octave%20%28electronics%29">octave</a> (a fractional bandwidth of ). Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types.

The first published account of a <a href="cross-coupled%20filter">cross-coupled filter</a> is due to <a href="John%20R.%20Pierce">John R. Pierce</a> at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> in a 1948 patent. A cross-coupled filter is one in which resonators that are not immediately adjacent are coupled. The additional <a href="Degrees%20of%20freedom%20%28physics%20and%20chemistry%29">degrees of freedom</a> thus provided allow the designer to create filters with improved performance, or, alternatively, with fewer resonators. One version of Pierce's filter, shown in figure 3, uses circular waveguide cavity resonators to link between rectangular guide cavity resonators. This principle was not at first much used by waveguide filter designers, but it was used extensively by <a href="mechanical%20filter">mechanical filter</a> designers in the 1960s, particularly R. A. Johnson at <a href="Collins%20Radio%20Company">Collins Radio Company</a>.

The initial non-military application of waveguide filters was in the <a href="microwave%20link">microwave link</a>s used by telecommunications companies to provide the <a href="backbone%20network">backbone</a> of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters. Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. They are now also used in <a href="satellite%20communications">satellite communications</a> systems.

The need for frequency-independent delay in satellite applications led to more research into the waveguide incarnation of cross-coupled filters. Previously, satellite communications systems used a separate component for <a href="delay%20equalisation">delay equalisation</a>. The additional degrees of freedom obtained from cross-coupled filters held out the possibility of designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other performance parameters. A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space. The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s. Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young, who investigated better modes for the band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid-1970s.

Another space-saving innovation was the <a href="dielectric%20resonator">dielectric resonator</a>, which can be used in other filter formats as well as waveguide. The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965, using <a href="titanium%20dioxide">titanium dioxide</a> as the dielectric material. Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s, however, had very poor temperature coefficients, typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of <a href="invar">invar</a>, which led to instability of filter parameters. Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a <a href="dielectric%20constant">dielectric constant</a> to be useful for space saving. This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s. The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using <a href="barium%20tetratitanate">barium tetratitanate</a> at <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> in 1972. Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and <a href="Murata%20Manufacturing">Murata Manufacturing</a>. Bell Labs' <a href="barium%20nonatitanate">barium nonatitanate</a> resonator had a dielectric constant of 40 and <a href="Q%20factor">"Q"</a> of 5000–10,000 at . Modern temperature-stable materials have a dielectric constant of about 90 at microwave frequencies, but research is continuing to find materials with both low loss and high permittivity; lower permittivity materials, such as <a href="zirconium%20stannate%20titanate">zirconium stannate titanate</a> (ZST) with a dielectric constant of 38, are still sometimes used for their low loss property.

An alternative approach to designing smaller waveguide filters was provided by the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.

A relatively recent technology being used inside hollow-metal-waveguide filters is finline, a kind of planar dielectric waveguide. Finline was first described by Paul Meier in 1972.

<a href="Frequency-division%20multiplexing">Multiplexers</a> were first described by Fano and Lawson in 1948. Pierce was the first to describe multiplexers with contiguous passbands. Multiplexing using directional filters was invented by Seymour Cohn and Frank Coale in the 1950s. Multiplexers with compensating <a href="immittance">immittance</a> resonators at each junction are largely the work of E. G. Cristal and G. L. Matthaei in the 1960s. This technique is still sometimes used, but the modern availability of computing power has led to the more common use of synthesis techniques which can directly produce matching filters without the need for these additional resonators. In 1965 R. J. Wenzel discovered that filters which were singly terminated, rather than the usual doubly terminated, were complementary—exactly what was needed for a diplexer. Wenzel was inspired by the lectures of circuit theorist <a href="Ernst%20Guillemin">Ernst Guillemin</a>.

Multi-channel, multi-octave multiplexers were investigated by Harold Schumacher at Microphase Corporation, and his results were published in 1976. The principle that multiplexer filters may be matched when joined together by modifying the first few elements, thus doing away with the compensating resonators, was discovered accidentally by E. J. Curly around 1968 when he mistuned a diplexer. A formal theory for this was provided by J. D. Rhodes in 1976 and generalised to multiplexers by Rhodes and Ralph Levy in 1979.

From the 1980s, planar technologies, especially microstrip, have tended to replace other technologies used for constructing filters and multiplexers, especially in products aimed at the consumer market. The recent innovation of post-wall waveguide allows waveguide designs to be implemented on a flat substrate with low-cost manufacturing techniques similar to those used for microstrip.

Waveguide filter designs frequently consist of two different components repeated a number of times. Typically, one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor, capacitor, or LC resonant circuit. Often, the filter type will take its name from the style of this component. These components are spaced apart by a second component, a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer. The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance. The net result is a lumped element equivalent circuit of a ladder network. Lumped element filters are commonly <a href="ladder%20topology">ladder topology</a>, and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs. Figure 4 shows such a ladder. Typically, waveguide components are resonators, and the equivalent circuit would be <a href="LC%20circuit">LC resonators</a> instead of the capacitors and inductors shown, but circuits like figure 4 are still used as <a href="prototype%20filter">prototype filter</a>s with the use of a band-pass or band-stop transformation.

Filter performance parameters, such as stopband rejection and rate of transition between passband and stopband, are improved by adding more components and thus increasing the length of the filter. Where the components are repeated identically, the filter is an <a href="image%20parameter%20filter">image parameter filter</a> design, and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements. This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the <a href="waffle-iron%20filter">waffle-iron filter</a>. For designs where the elements are more widely spaced, better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design, such as the common Chebyshev filter and <a href="Butterworth%20filter">Butterworth filter</a>s. In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value, and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions. Furthermore, if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch. In general, there will be no common values between the two instances of the design. Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous, such as satellite applications.

An impedance transformer is a device which makes an impedance at its output <a href="port%20%28circuit%20theory%29">port</a> appear as a different impedance at its input port. In waveguide, this device is simply a short length of waveguide. Especially useful is the <a href="quarter-wave%20impedance%20transformer">quarter-wave impedance transformer</a> which has a length of λ/4. This device can turn <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a>s into <a href="inductance">inductance</a>s and vice versa. It also has the useful property of turning shunt-connected elements into series-connected elements and vice versa. Series-connected elements are otherwise difficult to implement in waveguide.

Many waveguide filter components work by introducing a sudden change, a discontinuity, to the transmission properties of the waveguide. Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point. This arises in the following way: the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction, the ratio of the two being known as the <a href="reflection%20coefficient">reflection coefficient</a>. This is entirely analogous to a <a href="Reflections%20of%20signals%20on%20conducting%20lines">reflection on a transmission line</a> where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection. This impedance must be <a href="electrical%20reactance">reactive</a>, that is, it must be a capacitance or an inductance. It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed—it is all either transmitted onward or reflected. Examples of components with this function include irises, stubs, and posts, all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur.

An impedance step is an example of a device introducing a discontinuity. It is achieved by a step change in the physical dimensions of the waveguide. This results in a step change in the characteristic impedance of the waveguide. The step can be in either the <a href="E-plane">E-plane</a> (change of height) or the <a href="H-plane">H-plane</a> (change of width) of the waveguide.

A basic component of waveguide filters is the <a href="microwave%20cavity">cavity resonator</a>. This consists of a short length of waveguide blocked at both ends. Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected back and forth between the two ends. A given geometry of cavity will <a href="resonance">resonate</a> at a characteristic frequency. The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies. Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure. However, if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal. A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter.

The nomenclature for modes in a cavity introduces a third index, for example TE. The first two indices describe the wave travelling up and down the length of the cavity, that is, they are the transverse mode numbers as for modes in a waveguide. The third index describes the <a href="longitudinal%20mode">longitudinal mode</a> caused by the <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference pattern</a> of the forward travelling and reflected waves. The third index is equal to the number of half wavelengths down the length of the guide. The most common modes used are the dominant modes: TE in rectangular waveguide, and TE in circular waveguide. TE circular mode is used where very low loss (hence high "Q") is required but cannot be used in a dual-mode filter because it is circularly symmetric. Better modes for rectangular waveguide in dual-mode filters are TE and TE. However, even better is the TE circular waveguide mode which can achieve a "Q" of 16,000 at .

Tuning screws are screws inserted into resonant cavities which can be adjusted externally to the waveguide. They provide fine tuning of the <a href="resonant%20frequency">resonant frequency</a> by inserting more, or less thread into the waveguide. Examples can be seen in the post filter of figure 1: each cavity has a tuning screw secured with <a href="jam%20nut">jam nut</a>s and <a href="thread-locking%20compound">thread-locking compound</a>. For screws inserted only a small distance, the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor, increasing in value as the screw is inserted. However, when the screw has been inserted a distance λ/4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit. Inserting it further causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive, that is, the arithmetic sign changes.

An iris is a thin metal plate across the waveguide with one or more holes in it. It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5. An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance, whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance. An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel <a href="LC%20circuit">LC resonant circuit</a>. A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide. Narrowband filters frequently use irises with small holes. These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris. Circular holes are simple to machine, but elongated holes, or holes in the shape of a cross, are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling.

Irises are a form of discontinuity and work by exciting evanescent higher modes. Vertical edges are parallel to the electric field (E field) and excite TE modes. The stored energy in TE modes is predominately in the magnetic field (H field), and consequently the lumped equivalent of this structure is an inductor. Horizontal edges are parallel to the H field and excite TM modes. In this case the stored energy is predominately in the E field and the lumped equivalent is a capacitor.

It is fairly simple to make irises that are mechanically adjustable. A thin plate of metal can be pushed in and out of a narrow slot in the side of the waveguide. The iris construction is sometimes chosen for this ability to make a variable component.

An iris-coupled filter consists of a cascade of impedance transformers in the form of waveguide resonant cavities coupled together by irises. In high power applications capacitive irises are avoided. The reduction in height of the waveguide (the direction of the E field) causes the electric field strength across the gap to increase and arcing (or dielectric breakdown if the waveguide is filled with an insulator) will occur at a lower power than it would otherwise.

Posts are conducting bars, usually circular, fixed internally across the height of the waveguide and are another means of introducing a discontinuity. A thin post has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductor. A row of posts can be viewed as a form of inductive iris.

A post filter consists of several rows of posts across the width of the waveguide which separate the waveguide into resonant cavities as shown in figure 7. Differing numbers of posts can be used in each row to achieve varying values of inductance. An example can be seen in figure 1. The filter operates in the same way as the iris-coupled filter but differs in the method of construction.

A post-wall waveguide, or substrate integrated waveguide, is a more recent format that seeks to combine the advantages of low radiation loss, high "Q", and high power handling of traditional hollow metal pipe waveguide with the small size and ease of manufacture of planar technologies (such as the widely used microstrip format). It consists of an insulated substrate pierced with two rows of conducting posts which stand in for the side walls of the waveguide. The top and bottom of the substrate are covered with conducting sheets making this a similar construction to the <a href="triplate">triplate</a> format. The existing manufacturing techniques of <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a> or <a href="low%20temperature%20co-fired%20ceramic">low temperature co-fired ceramic</a> can be used to make post-wall waveguide circuits. This format naturally lends itself to waveguide post filter designs.

A dual-mode filter is a kind of resonant cavity filter, but in this case each cavity is used to provide two resonators by employing two modes (two polarizations), so halving the volume of the filter for a given order. This improvement in size of the filter is a major advantage in aircraft <a href="avionics">avionics</a> and space applications. High quality filters in these applications can require many cavities which occupy significant space.

Dielectric resonators are pieces of <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a> material inserted into the waveguide. They are usually cylindrical since these can be made without <a href="machining">machining</a> but other shapes have been used. They can be made with a hole through the centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide. There is no field at the centre when the TE circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect. The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide, but usually they are mounted transversally across the width as shown in figure 8. The latter arrangement allows the resonators to be tuned by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator.

When dielectric resonators are made from a high <a href="permittivity">permittivity</a> material, such as one of the <a href="barium%20titanate">barium titanate</a>s, they have an important space saving advantage compared to cavity resonators. However, they are much more prone to spurious modes. In high-power applications, metal layers may be built into the resonators to conduct heat away since dielectric materials tend to have low <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a>.

The resonators can be coupled together with irises or impedance transformers. Alternatively, they can be placed in a stub-like side-housing and coupled through a small aperture.

In insert filters one or more metal sheets are placed longitudinally down the length of the waveguide as shown in figure 9. These sheets have holes punched in them to form resonators. The air dielectric gives these resonators a high "Q". Several parallel inserts may be used in the same length of waveguide. More compact resonators may be achieved with a thin sheet of dielectric material and printed metallisation instead of holes in metal sheets at the cost of a lower resonator "Q".

<a href="Finline">Finline</a> is a different kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation. There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips. Finline is a variation of <a href="slot-waveguide">slot-waveguide</a> but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield. This has the advantage that, like hollow metal waveguide, no power is lost by radiation. Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E-plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters. The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide. Resonators are formed by metallising a pattern on to the dielectric sheet. More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal. This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design. Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths.

It is possible to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes. This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, does not need to be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode. Typically, an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports. In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter. Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points. In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts. These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action. Energy from many different evanescent modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities. However, the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors.

Corrugated-waveguide filters, also called ridged-waveguide filters, consist of a number of ridges, or teeth, that periodically reduce the internal height of the waveguide as shown in figures 10 and 11. They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband, good passband matching, and a wide stopband. They are essentially low-pass designs (above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency), unlike most other forms which are usually band-pass. The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical λ/4 distance between elements of other filter designs. Typically, they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical, but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture. In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of <a href="Constant%20k%20filter%23Derivation">LC half sections</a>. The filter operates in the dominant TE mode, but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present. In particular, there is little stopband attenuation of TE and TE modes.

The waffle-iron filter is a variant of the corrugated-waveguide filter. It has similar properties to that filter with the additional advantage that spurious TE and TE modes are suppressed. In the waffle-iron filter, channels are cut through the ridges longitudinally down the filter. This leaves a matrix of teeth protruding internally from the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide. This pattern of teeth resembles a <a href="waffle%20iron">waffle iron</a>, hence the name of the filter.

A <a href="Stub%20%28electronics%29">stub</a> is a short length of waveguide connected to some point in the filter at one end and short-circuited at the other end. Open-circuited stubs are also theoretically possible, but an implementation in waveguide is not practical because electromagnetic energy would be launched out of the open end of the stub, resulting in high losses. Stubs are a kind of resonator, and the lumped element equivalent is an LC resonant circuit. However, over a narrow band, stubs can be viewed as an impedance transformer. The short-circuit is transformed into either an inductance or a capacitance depending on the stub length.

A waveguide stub filter is made by placing one or more stubs along the length of a waveguide, usually λ/4 apart, as shown in figure 12. The ends of the stubs are blanked off to short-circuit them. When the short-circuited stubs are λ/4 long the filter will be a <a href="band-stop%20filter">band-stop filter</a> and the stubs will have a lumped-element approximate equivalent circuit of parallel resonant circuits connected in series with the line. When the stubs are λ/2 long, the filter will be a <a href="band-pass%20filter">band-pass filter</a>. In this case the lumped-element equivalent is series LC resonant circuits in series with the line.

Absorption filters dissipate the energy in unwanted frequencies internally as heat. This is in contrast to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter. Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source. This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter <a href="spurious%20emission">spurious emission</a>s such as <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a>s or spurious <a href="sideband">sideband</a>s. A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material. Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.

There are many applications of filters whose design objectives are something other than rejection or passing of certain frequencies. Frequently, a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design. However, a <a href="broadband">broadband</a> design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes on the nature of a filter. Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are <a href="impedance%20matching">impedance matching</a> networks, <a href="power%20dividers%20and%20directional%20couplers">directional couplers, power dividers, power combiners</a>, and <a href="diplexer">diplexer</a>s. Other possible applications include <a href="multiplexer">multiplexer</a>s, demultiplexers, <a href="negative-resistance%20amplifier">negative-resistance amplifier</a>s, and <a href="Bessel%20filter">time-delay networks</a>.

A simple method of impedance matching is <a href="stub%20matching">stub matching</a> with a single stub. However, a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency. This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications. To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used, and the structure then takes on the form of a stub filter. The design proceeds as if it were a filter except that a different parameter is optimised. In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection, passband attenuation, steepness of transition, or some compromise between these. In a matching network the parameter optimised is the impedance match. The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth, but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the "structure" of the device.

Stubs are not the only format of filter than can be used. In principle, any filter structure could be applied to impedance matching, but some will result in more practical designs than others. A frequent format used for impedance matching in waveguide is the stepped impedance filter. An example can be seen in the duplexer pictured in figure 13.

Directional couplers, power splitters, and power combiners are all essentially the same type of device, at least when implemented with <a href="Passivity%20%28engineering%29">passive</a> components. A directional coupler splits a small amount of power from the main line to a third port. A more strongly coupled, but otherwise identical, device may be called a power splitter. One that couples exactly half the power to the third port (a coupler) is the maximum coupling achievable without reversing the functions of the ports. Many designs of power splitter can be used in reverse, whereupon they become power combiners.

A simple form of directional coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length. This design is limited because the <a href="electrical%20length">electrical length</a> of the coupler will only be λ/4 at one specific frequency. Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side. Similar to the impedance matching case, this can be improved by using multiple elements, resulting in a filter-like structure. A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the <a href="Bethe-hole%20directional%20coupler">Bethe-hole directional coupler</a> in which two parallel waveguides are stacked on top of each other and a hole provided for coupling. To produce a wideband design, multiple holes are used along the guides as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied. It is not only the coupled-line design that suffers from being narrow band, all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way. For instance the <a href="rat-race%20coupler">rat-race coupler</a> (which can be implemented directly in waveguide) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ.

A diplexer is a device used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands into a single signal. This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer.) The same device can be used to separate the signals again at the far end of the channel. The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the <a href="output%20impedance">output impedance</a> of source B thus causing mismatch. These problems could be overcome with the use of a directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.

Two widely spaced narrowband signals can be diplexed by joining together the outputs of two appropriate band-pass filters. Steps need to be taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance. This can be achieved by appropriate spacing. For instance, if the filters are of the iris-coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed λ/4 from the junction where λ is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B. Likewise, the nearest iris of filter B is placed λ/4 from the junction. This works because when filter A is at resonance, filter B is in its stopband and only loosely coupled and vice versa. An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions. A decoupling resonator is placed λ/4 from the junction of each filter. This can be in the form of a short-circuited stub tuned to the resonant frequency of that filter. This arrangement can be extended to multiplexers with any number of bands.

For diplexers dealing with contiguous passbands proper account of the <a href="crossover%20filter">crossover</a> characteristics of filters needs to be considered in the design. An especially common case of this is where the diplexer is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands. Here a low-pass and a high-pass filter are used instead of band-pass filters. The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to narrowband multiplexers and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators.

A directional filter is a device that combines the functions of a directional coupler and a diplexer. As it is based on a directional coupler it is essentially a four-port device, but like directional couplers, port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally. Power entering port 1 exits port 3 after being subject to some filtering function (usually band-pass). The remaining power exits port 2, and since no power is absorbed or reflected this will be the exact complement of the filtering function at port 2, in this case band-stop. In reverse, power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1, but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4. Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a directional filter. Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE mode provide the four ports. These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE mode. The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response.

Pilot (Supernatural)

"Pilot" is the first episode of the television series "<a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Supernatural</a>". It premiered on <a href="The%20WB">The WB</a> on September 13, 2005, and was written by series creator <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a> and directed by <a href="David%20Nutter">David Nutter</a>. The "Supernatural" <a href="Television%20pilot">pilot</a> introduced the characters of <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam</a> (<a href="Jared%20Padalecki">Jared Padalecki</a>) and <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean Winchester</a> (<a href="Jensen%20Ackles">Jensen Ackles</a>), brothers who travel throughout the country hunting supernatural creatures, as they battled a ghostly <a href="La%20Llorona">Woman in White</a> (<a href="Sarah%20Shahi">Sarah Shahi</a>) while searching for their missing father (<a href="Jeffrey%20Dean%20Morgan">Jeffrey Dean Morgan</a>).

Kripke was developing the concept for ten years before it was greenlit as a television series. Before it could be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, British Columbia, to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend <a href="Christopher%20Lennertz">Christopher Lennertz</a>. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying opinions of the lead actors' performances.

In 1983 in <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence, Kansas</a>, <a href="Mary%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">Mary Winchester</a> (Samantha Smith) investigates a sound coming from her infant son Sam's nursery. She sees a figure standing over his crib, and confronts him. Her husband, <a href="John%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">John</a> (Morgan), is awoken by her screams and finds her pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She bursts into flames, and John is forced to evacuate the house with Sam and his older son, Dean, while the house erupts into flames.

Twenty-two years later, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and his girlfriend <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Jessica%20Moore">Jessica Moore</a> (<a href="Adrianne%20Palicki">Adrianne Palicki</a>) celebrate his high <a href="Law%20School%20Admission%20Test">LSAT</a> score. Later that night, Dean (Jensen Ackles) shows up at Sam's home. Though the brothers have not spoken in years, Dean comes looking for help in finding their father, who disappeared while hunting a supernatural entity. After Sam hears a voicemail from his father that contains <a href="electronic%20voice%20phenomenon">electronic voice phenomenon</a> of a woman saying, "I can never go home," he agrees to help Dean in the search. The brothers head to John's last known whereabouts—the town of Jericho—where he had been investigating the disappearances of young men along a single stretch of road over ten years. Sam and Dean discover a local legend of a murdered girl who has returned as a homicidal, hitchhiking ghost. Research points to Constance Welch (Shahi), who jumped to her death off a nearby bridge after drowning her children. While they stakeout the bridge that night, Sam tells Dean he does not want to return to hunting supernatural creatures. He points out that finding whatever creature killed their mother—a task their father has dedicated his life to—will not bring her back. The two are interrupted by a ghostly woman jumping off the bridge. Sam and Dean later check into a local motel, and discover their father is also renting a room there. They break into it and discover his research scattered all over the room; all his findings point to Constance being a <a href="La%20Llorona">woman in white</a>.

When Dean leaves the room to get food, he is arrested by the police, who believe he is connected to the disappearances. At the police station, they show him John's journal, and he notices the message "Dean 35-111" written inside it. As Dean is interrogated, Sam tracks down Constance's husband (<a href="Steve%20Railsback">Steve Railsback</a>), and learns the locations of both her grave site and the house in which she drowned their children. Sam then fakes a 911 call so Dean can escape the station. However, Constance targets Sam in his car, demanding he take her home. Sam refuses, but she possesses the car so that it drives Sam to her home. Once they arrive at her old house, she attempts to seduce him, but when he resists, she attacks him. Dean forces her to temporarily dissipate by shooting her with rock salt, and Sam uses the opportunity to crash the car into the house. Constance reappears and attacks them, but the spirits of her children confront her. They embrace their mother, causing her to scream in pain as demonic like beings spawn from under her, dragging her down through the floor.

Dean deduces John's message was coordinates to where he has headed. Sam still does not want to join the search, so Dean drops him off at his apartment. Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt to put out the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.

Series creator <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a> had previously written for the <a href="The%20WB">WB</a> series "<a href="Tarzan%20%282003%20TV%20series%29">Tarzan</a>", and was offered the chance to pitch show ideas to the network. He used the opportunity for "Supernatural", a concept he had been developing for nearly ten years. Kripke envisioned "Supernatural" as a road trip series, deeming it the "best vehicle to tell these stories because it's pure, stripped down and uniquely American... These stories exist in these small towns all across the country, and it just makes so much sense to drive in and out of these stories." Though the network rejected his initial pitch—a <a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> reporter investigates supernatural occurrences throughout the country—they were still interested in a series featuring urban legends. Kripke quickly suggested a "<a href="Route%2066%20%28TV%20series%29">Route 66</a>"-style series, and the network loved it. Filming was greenlit after director <a href="David%20Nutter">David Nutter</a>, who previously had worked with Kripke on "Tarzan", signed on.

The pilot stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, whom Kripke likened to <a href="Luke%20Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> and <a href="Han%20Solo">Han Solo</a> of "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>". Padalecki knew executive producers <a href="McG">McG</a> and Nutter, the former convincing him to audition for the role. He was excited to play "the reluctant hero", and compared Sam to "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>"'s <a href="Neo%20%28The%20Matrix%29">Neo</a>. However, Nutter also asked Ackles to audition for the role of Sam. Nutter and Kripke found themselves in a predicament, as they felt both actors were great as Sam. To remedy the situation, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> president <a href="Peter%20Roth%20%28executive%29">Peter Roth</a> suggested Ackles instead audition for Dean. Kripke agreed, believing Ackles' "smart-ass attitude" made him "born to play" the <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a>-like character, and Ackles preferred the character of Dean after reading the script. Both actors were the only ones to audition, and network executives instantly noticed a brotherly chemistry between them. "<a href="The%20Evil%20Dead%20%28franchise%29">Evil Dead</a>"-actor <a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a> was Kripke's first choice to portray <a href="John%20Winchester%20%28Supernatural%29">John Winchester</a>, father of Sam and Dean. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan eventually received the role. With Morgan's scene taking place 22 years before the series, he expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes, and was surprised when he was later asked to reprise the role.

For the role of Constance Welch—the Woman in White—production set out to find the "perfect actress". Nutter, a fan of "<a href="The%20L%20Word">The L Word</a>", had watched an episode featuring actress <a href="Sarah%20Shahi">Sarah Shahi</a> one night during the casting process. He felt she was "really sharp" and a "fine actress", with a "seductive quality about her". Surprised when she came in to audition the following day, he knew she "had the job when she walked in the door". Because the scene involving Constance's husband Joseph Welch merely discusses Constance's backstory, the scene hinged on the actors' performances. Seeking a "great actor", Nutter recalled his previous experience working with <a href="Steve%20Railsback">Steve Railsback</a>, and offered him the role. Other guest stars include Adrianne Palicki as Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore, and Samantha Smith as Mary Winchester. The latter felt she landed the part due to her joking around with Nutter during the audition.

The episode was written by series creator Eric Kripke, who described its creation as a "very difficult, birthing process" due to the numerous rewrites required. The original version did not feature the Woman in White, and John Winchester died in the teaser. In the revised script, Sam and Dean Winchester were raised by their aunt and uncle instead of their father. Because of this, Sam is unaware that supernatural beings exist, and Dean must convince him of the truth when he asks for help. Kripke realized this made the backstory too complicated, and reworked it with co-executive producer Peter Johnson so that their father raised them to be hunters like him. This decision granted the brothers proficiency in both fighting and swindling people. Other revised concepts included Sam believing Dean to be a serial killer who murdered their father, and John dying instead of Sam's girlfriend Jessica. The scene in which the brothers discuss their childhood and delve into their backstory was rewritten 20 to 30 times, and the final version was heavily trimmed.

A gas-station scene within the episode was meant to establish what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card scams, and classic rock; Kripke feared that it would be cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the <a href="vanishing%20hitchhiker">vanishing hitchhiker</a>, but combined it with the Mexican legend of <a href="La%20Llorona">La Llorona</a> to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.

Originally, the studio did not want Kripke to kill Jessica at the episode's end, but rather keep her as a recurring character in the series. Kripke felt this would not fit the series's format, and decided to have her revealed as a demon, with the revelation prompting Sam to join Dean in hunting. However, with only a short amount of screentime available to depict this, Kripke believed it would be a "tough aspect to sell". Because Luke Skywalker only begins his journey after the deaths of his aunt and uncle, Kripke found it more appropriate for Sam's motivation to be Jessica's death. Thus, the character is killed in the same manner as Sam's mother, making the deaths the "right bookends".

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> for the pilot took place in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, though subsequent episodes of the series are filmed in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> to save money. The bridge sequences were shot at <a href="Lake%20Piru">Lake Piru</a>, near a "<a href="War%20of%20the%20Worlds%20%282005%20film%29">War of the Worlds</a>" filming location, and the library and phone booth scenes were filmed at an elementary school. Triplet babies portrayed Sam in the episode's teaser, and production found it difficult to get them to cry on cue. Though a real house served as the first-story level in the teaser, the upstairs was constructed on a <a href="sound%20stage">sound stage</a> because of the special effects required for Mary's fiery death. Script rewrites for the opening sequence—a better introduction for Sam was needed—required reshoots on the set of "<a href="The%20O.C.">The O.C.</a>" two months after principal photography.

To depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Businesses, such as visual effects company Entity FX, were contracted for production of the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver and required a new crew that works exclusively for the show. Mary Winchester's death scene, which had the character pinned to the ceiling and burning to death, required actress Samantha Smith to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a fake body the crew named "Christina" was made out of wire and <a href="papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">papier-mâché</a>, and was then ignited on a fake ceiling. However, the room quickly caught fire, forcing an evacuation. <a href="Chroma%20key">Green screen</a> coincided with the visual effects for the ghostly Woman in White, and executive producer <a href="McG">McG</a> chose to make the imagery of her death sequence an homage to <a href="Chris%20Cunningham">Chris Cunningham</a>'s <a href="Aphex%20Twin">Aphex Twin</a> video "<a href="Windowlicker%23Music%20video">Windowlicker</a>". <a href="J-Horror">Japanese horror</a> also influenced the scene, such as the school uniforms worn by the ghost children, the water cascading down the stairs, and the "<a href="Dark%20Water%20%282002%20film%29">Dark Water</a>" elements.

The episode's synthesized orchestral score was written by <a href="Christopher%20Lennertz">Christopher Lennertz</a>, Kripke's friend and next-door neighbor. The two attended <a href="USC%20School%20of%20Cinematic%20Arts">USC School of Cinematic Arts</a> together, and worked together on various projects afterwards. Lennertz described "Supernatural" as "one of those dream situations where you get to work with someone who you admire, but also have a relationship with already", and noted he and Kripke "were already on the same page without even talking about [the series' music]".

For the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths at the hands of the demon <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a>, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a "really nasty" sounding echo effect. He would later reuse this theme in the season one episode "Nightmare". The episode also included a number of rock songs, which would become a tradition for the series. Kripke wanted to feature the song "<a href="Enter%20Sandman">Enter Sandman</a>", but <a href="Metallica">Metallica</a> would not grant permission.

In its original broadcast, the pilot was viewed by an estimated 5.69 million viewers. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Diana Steenbergen of <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, who was "hooked right away", gave the pilot episode a score of 8.5 out of 10. She felt it began "heartbreakingly", and the "genuinely scary" death scenes of Mary and Jess "will haunt...the viewers". Steenbergen praised both the writers and the lead actors for making the "[exposition scenes] still feel natural, for the most part", and noted Ackles and Padalecki were "instantly convincing as brothers". Also credited for this "well paced" episode was director David Nutter, who did an "excellent job of setting up the atmosphere and tone of the series". Likewise, <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a>'s Don Williams posited, "It's about as good as a pilot can get." He ranked it ninth out of his favorite episodes of the first three seasons, believing it introduces the characters "in a memorable fashion" and "wonderfully" establishes the show's universe. Robert Bianco of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" deemed the series as possibly "the simplest and the scariest" of the season's new dark shows, and wrote, "It wants nothing more than to frighten you — and tonight, it does." He noted the episode "[pulls] off a few surprises" and "works its way to an ending that lives up to Dean's 'no chick-flick moments'". However, Bianco criticized the "pauses for comic relief"; he felt Ackles' "comic touch" was "not yet as skillful as it needs to be", with Ackles' attempts at being "humorously annoying" leaving him "simply annoying". Despite the episode having a somewhat unoriginal villain and a "relatively simple" solution, Brian Lowry of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" deemed the series' debut as "a promising plunge into the darkness". Lowry applauded Ackles, who "brings an easygoing charm and engaging wise-ass personality to the absurd notion of traveling the country with a trunk full of wooden stakes and holy water".

Alessandra Stanley of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" found the first half of the episode "quite effective", with the "camera angles, spooky music and jumpy sequences...[being] as frightening as those found in any horror movie, with an added twist of suspense". However, she deemed the depiction of the ghostly villain as "pretty silly", and noted the second half "stops building suspense and turns predictable". Calling the series "Ghostbusters' Creek", Stanley felt the episode "reverts to a WB family drama about the bonds between two mismatched brothers and their father". Similarly, Matthew Gilbert of the "Boston Globe" called Ackles and Padalecki "generic cuties who hold their lips together tightly, except to utter the word Dude". Although Gilbert noted there are a couple "moderately creepy" twists, he found there to be "nothing about the central family story in "Supernatural" or its bland actors that makes it addictive".

Work on the pilot episode garnered two <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> nominations in 2006. Lennertz was nominated in the category of "Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)", and the sound editors for "Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series".

1968 Illinois earthquake

The 1968 Illinois earthquake (a "New Madrid event") was the largest recorded earthquake in the U.S. <a href="Midwestern">Midwestern</a> state of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Striking at 11:02 a.m. on November 9, it measured 5.4 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter scale</a>. Although there were no fatalities, the event caused considerable structural damage to buildings, including the toppling of chimneys and shaking in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, the region's largest city. The earthquake was one of the most widely felt in U.S. history, affecting 23 states over an area of . In studying its cause, scientists discovered the <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Illinois%23Cottage%20Grove%20Fault%20System">Cottage Grove Fault</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Illinois">Southern Illinois</a> <a href="Geology%20of%20Illinois%23Illinois%20Basin">Basin</a>.

Within the region, millions felt the rupture. Reactions to the earthquake varied: some people near the epicenter did not react to the shaking, while others panicked. A future earthquake in the region is extremely likely; in 2005, seismologists and geologists estimated a 90% chance of a magnitude 6–7 tremor before 2055, likely originating in the <a href="Wabash%20Valley%20Seismic%20Zone">Wabash Valley seismic zone</a> on the Illinois–Indiana border or the <a href="New%20Madrid%20fault%20zone">New Madrid fault zone</a>.

The first recorded Illinois earthquake is from 1795, when a small earthquake shook the frontier settlement of <a href="Kaskaskia%2C%20Illinois">Kaskaskia</a>. Data from large earthquakes—in May and July 1909, and November 1968—suggest that earthquakes in the area are of moderate magnitude but can be felt over a large geographical area, largely because of the lack of fault lines. The May 1909 <a href="Aurora%2C%20Illinois">Aurora</a> earthquake affected people in an area of ; the 1968 Illinois earthquake was felt by those living in an area of about . Contradicting the idea that the region's earthquakes are felt over a wide area, a 1965 shock was only noticed near <a href="Tamms%2C%20Illinois">Tamms</a>, even though it had the same intensity level (VII) as those of 1909 and 1968. Before 1968, earthquakes had been recorded in 1838, 1857, 1876, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1887, 1891, 1903, 1905, 1912, 1917, 1922, 1934, 1939, 1947, 1953, 1955, and 1958. Since 1968, other earthquakes have occurred in the same region in 1972, 1974, 1984, and <a href="2008%20Illinois%20earthquake">2008</a>.

The quake struck on Saturday, November 9, 1968, at 11:02 a.m. The quake's <a href="epicenter">epicenter</a> was slightly northwest of <a href="Broughton%2C%20Illinois">Broughton</a> in <a href="Hamilton%20County%2C%20Illinois">Hamilton County</a>, and close to the Illinois–Indiana border, about east of <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. Surrounding the epicenter were several small towns built on flat <a href="glacial%20lake">glacial lake plains</a> and low hills. Scientists described the rupture as "strong". During the quake, <a href="surface%20wave%20magnitude">surface wave</a> and <a href="body%20wave%20magnitude">body wave</a> magnitudes were measured at 5.2 and 5.54 respectively. The magnitude of the quake reached 5.4 on the <a href="Richter%20scale">Richter scale</a>. The earthquake occurred at a depth of .

A <a href="focal%20mechanism">fault plane solution</a> for the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes (one is always a <a href="fault%20plane">fault plane</a>, the other an auxiliary plane) striking north–south and dipping approximately 45 degrees to the east and to the west. This faulting suggests <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Dip-slip%20faults">dip slip reverse motion</a> and a horizontal east–west axis of confining stress. At the time of the earthquake, no faults were known in the immediate epicentral region (see below), but the motion corresponded to movement along the <a href="Wabash%20Valley%20Fault%20System">Wabash Valley Fault System</a> roughly east of the region. The rupture also partly occurred on the <a href="New%20Madrid%20Fault">New Madrid Fault</a>, responsible for the great <a href="1812%20New%20Madrid%20earthquake">New Madrid earthquakes</a> in 1812. The New Madrid tremors were the most powerful earthquakes to hit the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>.

Various theories were put forward for the cause of the rupture. Donald Roll, director of seismology at <a href="Loyola%20University%20Chicago">Loyola University Chicago</a>, proposed that the quake was caused by massive amounts of <a href="silt">silt</a> being deposited by rivers, generating a "seesaw" effect on the plates beneath. "The weight of the silt depressed one end of the block and tipped up the other," he said. However, scientists eventually realized the cause was a then-unknown fault, the <a href="Cottage%20Grove%20Fault">Cottage Grove Fault</a>, a small tear in the Earth's rock in the Southern Illinois Basin near the city of <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Illinois">Harrisburg, Illinois</a>.

The fault, which is aligned east–west, is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed <a href="monocline">monocline</a>s, <a href="anticline">anticline</a>s, and <a href="syncline">syncline</a>s, all of which suggest deformation during the <a href="Paleozoic%20era">Paleozoic era</a>, when <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Strike-slip%20faults">strike-slip faulting</a> took place nearby. The fault runs along an ancient <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> <a href="terrane">terrane</a> boundary. It was active mainly in the <a href="Late%20Pennsylvanian">Late Pennsylvanian</a> and <a href="Early%20Permian">Early Permian</a> epochs around 300 million years ago.

The earthquake was felt in 23 states and affected a zone of . The shaking extended east to Pennsylvania and West Virginia, south to Mississippi and Alabama, north to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Ontario, Canada, and west to Oklahoma. Isolated reports were received from <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, southern <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, Arkansas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas, Ohio, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Missouri, West Virginia, Alabama, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, presumably because of shaking. The worst affected areas were in the general area of <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville, Indiana</a>, St. Louis, and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, but there was no major damage. There were no deaths; the worst injury was a child knocked unconscious by falling debris outside his home.

Damage was confined to Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and south-central Iowa, and largely consisted of fallen chimneys, foundation cracks, collapsed <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s, and overturned tombstones. In one home in <a href="Dale%2C%20Illinois">Dale, Illinois</a>, near <a href="Tuckers%20Corners%2C%20Illinois">Tuckers Corners</a> and southwest of <a href="McLeansboro%2C%20Illinois">McLeansboro</a>, the quake cracked interior walls, plaster, and chimneys. Using a type of <a href="victim%20study">victim study</a>, the local post office surveyed residents and implemented a field inspection which indicated the strongest shaking (<a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">MM VII</a>) took place in the <a href="Wabash%20Valley">Wabash Valley</a>, <a href="Ohio%20Valley">Ohio Valley</a>, and other nearby south-central Illinois lowlands. Outside this four-state zone, oscillating objects including cars, chimneys, and the <a href="Gateway%20Arch">Gateway Arch</a> were reported to authorities.

McLeansboro in particular experienced minor damage over an extensive area. Its local high school reported 19 broken windows in the girls' gymnasium, along with cracked plaster walls. Most of the high school's classrooms sustained fractured walls. The <a href="facade">facade</a> of the town's First United Methodist Church was damaged, and a brick and concrete block fell off the top. The Hamilton County Courthouse withstood several structural cracks, including one on the ceiling above the judge's seat. The town's residents also reported collapsing chimneys; three chimneys toppled at one home, leading to further damage.

Most of the buildings that experienced chimney damage were 30 to 50 years old. The City Building in <a href="Henderson%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson, Kentucky</a>, east-southeast of the epicenter, sustained considerable structural damage. Moderate damage—including broken chimneys and fractured walls—occurred in towns in south-central Illinois, southwest Indiana, and northwest Kentucky. For instance, a concrete-brick <a href="cistern">cistern</a> caved in west of Dale.

In Lineville, Iowa, about south of Des Moines on the Missouri border, the quake was felt as a long shaking. The quake damaged the town's water tower which began to leak of water an hour.

Donald Roll correctly predicted the earthquake would have no aftershocks. He later said, "That was kind of a safety valve. The pressure which has been built up has been released." He also described the earthquake as "a very rare occurrence".

Millions in the area experienced the earthquake, the first major seismic event in decades. Following the tremor, businesses in the area emptied. Many residents did not believe that the earthquake was over magnitude 5. Others did not realize an earthquake was taking place, for example, some residents thought their furnaces had exploded, and one man thought that the shaking was caused by his son "jumping up and down". At the Suntone Factory in McLeansboro, from the epicenter, workers rushed out of the building, thinking a <a href="water%20tank">water tank</a> inside had fallen.

People's reactions varied: some described themselves as "shocked"; others admitted to being "shaky" or nervous for the rest of the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The <a href="Window%20blind%23Venetian">Venetian shades</a> began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." People in the community of <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20Illinois">Mount Vernon, Illinois</a>, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was "in a car ... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".

In 2005, scientists determined there was a 90% probability of a magnitude 6–7 earthquake in the New Madrid area during the next 50 years. This could cause potentially high damage in the <a href="Chicago%20metropolitan%20area">Chicago metropolitan area</a> which has a population near ten million people. Pressure on the fault where the 1811–1812 Madrid earthquakes occurred was believed to be increasing, but a later study by Eric Calais of <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a> and other experts concluded the land adjacent to the New Madrid fault was moving less than a year, increasing the span between expected earthquakes on the fault to 500–1,000 years. Scientists anticipating a future earthquake suggest the <a href="Wabash%20Valley%20Seismic%20Zone">Wabash Valley Fault</a> as a possible source, calling it "dangerous".

Douglas Wiens, a professor of earth and planetary sciences, reported: "The strongest earthquakes in the last few years have come from the Wabash Valley Fault", and said the fault needs more scientific observation. Steven Obermeir of the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> is one of several scientists who have found sediments suggesting Wabash Valley Fault earthquakes around magnitude 7 on the Richter scale. Michael Wyssession, an associate professor of earth and planetary sciences, denigrated the Madrid fault zone and said, "in 20 years there have been three magnitude 5 or better earthquakes on the Wabash Valley Fault. There is evidence that sometime in the past the Wabash Valley Fault has produced as strong as magnitude 7 earthquakes. On the other hand, the New Madrid Fault has been very quiet for a long time now. Clearly, the Wabash Valley Fault has gotten our deserved attention."

<doc id="25054295" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25054295" title="John Edward Brownlee as Attorney-General of Alberta">
John Edward Brownlee as Attorney-General of Alberta

<a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee">John Edward Brownlee</a> served as <a href="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a> of the province of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> in western Canada from 1921 until 1926, in the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA) government of <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>. As Brownlee was the only lawyer in a caucus formed almost entirely of farmers, his role extended beyond the traditional expectations of an attorney-general, and ranged from providing legal advice to explaining how to write a business letter; he also became the government's de facto leader in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>.

UFA members held widely disparate political views, and Brownlee quickly became identified with the government's conservative faction. He opposed radical changes to the structure of government and urged thrift in public spending. As part of the government's attempts to balance its budget, Brownlee favoured selling its money-losing railways and concluding an agreement with the federal government to give Alberta control over its natural resources; he was unsuccessful at both while Attorney-General. As a member of a farmers' government, he was also involved in attempts to alleviate drought-induced poverty in southern Alberta and in investigations into the establishment of a provincial <a href="wheat%20pool">wheat pool</a>.

UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) began to see Brownlee as a better leader than the indecisive Greenfield. A group of them attempted to force Greenfield to resign in Brownlee's favour. Though Brownlee opposed these attempts, initially threatening to resign if Greenfield did, he was eventually persuaded to accept the premiership if Greenfield willingly relinquished it. Brownlee became premier November 23, 1925.

Brownlee began his legal career in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, and the UFA was one of his firm's major clients. One of the projects he undertook for it was the creation of the <a href="United%20Grain%20Growers">United Grain Growers</a> (UGG), of whose securities division he became general manager in 1919. He also travelled around Alberta with UFA president <a href="Henry%20Wise%20Wood">Henry Wise Wood</a> answering UFA members' legal questions while Wood spoke to them about politics and the farmers' movement. Though Brownlee was not initially interested in the UFA's political activities, this changed through his association with Wood and <a href="Progressive%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressive Party of Canada</a> leader <a href="Thomas%20Crerar">Thomas Crerar</a>.

Until 1919, the UFA's political activities were limited to advocacy, but that year it decided to run candidates in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">1921 provincial election</a>. Despite Brownlee's burgeoning interest in politics, he did not view himself as part of the UFA's political branch, and did not run as a candidate; indeed, he was on vacation in <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria, British Columbia</a>, for most of the campaign.

The UFA contested the election without a leader, so when it won 38 of the 61 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta it did not know who it would recommend to form a government as <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a>. Wood was not interested and suggested that Brownlee should take the position, to the latter's astonishment. Brownlee did not believe that, as an urbanite and lawyer, he would be acceptable to the rural UFA caucus, and declined; the position went to <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>.

Though the UFA <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly">MLA</a>s were not willing to accept a non-farmer as premier, many of them realized that the post of Attorney-General should go to a lawyer. Others were less convinced, and Brownlee was invited to address the UFA caucus. He acknowledged that there was no constitutional requirement on the question, but advised that a non-lawyer attorney-general would be wholly reliant on the advice of the lawyers on his staff. With the caucus convinced, Greenfield asked Brownlee to accept the position. Brownlee demurred, reluctant to take the resulting cut in income, not eager to leave his family in Calgary to work in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> (the provincial capital), and leery of the high expectations invested in the new government by the province's farmers. Ultimately, a combination of duty, loyalty, and ambition convinced him to accept the position. Though the choice of cabinet ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier, as part of the UFA's agenda of democratic reform Greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting. Brownlee was approved August 11, 1921, and was sworn in two days later.

Neither he nor Greenfield had run as a candidate in the election, and neither was a member of the legislature. <a href="Percival%20Baker">Percival Baker</a>, the UFA member elected for <a href="Ponoka%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Ponoka</a>, had died on election day, opening up a seat for one of them. A second seat, <a href="Peace%20River%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Peace River</a>, became available when incumbent <a href="Donald%20MacBeth%20Kennedy">Donald MacBeth Kennedy</a> resigned to run in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201921">1921 federal election</a>. Greenfield seemed a more reasonable candidate for that rugged northern <a href="riding%20%28country%20subdivision%29">riding</a> than the urban lawyer Brownlee, and so Brownlee was <a href="Acclamation">acclaimed</a> as Ponoka's MLA December 9, 1921.

Brownlee was the only lawyer in a government composed primarily of farmers, and the rest of the cabinet drew heavily on his expertise. Its reliance on him extended beyond legal issues to such matters as how to write a business letter. Greenfield was among the most dependent, and forwarded most controversial issues to his attorney-general for a draft response; Greenfield often signed the draft and sent it out unchanged. The premier eventually relied on Brownlee so heavily that Brownlee set the agenda for cabinet meetings. The government also relied on Brownlee in the legislature, where it found itself under relentless attack from the <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a>-led <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberals</a>. Brownlee had the widest debating experience of the UFA members, and he was increasingly called upon to counter these attacks. His maiden speech was typical of him: "I came into this House with considerable trepidation, because I knew that sitting opposite would be the former giants of this House, men with ability, experience, and skill. Since coming in I've listened to all these men—giving their best—and now I blush at my own modesty."

When Greenfield was asked a difficult question in the legislature, he often leaned over to Brownlee, his seatmate, who supplied him with an answer in full view of the legislature. Many UFA members found this practice humiliating. Brownlee's importance to the government in the legislature was illustrated by an incident in 1922. Brownlee was on vacation in Victoria during a special sitting of the legislature. While his presence was usually considered crucial, the only item of business scheduled for the session was uncontroversial, and passed by a large margin. However, once this item was dispensed with, some members complained that the <a href="C%24">C$</a>100 payment that they were to receive for the special session was too low. Greenfield brought a motion to double it; the amount was increased to $250 in committee. At a time when many farmers earned less than $250 per year, the move cost the UFA dearly in the eyes of its supporters. Many UFA MLAs privately suggested that the incident would have been avoided had Brownlee been present. On another occasion, in 1924, Brownlee was absent from the legislature due to illness. Boyle called him to assure him that he could rest easy, since the Liberals would not raise any difficult issues in his absence. While Brownlee appreciated the gesture, all involved recognized it as an admission that the government was helpless in the legislature without its strongman.

Brownlee's work as an MLA extended beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from his constituents, especially those alleging improper treatment at <a href="Ponoka%2C%20Alberta">Ponoka</a>'s psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.

Many of the elected UFA members espoused radical political doctrines calculated to transform the provincial government. Brownlee quickly became identified with the caucus's conservative faction. At the caucus meeting that approved his appointment, he put an end to discussion of whether nominations for <a href="justices%20of%20the%20peace">justices of the peace</a> should come from UFA locals or its central political committee by asserting that they would continue to be handled by the office of the Attorney-General. Later, many UFA MLAs argued that only motions explicitly declaring a lack of confidence in the government should be treated as <a href="motions%20of%20non-confidence">motions of non-confidence</a>. They were concerned that supporters of the government who nonetheless disagreed with it on a specific issue might be pressured to refrain from voting their consciences on motions, such as <a href="money%20bill">money bill</a>s, that were conventionally considered tests of the government's confidence. Brownlee warned these MLAs that regardless of their beliefs, the <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20of%20Alberta">Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta</a> was free to request the government's resignation any time he considered that it lacked or did not merit the legislature's confidence. Despite this warning, UFA MLAs <a href="John%20Russell%20Love">John Russell Love</a> and <a href="Alex%20Moore%20%28politician%29">Alex Moore</a> proposed a resolution in the legislature changing the convention. The proposal attracted notice from across Canada; <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> advised Brownlee, his former clerk, to warn Moore and Love that it was unconstitutional and demand that they withdraw it. Brownlee was reluctant to do so, since a similar proposal had been part of the UFA's election platform, and instead moved successful amendments weakening the motion to a vague "statement of intent".

Brownlee clashed again with the UFA's radical elements on the question of a provincial bank. The writings of <a href="C.%20H.%20Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a> advocating an economic system that he called <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a> were attracting notice in Alberta, and his adherents included many UFA members. Led by <a href="George%20Bevington">George Bevington</a>, they sponsored a resolution at the UFA convention in January 1923 calling for the creation of a government-owned bank. After Bevington's introduction, support for the resolution was running high; Brownlee cooled enthusiasm with a speech of his own warning delegates that Alberta's debt load could not manage the programs that Bevington proposed that a provincial bank should undertake. Even so, the convention passed a resolution calling on the provincial government to apply for a bank charter from the federal government, which was responsible for banking under the <a href="British%20North%20America%20Act%2C%201867">British North America Act, 1867</a>. At Brownlee's recommendation, the Greenfield government struck a commission under the leadership of <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> economist D. A. MacGibbon, which strongly recommended against the establishment of a provincial bank. This mirrored Brownlee's own conclusion, reached after investigating state-run banks in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. At the 1924 UFA convention, Bevington and his followers reaffirmed their demands; Brownlee responded by pointing to the findings of the MacGibbon commission and to his contention that the proposal was unconstitutional and would bankrupt the province. In this he was supported by Henry Wise Wood, whom Bevington was challenging for the UFA presidency. Brownlee proposed instead that the government's treasury branches should begin to accept deposits.

Brownlee also advocated a conservative approach on budgetary issues. The UFA government inherited a large budget <a href="Government%20budget%20deficit">deficit</a>, and Brownlee was dissatisfied with Greenfield's early efforts at reducing it. In 1922, he warned the premier that unless the government sharply cut expenditures, he would find it difficult to defend its fiscal policy in that year's session of the legislature. In 1924, unsatisfied with Greenfield's response, he made an example of his own department, cutting staff and taking a strict approach to spending. In 1923, he found an ally for his position in new provincial treasurer <a href="Richard%20Gavin%20Reid">Richard Gavin Reid</a>, who impressed on his cabinet colleagues the need for thrift and recommended the creation of a purchasing department for coordinating government expenditures.

The province's poor financial situation was due in part to its $5 million annual expenditure on railways, comprising 37 percent of the 1922 budget. These expenditures resulted from the collapse of four small-railroad syndicates, which left the government to finance the rail construction. Brownlee believed that these lines, the largest of which was the <a href="Edmonton%2C%20Dunvegan%20and%20British%20Columbia">Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia</a> (ED&BC) line, should be sold to either the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> or the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>. Though neither was interested in purchasing the lines, in 1925 both expressed an interest in leasing the ED&BC. However, the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Canada">Royal Bank of Canada</a>, which held the mortgage on the ED&BC, refused to consent to any lease arrangement unless the Alberta government redeemed its stock in the railway as security for the mortgage. Brownlee was inclined to agree with Minister of Railways <a href="Vernor%20Smith">Vernor Smith</a> that the government should buy the mortgage from the Royal Bank and become the owner and operator of the line, but Greenfield was resistant to this approach and resolution of the railways question had to wait until Brownlee was premier.

Brownlee was also active on natural resource issues. Alberta, along with <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> and <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, had been admitted into <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Confederation</a> without being granted the control over its natural resources that the older provinces enjoyed over theirs. While the federal government did provide a compensatory grant in lieu of resource rights, Alberta sought control over the resources not only because it believed that this would yield higher revenues than the grant, but out of sheer pride. In 1920, Prime Minister <a href="Arthur%20Meighen">Arthur Meighen</a> committed the federal government in principle to transferring resource rights; all that remained to discuss were the terms. Alberta, while willing to forgo the annual subsidy, wanted compensation for some of the land and resources previously awarded by the federal government to private interests, including of land granted to eastern railway companies, mineral leases that deprived the government of royalties for more than half of the of <a href="coal">coal</a> extracted from Alberta annually, and assorted areas with <a href="hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> potential that had been yielded to private companies.

Brownlee became the province's chief negotiator on resource questions in October 1921. Though early attempts at reaching agreement were hampered by the unwillingness of the <a href="Maritimes">Maritime provinces</a> to agree to the necessary constitutional amendments unless their own annual subsidies were increased, negotiations between the provincial and federal government continued intermittently throughout the 1920s. <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a> Prime Minister <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> occasionally appeared receptive to Alberta's demands, but never fully agreed to them. A possible explanation for this is found in a 1924 letter from Alberta Liberal Party leader John R. Boyle to King, explaining that the UFA was likely to lose the next provincial election to Boyle's Liberals "unless something extraordinary happens. That extraordinary thing which Greenfield wants to happen now is obtaining from you the natural resources at once." Despite this letter, the sides seemed close to agreement in early 1925: at a January conference Alberta accepted in principle a federal offer of three years of continuing subsidy after the transfer of resource rights. After an exhaustive series of meetings between Brownlee and the federal counsel, the agreement went back to the governments for approval. As Greenfield and Brownlee expressed their impatience with federal inaction, an intergovernmental meeting was convened in May. The meeting proceeded at a leisurely pace into June, after which King announced that his cabinet would like the summer to consider the agreement in greater detail. The Albertans returned home in disgust.

The consequences of continued control of Alberta's resources by the federal government extended beyond the merely financial. As Alberta's smaller towns and rural areas were being connected to the <a href="electrical%20grid">electrical grid</a>, <a href="Calgary%20Power">Calgary Power</a> made an application to the federal government for hydroelectric rights on the upper <a href="Bow%20River">Bow River</a>. Not wanting these rights to fall into private hands, Brownlee made an application of his own on behalf of the Alberta government. It was denied by <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Charles Stewart</a>, federal Minister of the Interior and the Premier of Alberta whom the UFA had defeated in 1921.

In 1924, the UFA government passed the "Mineral Tax Act", which taxed mineral rightsholders at a rate of three cents per acre. The two largest such rightsholders, the Canadian Pacific Railway and the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, urged the federal government to use its power of <a href="disallowance">disallowance</a> to put a stop to the legislation. When the federal government complied, Brownlee protested its action on three grounds: first, as a <a href="direct%20tax">direct tax</a> the proposed levy was within Alberta's rights under section 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and it was constitutional convention for the federal government to exercise disallowance only when the impugned legislation was clearly unconstitutional. Second, disallowance allowed the province no recourse to the courts, where the constitutionality of the legislation could be tested. Third, the federal government's stated reasons for disallowing the legislation, which were released belatedly by justice minister <a href="Ernest%20Lapointe">Ernest Lapointe</a>, were (according to Brownlee) erroneous and led Brownlee to suggest that Lapointe, a <a href="Quebec">Québécois</a> lawyer trained in the <a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> tradition of his home province rather than the <a href="common%20law">common law</a> system used in the rest of Canada, must be unfamiliar with the land-holding system outside of Quebec. Brownlee's attacks were rejected, and the disallowance stood.

The UFA took office at a time of <a href="drought">drought</a> in the southern regions of the province. At Brownlee's instigation, the government appointed a three-person panel, led by <a href="Charles%20Alexander%20Magrath">Charles Alexander Magrath</a>, to investigate the problem. In 1922 the government passed the "Drought Relief Act". The Act, a Brownlee brainchild, created a Drought Relief Commissioner to whom farmers in affected areas could turn for financial counselling and asset administration. It authorized the adjustment of farmers' debts to levels that were within the debtors' means, but still sufficiently acceptable to creditors that their willingness to make loans would not disappear altogether. Brownlee hoped that this system would provide affected farmers with sound financial advice and facilitate the fair division of farmers' assets among competing creditors without forcing farmers to pay high legal fees. In 1923 this was replaced by the "Debt Adjustment Act", which strengthened the commissioner's powers and was intended to extend his jurisdiction over the entire province; due to opposition from lenders, the portions of the act dealing with other than drought-stricken areas were never <a href="proclamation">proclaimed</a>.

The name change of the legislation reflected Brownlee's growing belief that farmers' financial troubles were due to factors more systemic than lack of rain. Angry over the federal government's decision to allow the first incarnation of the <a href="Canadian%20Wheat%20Board">Canadian Wheat Board</a> (CWB) to lapse, many Albertan farmers began to advocate the "pooling" of their wheat, which would render individual farmers less susceptible to the machinations of grain <a href="speculator">speculator</a>s by introducing collective marketing, with each farmer receiving an averaged, identical price. Farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were more adamant about the return of the CWB; Prime Minister King eventually agreed to its re-creation, provided that at least two of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba passed enabling legislation and found the personnel necessary to sit on the Board. By June 1923, the provinces had not found anybody suitable. Interest in pooling experienced a resurgence. In July, a UFA meeting, which Brownlee attended as the government's representative, endorsed the creation of a wheat pool as soon as practicable. Brownlee and his cabinet colleague Richard Gavin Reid undertook an investigation of how soon this might be, which included a trip to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> to meet with <a href="Aaron%20Sapiro">Aaron Sapiro</a>, an American agricultural cooperative leader. Sapiro proclaimed that a wheat pool could be organized in a few weeks, though both Brownlee and Reid disagreed and returned to Canada committed to caution. However, in their absence the "<a href="Edmonton%20Journal">Edmonton Journal</a>" and "<a href="Calgary%20Herald">Calgary Herald</a>" had invited Sapiro to tour Alberta, and his speeches stirred up extravagant expectations among UFA members for immediate action, in time for the new organization to market the 1923 crop.

Faced with the zeal of its membership, the UFA leadership appointed a 17-person committee, including Brownlee, to create the Alberta Cooperative Wheat Producers Limited. The membership fee was to be three dollars, and the organization was to work with similar organizations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The provincial government—at Brownlee's insistence—and the UGG both provided startup loans. The UGG also took the lead in agreeing to let its <a href="grain%20elevators">grain elevators</a> be used by the pool, which allowed Brownlee to defeat those committee members who thought the new company should acquire its own elevators.

By the end of August it was obvious that the organizations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba were not going to be ready in time for the 1923 crop, and the committee decided to proceed alone. It determined that if farmers representing half of Alberta's total wheat acreage agreed to pool their crop by September 15, the pool would proceed. Brownlee believed that this was an impossible objective. Despite the experimental and unproven nature of the model and the as-yet nonexistent organization that was to execute it, this objective was met. The <a href="Alberta%20Wheat%20Pool">Alberta Wheat Pool</a> was born. By the following year's harvest, comparable organizations had formed in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and a Central Selling Agency (CSA) was formed to sell all three provinces' wheat. The CSA's first president, Alexander James McPhail (whom Brownlee helped select), offered Brownlee the position of CSA general manager, at the attractive salary of $20,000 per year (a figure that Brownlee had helped set). At the urging of his government colleagues and the UFA leadership, both of who felt his continued presence in Edmonton was vital to the UFA government's hold on power, he declined; he was instead made the CSA's general counsel. Brownlee was also heavily involved in the creation of a livestock pool and three dairy pools, as a sort of "poolmania" hit Alberta farmers.

As Attorney-General, Brownlee inherited the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition</a> implemented by the previous Liberal government. While the UFA base and public opinion both favoured prohibition, the existing law was full of <a href="loopholes">loopholes</a> and unevenly enforced. Some judges, opponents of prohibition, refused to convict defendants charged with liquor offences. The UFA had pledged during the election campaign to introduce prohibition in fact as well as in law, and the task fell to Brownlee. He initially cooled expectations by announcing that he had no interest in making "any hasty or ill-considered move", either in changing the law or altering enforcement of the existing one.

On September 21, 1922, Constable Steve Lawson of the <a href="Alberta%20Provincial%20Police">Alberta Provincial Police</a> was murdered at his <a href="Blairmore%2C%20Alberta">Blairmore</a> home by <a href="rum-running">bootlegger</a> <a href="Emil%20Picariello">Emil Picariello</a> and his companion <a href="Florence%20Lassandra">Florence Lassandra</a>. He was the third policeman killed in Alberta in liquor-related incidents in 1922. The murder opened up a rift between Albertans of British descent, who saw bootlegging as an affront to the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> even if they did not support prohibition, and Albertans of southern and eastern European descent, who found prohibition to be something of a joke and accepted bootlegging. Brownlee authorized the deployment of special constables to apprehend Picariello and Lassandra. Once they were arrested, he appeared personally at the prosecution's bench alongside <a href="Alexander%20McGillivray%20%28Alberta%20politician%29">A. A. McGillivray</a>, reputedly Alberta's best courtroom lawyer, whose services he secured specifically for the case. Picariello and Lassandra were convicted and sentenced to death by <a href="hanging">hanging</a>.

By the time of their executions in May 1923, public opinion was turning against prohibition. The sentiment that criminal activities such as Picariello's were the inevitable result of prohibition laws became a popular one, as did the view that the government should legalize and regulate liquor sales. Brownlee, morally supportive of prohibition, began to personally support this course, believing that prohibition was unenforceable in the face of widespread public opposition. A <a href="Alberta%20prohibition%20plebiscite%2C%201923">1923 referendum</a> opted for the end of prohibition. In 1924 Brownlee guided the "Government Liquor Control Act"—drafted with the assistance of R. B. Bennett, who received $1,000 for his services—through the legislature.

As Attorney-General, Brownlee was responsible for administration of the "Lord's Day Act", which forbade most commerce on Sundays. Charles Huestis of the Lord's Day Alliance took issue with the <a href="Edmonton%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Edmonton Orchestra</a>'s Sunday concerts, on the grounds that by opening them only to its subscription holders it was "de facto" charging admission, and that by paying its musicians honoraria it was gainfully employing them in their regular professions on Sundays. Brownlee declined to prosecute, since courts had previously held that the concerts were legal. Huestis retorted that as Attorney-General Brownlee should make them illegal, to which Brownlee responded that he fully appreciated the importance of the Sabbath and did not need to be lectured on the subject by Huestis. There were also complaints about farmers violating the act by working Sundays; Brownlee felt that such complaints were often more about conflicts between neighbours than preservation of the Sabbath, and prosecuted only the most gratuitous and flagrant cases.

In the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201921">1921 federal election</a>, 65 of the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons of Canada</a>' 235 seats were won by <a href="Progressive%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressives</a> and allied factions, including the UFA, which won both seats it contested. <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a> Prime Minister-designate William Lyon MacKenzie King had only a minority, and expected to rely on the support of these Progressives to govern. Progressive leader Thomas Crerar envisioned forming a <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a> with the Liberals, and knew that he would be expected to provide cabinet members from Alberta, which had been swept by Progressives and allied parties. Seeing no "cabinet material" among the elected members, he sent an emissary to Edmonton to convince Greenfield or Brownlee to enter federal politics. Brownlee refused and advised Greenfield to do the same, on the grounds that their abandonment of provincial politics soon after the UFA's election would be seen as a betrayal.

As Greenfield's shortcomings became obvious, Brownlee found himself fielding propositions closer to home: in 1924 a group of UFA MLAs dissatisfied with Greenfield—including <a href="George%20Johnston%20%28politician%29">George Johnston</a>, <a href="George%20MacLachlan">George MacLachlan</a>, <a href="William%20H.%20Shield">William Shield</a>, <a href="Donald%20Cameron%2C%20Sr.">Donald Cameron</a>, <a href="Oran%20McPherson">Oran McPherson</a>, and <a href="Austin%20Claypool">Austin Claypool</a>—approached Brownlee to advise him that they planned to ask the premier to resign in favour of his attorney-general. To their surprise, Brownlee immediately told them that if Greenfield resigned, so would he. Faced with Brownlee's refusal to cooperate with their coup, the dissidents relented. They made another attempt in 1925; Brownlee again threatened to resign, but this time was persuaded by Henry Wise Wood to accept the crown if Greenfield relinquished it willingly. Greenfield assured Brownlee that he had not wanted the job of premier in the first place and would happily see Brownlee take it from him. Faced with these assurances, Brownlee agreed to form a government, and became Premier of Alberta November 23, 1925. He remained Attorney-General until after the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201926">1926 election</a>, when he appointed the newly elected <a href="John%20Lymburn">John Lymburn</a> to replace him.

Dutch 1913 battleship proposal

A <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> proposal to build new <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over the expansion of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>. Only four <a href="coastal%20defense%20ship">coastal defense ship</a>s were planned, but naval experts and the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20the%20Netherlands">"Tweede Kamer"</a> (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide a stronger defense for the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">"Nederlands-Indië"</a> (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.

The Royal Commission reported in August 1913. It recommended that the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Navy">"Koninklijke Marine"</a> (Royal Netherlands Navy) acquire nine <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>-type battleships to protect the NEI from attack and help guarantee the country's neutrality in Europe. Five of these would be based in the colony, while the other four would operate out of the Netherlands. Seven foreign companies submitted designs for the contract; naval historians believe that a 26,850-<a href="long%20ton">long-ton</a> (27,280 <a href="metric%20ton">tonnes</a>) ship, whose design was submitted by the German firm <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft">Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft</a>, would have been eventually selected.

The Royal Commission's proposal led to a debate between senior officers in the Navy and the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Army">"Koninklijke Landmacht"</a> (Royal Netherlands Army) over how to best protect the NEI, and the question of how the cost of the ships should be split between the Netherlands and the NEI also was not settled until July 1914. After considering the recommendations, the Dutch Government decided to acquire four battleships, and a bill seeking funding for them was introduced into the Dutch parliament in August 1914. However, this was withdrawn following the outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> that month. A new royal commission into Dutch defense needs held after the war did not recommend that battleships be procured and none were ever ordered.

During the early years of the 20th century, the Dutch became concerned about their ability to defend their colonial empire in the NEI from foreign aggressors. Fears of an eventual Japanese attack developed following the total defeat of the Russian <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Fleet%20%28Russia%29">Pacific</a> and <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>s in the <a href="Russo%E2%80%93Japanese%20War">Russo–Japanese War</a>. Moreover, the withdrawal of most of the British <a href="China%20Station">China Station's</a> warships in 1905 meant that there was no credible force in the Pacific to deter the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>, which had been victorious over the Russians and was building powerful cruisers armed with guns.
At the time, the Dutch naval force in the NEI, the <a href="Dutch%20Squadron%20in%20the%20East%20Indies">Dutch Squadron in the East Indies</a>, was widely seen as inadequate. It comprised a small number of <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a>s and <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s, most of which were not battle-worthy. In response to the perceived threat of Japanese attack, the Dutch laid down a coastal defense ship, , and eight <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s of the , while beginning plans for other ships. In addition, a submarine for the colony was approved in 1911. Four coast defense ships were projected in one of the two major <a href="Bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bills</a> to come before the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20the%20Netherlands">House of Representatives</a> in 1912. Specifications for these ships included an armament of four 280-mm (11-inch) and ten 102-mm (4-inch) guns and three torpedo tubes and they would have been armored with a <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a> of 152-mm (6-inch) and <a href="gun%20turret">turret</a> armor of 203 mm (8 inches). Two <a href="Steam%20engine%23Multiple%20expansion%20engines">triple-expansion engines</a> generating 10,000 <a href="Horsepower%23Indicated%20horsepower">indicated horsepower</a> would drive the ships through the water at . One ship of this design was very close to being authorized in 1912, but it was felt by experts and the House of Representatives that the Netherlands would be better served by constructing <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s of a type similar to the Spanish . Further plans for coast-defense ships were shelved pending the findings of a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>, formed on 5 June 1912. Its goal was to assess the steps needed to improve the defenses of the East Indies.

Meanwhile, in September 1912 the Navy Minister, <a href="Hendrikus%20Colijn">Hendrikus Colijn</a>, contacted the German firm <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft">Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft</a> and asked them to prepare a design for dreadnought battleships suited to the NEI. Germaniawerft submitted their design to the Royal Netherlands Navy on 25 September 1912. The proposed ships were generally similar to the German , but with eight L/50 guns in four turrets mounted "en echelon" rather than ten guns in five turrets, and two fewer medium guns. The proposed Dutch ships were faster and had a longer range, at the expense of lighter armor protection, similar to that used in contemporary German <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s. By the time the design was proposed the Dutch authorities had decided that mounting the armament "en echelon" was inferior to <a href="Superfire">superfiring</a> turrets, and asked Germaniawerft to submit a revised design incorporating this armament, enhanced ammunition storage and other minor improvements.

The Royal Commission handed its findings and recommendations to the government in August 1913. It concluded that international relations were deteriorating in the Pacific and there was an increased risk of the NEI becoming involved in a war between western and Asian powers. As a result, the Commission argued that the Netherlands should develop a powerful fleet of warships to enforce Dutch neutrality and offer a credible defense should any nation attack the NEI or the home country itself. The Commission was very specific in its call for nine dreadnoughts, stating that they should be ships of , possessing a speed of , and mounting eight guns, sixteen , and twelve guns. It was also recommended that the fleet include six "torpedo cruisers"—believed by "Conways" to be closer to large destroyers—eight destroyers (a role which would be filled by the "Fret" class), eight <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s (also already completed, though they were old), eight large <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and two large <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a>s. This ambitious plan was estimated to cost nearly <a href="Dutch%20guilder">ƒ</a>17,000,000 each year for the next 35 (until 1949), adding up to about ƒ595,000,000; this would triple the Navy's budget. The Commission recommended that the cost of the fleet be partially offset by reducing the size of the "<a href="Royal%20Dutch%20East%20Indies%20Army">"Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger"</a>" (Royal Dutch East Indies Army) as the Navy would provide a stronger defense from attack than the Army could.

The requirement for nine battleships was determined by the defense needs of both the Netherlands and NEI. The Commission recommended that four battleships be active at all times in the NEI, with a fifth ship held in reserve there. The remaining four battleships would be based in the Netherlands. Ships sent to the NEI would return to Europe after twelve years in the tropics and complete another eight years service before being scrapped.

The Dutch Navy would need a significant manpower expansion of 2,800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships. The Commission believed that it was unlikely that sufficient Dutch citizens would volunteer, and that as a result Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI. Strong <a href="Racial%20segregation">segregation</a> between white and Indonesian sailors was to be maintained to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency.

One member of the Commission, the chief accountant of the Ministry of Finance, A. van Gijn, objected to the report's conclusions. He provided a note to <a href="Wilhelmina%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Queen Wilhelmina</a>, which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced their views on the other members of the commission. Moreover, he believed that the proposed fleet would be inadequate given the rapid naval expansion being undertaken by the major powers, and that if it was adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace. This note was included as an appendix to the Commission's report.

The Royal Commission's proposals were extensively debated. <a href="Hendrick%20van%20Kol">Hendrick van Kol</a>, who was one of the leaders of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Workers%27%20Party%20%28Netherlands%29">Social Democratic Workers' Party</a>, argued that building up a strong fleet would hinder Dutch neutrality by making it impossible to avoid battle with foreign fleets which passed through NEI waters en route to other destinations. Other critics of the plan believed that it would be unwise for the Netherlands to join the naval <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> which was taking place in Europe at the time, and that competition between the major powers meant that none of them would allow another nation to occupy either the Netherlands or the NEI. The Dutch Army also opposed the development of a strong fleet in the NEI, arguing that a land force centered on <a href="Java">Java</a> would be better able to mount a prolonged resistance against a large invasion force and that reducing the size of the Army to fund the fleet would leave it unable to suppress insurrections. The <a href="Governor-General%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Governor-General of the NEI</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Willem%20Frederik%20Idenburg">Alexander Willem Frederik Idenburg</a>, argued that both a stronger Army and Navy were necessary, and advocated for seven battleships to be stationed in the Indies. He believed that the cost of this alternative could be managed by reducing the planned battleship force in European waters to three small ships. Other supporters of the proposal, led by the "<a href="Onze%20Vloot">Onze Vloot</a>" ("Our Fleet") naval advocacy association, argued that it was necessary to build a strong fleet which was capable of defending the NEI as the loss of the colonial empire would greatly damage the Dutch economy and reduce the country's prestige. The Dutch Naval staff also debated the relative merits of torpedo boats and battleships, and concluded that while small craft and submarines were suitable for defending the Netherlands, large warships were needed to effectively protect the sprawling East Indies.

After considering the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships were to be permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued for at least a fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, and that it would be paid for by a loan borne by NEI.

Germaniawerft submitted a revised battleship design (designated Project No. 753) to the Dutch Navy on 4 March 1913, well before the Royal Commission reported back to the Government. As requested, the new design mounted its main armament in superfiring turrets. Other changes included an increase in the number of guns to sixteen, a faster maximum speed, different armor protection, replacement of two of the side-launching <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> tubes with a single stern tube and an increase in the number of rounds carried for each gun from 60 to 100 for the main armament and 100 to 150 for the medium guns. The new design also had a single funnel and a tripod mast that supported a director tower. Displacement was increased from 19,535 tons to 20,040 tons. Germaniawerft submitted a modified version of this design later in the year which increased the ships' displacement to 20,700 tons and substituted eight 343 mm (13.5 inch) L/45 guns mounted in two quadruple turrets which were better protected than the four double turrets in the Project No. 753 proposal. This design was not accepted, however.
A meeting chaired by the Navy Minister, <a href="Jean%20Jacques%20Rambonnet">Jean Jacques Rambonnet</a>, was held on 10 November 1913 to finalize the battleships' specifications. It was decided that the ships would be armed with eight 343 mm (13.5 inch) L/45 guns in four superfiring turrets mounted on the centerline, a secondary armament of sixteen 150 mm (5.9 inch) and twelve 75 mm (2.9 inch) guns and at least two, possibly four, 533 mm (21 inch) side-launching submerged torpedo tubes and a single stern torpedo tube. The ships were to have a speed of at least and an endurance of more than at . They would be propelled by oil-fired boilers powering turbines and three or four propeller shafts. Armor protection would comprise a <a href="belt%20armor">main belt</a> at least 250 mm (9.8 inches) thick and at least 300 mm (11.8 inches) over the gun turrets and <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a>. A crew of 110 officers and petty officers and 750 <a href="Naval%20rating">ratings</a> was envisioned, and designers were permitted to reduce the armor protection at ships' bow and stern to save weight for improvements to crew living conditions if necessary.

On 13 March 1914 the Dutch Government altered the battleships' specifications to require a displacement of 25,000 tons, main armament of 356 mm (14 inch) guns, speed of and endurance of . The specified speed was faster than normal for contemporary battleships and their belt armor protection was relatively thin. These characteristics were meant to aid the ships in fighting on the <a href="Java%20Sea">Java Sea</a>; with the good visibility common in that area, naval battles could—and most likely would—be fought at a longer range than would be feasible in other areas like the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, meaning that more shells would strike the deck rather than the belt.

Eleven firms or groups of firms were invited to tender to build the ships, with proposals due on 4 June 1914. Proposals were received from seven firms; <a href="Friedrich%20Krupp%20Germaniawerft">Germaniawerft</a>, <a href="Blohm%20%2B%20Voss">Blohm & Voss</a>, <a href="AG%20Vulcan%20Stettin">AG Vulcan</a> in cooperation with <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> and <a href="AG%20Weser">AG Weser</a> from Germany as well as the British firms <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co</a>, <a href="Fairfield%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Engineering%20Company">Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company</a> and <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a>. It is believed that Armstrong submitted at least five different designs. As Dutch shipyards lacked the capability to build large battleships, the ships would have been constructed abroad.

The proposal from Germaniawerft (designated Project No. 806) is regarded by both "Conway's" and historian Anthonie van Dijk as being the most likely to have been selected. This design envisioned 24,605 long ton ships with a length of 184 meters (604 ft), beam of and draft of . The main armament of eight 356 mm guns was to be mounted in four <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> turrets, while the sixteen 150 mm guns would be placed in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s about above the waterline. Their machinery would include six double-ended boilers and one single-ended boiler and three turbine sets were to drive three propeller shafts. Armor would have included a <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a> of 250 mm amidships and 150 mm to fore and aft. Germaniawerft reserved the right to subcontract Blohm & Voss to build some of the ships and offered a delivery time for the first ship of 28 months following the date the order was made.

Other major proposals included the ones from Blohm & Voss and Vickers. While both included the same armament as Germania, the former design had a smaller displacement—26,055 long tons (26,473 metric tons) versus 28,033 long tons (28,483 t)—and devoted a greater amount of weight to protection: 8,974 long tons (9,118 t, 34.8% of the displacement), versus 8,820 long tons (8,960 t, 31.77%). Blohm & Voss' design included a belt starting at 150 mm in the bow, increasing to 250 mm, then tapering to in the stern. It would have been powered by six double-ended coal boilers with oil burners alongside. These boilers would have generated 38,000 shaft horsepower (shp) to drive four propellers, giving the ships a maximum speed of . Only one rudder would have been fitted. The Vickers design had a shorter belt of 250 mm amidships, and would have used 15 boilers with oil burners to provide 34,000 shp and the same 22 knots.

There was an extensive debate over how to divide the cost of the proposed fleet between the Netherlands and NEI. The members of the Royal Commission were split on this question; while a minority preferred an equal division, the majority wanted the NEI to pay most of the costs. The public debate on this issue was centered on the questions of who should pay for the ships and who would make the greatest profits from the NEI remaining under Dutch rule. Arguments against the NEI paying for the ships included that the resources required were needed to fund economic and social development and that the cost of the ships would increase opposition to Dutch rule, thereby worsening the security situation in the East Indies. Some critics of the plan also argued that it was unreasonable to expect the Dutch subjects in the NEI to pay for ships intended to prolong colonial rule. In contrast, "Onze Vloot" published pamphlets which claimed that Dutch rule was seen as beneficial in the NEI, and that both white and native residents of the islands would be willing to pay for the ships as they were necessary to guarantee its continuation. These pamphlets also argued that the cost of the ships was modest compared to the NEI's economic output.

In order to avoid a confrontation over the naval budget, the Dutch Government postponed parliamentary discussions of the Royal Commission's recommendations during 1913 and early 1914. By this time "Onze Vloot"s campaign in support of the fleet had gained considerable momentum. In late 1913 the Government accepted an offer made by representatives of the Dutch business community to contribute 120,000 guilders towards the cost of a second battleship once parliament approved funding for the first ship. Despite this, the Government continued to delay submitting a plan for the defense of the NEI to parliament, though work continued on it. The main difficulty remained the question of how to pay for the fleet. The Minister of the Colonies, <a href="Thomas%20Bastiaan%20Pleyte">Thomas B. Pleyte</a>, believed that the NEI's population needed to be sheltered from the cost of the ships to the extent possible so that funding for welfare projects was not reduced or taxes increased from what were already high levels. In 1914 he settled on a plan under which the necessary revenue would be raised through increasing the taxes on export duties and freight moved by privately owned railways and ships.

A bill setting out arrangements for funding and building the fleet was finalized in mid-July 1914. At this time the Navy had not yet settled on a final battleship design. It was planned that the first ship's <a href="keel">keel</a> would be laid in December 1914 and <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a> be completed sometime in 1918. The bill was not immediately introduced into parliament, however, as Idenburg was given until 10 August to comment on it. The outbreak of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> led to the bill being withdrawn due to the uncertain international circumstances and the impossibility of buying battleships from foreign shipbuilders in wartime. Instead, the Government ordered three s in 1915, though only two were completed.

A new Royal Commission into the defense of the Netherlands and NEI was held during 1920 and 1921. This Commission did not recommend that any battleships be constructed; instead it proposed that all ships under construction as at 31 December be completed along with a further two cruisers, 12 destroyers and 16 submarines. This plan was considered unaffordable, however, especially given the strength of the <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a> movement internationally. A Navy Bill to fund a reduced version of the Royal Commission's proposal was introduced to parliament in November 1921, but was eventually defeated by a single vote in October 1923. Renewed Dutch concerns over Japanese aggression in the late 1930s led to a proposal to build three <a href="Design%201047%20battlecruiser">Design 1047 battlecruiser</a>s for service in the NEI, but construction of these ships had not begun when the Netherlands was <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Netherlands">overrun by German forces</a> in May 1940.

Richard Barre

Richard Barre (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1130 – c. 1202) was a medieval English justice, clergyman and scholar. He was educated at the law school of Bologna and entered royal service under King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a>, later working for Henry's son and successor <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard I</a>. He was also briefly in the household of Henry's son <a href="Henry%20the%20Young%20King">Henry the Young King</a>. Barre served the elder Henry as a diplomat and was involved in a minor way with the king's quarrel with <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, which earned Barre a condemnation from Becket. After King Henry's death, Barre became a royal justice during Richard's reign and was one of the main judges in the period from 1194 to 1199. After disagreeing with him earlier in his career, Barre was discharged from his judgeship during <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a>'s reign as king. Barre was also archdeacon of <a href="Ely%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Ely</a> and the author of a work of <a href="Bible">biblical</a> extracts dedicated to one of his patrons, <a href="William%20Longchamp">William Longchamp</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a> and <a href="Chancellor%20of%20England">Chancellor of England</a>.

Whether Barre was a native of England or of Normandy is unknown, but his surname appears to derive from the Norman village of <a href="La%20Barre-en-Ouche">La Barre</a>, near <a href="Bernay%2C%20Eure">Bernay</a>, in the present-day department of <a href="Eure">Eure</a>. He was likely born around 1130 and was related to Normandy's Sifrewast family, knights in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>. Barre had a relative, Hugh Barre, who was <a href="List%20of%20Archdeacons%20of%20Leicester">Archdeacon of Leicester</a> in the 1150s. Barre studied law at <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> in Italy before 1150 and was a student there with <a href="Stephen%20of%20Tournai">Stephen of Tournai</a>, who became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Tournai">Bishop of Tournai</a> in 1192. Another fellow student wrote a short verse addressed to Barre: ""Pontificum causas regumque negocia tractes, Qui tibi divicias deliciasque parant"", which translates to "May you manage the causes of bishops and the affairs of kings, Who provide riches and delights for you." After finishing his schooling, Barre seems to have worked for either <a href="Robert%20de%20Chesney">Robert de Chesney</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, or <a href="Nicholas%20de%20Sigillo">Nicholas</a>, <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Huntingdon">Archdeacon of Huntingdon</a>; the main evidence for this is that Barre witnessed charters for both men from 1160 to 1164. By 1165, Barre had joined the household of King Henry II of England.

Barre served King Henry during the king's quarrel with Thomas Becket, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, who had gone into exile in 1164 over the dispute about the limits of royal authority over the English Church. Because of Barre's close ties to King Henry, Becket considered him one of the king's "evil counselors", and Barre was the subject of denunciations by the archbishop. In late August 1169, Barre was in Normandy with Henry, where Barre was part of a group of ecclesiastics advising the king on how to resolve the <a href="Becket%20controversy">Becket dispute</a>. In September 1169, Barre was sent along with two other clerks to Rome to complain about the behaviour of papal envoys during negotiations with Becket held at the beginning of September. The papal negotiators at first agreed to a compromise, but the next day claimed that the proposal was unacceptable. With the failure of the negotiations, Becket restored the sentences of <a href="excommunicate">excommunication</a> on a number of royal officials, but Barre was not included among those specifically named even though many of his colleagues were. The historian <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a> argues that Barre was not specifically named in the restoration of excommunications, as Becket considered him already excommunicated because of his association with those under the church's ban.

During January and February 1170 the king sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for the coronation of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Alexander III</a> over this usurpation of the right of the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow the coronation, but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow the coronation in 1170.

After Becket's murder in December 1170 King Henry sent Barre to Rome, accompanied by the Archbishop of Rouen, the bishops of Évreux and Worcester, and other royal clerks, to plead the royal case with the papacy. The mission's objective was to make it clear to Alexander that Henry had had nothing to do with Becket's murder and that the king was horrified that it had taken place. Barre was at first refused a meeting with Alexander, but eventually the envoys were allowed to meet with the pope. Although the mission was not a complete success, the royal commission did manage to persuade the papacy not to impose an <a href="Papal%20interdict">interdict</a>, or ban on clerical rites, on England or to excommunicate the king. Shortly afterwards Barre was granted the office of Archdeacon of <a href="Lisieux">Lisieux</a>, probably as a reward for his efforts in Rome in 1171. In September he was named a royal justice. He was named <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a> to King Henry's eldest living son <a href="Henry%20the%20Young%20King">Henry</a> for a brief period in 1172 and 1173, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father and sought refuge at the French royal court, Barre refused to join him in exile and returned to the king's service. Barre took with him the younger Henry's seal.

In addition to the Lisieux archdeaconry, Barre held the <a href="prebend">prebend</a> of Hurstborne and Burbage in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Salisbury">Diocese of Salisbury</a> from 1177 and the prebend of Moreton and Whaddon in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Diocese of Hereford</a> from 1180 through 1184. He continued to hold the archdeaconry at Lisieux until 1188, and was at Lisieux for most of the late 1170s and 1180s. In 1179 he was at Rouen for the display of the body of Saint <a href="Romanus%20of%20Rouen">Romanus</a> and was one of the witnesses to the event. While holding his Norman archdeaconry, he gave land to the abbey of St-Pierre-sur-Dives along with <a href="Ralph%20de%20Warneville">Ralph, Bishop of Lisieux</a>. In February or March 1198, King Henry sent Barre on a diplomatic mission to the continent with letters to <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick Barbarossa</a>, the German Emperor, <a href="B%C3%A9la%20II%20of%20Hungary">Bela II</a>, the King of Hungary, and <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelos">Isaac II Angelos</a>, the Emperor at Constantinople, seeking assistance for his projected crusade. Barre carried letters to the three rulers requesting passage through their lands and the right to procure supplies. Nothing came of this mission, as Henry died in 1189 before the crusade could set off.

After the death of King Henry, Barre joined the service of William Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who was justiciar and Lord Chancellor. Longchamp named Barre as <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Ely">Archdeacon of Ely</a>, with the appointment occurring before 4 July 1190. Longchamp sent Barre as a royal justice to the counties near Ely in 1190. However, Longchamp was driven into exile in late 1191 owing to the hostility of the English nobility and Richard's brother Prince <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a> during Richard's absence on the <a href="Third%20Crusade">Third Crusade</a>. Longchamp's exile meant that Barre did not serve as a royal justice again until King Richard I returned to England in 1194. Although Longchamp eventually returned to England, he did not return to his diocese, and much of the administration of Ely would have devolved on Barre during Longchamp's absence.

Barre was one of the main royal justices between 1194 and 1199. He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, <a href="Eustace%20%28Bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Eustace</a>, who was elected in August 1197. But Barre had incurred the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202, when he was serving as a <a href="Papal%20judge-delegate">judge-delegate</a> for <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a>, but he may have been alive as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and 1213. Barre maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.

Barre wrote a work on the Bible entitled "Compendium de veteri et novo testamento", which he dedicated to Longchamp. The work arranged passages from the Bible under topics, and then annotated the passages with marginal notations such as were done with <a href="gloss%20%28annotation%29%23In%20law">gloss</a>es on <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a>. It is still extant in two manuscript (MS) copies, MS <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> <a href="Harleian%20Collection">Harley</a> 3255, and <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> MS 105. The Harley manuscript is shorter than the Lambeth manuscript. Richard Sharpe, a modern historian who studied both works, stated that the Harley manuscript "provides [a] well structured and systematic (though not complete) coverage of the whole Bible." Because of the dedication to William Longchamp as "bishop, legate, and chancellor", it is likely that the work was composed between January 1190 and October 1191, as Longchamp only held those three offices together during that period. The prologue to the work describes it as something to be used privately, and thus Sharpe feels that it was not intended to be a publicly published work; instead Barre may have intended it for Longchamp's private use in preparing sermons.

A third copy of Barre's "Compendium" may have existed at <a href="Leicester%20Abbey">Leicester Abbey</a>, where a late 15th-century library catalogue records a work by Barre on the Bible that the catalogue titles "Compendium Ricardi Barre super utroque testamento". The title and contents make this manuscript likely to be a copy of the "Compendium". The same catalogue also records five books once owned by Barre – copies of <a href="Gratian%20%28jurist%29">Gratian</a>'s "<a href="Decretum%20Gratiani">Decretum</a>", <a href="Justinian">Justinian</a>'s "<a href="Corpus%20Juris%20Civilis">Codex</a>", glossed copies of the <a href="Psalter">Psalter</a> and some of the "<a href="Pauline%20Epistles">Epistles</a>" of <a href="St.%20Paul">Paul</a>, as well as <a href="Peter%20Lombard">Peter Lombard</a>'s "<a href="Sentences">Sentences</a>". Also, another Leicester Abbey manuscript records some satirical verses that were said to have been written by Barre.
