Telopea truncata

Telopea truncata, <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as the Tasmanian waratah, is a plant in the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. It is <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> where it is found on moist acidic soils at altitudes of 600 to 1200 m (2000–4000 ft). "Telopea truncata" is a component of alpine <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a> forest, rainforest and scrub communities. It grows as a multistemmed shrub to a height of , or occasionally as a small tree to 10 m (35 ft) high, with red <a href="flower%20head">flower head</a>s, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appearing over the Tasmanian summer (November to February) and bearing 10 to 35 individual flowers. Yellow-flowered forms are occasionally seen, but do not form a population distinct from the rest of the species.

Collected by French botanist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> in 1792–93, "Telopea truncata" was first scientifically described in 1805. Genetic analysis revealed that the Tasmanian waratah is the most distinctive of the five <a href="waratah">waratah</a> species. It can be cultivated in <a href="temperate%20climate">temperate climate</a>s, requiring soils with good drainage and ample moisture in part-shaded or sunny positions. Several commercially available <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s that are <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>s of "T. truncata" with the New South Wales waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20speciosissima">T. speciosissima</a>") and Gippsland waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20oreades">T. oreades</a>") have been developed.

The Tasmanian waratah is a large erect shrub up to in height with several stems, although it sometimes grows as a single-stemmed tree to 10 m (35 ft) high. Unlike the New South Wales waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20speciosissima">T. speciosissima</a>"), which has a few stems topped with flowers, the stems of the Tasmanian waratah branch freely, with numerous smaller branches topped with flower heads. Younger branches and flower heads frequently have a coating of brownish hairs. The narrow adult leaves are long and across and have a rough texture. <a href="wikt%3Aspathulate">Spathulate</a> (spoon-shaped) to <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> in shape, they have smooth, slightly down-curved margins. The undersurface of the leaves is hairy. Occasional lobed leaves are seen.

Flowering occurs from October to January, and is related to altitude: plants at lower elevations flower earlier than ones higher up. The flower heads, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are terminal—that is, they arise on the ends of small branches—and are surrounded by small inconspicuous hairy <a href="bract">bract</a>s. This sets "T. truncata" apart from all other waratah species, which have hairless bracts. In the shape of a flattened <a href="raceme">raceme</a>, the flower heads are in diameter and composed of 10 to 35 individual flowers. They are most commonly bright red, though scattered yellow-flowered plants occur. These were described as forma "lutea" but are mere colour variations and not genetically distinct. Yellow-flowered plants have both red- and yellow-flowered progeny. <a href="Anthesis">Anthesis</a> is <a href="basipetal">basipetal</a>; that is, the flowers at the base (edges) of the flower head open first. The flower is composed of a 2 cm-long <a href="perianth">perianth</a> on a 1 cm-long stalk, with a pronounced kink in the <a href="Style%20%28flower%29">style</a> above the <a href="Ovary%20%28botany%29">ovary</a>; all other waratah species have gently incurving styles. Anatomically, the individual flower bears a sessile <a href="stamen">anther</a> (that is, it lacks a filament), which lies next to the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a> at the end of the style. The ovary lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the <a href="gynophore">gynophore</a>, and it is from here that the seed pod then develops. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped <a href="Nectar%23Floral%20nectaries">nectary</a> lies at the base of the gynophore.

After flowering, the curved leathery to woody <a href="Follicle%20%28fruit%29">follicles</a> develop. Hanging downwards on wooden stalks, these are roughly oblong in shape, and measure around 5 cm (2 in) long. They split longitudinally to release the winged seeds, which are ripe around March. There are around 16 seeds, which are arranged in two rows. Wooden structures known as lamellae separate the seeds from each other and the follicle walls.

While exploring Van Diemen's Land (<a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>) in 1792–3, French botanist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> collected specimens of what he later formally described as "Embothrium truncatum" in his 1805 work "<a href="Novae%20Hollandiae%20Plantarum%20Specimen">Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen</a>". The <a href="Botanical%20name%23Components%20of%20plant%20names">specific epithet</a> is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "truncatus", meaning "truncated" or "ending abruptly", referring to the end of the seed wing. This characteristic is not specific to the Tasmanian waratah; all members of the subtribe <a href="Embothriinae">Embothriinae</a> have truncate seed wings. "Embothrium" was a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a> at the time, and <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> proposed placing the species in a new genus, "<a href="Waratah">Telopea</a>", in a talk he gave in 1809, publishing the new name "Telopea truncata" in 1810. <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a> had attended the talk and controversially published the species as "Hylogyne australis", or southern hylogyne, in <a href="Joseph%20Knight%20%28horticulturist%29">Joseph Knight's</a> 1809 book "<a href="On%20the%20cultivation%20of%20the%20plants%20belonging%20to%20the%20natural%20order%20of%20Proteeae">On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae</a>", thus claiming precedence over Brown's formal 1810 description. Salisbury was involved in disputes with several prominent naturalists of the time, and his preemption of Brown was seen as unethical, so his names were largely ignored by his contemporaries in favor of Brown's.

James Ross described a new species of waratah, "Telopea tasmaniana", in his "Hobart Town Almanack" in 1835, but it is now considered a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> of "T. truncata". In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> published "<a href="Revisio%20generum%20plantarum">Revisio generum plantarum</a>", his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice. He revived the genus "Hylogyne" on the grounds of priority, and correctly made the new combination "Hylogyne truncata" for "T. truncata". However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists. Ultimately, the genus "Telopea" was <a href="conserved%20name">nomenclaturally conserved</a> over "Hylogyne" by the <a href="International%20Botanical%20Congress">International Botanical Congress</a> of 1905.

"Telopea truncata" is one, and possibly the most distinctive, of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus "Telopea". It is the earliest offshoot of a lineage that gives rise to the Gippsland waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20oreades">T. oreades</a>") and Monga waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20mongaensis">T. mongaensis</a>") of southeastern mainland Australia. The perianths of "T. truncata" are of a single shade of red, whereas those of its mainland relatives are coloured with two distinct shades of red—the surfaces facing the centre of the flower head are a much brighter red than those facing away.

The genus is classified in the subtribe Embothriinae of the Proteaceae, along with the <a href="Alloxylon">tree waratahs ("Alloxylon")</a> from eastern Australia and <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, and the South American genera "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis</a>" and "<a href="Embothrium">Embothrium</a>". Almost all of these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely pre-dated the splitting of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. "<a href="Propylipollis%20ambiguus">Propylipollis ambiguus</a>" (formerly "Triporopollenites ambiguus") is the oldest identifiable member of the Embothriinae. It is known only from pollen deposits, and was originally described from <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> deposits in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of "T. truncata", "<a href="Alloxylon%20pinnatum">Alloxylon pinnatum</a>" and "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis grandiflora</a>". Fossil remains of "Telopea truncata" have been recovered from early to middle <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> strata at <a href="Regatta%20Point%2C%20Tasmania">Regatta Point</a> in western Tasmania. The leaves are small, and these beds housed a subalpine plant community in what is now lowland terrain. Leaves identical to (and classified as) "Telopea truncata" have been recovered from early <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> deposits around <a href="Sheffield%2C%20Tasmania%23Lake%20Cethana">Lake Cethana</a> near <a href="Sheffield%2C%20Tasmania">Sheffield</a>.

The species is found in central, southern, and western Tasmania and is absent from warmer, dryer areas. It grows on moist acidic soils in wet <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest or <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> scrub at altitudes of 600 to 1200 m (2000–4000 ft). It is an <a href="understory">understory</a> component of subalpine forest stands of alpine ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20delegatensis">Eucalyptus delegatensis</a>") and alpine yellow gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20subcrenulata">E. subcrenulata</a>"), as well as "<a href="Athrotaxis%20selaginoides">Athrotaxis selaginoides</a>"–"<a href="Fuscospora%20gunnii">Nothofagus gunnii</a>" short rainforest, "Athrotaxis selaginoides" rainforest, "<a href="Leptospermum">Leptospermum</a>"-with-rainforest scrub, the tall "<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>"–"<a href="Atherosperma">Atherosperma</a>" rainforest and "Nothofagus"–"<a href="Phyllocladus">Phyllocladus</a>" short rainforest. It is occasionally found in the "<a href="Leptospermum%20scoparium">Leptospermum scoparium</a>"–"<a href="Acacia%20mucronata">Acacia mucronata</a>" forest community of western Tasmania.

The prominent position and striking colour of the flowers of "T. truncata" and many of its relatives within the subtribe Embothriinae in both Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. The flower heads produce abundant nectar, which is fed upon by many bird species. The Tasmanian waratah has a swollen woody base largely under the soil known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, which stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth after a <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>.

Like most Proteaceae, "T. truncata" has fine <a href="Cluster%20root">proteoid roots</a> that arise from larger roots. These are roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. They are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, including the <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>-deficient native soils of Australia. Waratah seeds are often eaten—and destroyed—by animals and do not travel far (just several metres) from the parent plants.

The flowers of the Tasmanian waratah provide ample nectar and hence are a food source for bird visitors to the garden. The species can be propagated by seed, though seedlings may succumb to <a href="damping%20off">damping off</a>. Growing in a natural shady location delays flowering by two to four weeks, while growing in a cooler conditions (due either to latitude or altitude) can delay flowering by up to six weeks. Pruning flower heads can promote subsequent growth of leaves and branches. It grows best in a cool climate with ample water and good drainage, and has done well in cultivation in England. The <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a> gave it an <a href="Award%20of%20Merit">Award of Merit</a> in 1934 and a First Class Certificate in 1938. The relationship between light duration and intensity, temperature, vegetative growth and flower production is poorly known. Yellow forms in cultivation were originally propagated from a plant found on <a href="Mount%20Wellington%20%28Tasmania%29">Mount Wellington</a>.


The flowers of "T. truncata" were once used extensively for decoration. Geoffrey Smith observed in 1909 that the collection of the flowers for this purpose had caused the decline of some populations on Mount Wellington. The <a href="Lumber">timber</a> of larger specimens has been used for inlays; it has an attractive grain and a pale red color.

Trial by Jury

Trial by Jury is a <a href="comic%20opera">comic opera</a> in one act, with music by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> and <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>. It was first produced on 25 March 1875, at London's <a href="Royalty%20Theatre">Royalty Theatre</a>, where it initially ran for 131 performances and was considered a hit, receiving critical praise and outrunning its popular companion piece, <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</a>'s "<a href="La%20P%C3%A9richole">La Périchole</a>". The story concerns a "<a href="breach%20of%20promise">breach of promise</a> of marriage" lawsuit in which the <a href="judge">judge</a> and legal system are the objects of lighthearted <a href="satire">satire</a>. Gilbert based the libretto of "Trial by Jury" on an operetta parody that he had written in 1868.

The opera premiered more than three years after <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s only previous collaboration, "<a href="Thespis%20%28opera%29">Thespis</a>", an 1871–72 Christmas season entertainment. In the intervening years, both the author and composer were busy with separate projects. Beginning in 1873, Gilbert tried several times to get the opera produced before the <a href="impresario">impresario</a> <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a> suggested that he collaborate on it with Sullivan. Sullivan was pleased with the piece and promptly wrote the music.

As with most Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the plot of "Trial by Jury" is ludicrous, but the characters behave as if the events were perfectly reasonable. This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy, especially of those in authority, and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions. These themes became favourites of Gilbert through the rest of his collaborations with Sullivan. Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan's witty and good-humoured music complemented Gilbert's satire. The success of "Trial by Jury" launched the famous series of 13 collaborative works between Gilbert and Sullivan that came to be known as the <a href="Savoy%20opera">Savoy Operas</a>.

After its original production in 1875, "Trial by Jury" toured widely in Britain and elsewhere and was frequently revived and recorded. It also became popular as a part of charity benefits. The work continues to be frequently played, especially as a companion piece to other short Gilbert and Sullivan operas or other works. According to the theatre scholar <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%A4nzl">Kurt Gänzl</a>, it is "probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time".

Before "Trial by Jury", <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> had collaborated on one previous opera, "<a href="Thespis%20%28opera%29">Thespis; or, The Gods Grown Old</a>", in 1871. Although reasonably successful, it was a Christmas entertainment, and such works were not expected to endure. Between "Thespis" and "Trial by Jury", <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> did not collaborate on any further operas, and each man separately produced works that further built his reputation in his own field. Gilbert wrote several short stories, edited the second volume of his comic "<a href="Bab%20Ballads">Bab Ballads</a>", and created a dozen theatrical works, including "<a href="Happy%20Arcadia">Happy Arcadia</a>" in 1872; "<a href="The%20Wicked%20World">The Wicked World</a>", "<a href="The%20Happy%20Land">The Happy Land</a>" and "<a href="The%20Realm%20of%20Joy">The Realm of Joy</a>" in 1873; "<a href="Charity%20%28play%29">Charity</a>", "<a href="Topsyturveydom">Topsyturveydom</a>" and "<a href="Sweethearts%20%28play%29">Sweethearts</a>" in 1874. At the same time, Sullivan wrote various pieces of religious music, including the "<a href="Festival%20Te%20Deum">Festival Te Deum</a>" (1872) and an <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>, "<a href="The%20Light%20of%20the%20World%20%28Sullivan%29">The Light of the World</a>" (1873), and edited "Church Hymns, with Tunes" (1874), which included 45 of his own hymns and arrangements. Two of his most famous hymn tunes from this period are settings of "<a href="Onward%2C%20Christian%20Soldiers">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>" and "<a href="Nearer%2C%20my%20God%2C%20to%20Thee">Nearer, my God, to Thee</a>" (both in 1872). He also wrote a suite of <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> to "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>" (1874) and many <a href="parlour%20ballads">parlour ballads</a> and other songs, including three in 1874–75 with words by Gilbert: "The Distant Shore", "Sweethearts" (inspired by <a href="Sweethearts%20%28play%29">Gilbert's play</a>) and "The Love that Loves Me Not".

The genesis of "Trial by Jury" began in 1868, when Gilbert wrote a single-page illustrated comic piece for the magazine "<a href="Fun%20%28magazine%29">Fun</a>" entitled "Trial by Jury: An Operetta". Drawing on Gilbert's training and brief practice as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, it detailed a "<a href="breach%20of%20promise">breach of promise</a>" trial going awry, in the process spoofing the law, lawyers and the legal system. (In the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, a man could be required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged.) The outline of this story was followed in the later opera, and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in "Fun". The skit, however, ended abruptly: the moment the attractive <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> stepped into the witness box, the judge leapt into her arms and vowed to marry her, whereas in the opera, the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached.

In 1873, the opera manager and composer <a href="Carl%20Rosa">Carl Rosa</a> asked Gilbert for a piece to use as part of a season of English opera that Rosa planned to present at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane Theatre</a>; Rosa was to write or commission the music. Gilbert expanded "Trial" into a one-act <a href="libretto">libretto</a>. Rosa's wife, <a href="Euphrosyne%20Parepa-Rosa">Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa</a>, a childhood friend of Gilbert's, died after an illness in 1874, and Rosa dropped the project. Later in the same year, Gilbert offered the libretto to the impresario <a href="Richard%20D%27Oyly%20Carte">Richard D'Oyly Carte</a>, but Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music.

Meanwhile, Sullivan may have been considering a return to <a href="light%20opera">light opera</a>: "<a href="Cox%20and%20Box">Cox and Box</a>", his first comic opera, had received a London revival (co-starring his brother, <a href="Fred%20Sullivan">Fred Sullivan</a>) in September 1874. In November, Sullivan travelled to Paris and contacted <a href="Albert%20Millaud">Albert Millaud</a>, one of the librettists for <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</a>'s operettas. However, he returned to London empty-handed and worked on <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for the <a href="Gaiety%20Theatre%2C%20London">Gaiety Theatre</a>'s production of "<a href="The%20Merry%20Wives%20of%20Windsor">The Merry Wives of Windsor</a>". By early 1875, Carte was managing <a href="Selina%20Dolaro">Selina Dolaro</a>'s <a href="Royalty%20Theatre">Royalty Theatre</a>, and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's "<a href="La%20P%C3%A9richole">La Périchole</a>", which was to open on 30 January (with Fred Sullivan in the cast), in which Dolaro starred. Carte had asked Sullivan to compose something for the theatre and advertised in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in late January: "In Preparation, a New Comic Opera composed expressly for this theatre by Mr. Arthur Sullivan in which Madame Dolaro and <a href="Nellie%20Bromley">Nellie Bromley</a> will appear." But around the same time, Carte also remembered Gilbert's "Trial by Jury" and knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create "Thespis". He suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan was the man to write the music for "Trial".

Gilbert finally called on Sullivan and read the libretto to him on 20 February 1875. Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, "[Gilbert] read it through ... in the manner of a man considerably disappointed with what he had written. As soon as he had come to the last word, he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, inasmuch as I was screaming with laughter the whole time." "Trial by Jury", described as "A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata" in the original promotional material, was composed and rehearsed in a matter of weeks.

The result of Gilbert and Sullivan's collaboration was a witty, tuneful and very "English" piece, in contrast to the <a href="wikt%3Abawdy">bawdy</a> <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesques</a> and adaptations of French <a href="operetta">operetta</a>s that dominated the London musical stage at that time.
Initially, "Trial by Jury", which runs only 30 minutes or so, was played last on a triple bill, on which the main attraction, "<a href="La%20P%C3%A9richole">La Périchole</a>" (starring Dolaro as the title character, Fred Sullivan as Don Andres and <a href="Walter%20H.%20Fisher">Walter H. Fisher</a> as Piquillo), was preceded by the one-act <a href="farce">farce</a> "<a href="Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata">Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata</a>". The latter was immediately replaced by a series of other <a href="Curtain%20raiser%20%28drama%29">curtain raisers</a>. The composer conducted the first night's performance, and the theatre's music director, B. Simmons, conducted thereafter. The composer's brother, Fred Sullivan, starred as the Learned Judge, with <a href="Nellie%20Bromley">Nellie Bromley</a> as the Plaintiff. One of the choristers in "Trial by Jury", <a href="W.%20S.%20Penley">W. S. Penley</a>, was promoted in November 1875 to the small part of the <a href="Jury%23Composition%20of%20juries">Foreman</a> of the Jury and made a strong impact on audiences with his amusing facial expressions and gestures. In March 1876, he temporarily replaced Fred Sullivan as the Judge, when Fred's health declined from tuberculosis. With this start, Penley went on to a successful career as comic actor, culminating with the lead role in the record-breaking original production of "<a href="Charley%27s%20Aunt">Charley's Aunt</a>". Fred Sullivan died in January 1877.

<a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Jacques Offenbach</a>'s works were then at the height of their popularity in Britain, but "Trial by Jury" proved even more popular than "La Périchole", becoming an unexpected hit. "Trial by Jury" drew crowds and continued to run after "La Périchole" closed. While the Royalty Theatre closed for the summer in 1875, Dolaro immediately took "Trial" on tour in England and Ireland. The piece resumed at the Royalty later in 1875 and was revived for additional London seasons in 1876 at the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a> and in 1877 at the <a href="Royal%20Strand%20Theatre">Strand Theatre</a>.

"Trial by Jury" soon became the most desirable supporting piece for any London production, and, outside London, the major British theatrical touring companies had added it to their repertoire by about 1877. The original production was given a world tour by the <a href="Opera%20Comique">Opera Comique</a>'s assistant manager <a href="Emily%20Soldene">Emily Soldene</a>, which travelled as far as Australia. Unauthorised "pirate" productions quickly sprang up in America, taking advantage of the fact that American courts did not enforce foreign copyrights. It also became popular as part of the Victorian tradition of "benefit concerts", where the theatrical community came together to raise money for actors and actresses down on their luck or retiring. The <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a> continued to play the work for a century, licensing the piece to amateur and foreign professional companies, such as the <a href="J.%20C.%20Williamson%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Opera%20Company">J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company</a>. Since the copyrights to Gilbert and Sullivan works ran out in 1961, the piece has been available to theatre companies around the world free of royalties. The work's enduring popularity since 1875 makes it, according to theatrical scholar <a href="Kurt%20G%C3%A4nzl">Kurt Gänzl</a>, "probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time".

The success of "Trial by Jury" spurred several attempts to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan, but difficulties arose. Plans for a collaboration for Carl Rosa in 1875 fell through because Gilbert was too busy with other projects, and an attempted Christmas 1875 revival of "Thespis" by Richard D'Oyly Carte failed when the financiers backed out. Gilbert and Sullivan continued their separate careers, though both continued writing light opera, among other projects: Sullivan's next light opera, "<a href="The%20Zoo">The Zoo</a>", opened while "Trial by Jury" was still playing, in June 1875; and Gilbert's "<a href="Eyes%20and%20No%20Eyes">Eyes and No Eyes</a>" premiered a month later, followed by "<a href="Princess%20Toto">Princess Toto</a>" in 1876. Gilbert and Sullivan were not reunited until "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>" in 1877.


The curtain rises on the <a href="Court%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Court of the Exchequer</a>, where a jury and the public assemble to hear a case of <a href="breach%20of%20promise">breach of promise</a> of marriage.
The Usher introduces the proceedings by exhorting the jury to listen to the broken-hearted Plaintiff's case but telling them that they "needn't mind" what the "ruffianly defendant" has to say. He adds, however, that "From bias free of every kind, this trial must be tried!" The Defendant (Edwin) arrives, and the jurymen greet him with hostility, even though, as he points out, they have as yet no idea of the merits of his case. He tells them, with surprising candour, that he jilted the Plaintiff because she became a "bore intense" to him, and he then quickly took up with another woman. The jurymen recall their own wayward youth, but they are now respectable gentlemen and no longer have any sympathy for the Defendant.

The Judge enters with great pomp and describes how he rose to his position – by courting a rich attorney's "elderly, ugly daughter". The rich attorney then aided his prospective son-in-law's legal career until "at length I became as rich as the <a href="Gurney%27s%20bank">Gurneys</a>" and "threw over" the daughter. The jury and public are delighted with the judge, and ignore that he has just admitted to the same wrong of which the Defendant is accused.

The jury is then sworn in, and the Plaintiff (Angelina) is summoned. She is preceded into the courtroom by her bridesmaids, one of whom catches the eye of the judge. However, when Angelina herself arrives in full wedding dress, she instantly captures the heart of both Judge and jury. The Counsel for the Plaintiff makes a moving speech detailing Edwin's betrayal. Angelina feigns distress and staggers, first into the arms of the Foreman of the Jury, and then of the Judge. Edwin counters, explaining that his change of heart is only natural: 
<poem>
Oh, gentlemen, listen, I pray,
Of nature the laws I obey, 
The moon in her phases is found, 
The months in succession come round, 
</poem>
He offers to marry both the Plaintiff "and" his new love, if that would satisfy everyone. The Judge at first finds this "a reasonable proposition", but the Counsel argues that from the days of <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a>, it has been "a rather serious crime / To marry two wives at a time" (humorously, he labels the crime in question "<a href="burglary">burglary</a>" rather than "<a href="bigamy">bigamy</a>"). Perplexed, everyone in court ponders the "nice dilemma" in a parody of Italian opera ensembles.

Angelina desperately embraces Edwin, demonstrating the depth of her love, and bemoans her loss – all in evidence of the large amount of damages that the jury should force Edwin to pay. Edwin, in turn, says he is a smoker, a drunkard, and a bully (when tipsy), and that the Plaintiff could not have endured him even for a day; thus the damages should be small. The Judge suggests making Edwin tipsy to see if he would really "thrash and kick" Angelina, but everyone else (except Edwin) objects to this experiment. Impatient at the lack of progress, the Judge resolves the case by offering to marry Angelina himself. This is found quite satisfactory, and the opera is concluded with "joy unbounded".


For clarity, only characters with a major role in each particular song have been listed.

Reviews of the first performance of "Trial by Jury" were uniformly glowing. "<a href="Fun%20%28magazine%29">Fun</a>" magazine declared the opera "extremely funny and admirably composed", while the rival "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" magazine wrote that it "is the funniest bit of nonsense your representative has seen for a considerable time", only regretting that it was too short. The "<a href="News%20Chronicle">Daily News</a>" praised the author: "In whimsical invention and eccentric humour Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living rival among our dramatic writers, and never has his peculiar vein of drollery and satire been more conspicuous than in a little piece entitled "Trial by Jury"". "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" concluded that the piece illustrated the composer's "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class". Many critics emphasised the happy combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. One noted that "so completely is each imbued with the same spirit, that it would be as difficult to conceive the existence of Mr. Gilbert's verses without Mr. Sullivan's music, as of Mr. Sullivan's music without Mr. Gilbert's verses. Each gives each a double charm." Another agreed that "it seems, as in the great <a href="Wagner">Wagner</a>ian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain."

The opening night audience was also delighted by the piece, preferring it even to the Offenbach work: "To judge by the unceasing and almost boisterous hilarity which formed a sort of running commentary on the part of the audience, "Trial by Jury" suffered nothing whatever from so dangerous a juxtaposition [with a piece by the popular Offenbach]. On the contrary, it may fairly be said to have borne away the palm." A reviewer noted that "Laughter more frequent or more hearty was never heard in any theatre than that which more than once brought the action ... to a temporary standstill." Another paper summed up its popular appeal: ""Trial by Jury" is but a trifle – it pretends to be nothing more – but it is one of those merry bits of extravagance which a great many will go to see and hear, which they will laugh at, and which they will advise their friends to go and see, and therefore its success cannot be doubtful."

Among the actors, special critical praise was reserved for the composer's brother, Fred Sullivan, in the role of the Learned Judge: "The greatest 'hit' was made by Mr. F. Sullivan, whose blending of official dignity, condescension, and, at the right moment, extravagant humour, made the character of the Judge stand out with all requisite prominence, and added much to the interest of the piece." "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" concurred that his portrayal deserved "a special word of praise for its quiet and natural humour." Nelly Bromley (the Plaintiff), <a href="Walter%20H.%20Fisher">Walter H. Fisher</a> (the Defendant), John Hollingsworth (the Counsel) and others were also praised for their acting.

Later assessments of the work have been no less positive. In 1907, Gilbert's first biographer, Edith A. Browne, concluded: "In "Trial by Jury" we find author and composer looking at the humorous side of life from exactly the same point of view, and we at once realise how Gilbert and Sullivan have been able to do for Comic Opera what <a href="Wagner">Wagner</a> has done for Grand Opera by combining words and music so as to make them one." H. M. Walbrook similarly wrote in 1922:
The Gilbert and Sullivan biographer Michael Ainger, writing in 2002, 127 years after the premiere of the opera, explained its enduring appeal: "Nothing could be more serious than a court of law ... and now the world had been turned upside down. The court of law had become the scene of humor and frivolity; the learned judge had shown himself to be as fickle as the defendant, and the justice system turned out to be flawed by human frailty. And Sullivan had grasped the joke... From the first chords ... Sullivan's music sets the scene of mock-seriousness and proceeds to dance its way through the whole piece."

As the first <a href="Savoy%20opera">Savoy opera</a>, "Trial by Jury" marked an important moment in the history of the Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration, as well as in the careers of each of the two men and in Victorian drama in general. The historian Reginald Allen sums up the historical import of the opera:
<a href="Sidney%20Dark">Sidney Dark</a> and Rowland Grey also give a high value to the importance of "Trial by Jury" and the operas that followed: "There is not a little historical interest in the genesis of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the one English contribution of any value to dramatic literature for many generations." In addition, references to the opera continue today in the popular media and even in law cases.

"Trial by Jury" is the only Gilbert and Sullivan opera played in one act and the only theatrical work by W. S. Gilbert without spoken dialogue. However, later Gilbert and Sullivan operas retained a number of patterns seen in "Trial". For example, all except "<a href="The%20Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">The Yeomen of the Guard</a>" begin with a chorus number. Also, like "Trial by Jury", the later operas generally end with a relatively short finale consisting of a chorus number interspersed with short solos by the principal characters. "Comes the broken flower" (part of No. 3) was the first in a string of meditative "<a href="Horace">Horatian</a>" lyrics, "mingling happiness and sadness, an acceptance and a smiling resignation". These would, from this point forward, allow the characters, in each of the Savoy operas, an introspective scene where they stop and consider life, in contrast to the foolishness of the surrounding scenes. Like both of the tenor's arias in "Trial by Jury", tenor arias in later Savoy operas were set in <a href="Time%20signature">time</a> so frequently that <a href="Anna%20Russell">Anna Russell</a>, in her 1953 parody, "How to Write Your Own Gilbert and Sullivan Opera", exclaimed, "the tenor ... according to tradition, "must" sing an aria in time, usually accompanying himself on a stringed instrument". In "Trial by Jury" hypocrisy is revealed as the characters' motivations are held up to satire, and Gilbert mocks the underlying absurdity of the judicial procedures. As Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther explains, Gilbert combines his criticisms with comic entertainment, which renders them more palatable, while at the same time underlining their truth: "By laughing at a joke you show that you accept its premise." This too would become characteristic of Gilbert's work.
The judge's song, "When I, good friends, was called to the Bar" was followed by a string of similar <a href="patter%20song">patter song</a>s that would come to epitomise <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s collaboration. In these, often, a "dignified personage [would, just like the Judge,] supply a humorous biography of himself." Just as in Gilbert's earlier play, "<a href="The%20Palace%20of%20Truth">The Palace of Truth</a>", in these songs, the characters "naïvely reveal their innermost thoughts, unconscious of their egotism, vanity, baseness, or cruelty". Crowther points out that such revelations work particularly well in "Trial by Jury", because people commonly expect "characters singing in opera/operetta will communicate at a deeper level of truth than they would in mere speech." In "When I, good friends", the judge outlines the path of corruption that led to his becoming a judge, and this, too, would set the pattern for many of the patter songs in Gilbert and Sullivan operas to follow.

One of Gilbert's most notable innovations, first found in "Thespis" and repeated in "Trial by Jury" and all of the later Savoy operas, is the use of the chorus as an essential part of the action. In most earlier operas, <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesques</a>, and comedies, the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as "noise or ornament". In the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, however, the chorus is essential, taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own right. Sullivan recalled, "Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns, and were practically nothing more than a part of the stage setting. It was in 'Thespis' that Gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the performance. At this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience was, at that time, a tremendous novelty." Another Gilbert innovation, following the example of his mentor, <a href="T.%20W.%20Robertson">T. W. Robertson</a>, was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as possible: Gilbert based the scenery for the production on the <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a> Sessions House, where he had practised law in the 1860s. The costumes were contemporary, and Angelina and her bridesmaids were dressed in real wedding attire. This attention to detail and careful creation of realistic sets and scenes were typical of Gilbert's stage management and would be repeated in all of Gilbert's work. For instance, when preparing the sets for "<a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a>" (1878), Gilbert and Sullivan visited <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> to inspect ships. Gilbert made sketches of <a href="HMS%20Victory">H.M.S. "Victory"</a> and <a href="HMS%20St%20Vincent%20%281815%29">H.M.S. "St Vincent"</a> and created a model set for the carpenters to work from. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, where naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and where most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged.

Andrew Crowther places "Trial by Jury" at the centre of Gilbert's development as a librettist. He notes that in some of Gilbert's early libretti, such as "<a href="Topsyturveydom">Topsyturveydom</a>" (1874), the songs simply emphasise the dialogue. In others, such as "<a href="Thespis%20%28opera%29">Thespis</a>" (1871), some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and characterisation, such as "I once knew a chap" or "Little maid of Arcadee", which simply convey a moral lesson. In "Trial by Jury", however, each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the characters. In addition, unlike some of Gilbert's more fantastical early plots, "Aside from the ending, nothing essentially improbable happens." Gänzl agrees, writing that "Gilbert's libretto was superior to any of his previous efforts. It was concise, modern and satirical without being impossibly whimsical. Having no spoken dialogue it was perforce tightly constructed and allowed of no interpolation or alteration." Sullivan's development as a comic opera writer, too, would mature with "Trial by Jury". Except for incidental music for productions of Shakespeare, he had not written any music for the stage since "Thespis". Gänzl wrote that "Trial by Jury" "brought Sullivan firmly and finally into the world of the musical" stage and confirmed, after his previous success with "<a href="Cox%20and%20Box">Cox and Box</a>" and "Thespis", that "Sullivan was a composer of light lyric and comic music who could rival Offenbach, <a href="Alexandre%20Charles%20Lecocq">Lecocq</a> and any English musician alive."
Sullivan used the opportunities suggested by Gilbert's satire of the pomp and ceremony of the law to provide a variety of musical jokes. "From the first chords ... Sullivan's music sets the scene of mock-seriousness... His ... humorous use of the orchestra runs throughout". For example, <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>ing the plaintiff's calculated swooning in "That she is reeling is plain to see!" (No. 9) with a reeling, <a href="minor%20key">minor-key</a> theme in the string accompaniment, heading up and down the <a href="octave">octave</a>s. The instruments are also used to comically set the scene; for instance, he underlines the Counsel's misstatement in the line "To marry two at once is burglaree" with a comic <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> "sting" in octaves and has the Defendant tune his guitar on stage (simulated by a violin in the orchestra) in the opening to his song.

The score also contains two parodies or pastiches of other composers: No. 3, "All hail great Judge" is an elaborate parody of <a href="Handel">Handel</a>'s <a href="fugue">fugue</a>s, and No. 12, "A nice dilemma", parodies "dilemma" ensembles of Italian opera in the <a href="Bel%20canto">Bel canto</a> era; in particular "D'un pensiero" from Act I of <a href="Vincenzo%20Bellini">Bellini</a>'s "<a href="La%20sonnambula">La sonnambula</a>". "A nice dilemma" uses the dominant rhythm and key of "D'un pensiero" and divides up some of the choral lines between the <a href="basso">basses</a> and higher voices to create an "oom-pa-pa" effect common in Italian opera choruses.

After the premiere of "Trial by Jury" in 1875, <a href="operetta">operetta</a> companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere picked it up rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta. The first American productions were an unauthorized production at the Arch Street Theatre in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> on 22 October 1875 and a D'Oyly Carte production at the Eagle Theatre in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. It was even translated into German, and premièred as "Im Schwurgericht", at the <a href="Carltheater">Carltheater</a> on 14 September 1886, and as "Das Brautpaar vor Gericht" at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.

Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera companies (of which there were often several playing simultaneously) usually programmed "Trial by Jury" as a companion piece to "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>" or "<a href="H.M.S.%20Pinafore">H.M.S. Pinafore</a>". In the 1884–85 London production, a <a href="transformation%20scene">transformation scene</a> was added at the end, in which the Judge and Plaintiff became the <a href="Harlequinade">Harlequinade</a> characters Harlequin and Columbine and the set was consumed by red fire and flames. From 1894, the year when the <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a> established a year-round touring company that had most of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in its repertory, "Trial by Jury" was always included, except for 1901–03, and then again from 1943–46, when the company played a reduced repertory during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. From 1919, costumes were by <a href="Percy%20Anderson">Percy Anderson</a>, and a new touring set was designed by <a href="Peter%20Goffin">Peter Goffin</a> in 1957.

During the company's 1975 centennial performances of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, "Trial" was given four times, as a curtain raiser to "The Sorcerer", "Pinafore" and "Pirates" and as an afterpiece following "The Grand Duke". Before the first of the four performances of "Trial", a specially written curtain raiser by <a href="William%20Douglas-Home">William Douglas-Home</a>, called "Dramatic Licence", was played by <a href="Peter%20Pratt">Peter Pratt</a> as Carte, <a href="Kenneth%20Sandford">Kenneth Sandford</a> as Gilbert and <a href="John%20Ayldon">John Ayldon</a> as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of "Trial" in 1875. "Trial by Jury" was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.

The following table summarises the main London productions of "Trial by Jury" up to the time of Sullivan's death in 1900:

The exclusive performing rights to "Trial by Jury" and the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas were held by the <a href="D%27Oyly%20Carte%20Opera%20Company">D'Oyly Carte Opera Company</a> until their expiration in 1961, 50 years after Gilbert's death, and no other professional company was authorised to present the Savoy operas in Britain from 1877 until that date. The following tables show the casts of the principal original D'Oyly Carte productions and touring companies at approximately 10-year intervals through to the 1975 centenary season.

Starting in 1877, "Trial by Jury" was often given at benefit performances, usually for an actor or actress who had fallen on hard times, but occasionally for other causes. These were glittering affairs, with various celebrities appearing in principal roles or as part of the chorus. Gilbert himself played the silent role of the Associate on at least four occasions.

Arthur Sullivan conducted the 1877 benefit for the actor <a href="Henry%20Compton%20%28actor%29">Henry Compton</a>. At the Compton benefit, Penley and <a href="George%20Grossmith">George Grossmith</a> were members of the Jury, and a number of other famous actors and actresses were in the chorus. Sullivan also conducted the 1889 benefit for Barrington.

At the <a href="Nellie%20Farren">Nellie Farren</a> benefit, many of the performers listed below sat in the jury or the gallery, and "Trial by Jury" was followed by a six-hour-long concert. Performances were given by <a href="Henry%20Irving">Henry Irving</a>, <a href="Ellaline%20Terriss">Ellaline Terriss</a>, <a href="Marie%20Tempest">Marie Tempest</a>, <a href="Hayden%20Coffin">Hayden Coffin</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Roberts%20%28comedian%29">Arthur Roberts</a>, <a href="Letty%20Lind">Letty Lind</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Payne">Edmund Payne</a> and many others.

The <a href="Ellen%20Terry">Ellen Terry</a> benefit in 1906 was also a particularly well-attended affair, with <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a> numbered among the jury and <a href="Enrico%20Caruso">Enrico Caruso</a> singing, among many star performances.

The role of the Associate's Wife was especially created for the disabled soldiers' benefit performance and does not appear in any standard performances.

"Trial by Jury" has been recorded many times. Of the recordings by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, those recorded in 1927 and 1964 are ranked the best, according to the "Gilbert and Sullivan Discography", edited by Marc Shepherd. The 1961 Sargent and especially the 1995 Mackerras recordings are also rated highly by the Discography. The reviewer Michael Walters gives his highest praise to the 1924 recording, but he also likes the 1961 recording.

The Discography recommends the 1982 Brent Walker video, which is paired with "<a href="Cox%20and%20Box">Cox and Box</a>". More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the <a href="International%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Festival">International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival</a>.


Before the first performance of "Trial by Jury", some material was cut, including two songs and a <a href="recitative">recitative</a>: a song for the foreman of the jury, "Oh, do not blush to shed a tear", which was to be sung just after "Oh, will you swear by yonder skies"; and a recitative for the Judge and song for the Usher, "We do not deal with artificial crime" and "His lordship's always quits", which came just before "A nice dilemma". The melody for "His Lordship's always quits" is known, and it was reused in "I loved her fondly" in "The Zoo" and later modified into the main tune from "A wand'ring minstrel, I" in "<a href="The%20Mikado">The Mikado</a>". A few changes were made to the end of "I love him, I love him!" after the first night. A third verse for "Oh, gentlemen, listen I pray" was sung, at least on the first night, and part was quoted in a review in the "Pictorial World".

"Trial by Jury" underwent relatively minor textual changes after its first run, mainly consisting of insignificant amendments to wording. The most significant changes involve the ending. The original stage directions set up a simple <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>-style tableau:
This became much more elaborate in the 1884 revival, with the entire set being transformed, and the plaintiff climbing onto the Judge's back "à la fairy". In the 1920s, the plaster cupids were evidently damaged on a tour, and the transformation scene was abandoned completely.

Noronha skink

The Noronha skink ("Trachylepis atlantica") is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="skink">skink</a> from the island of <a href="Fernando%20de%20Noronha">Fernando de Noronha</a> off northeastern <a href="List%20of%20reptiles%20of%20Brazil">Brazil</a>. It is covered with dark and light spots on the upperparts and is usually about in length. The tail is long and muscular, but breaks off easily. Very common throughout Fernando de Noronha, it is an opportunistic feeder, eating both <a href="insect">insect</a>s and plant material, including <a href="nectar">nectar</a> from the "<a href="Erythrina%20velutina">Erythrina velutina</a>" tree, as well as other material ranging from cookie crumbs to eggs of its own species. <a href="Introduced%20species">Introduced</a> <a href="predation">predators</a> such as <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s prey on it and several <a href="parasitic%20worm">parasitic worm</a>s infect it.

Perhaps seen by <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> in 1503, it was first formally described in 1839. Its subsequent <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history has been complex, riddled with confusion with "<a href="Trachylepis%20maculata">Trachylepis maculata</a>" and other species, <a href="homonym%20%28biology%29">homonyms</a>, and other problems. The species is classified in the otherwise mostly African genus "<a href="Trachylepis">Trachylepis</a>" and is thought to have reached its island from Africa by <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafting</a>. The enigmatic "<a href="Trachylepis%20tschudii">Trachylepis tschudii</a>", supposedly from <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, may well be the same species.

In an early account of what may be Fernando de Noronha, purportedly based on a voyage by <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> in 1503, the island was said to be inhabited by "lizards with two tails", which is thought be a reference to the Noronha skink. The tail is long and fragile, and it breaks easily, like that of many skinks and other <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, following which it may <a href="Regeneration%20%28biology%29">regenerate</a>. However, when it does not completely break off, a new tail may nevertheless grow out of the broken part, so that the tail appears forked.

The species was first formally described by <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> in 1839, based on two specimens collected by <a href="HMS%20Chanticleer%20%281808%29">HMS "Chanticleer"</a> before 1838. He introduced the names "Tiliqua punctata", for the Noronha skink, and "Tiliqua maculata", for a species from <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, among many others. Six years later, he transferred both to the genus "<a href="Euprepis">Euprepis</a>". In 1887, <a href="George%20Albert%20Boulenger">George Boulenger</a> placed both in the genus "<a href="Mabuya">Mabuya</a>" (misspelled ""Mabuia"") and considered them identical, using the name ""Mabuia punctata"" for the species, which was said to occur both on Fernando de Noronha and in Guyana. He also included "<a href="Mabouya%20punctatissima">Mabouya punctatissima</a>" O'Shaughnessy, 1874, purportedly from South Africa, as a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>.

In 1900, L.G. Andersson claimed that Gray's name "punctata" was <a href="preoccupied%20name">preoccupied</a> by "Lacerta punctata" <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>, 1758, which he identified as "<a href="Mabuya%20homalocephala">Mabuya homalocephala</a>". He therefore replaced the name "punctata" with its <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> "maculata", using the name "Mabuya maculata" for the skink of Fernando de Noronha. Linnaeus's "Lacerta punctata" in fact refers to the Asian species "<a href="Lygosoma%20punctatum">Lygosoma punctatum</a>", not to "Mabuya homalocephala", but Gray's name "punctata" remains invalid regardless. In 1931, C.E. and M.D. Burt resurrected the name "Mabuya punctata" (now spelled correctly) for the Noronha skink, noting that it was "apparently a very distinct species", but did not mention "maculata", and in 1935, E.R. Dunn disputed Boulenger's conclusion as to the synonymy of "punctata" and "maculata" and, in apparent ignorance of Andersson's work, restored the name "Mabuya punctata" for the Noronha skink. He wrote that the Noronha skink was very distinct from other American "Mabuya" and more similar in some respects to African species.

<a href="Karl%20Patterson%20Schmidt">K.P. Schmidt</a>, in 1945, agreed with Dunn's conclusion that "maculata" and "punctata" of Gray were not the same, but he noted Andersson's point that "punctata" was preoccupied and therefore introduced the new name "Mabuya atlantica" to replace "punctata". The next year, H. Travassos, disagreeing with Dunn and unaware of Andersson's and Schmidt's contributions, considered both of Gray's names to be synonymous and restored the name "Mabuya punctata" for the Noronha skink. He also considered "Mabouya punctatissima" and "Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata" <a href="Johann%20Jakob%20von%20Tschudi">Tschudi</a>, 1845, described from Peru, as synonyms of this species. In 1948, he acknowledged the preoccupation of "punctata" noted by Andersson and accordingly retired "Mabuya punctata" in favor of "Mabuya maculata", as Andersson had done. The name "Mabuya maculata" remained in general usage for the Noronha skink in subsequent decades, though some have used "Mabuya punctata", "not ... aware of the last nomenclatural changes."

In 2002, P. Mausfeld and D. Vrcibradic published a note on the nomenclature of the Noronha skink informed by a re-examination of Gray's original <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type specimens</a>; despite extensive attempts to correctly name the species, they were apparently the first to do so since Boulenger in 1887. Based on differences in the number of <a href="scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a>, <a href="subdigital%20lamella">subdigital lamella</a>e (<a href="lamella%20%28zoology%29">lamellae</a> on the lower sides of the digits), and keels (longitudinal ridges) on the <a href="dorsal%20scales">dorsal scales</a> (located on the upperparts), as well as the separation of the <a href="parietal%20scales">parietal scales</a> (on the head behind the eyes) in "maculata", they concluded that the two were not, after all, identical, and that Schmidt's name "Mabuya atlantica" should therefore be used. Mausfeld and Vrcibradic considered "Mabouya punctatissima" to represent a different species on the basis of <a href="morphology%20%28anatomy%29">morphological</a> differences, but were unable to resolve the status of "Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata".

In the same year, Mausfeld and others conducted a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic</a> study on the Noronha skink, using the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> <a href="12S%20rRNA">12S</a> and <a href="16S%20ribosomal%20RNA">16S rRNA</a> genes, and showed that the species is more closely related to African than to South American "Mabuya" species, as previously suggested on the basis of morphological similarities. They split the old genus "Mabuya" into four genera for geographically discrete <a href="clade">clade</a>s, including "Euprepis" for the African–Noronha clade, thus renaming the Noronha species to "Euprepis atlanticus". In 2003, A.M. Bauer found that the name "Euprepis" had been incorrectly applied to this clade and that "<a href="Trachylepis">Trachylepis</a>" was correct instead, so that the Noronha skink is currently referred to as "Trachylepis atlantica". Additional molecular phylogenetic studies published in 2003 and 2006 confirmed the relationship between the Noronha skink and African "Trachylepis".

In 2009, Miralles and others reviewed the taxon "maculata" and concluded that the animal now known as "<a href="Trachylepis%20maculata">Trachylepis maculata</a>" also belongs in the African clade, but they were unable to determine whether or not it is indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed "Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata" and replaced it with "<a href="Trachylepis%20tschudii">Trachylepis tschudii</a>" because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's "punctata". Although they were unable to resolve the identity of "T. tschudii", which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter or simply a mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.

The Noronha skink is covered with light and dark spots above, but there is substantial variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front at the sides of the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. There are three to five well-developed <a href="auricular%20lobule">auricular lobule</a>s (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true "Mabuya". The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very <a href="brittleness">brittle</a>. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.

In reptiles, features of the <a href="scale%20%28zoology%29">scales</a> are important in distinguishing among species and groups of species. In the Noronha skink, the <a href="supranasal%20scale">supranasal scale</a>s (located above the nose) are in contact, as are the <a href="prefrontal%20scales">prefrontal scales</a> (behind the nose) in most individuals. The two <a href="frontoparietal%20scale">frontoparietal scale</a>s (above and slightly behind the eyes) are not fused. Unlike in "T. maculata", the <a href="parietal%20scales">parietal scales</a> (behind the frontoparietals) are in contact with each other. There are four <a href="supraocular%20scales">supraocular scales</a> (above the eyes) in almost all specimens and five <a href="supraciliary%20scale">supraciliary scale</a>s (immediately above the eyes, below the supraoculars). The <a href="dorsal%20scales">dorsal scales</a> (on the upperparts) have three keels, two fewer than in "T. maculata". There are 34 to 40 (mode 38) midbody scales (counted around the body midway between the fore- and hindlimbs), 58 to 69 (mode 63–64) dorsal, and 66 to 78 (mode 70) <a href="ventral%20scales">ventral</a> scales (on the underparts). "Mabuya" species and "T. maculata" generally have fewer midbody scales (up to 34). There are 21 to 29 subdigital lamellae under the fourth toe, more than in "T. maculata", which has 18. The Noronha skink has 26 <a href="presacral%20vertebra">presacral vertebra</a>e (located before the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>), similar to most "Trachylepis", but unlike American "Mabuya", which have at least 28.

Although there is substantial variation in measurements within the species, no discrete groups can be detected and it is not possible to separate the sexes unambiguously using measurements alone. Among 15 male and 21 female "T. atlantica" collected in 2006, snout to vent length was , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females and body mass was , averaging , in males and , averaging , in females. Males are significantly larger than females. In 100 specimens collected in 1876, head length was , averaging ; head width was , averaging , and tail length was , averaging 117 mm.

The Noronha skink is very abundant throughout Fernando de Noronha, even occurring commonly in houses, and also occurs on the smaller islands that surround the main island of the archipelago. Its abundance may be a result of the absence of ecologically similar competitors. Apart from "T. atlantica", the reptile fauna of Fernando de Noronha consists of the indigenous <a href="amphisbaenia">amphisbaenia</a>n "<a href="Amphisbaena%20ridleyi">Amphisbaena ridleyi</a>" and two <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> lizards, the gecko "<a href="tropical%20house%20gecko">Hemidactylus mabouia</a>" and the tegu "<a href="Argentine%20black%20and%20white%20tegu">Tupinambis merianae</a>".

The species is found in several <a href="habitat">microhabitats</a>, but most often on rocks. Although predominantly ground-dwelling, it is a good climber. Nothing is known about its reproduction except that skinks studied in late October and early November, during the dry season, showed little evidence of reproductive activity. The Noronha skink is <a href="oviparity">oviparous</a> (egg-laying), like many "Trachylepis", but unlike "Mabuya", which are all <a href="viviparity">viviparous</a> (giving live birth).

"Trachylepis atlantica" is active during the day. Its body temperature averages , a few degrees higher than the environment temperature. During the day, body temperature peaks at up to around midday and is lower earlier and later. In the early morning, the lizard may bask in the sun. During foraging, it spends about 28.4% of its time moving on average, a relatively high value for "Trachylepis".

A geologist who visited the island in 1876 noted that the skink is curious and bold:
While seated upon the bare rocks I have often observed these little animals watching me, apparently with as much curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads from side to side as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.

The Noronha skink is an opportunistic <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a> and "thrives on anything edible". Analysis of stomach contents indicates that it mainly eats plant material, at least during the dry period, but it also feeds on <a href="insect">insect</a>s, including larvae, <a href="termite">termite</a>s (Isoptera), <a href="ant">ant</a>s (Formicidae), and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s (Coleoptera). Its prey is mostly mobile, rather than sedentary, which is consistent with the relatively high proportion of time it spends moving. Related skink species eat mostly insects, but island populations may often be more herbivorous. Animal prey averages 6.9 mm in volume, less than in most other "Trachylepis".

When the mulungu tree "<a href="Erythrina%20velutina">Erythrina velutina</a>" blooms during the dry season, Noronha skinks climb up to to reach the <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s of the tree and to eat the <a href="nectar">nectar</a> by inserting their heads into the flowers. They probably use the nectar both for its sugar and water content. In this way, the skinks aid in <a href="pollination">pollinating</a> the tree, as they acquire pollen on their scales and leave pollen on <a href="stigma%20%28botany%29">stigmas</a> when visiting a flower. Pollination is rare behavior among lizards, but occurs most frequently in island species. Humans have introduced additional food sources to the island, including "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>" seeds, feces of the <a href="rock%20cavy">rock cavy</a> ("Kerodon rupestris"), carrion flies, juvenile "Hemidactylus mabouya", and even cookie crumbs given by tourists. The availability of these additional food sources may increase the abundance of the skink. In 1887, <a href="H.%20N.%20Ridley">H. N. Ridley</a> observed Noronha skinks eating banana skins and yolk from doves' eggs. Several cases of <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> have been reported, involving skinks eating eggs, juveniles, and the tail of an adult.

The Noronha skink probably lacked predators before Fernando de Noronha was discovered by humans, but several species that arrived since do prey on it, most commonly the <a href="cat">cat</a> ("Felis catus") and <a href="cattle%20egret">cattle egret</a> ("Bubulcus ibis"). These may negatively affect skink abundance at some localities on the island. The <a href="Tupinambis%20merianae">Argentine black and white tegu</a> lizard, "Tupinambis merianae", and three introduced <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, the <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus"), <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a> ("Rattus norvegicus") and <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"), have also been observed to eat Noronha skinks, but the rodents, particularly the house mouse, may have been scavenging on already dead skinks.

According to a 2006 study, the Noronha skink is infected by several <a href="parasitic%20worm">parasitic worm</a>s, most frequently by the <a href="nematode">nematode</a> "<a href="Spinicauda%20spinicauda">Spinicauda spinicauda</a>". Another nematode, "<a href="Moaciria%20alvarengai">Moaciria alvarengai</a>", is much rarer. Other rare parasites include two <a href="Trematoda">trematodes</a>—"<a href="Mesocoelium%20monas">Mesocoelium monas</a>" and an undetermined species of "<a href="Platynossomum">Platynossomum</a>"—and an undetermined species of "<a href="Oochoristica">Oochoristica</a>", a <a href="Cestoda">cestode</a>. "S. spinicauda" is usually only found in <a href="Teiidae">teiid</a> lizards; it may have entered the archipelago when "Tupinambis merianae", a teiid, was introduced to the island in 1960. Among nematodes, previous studies in 1956 and 1957 had only reported "M. alvarengai" and "<a href="Thelandros%20alvarengai">Thelandros alvarengai</a>" from the skink; the presence of "S. spinicauda" could explain the rarity of "M. alvarengai" and absence of "T. alvarengai" in Noronha skinks observed in 2006.

<a href="Cladistics">Phylogenetic</a> analyses using a variety of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial</a> and <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> genes places the Noronha skink among the tropical African species of "Trachylepis", a position also supported by morphological similarities. It may have arrived on its island on <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">rafting vegetation</a> from southwestern Africa via the <a href="Benguela%20Current">Benguela Current</a> and the <a href="South%20Equatorial%20Current">South Equatorial Current</a>, which passes Fernando de Noronha. This possibility was first suggested by <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> before 1888. Mausfeld and coworkers calculated that the journey from Africa to Fernando de Noronha would take 139 days. Because this period seemed too long for the skink to survive, they proposed that the Noronha skink instead arrived via <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a>, where a skink may have persisted into historical times.

The South American and Caribbean "<a href="Mabuya">Mabuya</a>" skinks form a clade that appears to be derived from a separate colonization from Africa. Both transatlantic <a href="colonisation%20%28biology%29">colonization</a> events are believed to have occurred within the last 9 million years.

Mechanical filter

A mechanical filter is a <a href="filter%20%28signal%20processing%29">signal processing filter</a> usually used in place of an <a href="electronic%20filter">electronic filter</a> at <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequencies</a>. Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others. The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal. At the input and output of the filter, <a href="transducer">transducer</a>s convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations.

The components of a mechanical filter are all directly analogous to the various elements found in electrical circuits. The mechanical elements obey mathematical functions which are identical to their corresponding electrical elements. This makes it possible to apply electrical network analysis and filter design methods to mechanical filters. Electrical theory has developed a large library of mathematical forms that produce useful filter <a href="linear%20filter%23Frequency%20response">frequency responses</a> and the mechanical filter designer is able to make direct use of these. It is only necessary to set the mechanical components to appropriate values to produce a filter with an identical response to the electrical counterpart.

<a href="Steel%20alloy">Steel alloy</a>s and <a href="iron%E2%80%93nickel%20alloy">iron–nickel alloy</a>s are common materials for mechanical filter components; nickel is sometimes used for the input and output couplings. Resonators in the filter made from these materials need to be machined to precisely adjust their <a href="resonance%20frequency">resonance frequency</a> before final assembly.

While the meaning of "mechanical filter" in this article is one that is used in an <a href="electromechanics">electromechanical</a> role, it is possible to use a mechanical design to filter mechanical vibrations or sound waves (which are also essentially mechanical) directly. For example, filtering of audio frequency response in the design of <a href="loudspeaker%20enclosure">loudspeaker cabinets</a> can be achieved with mechanical components. In the electrical application, in addition to mechanical components which correspond to their electrical counterparts, transducers are needed to convert between the mechanical and electrical domains. A representative selection of the wide variety of component forms and topologies for mechanical filters are presented in this article.

The theory of mechanical filters was first applied to improving the mechanical parts of <a href="phonograph">phonograph</a>s in the 1920s. By the 1950s mechanical filters were being manufactured as self-contained components for applications in radio transmitters and high-end receivers. The high "quality factor", "<a href="Q%20factor">Q</a>", that mechanical resonators can attain, far higher than that of an all-electrical <a href="RLC%20circuit%23Q%20factor">LC circuit</a>, made possible the construction of mechanical filters with excellent <a href="selectivity%20%28electronic%29">selectivity</a>. Good selectivity, being important in radio receivers, made such filters highly attractive. Contemporary researchers are working on microelectromechanical filters, the mechanical devices corresponding to electronic integrated circuits.

The elements of a <a href="Passivity%20%28engineering%29">passive</a> linear electrical network consist of <a href="inductor">inductor</a>s, <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a>s and <a href="resistor">resistor</a>s which have the properties of <a href="inductance">inductance</a>, elastance (inverse <a href="capacitance">capacitance</a>) and <a href="Electrical%20resistance">resistance</a>, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="stiffness">stiffness</a> and <a href="damping">damping</a>. In most electronic filter designs, only inductor and capacitor elements are used in the body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted <a href="parasitic%20element%20%28electrical%20networks%29">parasitic element</a>s. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.

The mechanical counterparts of <a href="voltage">voltage</a> and <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> in this type of analysis are, respectively, <a href="force">force</a> ("F") and <a href="velocity">velocity</a> ("v") and represent the signal waveforms. From this, a <a href="mechanical%20impedance">mechanical impedance</a> can be defined in terms of the imaginary <a href="angular%20frequency">angular frequency</a>, "jω", which entirely follows the electrical analogy.

The scheme presented in the table is known as the <a href="impedance%20analogy">impedance analogy</a>. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the <a href="mobility%20analogy">mobility analogy</a>, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, "M" → "C", "S" → 1/"L", "D" → "G" where "G" is <a href="electrical%20conductance">electrical conductance</a>, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the <a href="dual%20impedance">dual impedance</a> forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical <a href="Topology%20%28electronics%29">arrangement</a> of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.

Any mechanical component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence mechanical components are resonators and are often used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass in comparison to the compliance of the piece.

Mechanical parts act as a <a href="transmission%20line">transmission line</a> for mechanical vibrations. If the <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> is short in comparison to the part then a <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped element model</a> as described above is no longer adequate and a <a href="distributed%20element%20model">distributed element model</a> must be used instead. The mechanical distributed elements are entirely analogous to electrical distributed elements and the mechanical filter designer can use the methods of electrical <a href="distributed%20element%20filter">distributed element filter</a> design.

Mechanical filter design was developed by applying the discoveries made in electrical filter theory to mechanics. However, a very early example (1870s) of acoustic filtering was the "<a href="harmonic%20telegraph">harmonic telegraph</a>", which arose precisely because electrical resonance was poorly understood but <a href="mechanical%20resonance">mechanical resonance</a> (in particular, <a href="acoustic%20resonance">acoustic resonance</a>) was very familiar to engineers. This situation was not to last for long; <a href="electrical%20resonance">electrical resonance</a> had been known to science for some time before this, and it was not long before engineers started to produce all-electric designs for filters. In its time, though, the harmonic telegraph was of some importance. The idea was to combine several telegraph signals on one telegraph line by what would now be called <a href="frequency%20division%20multiplexing">frequency division multiplexing</a> thus saving enormously on line installation costs. The <a href="Telegraph%20key">key</a> of each operator activated a vibrating electromechanical reed which converted this vibration into an electrical signal. Filtering at the receiving operator was achieved by a similar reed tuned to precisely the same frequency, which would only vibrate and produce a sound from transmissions by the operator with the identical tuning.

Versions of the harmonic telegraph were developed by <a href="Elisha%20Gray">Elisha Gray</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>, <a href="Ernest%20Mercadier">Ernest Mercadier</a> and others. Its ability to act as a sound <a href="transducer">transducer</a> to and from the electrical domain was to inspire the invention of the telephone.

Once the basics of electrical network analysis began to be established, it was not long before the ideas of <a href="complex%20impedance">complex impedance</a> and <a href="filter%20design">filter design</a> theories were carried over into mechanics by analogy. <a href="Arthur%20E.%20Kennelly">Kennelly</a>, who was also responsible for introducing complex impedance, and <a href="Arthur%20Gordon%20Webster">Webster</a> were the first to extend the concept of impedance into mechanical systems in 1920. Mechanical admittance and the associated mobility analogy came much later and are due to Firestone in 1932.

It was not enough to just develop a mechanical analogy. This could be applied to problems that were entirely in the mechanical domain, but for mechanical filters with an electrical application it is necessary to include the transducer in the analogy as well. <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Poincaré</a> in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of <a href="linear%20algebra">linear algebra</a>ic equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity). These equations can be expressed as a matrix relationship in much the same way as the <a href="impedance%20parameters">z-parameters</a> of a <a href="two-port%20network">two-port network</a> in electrical theory, to which this is entirely analogous:

where "V" and "I" represent the voltage and current respectively on the electrical side of the transducer.

Wegel, in 1921, was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance. The element formula_2 is the open circuit mechanical impedance, that is, the impedance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when no current is entering the electrical side. The element formula_3, conversely, is the clamped electrical impedance, that is, the impedance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is clamped and prevented from moving (velocity is zero). The remaining two elements, formula_4 and formula_5, describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively. Once these ideas were in place, engineers were able to extend electrical theory into the mechanical domain and analyse an electromechanical system as a unified whole.

An early application of these new theoretical tools was in <a href="phonograph">phonograph</a>ic sound reproduction. A recurring problem with early phonograph designs was that mechanical resonances in the pickup and sound transmission mechanism caused excessively large peaks and troughs in the frequency response, resulting in poor sound quality. In 1923, Harrison of the <a href="Western%20Electric%20Company">Western Electric Company</a> filed a patent for a phonograph in which the mechanical design was entirely represented as an electrical circuit. The horn of the phonograph is represented as a transmission line, and is a resistive load for the rest of the circuit, while all the mechanical and acoustic parts—from the pickup needle through to the horn—are translated into lumped components according to the impedance analogy. The circuit arrived at is a <a href="ladder%20topology">ladder topology</a> of series resonant circuits coupled by shunt capacitors. This can be viewed as a <a href="bandpass%20filter">bandpass filter</a> circuit. Harrison designed the component values of this filter to have a specific passband corresponding to the desired audio passband (in this case 100 Hz to 6 kHz) and a flat response. Translating these electrical element values back into mechanical quantities provided specifications for the mechanical components in terms of mass and stiffness, which in turn could be translated into physical dimensions for their manufacture. The resulting phonograph has a flat frequency response in its passband and is free of the resonances previously experienced. Shortly after this, Harrison filed another patent using the same methodology on telephone transmit and receive transducers.
Harrison used <a href="George%20Ashley%20Campbell">Campbell</a>'s <a href="constant%20k%20filter">image filter</a> theory, which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an <a href="impedance%20matching">impedance matching</a> problem. More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by <a href="Edward%20Lawry%20Norton">Norton</a> in 1929 at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a>. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to <a href="Sidney%20Darlington">Darlington</a> the filter he designed as being "maximally flat". Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by <a href="Stephen%20Butterworth">Butterworth</a> who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic <a href="Butterworth%20filter">maximally flat filter</a>. The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter, that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is. Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the <a href="diaphragm%20%28acoustics%29">diaphragm</a>. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a <a href="prototype%20filter">low-pass prototype</a>. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the "<a href="Equivalent%20impedance%20transforms%23Transform%205.2">turning round the L</a>" impedance transform to achieve this.

The definitive description of the subject from this period is Maxfield and Harrison's 1926 paper. There, they describe not only how mechanical bandpass filters can be applied to sound reproduction systems, but also apply the same principles to recording systems and describe a much improved disc cutting head.

The first volume production of mechanical filters was undertaken by <a href="Collins%20Radio">Collins Radio Company</a> starting in the 1950s. These were originally designed for telephone frequency-division multiplex applications where there is commercial advantage in using high quality filters. Precision and steepness of the transition band leads to a reduced width of <a href="guard%20band">guard band</a>, which in turn leads to the ability to squeeze more telephone channels into the same cable. This same feature is useful in radio transmitters for much the same reason. Mechanical filters quickly also found popularity in VHF/UHF radio <a href="intermediate%20frequency">intermediate frequency</a> (IF) stages of the high end radio sets (military, marine, <a href="amateur%20radio">amateur radio</a> and the like) manufactured by Collins. They were favoured in the radio application because they could achieve much higher Q-factors than the equivalent "LC" filter. High "Q" allows filters to be designed which have high <a href="selectivity%20%28electronic%29">selectivity</a>, important for distinguishing adjacent radio channels in receivers. They also had an advantage in stability over both "LC" filters and monolithic <a href="crystal%20filter">crystal filter</a>s. The most popular design for radio applications was torsional resonators because radio IF typically lies in the 100 to 500 kHz band.

Both <a href="magnetostrictive">magnetostrictive</a> and <a href="piezoelectric">piezoelectric</a> transducers are used in mechanical filters. Piezoelectric transducers are favoured in recent designs since the piezoelectric material can also be used as one of the resonators of the filter, thus reducing the number of components and thereby saving space. They also avoid the susceptibility to extraneous magnetic fields of the magnetostrictive type of transducer.

A magnetostrictive material is one which changes shape when a magnetic field is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the magnetostrictive material. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from the motion of the transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a <a href="direct%20current">d.c.</a> current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.

The usual magnetostrictive materials used for the transducer are either <a href="Ferrite%20%28magnet%29">ferrite</a> or compressed powdered <a href="iron">iron</a>. Mechanical filter designs often have the resonators coupled with steel or nickel-iron wires, but on some designs, especially older ones, nickel wire may be used for the input and output rods. This is because it is possible to wind the transducer coil directly on to a nickel coupling wire since nickel is slightly magnetostrictive. However, it is not strongly so and coupling to the electrical circuit is weak. This scheme also has the disadvantage of <a href="eddy%20current">eddy current</a>s, a problem that is avoided if ferrites are used instead of nickel.

The coil of the transducer adds some inductance on the electrical side of the filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which can be incorporated into the filter design. While this will not improve performance to the extent that an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.

A piezoelectric material is one which changes shape when an electric field is applied. In reverse, it produces an electric field when it is distorted. A piezoelectric transducer, in essence, is made simply by plating <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s on to the piezoelectric material. Early piezoelectric materials used in transducers such as <a href="barium%20titanate">barium titanate</a> had poor temperature stability. This precluded the transducer from functioning as one of the resonators; it had to be a separate component. This problem was solved with the introduction of <a href="lead%20zirconate%20titanate">lead zirconate titanate</a> (abbreviated PZT) which is stable enough to be used as a resonator. Another common piezoelectric material is <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, which has also been used in mechanical filters. However, <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> materials such as PZT are preferred for their greater <a href="electromechanical%20coupling%20coefficient">electromechanical coupling coefficient</a>.

One type of piezoelectric transducer is the Langevin type, named after a transducer used by <a href="Paul%20Langevin">Paul Langevin</a> in early <a href="sonar">sonar</a> research. This is good for longitudinal modes of vibration. It can also be used on resonators with other modes of vibration if the motion can be mechanically converted into a longitudinal motion. The transducer consists of a layer of piezoelectric material sandwiched transversally into a coupling rod or resonator.

Another kind of piezoelectric transducer has the piezoelectric material sandwiched in longitudinally, usually into the resonator itself. This kind is good for <a href="Torsion%20%28mechanics%29">torsional</a> vibration modes and is called a torsional transducer.

It is possible to achieve an extremely high "<a href="Q%20factor">Q</a>" with mechanical resonators. Mechanical resonators typically have a "Q" of 10,000 or so, and 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy. This is an unreasonably high figure to achieve with LC circuits, whose "Q" is limited by the resistance of the inductor coils.

Early designs in the 1940s and 1950s started by using steel as a resonator material. This has given way to nickel-iron alloys, primarily to maximise the "Q" since this is often the primary appeal of mechanical filters rather than price. Some of the metals that have been used for mechanical filter resonators and their "Q" are shown in the table.

Piezoelectric crystals are also sometimes used in mechanical filter designs. This is especially true for resonators that are also acting as transducers for inputs and outputs.

One advantage that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters is that they can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5 <a href="parts%20per%20billion">parts per billion</a> (ppb) from the specified value over the operating temperature range (), and its average drift with time can be as low as 4 ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the <a href="Young%27s%20modulus">Young's modulus</a>, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. Materials are therefore sought that have a small <a href="temperature%20coefficient">temperature coefficient</a> of Young's modulus. In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.

It is usually possible for a mechanical part to <a href="vibration">vibrate</a> in a number of different <a href="vibration%20mode">modes</a>, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward <a href="longitudinal%20stress">longitudinal</a> mode some others which are used include <a href="flexural%20strength">flexural</a> mode, <a href="torsional%20vibration">torsional mode</a>, radial mode and <a href="vibrations%20of%20a%20circular%20drum">drumhead mode</a>.

Modes are numbered according to the number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number. When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second flexural mode, (5e) first radial expansion mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.

There are a great many combinations of resonators and transducers that can be used to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in <a href="antiphase">antiphase</a> to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal. Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a <a href="Signal%20chain%20%28signal%20processing%20chain%29">chain</a> by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers. Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa. Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.

The various types of resonator are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700 kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few <a href="kilohertz">kilohertz</a> (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100 kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300 kHz.

The frequency response behaviour of all mechanical filters can be expressed as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An example of this is shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular <a href="Analogue%20filter%23Approximation">finite element approximations</a> to an ideal filter response of the <a href="Butterworth%20filter">Butterworth</a> and <a href="Chebyshev%20filter">Chebyshev filter</a>s can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.

Frequencies of the order of <a href="megahertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) are above the usual range for mechanical filters. The components start to become very small, or alternatively the components are large compared to the signal wavelength. The <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped element model</a> described above starts to break down and the components must be considered as <a href="distributed%20element%20model">distributed elements</a>. The frequency at which the transition from lumped to distributed models takes place is much lower for mechanical filters than it is for their electrical counterparts. This is because mechanical vibrations travel at the speed of sound for the material the component is composed of. For solid components, this is many times (x15 for nickel-iron) the speed of sound in air () but still considerably less than the speed of electromagnetic waves (approx. in vacuum). Consequently, mechanical wavelengths are much shorter than electrical wavelengths for the same frequency. Advantage can be taken of these effects by deliberately designing components to be distributed elements, and the components and methods used in electrical <a href="distributed%20element%20filter">distributed element filter</a>s can be brought to bear. The equivalents of <a href="stub%20%28electronics%29">stubs</a> and <a href="quarter%20wave%20impedance%20transformer">impedance transformers</a> are both achievable. Designs which use a mixture of lumped and distributed elements are referred to as semi-lumped.

An example of such a design is shown in figure 10a. The resonators are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.

Bridging wires are rods that couple together resonators that are not adjacent. They can be used to produce <a href="pole%20%28complex%20analysis%29">poles</a> of attenuation in the <a href="stopband">stopband</a>. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the <a href="passband">passband</a> edge, it also has the benefit of increasing <a href="roll-off">roll-off</a> and narrowing the <a href="transition%20band">transition band</a>. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.

The method of coupling between non-adjacent resonators is not limited to mechanical filters. It can be applied to other filter formats and the general term for this class is <a href="cross-coupled%20filter">cross-coupled filter</a>. For instance, channels can be cut between <a href="cavity%20resonator">cavity resonator</a>s, <a href="mutual%20inductance">mutual inductance</a> can be used with discrete component filters, and feedback paths can be used with active <a href="analogue%20filter">analogue</a> or <a href="digital%20filter">digital filter</a>s. Nor was the method first discovered in the field of mechanical filters; the earliest description is in a 1948 patent for filters using <a href="microwave">microwave</a> cavity resonators. However, mechanical filter designers were the first (1960s) to develop practical filters of this kind and the method became a particular feature of mechanical filters.

A new technology emerging in mechanical filtering is <a href="microelectromechanical%20systems">microelectromechanical systems</a> (MEMS). MEMS are very small <a href="micromachine">micromachine</a>s with component sizes measured in <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s (μm), but not as small as <a href="nanotechnology">nanomachines</a>. These filters can be designed to operate at much higher frequencies than can be achieved with traditional mechanical filters. These systems are mostly fabricated from <a href="silicon">silicon</a> (Si), <a href="silicon%20nitride">silicon nitride</a> (SiN), or <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s. A common component used for <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequency</a> filtering (and MEMS applications generally), is the <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> resonator. Cantilevers are simple mechanical components to manufacture by much the same methods used by the semiconductor industry; masking, <a href="photolithography">photolithography</a> and etching, with a final undercutting etch to separate the cantilever from the substrate. The technology has great promise since cantilevers can be produced in large numbers on a single substrate—much as large numbers of transistors are currently contained on a single silicon chip.

The resonator shown in figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30 GHz have been produced using cantilever <a href="varactor">varactor</a>s as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5 mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200 MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, can be used in the microwave bands. Extremely high "Q" resonators can be made with this technology; flexural mode resonators with a "Q" in excess of 80,000 at 8 MHz are reported.

The precision applications in which mechanical filters are used require that the resonators are accurately adjusted to the specified resonance frequency. This is known as "trimming" and usually involves a mechanical machining process. In most filter designs, this can be difficult to do once the resonators have been assembled into the complete filter so the resonators are trimmed before assembly. Trimming is done in at least two stages; coarse and fine, with each stage bringing the resonance frequency closer to the specified value. Most trimming methods involve removing material from the resonator which will increase the resonance frequency. The target frequency for a coarse trimming stage consequently needs to be set below the final frequency since the <a href="engineering%20tolerance">tolerances</a> of the process could otherwise result in a frequency higher than the following fine trimming stage could adjust for.

The coarsest method of trimming is <a href="Grinding%20%28abrasive%20cutting%29">grinding</a> of the main resonating surface of the resonator; this process has an accuracy of around . Better control can be achieved by grinding the edge of the resonator instead of the main surface. This has a less dramatic effect and consequently better accuracy. Processes that can be used for fine trimming, in order of increasing accuracy, are <a href="Abrasive%20blasting">sandblasting</a>, drilling, and <a href="laser%20ablation">laser ablation</a>. Laser trimming is capable of achieving an accuracy of .

Trimming by hand, rather than machine, was used on some early production components but would now normally only be encountered during product development. Methods available include <a href="sanding">sanding</a> and <a href="File%20%28tool%29">filing</a>. It is also possible to add material to the resonator by hand, thus reducing the resonance frequency. One such method is to add <a href="solder">solder</a>, but this is not suitable for production use since the solder will tend to reduce the high "Q" of the resonator.

In the case of MEMS filters, it is not possible to trim the resonators outside of the filter because of the integrated nature of the device construction. However, trimming is still a requirement in many MEMS applications. Laser ablation can be used for this but material deposition methods are available as well as material removal. These methods include <a href="Pulsed%20laser%20deposition">laser</a> or <a href="Ion%20beam%20deposition">ion-beam induced deposition</a>.

Zaian War

The Zaian (or Zayan) War was fought between France and the <a href="Zaian%20confederation">Zaian confederation</a> of <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a> tribes in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> between 1914 and 1921. Morocco had become a French protectorate in 1912, and <a href="List%20of%20French%20residents-general%20in%20Morocco">Resident-General</a> <a href="Louis-Hubert%20Lyautey">Louis-Hubert Lyautey</a> sought to extend French influence eastwards through the <a href="Middle%20Atlas">Middle Atlas</a> mountains towards <a href="French%20Algeria">French Algeria</a>. This was opposed by the Zaians, led by <a href="Mouha%20ou%20Hammou%20Zayani">Mouha ou Hammou Zayani</a>. The war began well for the French, who quickly took the key towns of <a href="Taza">Taza</a> and <a href="Kh%C3%A9nifra">Khénifra</a>. Despite the loss of their base at Khénifra, the Zaians inflicted heavy losses on the French, who responded by establishing "groupes mobiles", <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> formations that mixed regular and irregular infantry, cavalry and artillery into a single force.

The outbreak of the First World War proved significant, with the withdrawal of troops for service in France compounded by the loss of more than 600 French killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20El%20Herri">Battle of El Herri</a>. Lyautey reorganised his available forces into a "living barricade", consisting of outposts manned by his best troops protecting the perimeter of French territory with lower quality troops manning the rear-guard positions. Over the next four years the French retained most of their territory despite intelligence and financial support provided by the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> to the Zaian Confederation and continual raids and skirmishes reducing scarce French manpower.

After the signing of the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice with Germany</a> in November 1918, significant forces of tribesmen remained opposed to French rule. The French resumed their offensive in the Khénifra area in 1920, establishing a series of <a href="blockhouse">blockhouse</a>s to limit the Zaians' freedom of movement. They opened negotiations with Hammou's sons, persuading three of them, along with many of their followers, to submit to French rule. A split in the Zaian Confederation between those who supported submission and those still opposed led to infighting and the death of Hammou in Spring 1921. The French responded with a strong, three-pronged attack into the Middle Atlas that pacified the area. Some tribesmen, led by <a href="Moha%20ou%20Said">Moha ou Said</a>, fled to the High Atlas and continued a guerrilla war against the French well into the 1930s.

The signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fez">Treaty of Fez</a> in 1912 established a French protectorate over Morocco. The treaty had been prompted by the <a href="Agadir%20Crisis">Agadir Crisis</a> of 1911, during which French and Spanish troops had been sent to Morocco to put down a rebellion against <a href="Abd%20al-Hafid%20of%20Morocco">Sultan Abdelhafid</a>. The <a href="French%20protectorate%20in%20Morocco">new French protectorate</a> was led by a <a href="List%20of%20French%20residents-general%20in%20Morocco">resident-general</a>, <a href="Louis-Hubert%20Lyautey">Louis-Hubert Lyautey</a>, and adopted the traditional Moroccan way of governing through the tribal system. Upon taking up his post Lyautey replaced Abdelhafid with his brother, <a href="Yusef%20of%20Morocco">Yusef</a>. The tribes took offence at this, installing their own Sultan, <a href="Ahmed%20al-Hiba">Ahmed al-Hiba</a>, in <a href="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a> and taking eight Europeans captive. Lyautey acted quickly against the revolt, dispatching General <a href="Charles%20Mangin">Charles Mangin</a> and 5,000 troops to retake the town. Mangin's men were highly successful, rescuing the captives and inflicting heavy casualties on vastly superior numbers of tribesmen for the loss of 2 men killed and 23 wounded. Al-Hiba escaped to the Atlas mountains with a small number of his followers and opposed French rule until his death in 1919.
A popular idea among the public in France was to possess an unbroken stretch of territory from <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> to the Atlantic Ocean, including expansion into the "<a href="Taza">Taza</a> corridor" in the Moroccan interior. Lyautey was in favour of this and advocated French occupation of the <a href="Middle%20Atlas">Middle Atlas</a> mountains near Taza, through peaceful means where possible. This French expansion into the Middle Atlas was strongly opposed by the "powerful Berber trinity" of <a href="Mouha%20ou%20Hammou%20Zayani">Mouha ou Hammou Zayani</a>, leader of the <a href="Zaian%20Confederation">Zaian Confederation</a>; <a href="Moha%20ou%20Said">Moha ou Said</a>, leader of the <a href="A%C3%AFt%20Ouirra">Aït Ouirra</a>; and <a href="Ali%20Amhaouch">Ali Amhaouch</a>, a religious leader of the <a href="Darqawa">Darqawa</a> variant of Islam prevalent in the region.

Hammou commanded between 4,000 and 4,200 tents of people and had led the Zaians since 1877, opposing the French since the start of their involvement in Morocco. An enemy of the French following their deposing of Sultan Abdelhafid, who was married to Hammou's daughter, he had declared a <a href="Religious%20war">holy war</a> against them and intensified his tribe's attacks on pro-French (or "submitted") tribes and military convoys. Said was an old man, who was held in good standing by tribesmen across the region and had formerly been a <a href="Qaid">caïd</a> (a local governor with almost absolute power) for the Moroccan government, even serving in the army of Sultan <a href="Abdelaziz%20of%20Morocco">Abdelaziz</a> against a pretender at Taza in 1902. Despite initially being open to negotiations with the French, pressure from pro-war chiefs and the fear of ridicule from his tribesmen had dissuaded him. Amhaouch was a strong and influential man, described by French officer and explorer <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Segonzac">René de Segonzac</a> as one of the "great spiritual leaders of Morocco" and the "most powerful religious personality of the south east". The French had attempted to persuade the Zaians to submit since 1913 with little success; most tribes in the confederation remained opposed to French rule.

Lyautey's plans for taking Taza also extended to capturing <a href="Kh%C3%A9nifra">Khénifra</a>, Hammou's headquarters. He had been advised by his political officer, <a href="Maurice%20Le%20Glay">Maurice Le Glay</a> that doing so would "finish him off definitively" and cut the Zaians off from support of other tribes. The French outpost at nearby <a href="Kasba%20Tadla">Kasbah Tadla</a> had recently been attacked by Said and subsequent peace negotiations led by Lyautey's head of intelligence, Colonel <a href="Henri%20Simon">Henri Simon</a>, had achieved little. As a result, Mangin was authorised to lead a retaliatory raid to Said's camp at <a href="El%20Ksiba">El Ksiba</a> but, despite inflicting heavy casualties, was forced to withdraw with the loss of 60 killed, 150 wounded and much equipment abandoned. Having failed to make any impression on the Zaians through negotiation in May 1914, Lyautey authorised General <a href="Paul%20Prosper%20Henrys">Paul Prosper Henrys</a> to take command of all French troops in the area and launch an attack on Taza and Khénifra. Henrys captured Taza within a few days using units drawn from garrisons in Fez, <a href="Meknes">Meknes</a>, Rabat and Marrakesh and then turned his attention to Khénifra.

Henrys planned his assault on Khénifra to begin on 10 June 1914 with the dispatch of three columns of troops, totalling 14,000 men equipped with wireless radios and supported by <a href="reconnaissance%20aircraft">reconnaissance aircraft</a>. One column was to set out from Meknes under the command of <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> <a href="Henri%20Claudel">Henri Claudel</a>, another from Rabat under Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Gaston%20Cros">Gaston Cros</a> and the third from Kasbah Tadla under <a href="Colonel">Colonel</a> <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Garnier-Duplessix">Noël Garnier-Duplessix</a>. Henrys took overall command, directing the forces from an <a href="Armored%20car%20%28military%29">armoured car</a> within the Claudel column. Aware that he knew little of the terrain or the allegiance of local tribes Henrys offered a generous set of terms for tribesmen who submitted to French rule: they would have to surrender only their rapid firing rifles and any captured French supplies, and pay a small tax in return for protection. He also set aside substantial funds to bribe informants and tribal leaders.

Despite these measures, Claudel's column came under attack before it even left Meknes, although it was the largest and intended as a diversion. Hammou's forces attacked their camp on three separate nights, inflicting losses of at least one officer and four men killed and nineteen injured, but leaving the other two columns unopposed. Claudel launched a counterattack on 10 June while Hammou was preparing a fourth attack, sweeping the Zaians away with artillery and ensuring little resistance for his march to Khénifra on the next day. After enduring some sniping attacks in Teguet, Claudel's cavalry crossed the <a href="Oum%20Er-Rbia%20River">Oum er Rbia</a> at <a href="el%20Bordj%2C%20Morocco">el Bordj</a> and advanced to the outskirts of Khénifra. The rest of the column joined them on 12 June, fighting off Zaian attacks on the way and meeting up with the other two columns, finding the town emptied of people and raising the French flag. The column had lost two men killed in the march.
The columns experienced repeated, strong attacks by Zaian tribesmen that day, repelled by late afternoon at the cost of five men killed and nineteen wounded. Further attacks on the nights of 14 and 15 June were repulsed by artillery and machine gun fire, directed by searchlights. Henrys then dispatched two columns south to the Zaian stronghold of <a href="Adersan">Adersan</a> to burn houses, proving his military abilities but not provoking a decisive confrontation with the tribes, who returned to guerrilla warfare tactics. In response all French-controlled markets were closed to the Zaians and their trade convoys were intercepted.

Henrys became aware of a Zaian presence at el Bordj and sent a column to attack them on 31 June. South of el Bordj the French came under heavy fire from tribesmen with modern rifles and resorted to <a href="bayonet%20charge">bayonet charge</a>s to clear the way. The encounter was Henrys' first major engagement with the Zaians and his losses were high, 1 officer and 16 men killed and a further 2 officers and 75 men wounded. Zaian losses were much higher: the French counted at least 140 dead remaining on the battlefield, and considered the battle a victory. Henrys expected a pause in activity while the Zaians recovered, but instead Hammou stepped up attacks on the French. Just four days later an attack on a French convoy by 500 mounted tribesmen was only repulsed after several hours by more bayonet charges. French losses were again significant with one officer and ten men killed and thirty men wounded.

In light of the increased attacks in the Khénifra area Henrys established three "groupes mobiles", made up of troops mostly drawn from the <a href="Army%20of%20Africa%20%28France%29">Army of Africa</a>. Each "groupe" was designed to be highly mobile and typically consisted of several <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s of regular infantry (Algerian and Senegalese <a href="Tirailleur">Tirailleur</a>s or <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a> troops), a <a href="Squadron%20%28army%29">squadron</a> of cavalry (Algerian <a href="Spahi">Spahi</a>s), a few <a href="Artillery%20battery">batteries</a> of artillery (<a href="field%20artillery">field</a> or <a href="mountain%20artillery">mountain</a>), a <a href="Section%20%28military%20unit%29">section</a> of <a href="Hotchkiss%20M1914%20machine%20gun">Hotchkiss machine gun</a>s and a mule train for supplies under the overall leadership of a French senior officer. In addition each "groupe mobile" would have one or two "goums" (informal groups of around 200 men) of "<a href="Moroccan%20Goumier">goumiers</a>", <a href="Irregular%20military">irregular tribal auxiliaries</a>, under the leadership of a French intelligence officer. The "goums" were used for intelligence gathering operations and in areas of difficult terrain.

A four-battalion-strong "groupe mobile" was established at Khénifra, under Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Laverdure">René Laverdure</a>; one based to the west under Claudel and one to the east under Garnier-Duplessix. In addition fortified posts were established at <a href="M%27Rirt">M'Rirt</a> and <a href="Sidi%20Lamine">Sidi Lamine</a> with the areas between patrolled by "goumiers" to protect convoys and submitted tribes from attack. Increasing attacks on Khénifra throughout July, repelled only by concentrated artillery and machine gun fire, left Henrys concerned that a combined force of tribesmen could threaten the town and the submitted tribes. This fear was partially allayed by the separate defeats of Hammou and Amhaouch by the "groupes mobiles" of Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix and by increasing numbers of auxiliaries becoming available from newly submitted tribes through the <a href="Conscription">levy</a> system.

Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix were ordered to patrol the French bank of the Oum er Rbia and attempt to separate the Zaians from the <a href="Chleuh">Chleuh</a> to the south while Henrys planned for an advance through the Middle Atlas to the <a href="Guigou%20River">Guigou River</a>. These operations were halted by the reduction in forces imposed on him by the outbreak of the First World War in Europe.

Lyautey received orders from Army headquarters in Paris on 28 July 1914 the day the First World War began, requesting the dispatch of all available troops to France in anticipation of a <a href="Schlieffen%20Plan">German invasion</a> and the withdrawal of his remaining forces to more defensible coastal enclaves. The French government justified this stance by stating that the "fate of Morocco will be determined in <a href="Lorraine%20%28region%29">Lorraine</a>". Lyautey, who had lost most of his own possessions when his house in <a href="Cr%C3%A9vic">Crévic</a> had been burnt to the ground by <a href="Battle%20of%20Lorraine">advancing German forces</a>, was keen to support the defence of France and within a month had sent 37 infantry and cavalry battalions and six artillery batteries to the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> – more than had been requested of him. A further 35,000 Moroccan labourers were recruited by Lyautey over the course of the war for service in France.
Nevertheless, Lyautey did not wish to abandon the inland territory his men had fought so hard for, stating that if he withdrew "such a shock would result immediately all over Morocco ... that a general revolt would arise under our feet, on all our points". Left with just 20 battalions of legionnaires (mainly German and Austrian), military criminals of the <a href="Battalions%20of%20Light%20Infantry%20of%20Africa">Infanterie Légère d'Afrique</a>, <a href="Military%20reserve%20forces%20of%20France">territorial reservists</a>, <a href="Senegalese%20Tirailleurs">Senegalese Tirailleurs</a> and "goumiers", he switched from the offensive to a long-term strategy of "active defence". Lyautey withdrew all non-essential personnel from his rear garrisons, brought in elderly reservists from France and issued weapons and elements of military dress to civilians in an attempt to convince the tribes that the French army in Morocco was as strong as before. Lyautey referred to this move as similar to hollowing out a lobster while leaving the shell intact. His plan depended on holding a "living barricade" of French outposts running from Taza in the north through Khenifra, Kasbah Tadla and Marrakesh to Agadir on the Atlantic coast.

Lyautey and Henrys intended to hold the Berbers in their current positions until they had sufficient resources to return to the offensive. The recent French advances and troop withdrawals had left Khénifra badly exposed and from 4 August – the day two battalions of infantry left the garrison for France – the Zaian tribes launched a month-long attack on the town, supply convoys and withdrawing French troops "without interruption". Lyautey was determined to hold Khénifra to use as a bridgehead for further expansion of French territory and referred to it as a bastion against the "hostile Berber masses" upon which the "maintenance of [his] occupation" depended. Attacks on Khénifra threatened the vital communication corridor between French forces in Morocco and those in Algeria. To relieve pressure on the town, Claudel and Garnier-Duplessix's "groupes mobiles" engaged Hammou and Amhaouch's forces at <a href="Mahajibat">Mahajibat</a>, <a href="Bou%20Moussa">Bou Moussa</a> and <a href="Bou%20Arar">Bou Arar</a> on 19, 20 and 21 August, inflicting "considerable losses". This, combined with the reinforcement of Khenifra on 1 September, led to reduced attacks, decreasing to a state of "armed peace" by November.
Henrys began to move towards a more offensive posture, ordering mobile columns to circulate through the Middle Atlas and mounted companies to patrol the plains. This was part of his plan to maintain pressure on Hammou, who he considered to be the linchpin of the "artificial" Zaian Confederation and responsible for their continued resistance. Henrys was counting on the onset of winter to force the Zaians from the mountains to their lowland pastures where they could be confronted or persuaded to surrender. In some cases the war assisted Lyautey, allowing him a freer hand in his overall strategy, greater access to finance and the use of at least 8,000 German <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> to construct essential infrastructure. In addition the increased national pride led many middle-aged French immigrants in Morocco to enlist in the army and, though they were of poor fighting quality, Lyautey was able to use these men to maintain the appearance of a large force under his command.

When Henrys had successfully repulsed the attacks on Khénifra, he believed he had the upper hand, having proven that the reduced French forces could resist the tribesmen. The Zaians were now contained within a triangle formed by the Oum er Rbia River, the Serrou River and the Atlas Mountains, and were already in dispute with neighbouring tribes over the best wintering land. Hammou decided to winter at the small village of <a href="El%20Herri">El Herri</a>, from Khénifra, and established a camp of around 100 tents there. Hammou had been promised peace talks by the French, and Lyautey twice refused Laverdure permission to attack him and ordered him to remain on the French bank of the Oum er Rbia. On 13 November Laverdure decided to disobey these orders and marched to El Herri with almost his entire force, some 43 officers and 1,187 men with supporting artillery and machine guns. This amounted to less than half the force he had in September, when he had last been refused permission to attack.

Laverdure's force surprised the Zaian camp, mostly empty of fighting men, at dawn. A French cavalry charge, followed up with infantry, successfully cleared the camp. After capturing two of Hammou's wives and looting the tents the French started back for Khénifra. The Zaians and other local tribes, eventually numbering 5,000 men, began to converge on the French column and began harassing its flanks and rear. The French artillery proved ineffective against dispersed <a href="skirmisher">skirmisher</a>s and at the Chbouka river the rearguard and gun batteries found themselves cut off and overrun. Laverdure detached a small column of troops to take his wounded to Khénifra, remaining behind with the rest of the force. Laverdure's remaining troops were surrounded by the Zaians and were wiped out by a mass attack of "several thousand" tribesmen.

The wounded and their escort reached Khenifra safely by noon, narrowly outpacing their pursuers, who had stopped to loot the French dead. This force of 431 able-bodied men and 176 wounded were the only French survivors of the battle. The French lost 623 men on the battlefield, while 182 Zaian were killed. The French troops also lost 4 machine guns, 630 small arms, 62 horses, 56 mules, all of their artillery and camping equipment and much of their personal belongings.

The loss of the column at El Herri, the bloodiest defeat of a French force in Morocco, left Khénifra almost undefended. The senior garrison officer, Captain Pierre Kroll, had just three companies of men to protect the town. He managed to inform Lyautey and Henrys of the situation by telegraph before the town came under siege from the Zaians. Henrys determined to act quickly against the Zaians to prevent Laverdure's defeat from jeopardising the French presence in Morocco, dispatching Garnier-Duplessix's "groupe mobile" to Khénifra and forming another "groupe" in support at <a href="Ito%2C%20Morocco">Ito</a> under Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Joseph%20D%C3%A9rigoin">Joseph Dérigoin</a>. Garnier-Duplessix fought his way to the town, relieved it on 16 November, and was joined by Henrys shortly afterwards. The 6th battalion of the 2nd French Foreign Legion Regiment also reached the town, having fought off Zaian attacks during their march from M'Rirt. Henrys led excursions from Khénifra to El Herri as a show of force and to bury their dead, some of whom had been taken as trophies by Hammou to encourage support from other tribes.

The Zaian victory at El Herri, combined with slow French progress on the Western Front and the siding of the Muslim <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> with the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>, led to an increase in recruits for the tribes and greater co-operation between Hammou, Amhaouch and Said. To counter this Henrys undertook a reorganisation of his forces, forming three military districts centred on Fez, Meknes and Tadla-Zaian (the Khénifra region), the latter under the command of Garnier-Duplessix. Henrys aimed to maintain pressure on Hammou through an economic blockade and the closure of markets to unsubmitted tribes. He imposed a war penalty, in the form of money, horses and rifles, on submitting tribes, believing that their submission would last only if they paid for it. Few tribes took up Henrys' offer and the Zaians continued to cross the Rbia and attack French patrols.

The French returned to the offensive in March with Dérigoin's group sweeping along the French bank of the Rbia, north of Khénifra, and Garnier-Duplessix the left. Dérigoin faced and drove off only a small Zaian force, but Garnier-Duplessix faced a more significant force – his troops were almost overrun by a large mounted group but managed to repulse them, inflicting "serious losses" in return for French casualties of one man killed and eight wounded. Garnier-Duplessix crossed the Rbia again in May to confiscate crops, and was attacked there by a force of 4–5,000 tribesmen at <a href="Sidi%20Sliman">Sidi Sliman</a>, near Kasbah Tadla. He repulsed them with artillery and counterattacked successfully over the course of a two-day engagement, killing 300 of the attackers and wounding 400 at the cost of 3 French dead and 5 wounded. This victory restored the image of French superiority and led to an increase in tribal submissions, the withdrawal of Said's forces further into the mountains and a six-month period of relative peace. In recognition of this Garnier-Duplessix was promoted to major-general.

The peace was broken on 11 November 1915 by an attack on a supply convoy headed for Khénifra by 1,200–1,500 Zaians and allied tribesmen. The Moroccans pressed to within of the French, and Garnier-Duplessix, in command of the convoy, was forced to resort to the bayonet to push them back. French casualties amounted to just 3 killed and 22 wounded but Henrys was concerned by the influence that Hammou continued to hold over other Berber tribes. In retaliation Henrys took both "groupes mobiles" across the Rbia and bombarded the Zaian camp, inflicting casualties but making little impression on their will to fight. The Zaians recrossed the Rbia in January 1916, camping in French territory and raiding the submitted tribes. Feeling that his communications with Taza were threatened Henrys withdrew his "groupes" to the Khénifra area, both of them coming under attack en route. At M'Rirt a sizeable Zaian attack was repulsed with 200 casualties but the French suffered the loss of one officer and 24 men killed and 56 wounded.
Lyautey had successfully retained the territory he had captured before the war but was of the opinion that he could not advance any further without risking "an extremely painful" mountain conflict. He faced having his troops withdrawn for service on the Western Front and being left with what he described as "degenerates and outcasts", a loss only partially mitigated by the expansion of the irregular tribal units to 21 "goums" in strength. Henrys accepted an offer of a position in France and was replaced by Colonel <a href="Joseph-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Poeymirau">Joseph-François Poeymirau</a>, a keen follower of Lyautey who had served as Henrys' second in command at Meknes. Lyautey was offered the post of <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28France%29">Minister of War</a> at the invitation of Prime Minister <a href="Aristide%20Briand">Aristide Briand</a>, which he accepted on 12 December 1916. Lyautey was replaced, at his request, by General <a href="Henri%20Gouraud%20%28French%20Army%20officer%29">Henri Gouraud</a>, who had experience fighting alongside Lyautey in Morocco and who had recently returned from the <a href="Dardanelles%20Campaign">Dardanelles</a>, where he had lost his right arm. Lyautey soon became disillusioned with French tactics in Europe, the disunity prevailing between <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">the Allies</a> and his position as a symbolic figurehead of the government. He was unfamiliar with dealing with political opposition and resigned on 14 March 1917, after being shouted down in the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28France%29">Chamber of Deputies</a>. The government could not survive the resignation of such a senior cabinet member and Briand himself resigned on 17 March, to be replaced by <a href="Alexandre%20Ribot">Alexandre Ribot</a>.

Lyautey returned to his former position in Morocco at the end of May and immediately decided on a new strategy. He concentrated his forces in the <a href="Moulouya%20River">Moulouya Valley</a>, convinced that the submission of the tribes in this area would lead to the collapse of the Zaian resistance. In preparation for this new offensive Poeymirau established a French post at <a href="El%20Bekrit">El Bekrit</a>, within Zaian territory, and forced the submission of three local tribes. He then used this post to protect his flanks during an advance south-eastwards into the valley, intending to meet with a column led by Colonel Paul Doury, advancing north-west from <a href="Boudenib">Boudenib</a>. The two columns met at <a href="Assaka%20Nidji">Assaka Nidji</a> on 6 June, a moment which represented the establishment of the first French-controlled route across the Atlas mountains, and earned Poeymirau promotion to brigadier-general. A defensive camp was soon established at <a href="Kasbah%20el%20Makhzen">Kasbah el Makhzen</a>, and Doury began construction on a road that he promised would be traversable by motor transport by 1918.

By late 1917 motorised lorries were able to traverse much of the road, allowing the French to quickly move troops to areas of trouble and supply their garrisons in eastern Morocco from the west rather than over long routes from the Algerian depots. A secondary road was constructed, leading southwards from the first along the <a href="Ziz%20River">Ziz River</a>, that allowed Doury to reach <a href="Er-Rich">Er-Rich</a> in the High Atlas, and major posts were established at <a href="Midelt">Midelt</a> and <a href="Missour">Missour</a>. The Zaians refused to be drawn into attacking the fortified posts that the French built along their new roads, though other tribes launched attacks that summer after rumours of French defeats on the European front. In one instance, in mid-June, it took Poeymirau's entire "groupe" three days to restore control of the road after an attack.

Doury had expanded the theatre of operations, against Lyautey's orders, by establishing a French mission at <a href="Tighmart">Tighmart</a>, in the <a href="Tafilalt">Tafilalt</a> region, in December 1917 in reaction to a rumoured German presence there. The land here, mainly desert, was almost worthless to the French and Lyautey was keen for his subordinates to focus on the more valuable Moulouya Valley. Local tribes resisted the French presence, killing a translator working at the mission in July 1918. Doury sought to avenge this act on 9 August by engaging up to 1,500 tribesmen, led by Sidi <a href="Mhand%20n%27Ifrutant">Mhand n'Ifrutant</a>, at <a href="Gaouz">Gaouz</a> with a smaller French force that included artillery and aircraft support. Entering a thick, jungle-like date palm oasis, one subgroup of Doury's force suffered a close, hard-fought action, hampered by exhaustion and poor supply lines. The whole force suffered casualties of 238 men killed and 68 wounded, the worst French losses since the disaster at El Herri, and also lost much of their equipment and transport. Lyautey was doubtful of Doury's claim to have almost wiped out his foe, and in response chastised him for his rash action in "this most peripheral of zones" and placed him under Poeymirau's direct command. Thus, as the war in Europe was drawing to a close in the early summer of 1918, the French remained hard pressed in Morocco. Despite the death of Ali Amhaouch by natural causes, significant numbers of tribesmen under the leadership of Hammou and Said continued to oppose them.

The Central Powers attempted to incite unrest in the Allied territories in Africa and the Middle East during the war, with the aim of diverting military resources away from the Western Front. German intelligence had identified Northwest Africa as the "<a href="Achilles%27%20heel">Achilles' heel</a>" of the French colonies, and encouraging resistance there became an important objective. Their involvement began in 1914, with the Germans attempting to find a suitable Moroccan leader that they could use to unite the tribes against the French. Their initial choice, former Sultan Abdelaziz, refused to co-operate and moved to the south of France to prevent any further approaches. Instead they entered negotiations with his successor Abdelhafid. He initially co-operated with the Germans, renouncing his former pro-Allied stance in autumn 1914 and moving to <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> to meet with officials from Germany, the Ottoman Empire and the Moroccan resistance. During this time he was also selling information to the French. These mixed loyalties came to light when he refused to board a German submarine headed for Morocco, and the Central Powers decided he was of no further use. Abdelhafid then attempted to extort money from the French intelligence services, who responded by halting his pension and arranging his internment at <a href="El%20Escorial">El Escorial</a>. He was later awarded a stipend by Germany in return for his silence on the matter.

The failure to find a suitable leader caused the Germans to alter their plans from a widespread insurrection in Morocco to smaller-scale support of the existing resistance movement. German support included the supply of military advisers and Foreign Legion deserters to the tribes as well as cash, arms and ammunition. Money (in both <a href="Spanish%20peseta">peseta</a>s and <a href="French%20franc">franc</a>s) was smuggled into Morocco from the German embassy at Madrid. The money was transferred to <a href="T%C3%A9touan">Tétouan</a> or <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a> by boat or wired through the <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> before being smuggled to the tribes, who each received up to 600,000 pesetas per month. Weapons arrived through long-established routes from Spanish <a href="Larache">Larache</a> or else purchased directly from French <a href="gun%20runner">gun runner</a>s or corrupt Spanish Army troops. The Germans found it hard to get resources to the Zaians in the Middle Atlas due to the distances involved and most of what did get through went to Said's forces. German attempts to distribute supplies inland were frustrated when many tribes hoarded the best resources. Ammunition remained scarce in the Middle Atlas, and many were forced to rely on locally manufactured gunpowder and cartridges.

The Ottoman Empire also supported the Moroccan tribesmen in this period, having provided military training to them since 1909. They co-operated with German intelligence to write and distribute propaganda in Arabic, French and the Middle Atlas Berber dialect. Much of the Ottoman intelligence effort was coordinated by Arab agents operating from the embassy in Madrid and at least two members of the Ottoman diplomatic staff there are known to have seen active service with the tribes in Morocco during the war. Ottoman efforts in Morocco were hindered by internal divisions among the staff, disagreements with their German allies and the outbreak of the <a href="Arab%20Revolt">Arab Revolt</a> in 1916, with which some of the embassy staff sympathised. These problems led many of the Ottoman diplomatic corps in Spain to leave for America in September 1916, bringing to an end many of the significant Ottoman operations in Morocco.
French intelligence forces worked hard to combat the Central Powers and to win the support of the Moroccan people. A series of commercial expositions, such as the <a href="Casablanca%20Fair%20of%201915">Casablanca Fair of 1915</a>, were held to demonstrate the wealth of France and the benefits of co-operation. In addition to stepping up their propaganda campaign and increasing the use of bribes to convince tribes to submit, the French established markets at their military outposts and paid Moroccans to undertake <a href="public%20works">public works</a>. Islamic scholars were also encouraged to issue <a href="fatw%C4%81">fatwā</a>s supporting the Moroccan Sultan's declaration of independence from the Ottoman Empire.

French and British intelligence agents co-operated in French and Spanish Morocco and Gibraltar, tracking Ottoman and German agents, infiltrating the advisers sent to the tribes and working to halt the flow of arms. German citizens in Morocco were placed under careful scrutiny and four were executed within days of the war's start. The French broke the codes used by the German embassy and were able to read almost every communication sent from there to the General Staff in Berlin. Bribes paid to staff at the Ottoman mission to Spain secured intelligence on the Central Powers' plans for Morocco.

Although the efforts of the Central Powers caused a resurgence in resistance against French rule, they were largely ineffective, falling short of the planners' aims of a widespread jihad. There were few cases of mass civil disorder, France was not required to reinforce the troops stationed in Morocco, and the export of raw materials and labour for the war effort continued. Although they were never able to completely stem the flow of arms, despite considerable effort, the French were able to limit the supply of machine guns and artillery. The tribes were thus unable to face the French in direct confrontation and had to continue to rely on ambushes and raids. This contrasted with the Spanish experience in the <a href="Rif%20War">Rif War</a> of 1920–26, in which tribes with access to such weapons were able to inflict defeats upon the Spanish Army in the field, such as at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Annual">Battle of Annual</a>.

The heavy French losses at the Battle of Gaouz encouraged an increase in tribal activity across the south-east of Morocco, threatening the French presence at Boudenib. Poeymirau was forced to withdraw garrisons from outlying posts in the Tafilalt, including that at Tighmart, to concentrate his force and reduce the risk of further disasters. Lyautey authorised only a series of limited offensives, such as the razing of villages and gardens, the primary aim of which was to emphasise French military superiority. The French struggled to move troops through the mountain passes from the Moulouya Valley due to heavy snows and attacks on their columns, and Lyautey, to his embarrassment, was forced to request reinforcements from Algeria. By October the situation had stabilised to the extent that Poeymirau was able to withdraw his troops to Meknes, but a large-scale uprising in January 1919 forced his return. Poeymirau defeated n'Ifrutant in battle at <a href="Meski">Meski</a> on 15 January, but was seriously wounded in the chest by the accidental explosion of an artillery shell and was forced to hand command to Colonel <a href="Antoine%20Hur%C3%A9">Antoine Huré</a>. Lyautey then received assistance from <a href="Thami%20El%20Glaoui">Thami El Glaoui</a>, a tribal leader who Lyautey had made <a href="Pasha">Pasha</a> of Marrakesh after the uprising of 1912. El Glaoui owed his increasing wealth (when he died in 1956 he was one of the richest men in the world) to corruption and fraud, which the French tolerated in return for his support. Thus committed to Lyautey's cause, El Glaoui led an army of 10,000 men, the largest Moroccan tribal force ever seen, across the Atlas to defeat anti-French tribesmen in the <a href="Dad%C3%A8s%20Gorges">Dadès Gorges</a> and to reinforce the garrison at Boudenib on 29 January. The uprising was over by 31 January 1919.
The conflict in the Tafilalt distracted the French from their main war aims, draining French reinforcements in return for little economic gain and drawing comparisons to the recent <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Battle of Verdun</a>. Indeed, the Zaians were encouraged by French losses in the area to renew their attacks on guardposts along the trans-Atlas road. The French continued to hope for a negotiated end to the conflict and had been in discussions with Hammou's close relatives since 1917. Indeed, his nephew, Ou El Aidi, had offered his submission in exchange for weapons and money but had been refused by the French who suspected he wanted to fight with his cousin, Hammou's son, Hassan. With no progress in these negotiations Poeymirau moved against the tribes to the north and south of Khénifra in 1920, the front in this area having remained static for six years. Troops were brought in from Tadla and Meknes to establish blockhouses and mobile reserves along the Rbia to prevent the Zaians crossing to use the pastures. The French were opposed vigorously but eventually established three blockhouses and forced some of the local tribes to submit. French successes in the Khénifra region persuaded Hassan and his two brothers to submit to the French on 2 June 1920, having returned some of the equipment captured at El Herri. Hassan was soon appointed Pasha of Khénifra and his 3,000 tents were brought under French protection in an expanded zone of occupation around the Rbia.
Following the submission of his sons, Hammou retained command of only 2,500 tents and in Spring 1921 was killed in a skirmish with other Zaian tribes that opposed continued resistance. The French seized the opportunity to launch an assault on the last bastion of Zaian resistance, located near El Bekrit. In September a three-pronged attack was made: General <a href="Jean%20Th%C3%A9veney">Jean Théveney</a> moved west from the El Bekrit settlement, Colonel <a href="Henry%20Freydenberg">Henry Freydenberg</a> moved east from <a href="Taka%20Ichian">Taka Ichian</a> and a third group of submitted tribesmen under Hassan and his brothers also took part. Théveney encountered resistance from the Zaians in his area but Freydenberg was almost unopposed and within days all resistance was put down. After seven years of fighting the Zaian War was ended, though Lyautey continued his expansion in the area, promising to have all of "useful Morocco" under French control by 1923. Lyautey had been granted the dignity of a <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal of France</a> in 1921 in recognition of his work in Morocco.
In Spring 1922, Poeymirau and Freydenberg launched attacks into the headwaters of the Moulouya in the western Middle Atlas and managed to defeat Said, the last surviving member of the Berber triumvirate, at El Ksiba in April 1922. Said was forced to flee, with much of the <a href="A%C3%AFt%20Ichkern">Aït Ichkern</a> tribe, to the highest mountains of the Middle Atlas and then into the High Atlas. Lyautey then secured the submission of several more tribes, constructed new military posts and improved his supply roads; by June 1922, he had brought the entire Moulouya Valley under control and pacified much of the Middle Atlas. Limited in numbers by rapid post-war demobilisation and commitments to <a href="Occupation%20of%20the%20Rhineland">garrisons in Germany</a>, he determined not to march through the difficult terrain of the High Atlas but to wait for the tribes to tire of the guerrilla war and submit. Said never did so, dying in action against a "groupe mobile" in March 1924, though his followers continued to cause problems for the French into the next decade. Pacification of the remaining tribal areas in French Morocco was completed in 1934, though small armed gangs of bandits continued to attack French troops in the mountains until 1936. Moroccan opposition to French rule continued, a plan for reform and return to indirect rule was published by the nationalist Comité d'Action Marocaine (CAM) in 1934, with significant riots and demonstrations occurring in 1934, 1937, 1944 and 1951. France, having failed to quell the nationalists by deposing the popular Sultan <a href="Mohammed%20V%20of%20Morocco">Mohammed V</a> and already fighting a bloody <a href="Algerian%20War">war of independence in Algeria</a>, recognised Moroccan independence in 1956.

The Whistleblower

The Whistleblower is a 2010 <a href="Cinema%20of%20Canada">Canadian</a>-<a href="Germany">German</a>-<a href="United%20States">American</a> <a href="biographical%20film">biographical</a> <a href="crime%20film">crime</a> <a href="drama%20film">drama film</a> directed by <a href="Larysa%20Kondracki">Larysa Kondracki</a> and starring <a href="Rachel%20Weisz">Rachel Weisz</a>. Kondracki and <a href="Eilis%20Kirwan">Eilis Kirwan</a> wrote the screenplay, which was inspired by the story of <a href="Kathryn%20Bolkovac">Kathryn Bolkovac</a>, a <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> police officer who was recruited as a United Nations peacekeeper for <a href="DynCorp%20International">DynCorp International</a> in post-war <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> in 1999. While there, she discovered a <a href="sex%20trafficking">sex trafficking</a> ring serving (and facilitated by) DynCorp employees, with the UN's <a href="SFOR">SFOR</a> peacekeeping force turning a blind eye. Bolkovac was fired and forced out of the country after attempting to shut down the ring. She took the story to <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> in the UK and won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit against DynCorp.

Kondracki wanted her debut film to concern human trafficking, and she encountered Bolkovac's story in college. She and Kirwan struggled to obtain financial support for the project. Eight years after Kondracki decided to produce the film, she secured funding and cast Weisz in the lead role. "The Whistleblower"a co-production of Canada, Germany, and the United Stateswas filmed in <a href="Romania">Romania</a> from October to December 2009.

"The Whistleblower" <a href="Film%20premiere">premiered</a> on 13 September 2010, at the <a href="2010%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>, and <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Films">Samuel Goldwyn Films</a> distributed the film in theaters in the United States. The film was advertised as a fictionalization of events occurring during the late 1990s. Kondracki said that the facts are broadly accurate but some details were omitted for the film; for example, a three-week "breaking-in" period for trafficking victims was not shown. The film received mixed reviews. The performances by Weisz and her co-stars were praised, but the intense violence depicted in several scenes was debated by critics, with some calling it exploitative. Kondracki and Weisz responded that what happened in Bosnia had been toned down for the film. "The Whistleblower" received several awards and nominations, including three nominations at the 2012 <a href="Genie%20Awards">Genie Awards</a>. UN Secretary-General <a href="Ban%20Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.

<a href="Kathryn%20Bolkovac">Kathryn Bolkovac</a> is a police officer from <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Nebraska">Lincoln, Nebraska</a>, who accepts an offer to work with the <a href="UN%20Police">United Nations International Police</a> in post-war <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> for a UK company, Democra Security (a pseudonym for <a href="DynCorp%20International">DynCorp International</a>). After successfully advocating for a Muslim woman who experienced domestic abuse, Kathryn is appointed head of the department of gender affairs.

Raya, a young <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> woman, and her friend Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a>. While investigating their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale <a href="sexual%20slavery">sexual slavery</a> ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid to proceed with the trial.

When she brings the scandal to the attention of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative <a href="Defense%20contractor">defense</a> and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: <a href="Madeleine%20Rees">Madeleine Rees</a>, head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. When Raya is found dead, Kathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors such as Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).

"The Whistleblower" is based on the experiences of <a href="Kathryn%20Bolkovac">Kathryn Bolkovac</a>, an American police officer who in 1999 was assigned to serve as a peacekeeper with the United Nations in post-war Bosnia. While there, she reportedly discovered a sex-trafficking ring which served and was facilitated by other peacekeepers. Bolkovac was fired after trying to investigate the ring, but she later won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit.

Director <a href="Larysa%20Kondracki">Larysa Kondracki</a> and co-screenwriter <a href="Eilis%20Kirwan">Eilis Kirwan</a> learned of Bolkovac's story while attending <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, eight years before the film's production. Kondracki subsequently devoted significant time to research human trafficking and the sex trade. After Bolkovac sold her the film rights for $100, she resolved to adapt the story for the screen. Financing for the project was initially difficult to secure, although the situation improved after <a href="Rachel%20Weisz">Rachel Weisz</a> was cast as Bolkovac. "I was young and naïve," Kondracki said of her initial attempts to secure funding. "I thought: 'Of course they're going to make my film. It's brilliant!'"

"The Whistleblower" was described as a "fictionalized dramatic presentation" of a late-1990s scandal. The producers based it on Bolkovac's experiences, rather than on her memoir. <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> played <a href="Madeleine%20Rees">Madeleine Rees</a>, a UN human-rights official ("one of the film's few heroic characters") who helps Bolkovac uncover the sex trade. Raya (<a href="Roxana%20Condurache">Roxana Condurache</a>) and Luba (Paula Schramm), two Ukrainian young women who are trafficked into Bosnia, are the primary representations of the trafficking victims encountered by Bolkovac. Neither is based on a particular person; they are composites of young women forced to work in Bosnian brothels. Kondracki's younger sister, Rayisa, also played a trafficking victim. For legal reasons the pseudonym "Democra Security" was used for <a href="DynCorp%20International">DynCorp International</a>, the organization whose employees reportedly sexually enslaved the women.

Although the producers kept the film factual, they debated how much to include. Details on the bureaucracy were removed. Kondracki said, "It was too much information and, frankly, people were bored." Another concern was how much violence against the sex-trafficking victims should be depicted in the film. Kondracki chose to bluntly portray the inhumane treatment of the young women, which she described as accurate representations of what happened. This included a graphic scene, in which Raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture. Weisz thought the reality had been toned down, "In real life there were girls doing this as young as 8 years old." Kondracki agreed, saying that she had lightened the events depicted out of fear that viewers would "tune it out":

Kondracki said that her goal for "The Whistleblower" was "information and exposure" on human trafficking. She said, "No one is putting pressure on governments to stop it, and there is no accountability. It's laziness."

"The Whistleblower" is a Canadian–German <a href="International%20co-production">co-production</a>. Weisz received the script from producer Amy Kaufman in 2007. Since she was pregnant with her son at the time, she initially turned down the offer. She said the story haunted her, and she later contacted Kaufman to ask if the project was still available. She signed on in August 2009, and shooting began in October 2009.

Bolkovac visited the set in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, where most of the movie was filmed. Weisz said that she made a point to spend "every waking moment" with her to accurately portray her. Weisz and Bolkovac are dissimilar in appearance: the former is dark-haired and slight, and the latter is "blond and much more voluptuous" and "much taller". As a result, the actress focused on emulating Bolkovac's accent and determination. Bolkovac later said she commended the choice to portray her and appreciated Weisz's efforts to be accurate.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Filming</a> took around six weeks, relatively short for a thriller; Weisz said most take about three months to complete. Producers used hand-held cameras and had a lower budget than usual for the genre. Kondracki said filming in Eastern Europe was crucial, "In a story such as this, it's more about what you don't see, so you need to create that world." The <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> in Romania served as the backdrop for the war-ravaged <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> of the late 1990s. Scenes set in UN buildings were filmed in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>. Most outdoor scenes are set at night; daytime shots often appear bleak, gray and overcast. This, coupled with a grainy texture, helped create a documentary feel.

Weisz had to separate herself emotionally from the atrocities depicted in the film. "It's something you learn," she said. "It's true between 'action' and 'cut,' and after 'cut' it's just not true anymore." Bolkovac echoed Weisz's sentiments, adding that distancing oneself emotionally is a necessity when working on a police force. However, the producers wanted the audience to be affected by scenes depicting brutal treatment of the women forced into prostitution, and the character of Raya was created to give a human face to the victims. Much of the rape scene was cut after its brutality caused a viewer to faint during the film's first screening in Toronto. Weisz responded:

"The Whistleblower" focuses on sexual slavery, human trafficking, and corruption. Kondracki wanted her first project to concern sex trafficking but was unsure how to create a moving, original plot. Her mother was born in Ukraine, and she was aware of what she described as the country's "epidemic" of trafficking. <a href="Victor%20Malarek">Victor Malarek</a>'s book "The Natashas" inspired her to produce a film on the subject. She said of her initiative being a challenge, "No one wants to watch a film of an enslaved girl being raped for two hours." Bolkovac's experiences gave Kondracki a framework for the film and added the themes of corruption and wide-scale cover-ups. Film critic <a href="Rex%20Reed">Rex Reed</a> said that the abuse of power featured prominently in "The Whistleblower"; a number of government officials participate in the sex trade or turn a blind eye to it (including peacekeepers, UN members and <a href="Mercenary">mercenaries</a>). Wallace Baine of the "<a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Sentinel">Santa Cruz Sentinel</a>" wrote that these aspects' portrayal made the movie "slippery and true-to-life". She said, "There are clear and vivid monsters in this film, but there are also those existing in the shades-of-gray middle, nice-enough guys tolerating crimes of unspeakable barbarity." Justice, another prominent theme, does not materialize by the end. The sex trafficking victim Raya is killed, and none of the peacekeepers who participated in the trafficking are prosecuted (although several are sent home). According to Baine, viewers are left with the impression that "the worst violence in Bolkovac's story was the violence done to justice".

Bolkovac is portrayed as imperfect—a "noble but screwed up" individual. In the film (which roughly mirrors her real life), her personal life is in disarray. She has lost custody of her children to her ex-husband and goes to Bosnia to earn money to move closer to them. While there, she has an affair with a fellow peacekeeper. Kondracki wanted to promote the idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers looked the other way. Her flaws are offset by her determination to fight the sex trade, and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three-dimensional character.

Weisz compared Bolkovac's story of "one lone woman fighting injustice" to that of <a href="David%20and%20Goliath">David and Goliath</a>, her favorite film genre. In the film, as in real life, Bolkovac begins by investigating a case of a kidnapped girl. As the story unfolds, she discovers a wide-ranging web of corruption and faces growing obstacles. The sex trade is facilitated by a large, influential organization. When she tries to report her findings to the UN and local officials, she receives threats and is "shunned by coworkers and thwarted by higher-ups". Weisz explained that she liked the idea of an ordinary person doing something extraordinary. She said, "I love that kind of thriller, the ordinary person who, because of their character, it's their character that leads them."

"The Whistleblower" premiered on 13 September 2010, at the <a href="2010%20Toronto%20Film%20Festival">2010 Toronto Film Festival</a>. Screenings were also held at film festivals in North America, including the 2011 Human Rights Watch Film Festival in New York.

A screening was held for "The Whistleblower" in Bosnia-Herzegovina for the first time in March 2014. The film was shown in <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> and <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>, with Kathryn Bolkovac being invited to speak to the Bosnian audience.

<a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Films">Samuel Goldwyn Films</a> purchased rights to distribute the film in the United States. The film had a limited release starting on 5 August 2011. It initially screened in seven theaters and expanded to a maximum of 70 theaters before drawing down. Its theatrical run lasted 12 weeks, during which it grossed .

At the time of its theatrical release, "The Whistleblower" received mixed reviews. <a href="Review%20aggregation">Review aggregation</a> website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> said critics commended Weisz's performance but thought that "the film suffers from a literal-minded approach to the material". The website surveyed 115 critics and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 85 as positive and 30 as negative. Of the 115 reviews, it determined a <a href="Weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">rating average</a> of 6.5 out of 10. Based on the reviews, the website gave the film a score of 74%. Another aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> surveyed 30 critics and assessed 17 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed, and three as negative. Based on the reviews, it gave the film a score of 59 out of 100, which it said indicated "mixed or average reviews".

"The Guardian's" Ed Vulliamy called "The Whistleblower" "the most searing drama-documentary of recent years", and "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>"'s Marshall Fine said the story was "dark, grim, and harrowing". Doris Toumarkine of "<a href="Film%20Journal%20International">Film Journal International</a>" called the movie a "well-told but troubling story impressively wrapped for audiences who show up in theatres for do-good cinema of a high order". Leigh Paatsch of <a href="News.com.au">News.com.au</a> said, "it is Bolkovac's ferocious will to right so many wrongs (expertly channelled by Weisz) that keeps you glued to the screen". Stephenie Foster of "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>" gave the film a highly-favorable review: 

An equally-positive review appeared in "The Balkan Chronicle": 

Allison Willmore of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" gave "The Whistleblower" a negative review, criticizing the producers for making its antagonists one-dimensional: "There's no hint of the erosion of morality that led to this point." Peter Rainer of "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>" called the film's pace "frustratingly uneven", but commended the actors' performances: Condurache "makes Raya's fears tremblingly palpable". <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that the film "tells a story so repellent that it is almost beyond belief. Its conclusion—that in the moral quagmire of war and its aftermath, human trafficking and corruption are collateral damage—is unutterably depressing." He praised Weisz's performance as "the strongest element" of the production.

The actors' performances received overall praise from reviewers. Camerin Courtney of "<a href="Christianity%20Today">Christianity Today</a>" was dismayed that the main character engaged in a sexual relationship with a married man, but Weisz "is wonderful as Bolkovac, a no-nonsense civil servant who is stunned at what she walks into" while "Vanessa Redgrave is a needed touch of strength and warmth as her mentor Madeleine, and David Strathairn is at his government thriller best as Peter Ward, an Internal Affairs agent. Raya is heart-breaking as the young victim." Steve Rea of "<a href="The%20Post%20and%20Courier">The Post and Courier</a>" praised Redgrave's acting in the supporting role of Madeleine Rees as "forceful, elegant, precise". <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" said, "Weisz gives a psychologically astute performance as a woman who can't leave things alone." <a href="Rex%20Reed">Rex Reed</a> of "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called her "superb" in the lead role.

Kondracki's graphic depiction of violence was controversial. Bob Mondello of <a href="NPR">NPR</a> called it "sobering", but felt the scenes detracted from the film and should have been more subtle. Ryan Rojas of "Tonight at the Movies" described the film as "gritty and merciless", and cautioned that certain scenes might offend some viewers: "While the scenes do work as reinforcing the horror of the events, it really just made it obvious that the way that the director was going to win over fans was to simply shock them into numbness, as scenes showing rape, mutilation, and murder are shown in very disturbing fashion." Christian Hamaker of <a href="Crosswalk.com">Crosswalk.com</a> wrote: 

A review in "The Balkan Chronicle", an Internet-based newspaper reporting from the Balkans, disagreed with the opinion that the violence was unnecessarily explicit or sensationalized: "Sugarcoating it would do no one any good. Grisly authenticity is one of the film's greatest aspects." Later, when Bolkovac spoke at a screening of the film in Bosnia, it was reported that her message was well-received and discussion about the events that occurred in the late 1990s "did not fail to engage and provoke".

<a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Home%20Entertainment">20th Century Fox Home Entertainment</a> released the film on DVD on 15 January 2012. The movie was reportedly more successful on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> than in theatres, and film critic Lynette Porter said that the subject's serious nature made it better-suited for television.

Consistent with Bolkovac's account, "The Whistleblower" portrays DynCorp International employees as participants in the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General <a href="Ban%20Ki-moon">Ban Ki-moon</a> hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This is not going to be simple or a quick fix." She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." Following the theatrical release of "The Whistleblower", "The Guardian" reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.

DynCorp International spokesperson Ashley Burke said:

A review in the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" criticized Perry's lack of creativity in her choice of recipes. Recipes from the work have been featured in related cookbooks.

Sara Perry is a resident of <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, and a columnist for "The Oregonian", a radio restaurant commentator and a cookbook author. Before "Everything Tastes Better with Bacon" she wrote four books: "The New Complete Coffee Book", "The New Tea Book", "Christmastime Treats" and "Weekends with the Kids". Her editor at <a href="Chronicle%20Books">Chronicle Books</a> suggested bacon as a cookbook subject. Bacon's popularity and usage was increasing, but Perry believed that a paucity of recipes would make writing the book difficult. Recalling her fondness for honey-baked <a href="ham">ham</a>, she combined sugar and bacon to create dishes. Perry realized that bacon could be used to add seasoning in flavoring dishes, including salads and pastas. She observed that bacon increased the sweet and <a href="salt">salt</a>y tastes of food. "Everything Tastes Better with Bacon" was published in English in <a href="paperback">paperback format</a> by Chronicle Books on May 1, 2002. The book sold for a retail price of in its initial publication. A French paperback edition was published in 2004 by Les Editions de l'Homme, as part of its "Tout un plat!" ("What a dish!") series.

Perry explains her feelings about bacon in the book's introduction, observing that its smell while cooking helps start her day and provide her with a sense of calmness. The beginning of the book provides background on the phrase "<a href="wikt%3Abring%20home%20the%20bacon">bringing home the bacon</a>", introduces the reader to types of bacon and describes storage methods. The book offers 70 recipes for bacon-flavored dishes, in nine chapters organized by topic, including breakfast, leaf vegetables, pasta meals, side dishes, party servings, <a href="dessert">dessert</a>s and <a href="appetizer">appetizer</a>s. Recipes include a bacon sandwich using other ingredients, a bacon crunch topping for <a href="ice%20cream">ice cream</a>, a bacon concoction to top a fruit crisp, and a <a href="pie%20crust">pie crust</a> that incorporates bacon. Methods are offered for cooking bacon on a <a href="stovetop">stovetop</a>, in an oven and under a griller to maximize its flavor and appearance. The book is illustrated with photographs by Sheri Giblin.

"Everything Tastes Better with Bacon" was positively received by reviewers and food critics. The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" reported that it sold 30,000 copies in its first month. Janet F. Keeler of the "<a href="St.%20Petersburg%20Times">St. Petersburg Times</a>" commented positively on the book's title. She noted the work was covered by food critics, who included its recipes in articles about the subject. Keeler interviewed Fran McCullough, author of "The Best American Recipes 2003–2004", who posited that the <a href="Atkins%20diet">Atkins diet</a> (which emphasizes higher meat consumption as part of a low <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a> plan) had helped increase the popularity of bacon usage. She classed it among the "most interesting and unique cookbooks" published. Giblin's photography received favorable commentary from Cindy Hoedel of "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>". Literary critic <a href="Dwight%20Garner%20%28critic%29">Dwight Garner</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" included the book in a list of favorites among recent cooking publications. The review was critical of the author's dessert recipes, but agreed with her overall argument for increased use of bacon in cooking.

"<a href="The%20Arizona%20Daily%20Star">The Arizona Daily Star</a>" highlighted the book in their "Hot Reads" section. Assistant Texas Taste Editor for "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" Laura H. Ehret wrote that the book successfully conveys the experience of consuming bacon. Marty Meitus wrote for the "<a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20News">Rocky Mountain News</a>" that the book had increased his appetite for bacon dishes. Meitus recommended dessert recipes, including <a href="Hazelnut">Hazelnut</a>-Bacon <a href="Candy">Candy</a> Crunch, <a href="Peanut%20butter">Peanut butter</a> Cookies with Bacon Brittle, <a href="Pear">Pear</a>-<a href="Apple%20Crisp">Apple Crisp</a> with Brown Sugar-Bacon Topping and Ruby <a href="Raisin">Raisin</a> <a href="Mincemeat">Mincemeat</a> <a href="Tart">Tart</a>. Steve Smith, executive chef at Dixon's Downtown Grill in <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, was inspired by Perry's "Maple Sundae" recipe and used it to create his own <a href="macadamia">macadamia</a>-bacon crunch ice cream dessert.

Writing for the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>", Marlene Parrish gave the book a favorable review, highlighting it in her article "Favorite Cookbooks for 2002". She wrote that she enjoyed sampling the recipes from the book. Parrish added that <a href="Robert%20Atkins%20%28nutritionist%29">Robert Atkins</a>, creator of the Atkins diet, would think favorably of the "<a href="Gorgonzola">Gorgonzola</a> <a href="Cheeseburger">Cheeseburger</a>s with Bacon" dish. "<a href="The%20Denver%20Post">The Denver Post</a>" included the book in a list of best cookbooks of 2002.

A review in the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" criticized Perry's lack of creativity in her choice of recipes. The review concluded the book was a good deal compared to other cookbooks on the subject while noting its lack of comprehensiveness with the small number of total recipes included. Michele Anna Jordan of "<a href="The%20Press%20Democrat">The Press Democrat</a>" recommended Perry's work, and commented that the author's zest for the subject was contagious.

According to the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" and the "St. Petersburg Times", "Everything Tastes Better with Bacon" is a niche work in the cookbook genre. Perry stated that bacon had undergone a <a href="renaissance">renaissance</a> period. "<a href="Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>" noted in a 2003 article that bacon was becoming an increasingly used cooking ingredient, despite having been maligned by nutritionists. Recipes from the book were selected for inclusion in "The Best American Recipes 2003–2004: The Year's Top Picks from Books, Magazines, Newspapers and the Internet". Perry's recipe for "Succulent Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp" was referenced in the 2003 book "Smoke & Spice: Cooking with Smoke, the Real Way to Barbecue". Fran McCullough, the author of "The Best American Recipes", commented that the book was a surprising addition to the field. "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" said that three years after the book's publication, bacon had become as popular as chocolate or olive oil. Leah A. Zeldes observed in a 2006 article for the "Chicago Sun-Times" that the book contributed to the body of works that display the adaptability of bacon in recipes. In his 2009 book "Hungry Monkey", author Matthew Amster-Burton commented on the phenomena involving bacon and books on the subject in prior years, listing the book along with "<a href="The%20Bacon%20Cookbook">The Bacon Cookbook</a>" and "<a href="Seduced%20by%20Bacon">Seduced by Bacon</a>". A 2013 article in the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" cited the book as an example of increasing interest in pork.

Parks and Recreation (season 1)

The first season of "<a href="Parks%20and%20Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>" originally aired in the United States on the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> television network between April 9 and May 14, 2009. Produced by <a href="Deedle-Dee%20Productions">Deedle-Dee Productions</a> and <a href="Universal%20Media%20Studios">Universal Media Studios</a>, the series was created by <a href="Greg%20Daniels">Greg Daniels</a> and <a href="Michael%20Schur">Michael Schur</a>, who served as executive producers with <a href="Howard%20Klein%20%28television%20producer%29">Howard Klein</a>.

The comedy series focuses on <a href="Leslie%20Knope">Leslie Knope</a> (<a href="Amy%20Poehler">Amy Poehler</a>), the deputy director of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30 p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> of his comedy series "<a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Office</a>", on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> style of "The Office". Like that show, "Parks and Recreation" encouraged improvisation among its cast members.

Early test screenings were poor, and many critics and industry observers were skeptical about the show's chances of success. The first season received generally mixed reviews, and several commentators found it too similar to "The Office". The <a href="Pilot%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">premiere episode</a> was watched by 6.77 million households, but the viewership declined almost every week in the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>. A season low of 4.25 million households watched the final episode, "<a href="Rock%20Show%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">Rock Show</a>". Despite the low rating, "Rock Show" received the best reviews of the season and convinced some critics that the series had finally found the right tone.

Dean Holland, an editor on "<a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Office</a>", also worked as an editor on "Parks and Recreation"s first season. <a href="Mike%20Scully">Mike Scully</a>, a former executive producer and <a href="show%20runner">show runner</a> for "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", joined "Parks and Recreation" as a consulting producer starting with the episode "<a href="Boys%27%20Club%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">Boys' Club</a>". Cawley left the show at the end of the first season to create the short-lived <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> sitcom "<a href="Hank%20%282009%20TV%20series%29">Hank</a>", starring <a href="Kelsey%20Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>. Gould left to focus on his stand-up career. The other producers all returned for <a href="Parks%20and%20Recreation%20%28season%202%29">the second season</a>. <a href="Allison%20Jones%20%28casting%20director%29">Allison Jones</a>, who worked as a casting director for "The Office", served in the same capacity for "Parks and Recreation", along with Nancy Perkins, for whom the character Ann Perkins was named.

The <a href="Pilot%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">pilot episode</a> was directed by Greg Daniels, and the <a href="Rock%20Show%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">season finale</a> was directed by Michael Schur, his debut in the position. Other directors included <a href="Seth%20Gordon">Seth Gordon</a>, director of the documentary ""; <a href="Jeffrey%20Blitz">Jeffrey Blitz</a>, who had directed numerous episodes of "The Office"; <a href="Michael%20McCullers">Michael McCullers</a>, co-writer of the first two "<a href="Austin%20Powers%20%28film%20series%29">Austin Powers</a>" films, who directed Poehler in the comedy film "<a href="Baby%20Mama%20%28film%29">Baby Mama</a>"; and <a href="Beth%20McCarthy-Miller">Beth McCarthy Miller</a>, a longtime television director who worked with Poehler on the sketch comedy show "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>". Daniels and Schur wrote the pilot episode, and the rest of the season's episodes were written by Axler, Goor, Hiscock, Cawley and <a href="Alan%20Yang">Alan Yang</a>.

A principal cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler portrayed the lead character, <a href="Leslie%20Knope">Leslie Knope</a>, the naive but well-meaning, eager-to-please deputy director of the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>. Poehler said, upon reading the script provided by Michael Schur, "it took me five minutes to realize Leslie Knope was the best character ever written for me". She also felt it took a few episodes before she started "feeling my groove" with the character, but came to realize the cast was extremely talented and "would eventually become like family". Also among the cast were <a href="Aziz%20Ansari">Aziz Ansari</a> as <a href="Tom%20Haverford">Tom Haverford</a>, a sarcastic parks department employee, and <a href="Rashida%20Jones">Rashida Jones</a> as <a href="Ann%20Perkins">Ann Perkins</a>, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in "The Office" as <a href="Karen%20Filippelli">Karen Filippelli</a>) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate "Parks and Recreation" concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler would be available to star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.

<a href="Nick%20Offerman">Nick Offerman</a> portrayed <a href="Ron%20Swanson">Ron Swanson</a>, the director of the parks and recreation department. Offerman had previously auditioned for a part on "The Office", and Schur was impressed with his comedic talents and wanted to cast him, but then Offerman became unavailable because he appeared on "<a href="Will%20%26amp%3B%20Grace">Will & Grace</a>", a show starring his wife, <a href="Megan%20Mullally">Megan Mullally</a>. Schur said, "I just wrote his name down on a post-it note and stuck it to my computer and said, 'Someday, I'm going to figure out what to do with that guy.'" <a href="Aubrey%20Plaza">Aubrey Plaza</a> played <a href="April%20Ludgate">April Ludgate</a>, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, casting director Allison Jones told Schur, "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." Schur of meeting her, "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted to put her in the show," although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was <a href="Paul%20Schneider%20%28actor%29">Paul Schneider</a>, best known for his work in independent films such as "<a href="Lars%20and%20the%20Real%20Girl">Lars and the Real Girl</a>" and "<a href="The%20Assassination%20of%20Jesse%20James%20by%20the%20Coward%20Robert%20Ford">The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</a>". He was cast as <a href="Mark%20Brendanawicz">Mark Brendanawicz</a>, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was still trying to figure out the character's motivations. <a href="Chris%20Pratt">Chris Pratt</a> played <a href="Andy%20Dwyer">Andy Dwyer</a>, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.

<a href="Jim%20O%27Heir">Jim O'Heir</a> and <a href="Retta%20%28comedian%29">Retta</a> made regular appearances as <a href="Jerry%20Gergich">Jerry Gergich</a> and <a href="Donna%20Meagle">Donna Meagle</a>, two fellow employees at the Pawnee parks and recreation department. The personalities of the two characters did not become developed until the second season, but Schur said the "Parks and Recreation" staff liked the actors so decided to include them in the show and "figured we'd work it out later". <a href="Pamela%20Reed">Pamela Reed</a> made several appearances as <a href="Marlene%20Griggs-Knope">Marlene Griggs-Knope</a>, Leslie's mother and an important figure in the Pawnee school system. Seth Gordon, who directed Reed in her first episode, "<a href="Canvassing%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">Canvassing</a>", said she improvised a great deal during her audition, creating many elements that helped define Marlene's character. <a href="Jama%20Williamson">Jama Williamson</a> appeared in "Rock Show" as <a href="Characters%20of%20Parks%20and%20Recreation%23Wendy%20Haverford">Wendy</a>, the attractive surgeon wife of Tom Haverford. Wendy would make numerous appearances in season 2, during which it was revealed that the Haverfords have a <a href="green%20card%20marriage">green card marriage</a>. <a href="Eric%20Edelstein">Eric Edelstein</a> guest starred in two season 1 episodes, "Canvassing" and "Boys' Club", as <a href="Characters%20of%20Parks%20and%20Recreation%23Lawrence">Lawrence</a>, a disgruntled neighbor of Andy's.

Immediately after <a href="Ben%20Silverman">Ben Silverman</a> was named co-chairman of <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s entertainment division in 2007, he asked Greg Daniels to create a <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> of "The Office", the half-hour comedy Daniels adapted from the <a href="The%20Office%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">British comedy of the same name</a>, created by <a href="Ricky%20Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a>. The idea of an "Office" spin-off stemmed from a subplot from the show's <a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20season%203%29">third season</a> that followed characters in an office branch in <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>, separate from the show's other characters, who were in <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Scranton, Pennsylvania</a>. Silverman felt it could have served as its own series and began asking Daniels about the possibility of a spinoff. Daniels resisted the idea for several years out of fears of diltuing the quality of "The Office", but Silverman eventually insisted upon a new show. Daniels co-created "Parks and Recreation" with Michael Schur, who had been a writer on "The Office". Like Daniels, Schur had previously worked on the NBC sketch comedy show "Saturday Night Live". The two spent months considering ideas for the new series and debating whether to make it a stand-alone show rather than a spin-off, with many of those conversations taking place at Norm's Diner in <a href="Van%20Nuys">Van Nuys</a>.

According to Daniels, they eventually abandoned the original spin-off plan because they "couldn't find the right fit". Daniels and Schur considered two "frontrunner ideas" about a family show done as a mockumentary, and a "mockumentary version of "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>"", which they felt could make the new show focus on the public sector in the same way that "The Office" was about the private sector. They also considered a series about a local government official trying to rebuild a political career following a humiliating public spectacle, but ultimately abandoned the idea. However, it was ultimately incorporated into the backstory for <a href="Ben%20Wyatt%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">Ben Wyatt</a>, the character played by <a href="Adam%20Scott%20%28actor%29">Adam Scott</a> who was added late in the second season. Daniels and Schur specifically sought to making avoid a political show about a "hypocrite running for office" or "bureaucrat who just makes everything impossible", which they felt were cliched and overdone stereotypes. After Poehler agreed to play the lead, they decided the show would revolve around an optimistic bureaucrat in small-town government. Schur said they sought to portray a "very optimistic kind of can-do spirit type person in the middle of (a) really Byzantine world (and) frustrating world".

The idea was partly inspired by the portrayal of local politics on the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> drama series "<a href="The%20Wire">The Wire</a>", as well as the renewed interest in and optimism about politics stemming from the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008 United States presidential election</a>. Schur said they wanted to focus on government's involvement in people's lives at a "very micro level" because, during the <a href="Great%20Recession">Great Recession</a>, there was a great deal of discussion and speculation about "a new Great Depression-era intervention in people's lives". The writing staff was also drawn to the idea of building a show around a female relationship, namely Leslie Knope and Ann Perkins. Reports that Daniels and Schur were developing a show together led to press speculation that it would, in fact, be a spin-off of "The Office". The producers insisted their new series would be entirely independent. Nevertheless, their concept for it shared several elements with "The Office", particularly the <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> approach, which allows the actors to look at and directly address the camera. The new show would also include documentary-style interviews, in which the characters speak one-on-one with the camera crew about the day's events. Again as with "The Office", the new series would be scripted but improvisation would be encouraged among the actors. Schur said the writers considered an idea in which a broken copy machine from the Scranton setting of "The Office" ended up in the government officers of "Parks and Recreation", thus jokingly making the copy machine the spun-off character from "The Office", but the idea was ultimately abandoned. Indiana was identified as a setting for the show because, Daniels said, "it's a Midwestern state that people don’t hear about much (and) didn't have a lot of stereotypes attached to it".

The series was scheduled as a mid-season replacement and rushed into production to meet the premiere date of April 9, 2009. As a result, when the series was featured at a panel during the January 2009 television critics press tour, NBC did not have a finished episode to screen, only a copy of the pilot script available for review. Some of the parts were still not cast and the series, which did not yet have a name, was referred to as "The Untitled Amy Poehler Project" or "TUAPP". The name "Public Service" was considered, but ultimately rejected because network officials did not want to be accused of mocking the idea. In a commercial that aired during NBC's <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> coverage in February, it was announced that the series would be called "Parks and Recreation".

The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attending <a href="Los%20Angeles%20City%20Council">Los Angeles City Council</a> meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: "I've been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." The depiction of public hearings in several "Parks and Recreation" episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also the basis for the entire "Canvassing" episode. Schur asked urban planners in <a href="Claremont%2C%20California">Claremont, California</a>, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years. Schur said the pit project was conceived as a device to bring all the characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in "The Wire" were brought together to work toward a common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.

The Pawnee residents vocally opposed to Leslie's park proposal were based on real-life California residents the show's producers encountered who fought the construction of parks in their hometowns. One such group, the Committee for a Better Park, was actually opposed to parks in general, and the deceptiveness of their name and mission inspired the producers' writing for those characters. The "Parks and Recreation" staff worked with a number of consultants familiar with local government work, including Scott Albright, a California city planner who provided feedback for the Mark Brendanawicz character. Inspiration for Ron Swanson came from an encounter Schur had in Burbank with an elected official, a Libertarian who favored minimal government and admitted, "I don't really believe in the mission of my job."

Daniels and Schur wrote the script for the pilot episode in mid-2008. The original script portrayed Leslie and Mark as slightly less likable than they appeared in the final draft. For example, in the premiere episode, Mark asks Ron to <a href="greenlight">greenlight</a> the park because he is inspired by Leslie's optimism and wants to help her. In the original script, Mark intervened because he was attracted to Ann and wanted an excuse to keep seeing her. The characters were made more likable in response to feedback the episode received from focus groups and press tour screenings. The first-season episodes were written and developed relatively quickly after each other, and Schur said the staff was treating the entire six-episode season as if it was one television pilot. When the season concluded, the writers had not decided what would happen with the developing romantic plotlines between Leslie and Mark, or Mark and Ann.

"Parks and Recreation" involves a mixture of written dialogue and comedic improvisation. In one example from the pilot episode, Aziz Ansari's character attempts to flirt with Rashida Jones's when she speaks at a parks and recreation public forum. Ansari continued to improvise long after completing his scripted dialogue. In the season's final episode, "Rock Show", Andy goes through a list of the previous names of his rock band. About half the band names used in the episode came directly from the script, but after actor Chris Pratt made up one on the spot, the directors encouraged him to keep improvising. Pratt said he went through about 200 fake band names during the take.

"Parks and Recreation" faced early production delays because Poehler was pregnant when she signed on; filming had to be postponed until she gave birth. Principal photography began on February 18, 2009. The show was filmed in Southern California, and the construction pit featured throughout the season was dug by the episode's producers at an undeveloped property in <a href="Van%20Nuys%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Van Nuys</a>, a district of Los Angeles. The producers went door-to-door in the neighborhood, seeking residents' permission for the dig. The pit was guarded 24 hours a day, and <a href="paparazzi">paparazzi</a> regularly came to the set to take photos of the actors during filming. The exterior of the Pawnee government building, and several of the hallway scenes, were shot at <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a> City Hall. The parks and recreation department interiors, as well as the Town Hall courtyard, were filmed on a sound stage. The set's windows were outfitted with water systems to simulate falling rain, and the windowsills included fake pigeons. Scenes set in playgrounds and elsewhere outdoors were filmed on location in Los Angeles, and the public forum scenes in the premiere episode were filmed in one of the city's middle schools.
Schur said the "Parks and Recreation" producers approach each episode as if they are filming a real documentary. They typically shoot enough for a 35- or 40-minute episode, then cut it down to 22 minutes, using the best material. Due to the improvisational acting and hand-held camerawork, a great deal of extra footage is shot that must be discarded for the final cut. According to Poehler, "For every show, there could probably be a second show of stuff we've edited out." The original cut of the 22-minute pilot was 48 minutes long. The producers film about nine pages of the script each day, a large amount by U.S. television standards.

Although the series shares a mockumentary style with "The Office", Daniels and Schur sought to establish a slightly different tone in the camerawork of the pilot episode. The one-on-one interviews, for example, sometimes feature two separate camera angles on the same person; the footage is intercut to create the final version of the scene. This technique was inspired by "<a href="The%20Five%20Obstructions">The Five Obstructions</a>", a 2003 experimental documentary directed by <a href="Lars%20Von%20Trier">Lars Von Trier</a> and <a href="J%C3%B8rgen%20Leth">Jørgen Leth</a>, which Daniels watched at the suggestion of actor Paul Schneider. "Parks and Recreation" also makes frequent use of the <a href="jump%20cut">jump cut</a> technique. For instance, one scene in the pilot episode repeatedly jump cuts between brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project. Early in the season, editor Dean Holland developed a technique that would be used throughout the series. During a scene in "<a href="The%20Reporter%20%28Parks%20and%20Recreation%29">The Reporter</a>" in which Leslie reacts to quotes read to her by the journalist, Poehler improvised a number of jokes, many of which were ultimately going to be cut from the episode. Holland thought they were all funny, so he created a brief montage intercutting several of the lines. The producers sought to lend authenticity to the fictional Pawnee setting by incorporating real-life Indiana elements. They contacted the <a href="Bloomington%2C%20Indiana">Bloomington</a>–based <a href="Upland%20Brewing%20Company">Upland Brewing Company</a> and asked for empty beer bottles and labels to be used as background props.

The six episodes of the first season aired Thursdays at 8:30 p.m. The premiere was shown between two <a href="The%20Office%20%28U.S.%20season%205%29">season 5</a> episodes of "The Office": "<a href="Dream%20Team%20%28The%20Office%29">Dream Team</a>" and "<a href="Michael%20Scott%20Paper%20Company%20%28The%20Office%20episode%29">Michael Scott Paper Company</a>". "The Reporter" was originally supposed to be the season's second episode, but the schedule was changed and "Canvassing", originally planned as the third episode, was shown second instead.

The first season of "Parks and Recreation" started to receive criticism before the premiere episode aired. According to a March 18, 2009, report that was leaked to television journalist <a href="Nikki%20Finke">Nikki Finke</a>, focus groups responded poorly to a rough-cut version of the pilot. Many focus group members felt the show was a "carbon copy" of "The Office". Some found it predictable, slow-paced and lacking in character development, and felt the beginning of the episode needed to better explain the setting and plot. Some viewers said the show lacked strong male characters, particularly a "datable" lead. On the other hand, viewers said the show's portrayal of government bureaucracy was "very believable" and had the potential to generate amusing situations. While Poehler's character drew mixed comments, the actress herself was "well liked". The early feedback left many critics and industry observers skeptical about the show's chances of success. In response to the leak, Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC Entertainment, said the feedback on rough cuts is usually negative, even with ultimately successful shows. Schur said that the pilot had been completely re-edited at least four times since the focus groups described in the report were held.

The first season received generally mixed to negative reviews. Many critics said the series was too similar to "The Office" and its mock documentary style. In particular, several commentators said the naive and well-meaning Leslie Knope character too closely resembled "The Office" protagonist <a href="Michael%20Scott%20%28The%20Office%29">Michael Scott</a>, the well-intentioned but dimwitted manager of a paper company sales office. Maureen Ryan, television reviewer for the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", said "Parks and Recreation" surpassed the "<a href="Friends">Friends</a>" spin-off "<a href="Joey%20%28TV%20series%29">Joey</a>" as the "worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." Daniels said of the comparisons between Leslie Knope and Michael Scott, "My sense is that if we had built 'Parks and Recreation' around a 90-year-old <a href="Maasai%20people">Maasai</a> warrior people would still have said, 'He reminds me of Michael Scott'. There was just no way to escape it." Poehler acknowledged that there was some validity to the comparisons, but felt that the series overcame them with the production of "Rock Show": "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style."

"<a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a>" writer Jonah Weiner said of the first season, "Each episode wound up more or less the same way, with the humiliation of Poehler's quixotic, adorably doofy bureaucrat". Some critics said the show's characters and overall tone were too mean-spirited in the early episodes. While reviewers praised various cast members in individual episodes, some said the supporting characters in general needed to be more fully developed and provided with better material. Several wrote that some of the subplots were too predictable and risked becoming stale, such as Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark and the question of whether Andy and Ann would keep dating. Others said Leslie was too unintelligent and ditzy. Schur said that was not the intention of the writers, and the feedback prompted changes to the character in the second season. Years after the first season ended, Schur said he believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers who revisited the episodes enjoyed them more because they had gotten to know the characters better as the series progressed.

Not all reviews were negative. Several commentators said the show had potential, and pointed out that early episodes of "The Office" had been flat before the series found its footing. The finale, "Rock Show", received the best reviews of the season. Several commentators declared that "Parks and Recreation" had finally found the right tone both generally and for the Leslie Knope character in particular. Several reviewers, even those who did not enjoy the show, applauded Poehler's comedic abilities and said her talent, timing and likability helped elevate the series above some of its flaws. Reviewers also said they particularly liked Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, and Chris Pratt as Andy Dwyer. Some commentators approved of the Pawnee setting as offering a good opportunity to satirize small-town government and politics.

"Parks and Recreation" went on to run for seven seasons over the span of six years. Looking back after the show's run concluded, most critics agreed that the first season was the worst of the series. In a 2015 recap of the show's best episodes, Oliver Lyttelton and Jessica Kiang of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> wrote, "Famously, "Parks & Rec" didn’t come flying out of the gate. It began with an uneven, rushed, truncated first season that saw the writers visibly struggling with how to make Leslie Knope work, and finding it tricky to stand apart from "The Office."" Nate Jones of <a href="Vulture.com">Vulture.com</a>, revisiting the first season following the <a href="One%20Last%20Ride">series finale</a>, noted the tone of the series was darker and more cynical, and the characters, particularly Leslie Knope, were not yet clearly defined or developed. Jones wrote: "Like a lot of early comedy episodes, the jokes are fine, but the series' worldview is hard to pin down, and, true to myth, the tone never really coalesces until the finale." In a 2015 article for "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>", Allen St. John suggests the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike</a> saved "Parks and Recreation" because it help prompt positive changes to the show: "In season two, the writers turned down the snark and the show immediately improved. Leslie was still overly enthusiastic, but beneath all that energy was a core of competence and good intentions." Ethan Alter, senior writer with <a href="Yahoo%21">Yahoo! Entertainment</a>, suggested the Mark Brendanawicz character was poorly conceived and a major problem for the show during its first season: "From the pilot, it's clear that Schneider is the odd man out in an ensemble that's taking some time to gel anyway." In a 2015 article, "<a href="Grantland">Grantland</a>" writer Sam Donsky said the first season of "Parks and Recreation" was his favorite season, though he acknowledged this was a minority opinion. Donsky said he preferred the darker tones, felt the character had more leeway, and preferred the series when it was "not worrying about being likable".

"Parks and Recreation"s premiere was seen in 6.77 million households. Media outlets described this as a solid result, comparable to the average <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> for "<a href="30%20Rock">30 Rock</a>", another Thursday-night show on NBC. However, viewership declined almost every week over the rest of the season, culminating in a season low of 4.25 million households for the final episode. The average first season viewership was 5.45 million households per episode. "The Office" experienced similarly poor ratings during its first season and later became a success. However, the low viewership presented a greater challenge for "Parks and Recreation" because NBC now trailed <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> and <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> in the ratings, and the move of comedian <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a> from "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show">The Tonight Show</a>" to <a href="The%20Jay%20Leno%20Show">a variety show</a> in NBC's 10 p.m. weeknight slot left less room on the network's primetime schedule.

Retta said acting during the first season was stressful because it was unclear how long the show would stay on the air, due to the poor reviews and ratings. Likewise, Chris Pratt said there was a constant feeling among the "Parks" staff that the show could be canceled at any time: "At the end of season one "Parks and Rec", you hug the people really, really fucking tight because you just don't know."

The first season of "Parks and Recreation" was released on DVD in the United States on September 8, 2009. The DVD included all six episodes, as well as an "Extended Producer's Cut" of the season finale, "Rock Show". The disc also included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode, as well as about 30 minutes of deleted scenes.

"Drake Force", consisting of the Australian <a href="2/12th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/12th Battalion</a> and attachments, landed on the southern tip of Goodenough Island at <a href="Mud%20Bay%2C%20Goodenough%20Island">Mud Bay</a> and <a href="Taleba%20Bay">Taleba Bay</a> on 22 October and, following a short but heavy fight, the Japanese forces withdrew to <a href="Fergusson%20Island">Fergusson Island</a> on 27 October. After the battle, Goodenough Island was developed by the Allies and became a major base for operations later in the war.
<a href="Goodenough%20Island">Goodenough Island</a> is the northernmost of the <a href="D%27Entrecasteaux%20Islands">D'Entrecasteaux Islands</a> to the north-east of <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a>, separated by the wide <a href="Ward%20Hunt%20Strait">Ward Hunt Strait</a>. The island is by sea from <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> and from <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>. Its position along the sea route between <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a> and Milne Bay made it strategically important during late 1942. The island is roughly oval shaped, measuring long and across. The coastal belt is up to wide, covered in grasslands and dissected by streams and coastal swamps. The island rises sharply to the central summit of <a href="Mount%20Vineuo">Mount Vineuo</a>, above sea level.

While the western side of the island was covered in rain forest and jungle, there were grassy plains on the north-eastern side covered in <a href="Imperata%20cylindrica">kunai</a> and <a href="Themeda%20triandra">kangaroo grass</a>. These were suitable sites for airfield development, but the best anchorages were at Mud Bay on the south-eastern side, Taleba Bay on the south-western, and <a href="Beli%20Beli%20Bay">Beli Beli Bay</a> on the eastern side. Other sites were obstructed by coral reefs or exposed to the weather, or could only accommodate shallow-draught vessels drawing or less, making them unsuitable for development. The island had no roads, and there was no motor or animal transport. Neither the interior of the island nor the surrounding waters were adequately charted in 1942. Important features were often missing from maps, and the spellings of the names of some features differed from one map to another.

Aircraft and ships headed from Milne Bay to Buna and vice versa had to pass close to Goodenough Island. An Allied presence on the island could provide warning of Japanese operations while denying the Japanese that opportunity. Goodenough Island also had flat areas suitable for the construction of emergency airstrips.

In early August 1942, a small detachment of an American fighter control squadron had been stationed on Goodenough Island to provide advance warning to the Australian fighters based at Milne Bay. On 7 August, five <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="P-40%20Kittyhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>s of <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a> made forced landings on the grassy plains. One crashed on landing and had to be written off, but after makeshift airstrips were cut through the grass, the remaining four were able to fly out again.

On 24 August, seven landing craft carrying 353 <a href="Japanese%20Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Forces">Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces</a> troops of the <a href="5th%20Sasebo%20Special%20Naval%20Landing%20Force">5th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force</a>, supplemented by a few engineers of the 14th and 15th Pioneer Units (Setsueitai), set out from Cape Nelson in the dark to participate in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">attack on the Allied forces at Milne Bay</a>. Upon reaching Goodenough Island they were unable to locate a suitable hiding place during the day for their landing craft, which had to be left on the beach, where the Allies discovered them. A <a href="coastwatcher">coastwatcher</a> at Cape Nelson reported the Japanese movements, and Milne Bay received a report around midday on 25 August that Japanese were on the west coast of Goodenough Island. Nine Kittyhawks from <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron RAAF</a> were despatched to investigate. They located the landing craft and destroyed all seven, along with the Japanese force's radio and most of its stores. The air raid killed eight Japanese; the survivors, lacking transport, were stranded. Meanwhile, the American detachment on Goodenough Island destroyed its own radios and withdrew from the island.

News of what had occurred on Goodenough Island reached the Japanese command on 9 September via an orderly who had made his way back to Buna in a canoe. The destroyers and set out from Rabaul to rescue the men on 10 September. Allied aircraft sighted them the next day. The destroyers , , and , under Captain Cornelius W. Flynn, USN, were detached from <a href="Task%20Force%2044">Task Force 44</a> to intercept. They did not locate the Japanese destroyers, but five <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a>es did. "Isokaze" escaped, despite a near-miss, but "Yayoi" sank after taking a direct hit on the stern that set her on fire. Her survivors reached <a href="Normanby%20Island%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Normanby Island</a>, where they found themselves in a similar predicament to their compatriots on Goodenough Island. After the attack, "Isokaze" returned to the area where "Yayoi" had gone down, finding an oil slick, but no survivors. On 22 September, "Isokaze" returned again, this time with the destroyer , and together they found 10 survivors in a launch. The two destroyers then searched the coast of Normanby Island without success. The next day a patrol plane spotted another 10 survivors, who were rescued on 26 September.

The presence of shipwrecked Japanese sailors on Normanby Island presented no military threat to the Allied forces at Milne Bay, who had repulsed the Japanese landing there earlier, but Captain A. T. Timperley, the <a href="Australian%20New%20Guinea%20Administrative%20Unit">Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit</a> (ANGAU) officer responsible for the D'Entrecasteaux and <a href="Trobriand%20Islands">Trobriand Islands</a>, argued that they posed a threat to the native population and Australia's reputation as its protector. C Company, <a href="2/10th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/10th Infantry Battalion</a>, under the command of Captain J. Brocksopp, was ordered to land on Normanby Island. Leaving <a href="Gili%20Gili">Gili Gili</a> on the destroyer on 21 September, Brocksopp's company landed at Nadi Nadi on 22 September, and experienced no opposition. It took eight Japanese as prisoners before returning to Milne Bay on "Stuart" on 23 September.

Meanwhile, messages and food supplies had been air dropped by the Japanese to their troops on Goodenough on 10 and 12 September. On 3 October, the submarine arrived at Goodenough Island, and dropped off rations, ammunition, medical supplies, a radio, and a landing craft. It took 71 sick or wounded men, all it could carry, back to Rabaul, along with the bodies of 13 dead. This left 285 Japanese troops on the island, most of whom were suffering from <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. "I-1" returned on 13 October with more rations and medical supplies and a second landing craft, but an Allied aircraft that dropped a flare drove her off. On 15 October, the Japanese received a radio message warning that the Allies were showing considerable interest in Goodenough Island and were likely to invade.
The Allied Supreme Commander of the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, issued new orders on 1 October:

As part of an operation codenamed "Drake", the <a href="2/12th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/12th Infantry Battalion</a>, a <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> unit from the <a href="18th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">18th Infantry Brigade</a>, which was composed mainly of men from Queensland and Tasmania, was selected to invade Goodenough Island, having taken part in the fighting around Milne Bay in August and September. Its commanding officer, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Arthur Arnold, as the commander of Drake Force, was ordered to destroy the Japanese force there, re-establish the coastwatching and radar warning posts, and reconnoitre the island for airfield sites. Intelligence reports indicated that there were approximately 300 Japanese troops on the island, mainly concentrated in the Galaiwau Bay–Kilia Mission area in the south-east. The Japanese were believed to be short of food and ammunition, and suffering from malnutrition and disease.
Boarding the destroyers HMAS "Stuart" and in Milne Bay on 22 October, the Australian troops were transported to Goodenough Island escorted by Task Force 44. Arriving that night, the battalion disembarked on both sides of the island's southern tip. Arnold planned to trap the Japanese between the main force of 520 men commanded by himself that landed at Mud Bay, and a smaller one of 120 men, mostly from C Company, commanded by Major Keith Gategood, which landed at Taleba Bay, about away. Australian landing craft were unavailable, but the 2/12th Infantry Battalion had three <a href="ketch">ketch</a>es, the "Matoma", "Maclaren King" and "Tieryo", three Japanese landing craft that had been captured in the Battle of Milne Bay, and two powered <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a>s. Seven days' rations were carried on these craft, and another seven days' on the two destroyers. Each man carried three days' rations.

Drake Force had two <a href="AWA%203B%20Wireless%20Set">AWA 3B Wireless Set</a>s for maintaining communication with <a href="Milne%20Force">Milne Force</a>. One was taken to Mud Bay while the other remained on "Arunta". Two <a href="Army%20No.%20101%20Wireless%20Set">Army No. 101 Wireless Set</a>s enabled battalion headquarters to communicate with Mud Bay. Each <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> had an <a href="Army%20No.%20108%20Wireless%20Set">Army No. 108 Wireless Set</a> to talk to battalion headquarters.

The Mud Bay force travelled in "Arunta" and came ashore at 23:00 in the "Maclaren King", two of the ship's launches, the three Japanese landing craft and the two powered whaleboats. A base was established at Mud Bay, where a dressing station was prepared and heavy equipment, including all but one <a href="2-inch%20mortar">2-inch mortar</a> per company, was cached. The Australians then set out on a gruelling march to Kilia, guided by Papuan policemen. As they moved off, a violent thunderstorm broke, and it started to rain heavily. The force pushed on toward Kilia, but made slow progress that night due to the steep terrain and heavy rain. They were still half a mile from Kilia at 08:30 on 23 October, when they encountered the Japanese.

The Australians were crossing a creek that was in front of a steep hill. The Japanese commander waited until the Australians were almost at his position before opening fire with machine guns and mortars. The troops who had crossed the creek found hand grenades were being rolled down the hill at them; those behind it were pinned down by heavy and accurate fire. Arnold decided to pull back. That night, he formed a defensive position, and beat off a small Japanese attack.

Meanwhile, the Taleba Bay force on "Stuart" transferred to "Tieryo", a ship's launch and a ship's whaleboat, and was ashore by 03:30 on 23 October. They captured a Japanese machine gun position at about 06:00. Two <a href="platoon">platoon</a>s went south where they were engaged by Japanese forces. The Japanese were driven beyond Niubulu Creek, but a heavy Japanese counterattack from the north at 09:00 inflicted casualties on the Australians and forced them to withdraw from the area. Gategood broke radio silence and attempted to contact Arnold on the 108 set, but was unable to reach him. After this, they came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, which inflicted heavy casualties. Having lost six men killed and ten wounded, with three more posted as missing, the Australians were forced to fall back under pressure from the pursuing Japanese. Lieutenant Clifford Hoskings would later receive the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for silencing a Japanese machine gun in the ensuing fighting. Faced with being overrun, Gategood withdrew his force even further, at first back to Taleba Bay, and then to Mud Bay aboard "Stuart", arriving on 24 October.

Gategood could not get through on the radio because the petrol generator that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link with Mud Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100 rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay. A promised air strike failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, as well as the ketch "Maclaren King" in Mud Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.

With the Australian forces unable to advance, the Japanese withdrew during the night. They were transported, along with their equipment and supplies, by their two landing craft to <a href="Fergusson%20Island">Fergusson Island</a>, where they arrived at dawn on 25 October. From there, 261 men were collected by the light cruiser the following day. The 2/12th Infantry Battalion then pressed on from Kilia to Galaiwai Bay, meeting no resistance and finding well-prepared but unmanned defences.

The bombing and strafing of native villages by the Allied Air Forces caused some 600 Goodenough Islanders to flee to Fergusson Island, where Timperley's ANGAU detachment had set up a refugee camp and was caring for them until the fighting was over and they could safely return. Australian losses on Goodenough Island were 13 killed in action or died of wounds, and 19 wounded. The Japanese suffered 20 killed and 15 wounded during the battle, but the 2/12th counted 39 dead. However, this was only an estimate as the Japanese had been able to retrieve and bury their dead, which had made it difficult for the Australians to accurately determine their casualties. Despite the evacuation, some Japanese were left behind. One was captured by islanders on 30 October and handed over to Timperley. Two died from malaria in November 1942, and another, Shigeki Yokota, evaded capture until he was taken prisoner in July 1943.

Two American officers, one each from the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">Air Corps</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Corps of Engineers</a>, had accompanied the 2/12th Infantry Battalion's landing on Goodenough Island with the mission of locating suitable sites for airbases and air warning facilities. They found good sites around Vivigani and Wataluma. The Vivigani site was cleared by local labourers who established a by emergency fighter landing strip. The 1st Battalion, <a href="91st%20Engineer%20General%20Service%20Regiment">91st Engineer General Service Regiment</a>, was assigned the task of developing <a href="Vivigani%20Airfield">Vivigani Airfield</a> into a major airbase capable of handling heavy bombers. The 2/12th Infantry Battalion remained on the island until the end of December, eventually being shipped to <a href="Oro%20Bay">Oro Bay</a> on the night of 28–29 December to join the attack on Buna on 31 December, leaving 75 men behind. The American engineers were withdrawn to Port Moresby.

Without the engineers, the plans to develop Goodenough Island had to be postponed. Due to the strategic importance of the island for the forthcoming operations against the Imperial Japanese forces in the South West Pacific Area, the small Australian occupation force used deception and camouflage to make the Japanese believe that a <a href="brigade">brigade</a>-sized force occupied the island. They fabricated dummy structures, including a hospital, anti-aircraft guns constructed of simple logs pointed at the sky, and barricades of jungle vines which looked like barbed wire. They also lit fires to appear as cooking fires for large numbers of soldiers, and sent messages in easily broken codes consistent with a brigade.

A new garrison, the <a href="47th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">Australian 47th Infantry Battalion</a>, a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> unit under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Tasker, arrived from Milne Bay on 4 March 1943. This became the major component of Drake Force, which also included a company of the 4th Field Ambulance, C Troop of the 2/10th Field Battery, B Troop of the 2/17th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, a section of the 11th Field Company, and detachments of signals, workshop and camouflage units. In all, Drake Force had a total strength of about 720 men. On 5 and 6 March, Japanese bombers attacked ships in the anchorage, and the airstrip and village at Vivigani. They wounded two men, but caused no damage.

In the aftermath of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, Japanese troops and sailors were again shipwrecked on Goodenough Island. Responding to reports from ANGAU, the police and civilian informants, patrols searched the island for Japanese survivors. In a week of vigorous patrolling between 8 and 14 March 1943, the 47th Infantry Battalion located and killed 72 Japanese, captured 42, and found another nine dead on a raft. A remarkable coup was achieved by a patrol under Captain Joseph Pascoe that killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat-bottomed boats. In the boats they found documents in sealed tins. On translation by the <a href="Allied%20Translator%20and%20Interpreter%20Section">Allied Translator and Interpreter Section</a>, one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List, with the names and postings of every officer. It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army, including many units never previously reported. Moreover, a mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit. Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan.

A four-man survey party from <a href="No.%205%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF</a> arrived on Goodenough Island on 3 January 1943. They selected Beli Beli Bay as a suitable site for an anchorage. Here, a 5,000 <a href="Gross%20register%20tonnage">ton</a> (14,000 m) ship could anchor half a mile (0.8 km) offshore with some degree of shelter from the south-east and north-west. A member of the survey team and 100 local workers recruited by ANGAU began constructing a jetty at Beli Beli Bay and improving the foot track to Vivigani. An advance party of 54 men from No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron arrived on 27 February 1943.

Plans for <a href="Operation%20Chronicle">Operation Chronicle</a>, the invasion of <a href="Woodlark%20Island">Woodlark</a> and <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina Islands</a>, called for fighter cover from Goodenough Island. The operation was scheduled for June 1943, so the pace of construction work was accelerated. The rest of No. 5 Mobile Works Squadron arrived in late March, followed by <a href="No.%207%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 7 Mobile Works Squadron</a> in April. A fighter strip was completed and sealed with a mixture of gravel and bitumen. <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a>s of <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron RAAF</a> arrived on 12 June. It was joined by Nos. 76 and <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">79 Squadrons RAAF</a> on 16 June, and <a href="No.%2073%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 73 Wing RAAF</a> assumed control of the three fighter squadrons on the island. A by bomber strip was completed on 20 October, although <a href="No.%2030%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 30 Squadron RAAF</a> had already commenced operations from the strip on 10 October. Work on the airbase at Vivigani continued until November, by which time there were taxiways and dispersal areas for 24 heavy and 60 medium bombers, and 115 fighters. No. 7 Mobile Works Squadron also built two wharves for <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a>s.

The island, now codenamed "Amoeba", became a staging point and supply base for operations in New Guinea and New Britain, and <a href="USASOS">USASOS</a> Sub Base C was established on the island on 27 April 1943. Sub Base C was abolished in July when responsibility for Goodenough Island passed to <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army">Alamo Force</a>, whose headquarters opened on Goodenough Island on 15 August. From there, it directed operations in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arawe">Battles of Arawae</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Gloucester">Cape Gloucester</a>, and the <a href="landing%20at%20Saidor">landing at Saidor</a>.

In August 1943, Goodenough Island was chosen as the site for a number of hospitals to treat casualties incurred as Allied forces advanced through the Pacific. Work on the 750-bed 360th Station Hospital commenced on 15 September 1943, followed by the 1,000-bed 9th General Hospital on 4 November. A staging area for 60,000 troops was also established on the island. Thousands of American troops later passed through Goodenough Island before the base was closed at the end of 1944.

Thomas Baker (aviator)

Thomas Charles Richmond Baker, (2 May 1897 – 4 November 1918) was an Australian soldier, aviator, and <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> of the First World War. Born in <a href="Smithfield%2C%20South%20Australia">Smithfield, South Australia</a>, he was an active sportsman in his youth and developed a keen interest in aviation. He was employed as a clerk with the <a href="Bank%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Bank of New South Wales</a>, before he enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> in July 1915, for service in World War I. Posted to an artillery unit on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, he was awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a> for carrying out numerous repairs on a communications line while subject to severe artillery fire. In June 1917, Baker was awarded a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his decoration for his part in quelling a fire in one of the artillery gun pits that was endangering approximately 300 rounds of <a href="Shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> and <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high explosive</a>.

In September 1917, Baker applied for a position as a mechanic in the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>. He was instead selected for flight training, and was posted to courses in the United Kingdom. He graduated as a pilot and was commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in March 1918. Posted for active duty in France that June, Baker joined the ranks of <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a>. Over the next four months, he rose to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> and was credited with bringing down 12 German aircraft. He was shot down and killed on 4 November 1918. In February 1919, he was posthumously awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a>.

Thomas Charles Richmond Baker was born in <a href="Smithfield%2C%20South%20Australia">Smithfield, South Australia</a>, on 2 May 1897, the eldest son of Richmond Baker, a <a href="schoolmaster">schoolmaster</a> and farmer, and his wife Annie Martha (née Gardner). He was educated at <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20College%2C%20Adelaide">St Peter's College</a> in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. During his school years Baker was an active sportsman, taking part in rowing, tennis and football, in addition to being a member of the cadet corps. In his youth, he acquired an avid interest in aviation, and the construction of model aeroplanes became "his chief hobby". Graduating from secondary school in 1914, he gained employment as a clerk with the Adelaide branch of the <a href="Bank%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Bank of New South Wales</a>. During this time, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Engineers">11th Royal Australian Engineers</a> of the <a href="Citizens%20Military%20Force">Citizens Military Force</a>.

On 29 July 1915, Baker enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> for service during the First World War. Allocated as a reinforcement to the 6th Field Artillery Brigade with the rank of <a href="Gunner%20%28rank%29">gunner</a>, he embarked from <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> aboard HMAT "Persic" on 22 November, bound for <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. On arrival, Baker was posted to the 16th Battery before moving to France for service on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Disembarking in France on 1 July 1916, Baker took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme offensive</a>.

On 11 December 1916, Baker was engaged in battle with his unit near <a href="Gueudecourt">Gueudecourt</a>. During the action, he was posted as a telephonist with the forward observation team sent to record the fall of the artillery and secure the range for a bombardment. Their position during this time was on a forward slope of the Australian frontline, which was subject to constant observation and the attention of German snipers. Attempting to maintain communications, Baker ventured out on four occasions during the engagement, each time subject to the heavy artillery barrage from the German forces, and repaired the telephone line in thirty separate places. As a consequence, the 16th Battery was able to align its artillery barrage and destroy the Germans' forward trench. Commended for his "great gallantry" as well as "good service and ... great devotion to duty", Baker was awarded the <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>. The announcement for the decoration was published in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 19 February 1917.

In 1917, the 16th Battery was relocated to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Messines</a> sector of the frontline in Belgium. On 16 March, Baker was admitted to hospital suffering from an illness; he returned to his unit six days later. During the afternoon of 21 June, the unit's position was subject to a severe bombardment of artillery shelling, resulting in an order for all men to evacuate the gun pits and seek cover. As a consequence of the barrage, the camouflage covering one of the gun pits caught fire, endangering approximately 300 rounds of <a href="Shrapnel%20shell">shrapnel</a> and <a href="Explosive%20material%23High%20explosives">high explosives</a>. The <a href="Company%20Sergeant%20Major">battery sergeant major</a> immediately called for men to assist him in quelling the blaze; Baker and three others volunteered. Despite the continuous shellfire, the four men promptly set about retrieving water from a nearby well and shellholes with buckets "at great personal risk", dousing the fire. The camouflage had been completely destroyed, several sand bags had caught fire, and a few rounds of ammunition were charred. As a result of their actions, Baker's three companions were recommended for the Military Medal, and Baker for a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his. The announcement of the decorations was promogulated in a supplement to the "London Gazette" on 21 August 1917.

In September 1917, Baker followed his ambition of joining the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> and applied for a transfer to become an air mechanic when the opportunity arose. His application proved successful, though he was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training. Embarking for the United Kingdom the following month, he was posted to No. 5 Training Squadron as a cadet pilot for his initial aviation instruction. On 27 March, Baker graduated as a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps and was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>; he had completed his first solo flight earlier that month. In May, he was posted for a course at No. 2 School of Aerial Fighting and Gunnery.

Baker proceeded overseas to France on 15 June 1918 and, on arrival the following day, was posted to <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a> piloting <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s. On 23 June, he flew his first operational sortie over the German lines; he was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> four days later. On 31 July, Baker was among a formation of seven Camels tasked with carrying out a patrol over German-held territory. The group crossed over into German lines near <a href="Nieppe">Nieppe Forrest</a>, and flew towards <a href="Estaires">Estaires</a>. The Camels soon intercepted a formation of seven <a href="Fokker%20D.VII">Fokker D.VII</a>s, and the entire patrol immediately dived at the German aircraft. In the ensuing melee, Baker managed to force one of the aircraft down to the ground, thus scoring his first aerial victory.

Throughout August 1918, No. 4 Squadron "maintained a high operational tempo" as the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">launched a new offensive</a> on the Western Front. On 7 August, Baker and two others took off from their squadron aerodrome at <a href="Reclinghem">Reclinghem</a>; all three machines were carrying a heavy load of bombs. Airborne over Pont-du-Hem, the trio released their bombs over German <a href="billet">billet</a>s in the area, before spotting two <a href="Albatros%20D.V">Albatros D.V</a>s. The three Australians closed in on the two aircraft. Baker engaged an Albatros, his fire severing the left wing of the aircraft, effectively destroying the machine. Nine days later, a formation of 65 aircraft was assembled from <a href="No.%2088%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 88 Squadron RAF</a>, <a href="No.%2092%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 92 Squadron RAF</a>, <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron AFC</a> and Baker's No. 4 Squadron AFC to execute a mass raid on the German aerodrome at <a href="Haubourdin">Haubourdin</a>. The fleet of aircraft was equipped with a range of incendiary and explosive bombs, in addition to machine gun ammunition. Led by Captain <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, the aircraft from No. 4 Squadron were the first to sweep down and assault the target. At one point, Baker pursued a staff car until the vehicle ran up an embankment and flipped over. He later reported that "No one left the car". The raid, which was the largest aerial attack by Allied forces to that date, was highly successful; British estimates concluded that 37 German aeroplanes had been destroyed.

On 19 August, Baker led a patrol of six aircraft over <a href="Lys%20%28department%29">Lys</a>. Five days later, he shot down a German <a href="Observation%20balloon">balloon</a> while on a lone mission in poor weather, scoring his third aerial victory. At dawn on 30 August, Baker took off on a sortie with Lieutenants <a href="Elwyn%20King">Roy King</a> and Oscar Ramsay. Over <a href="Laventie">Laventie</a>, the trio encountered three <a href="DFW%20C.V">DFW C.V</a>s; Baker and King each disposed of one of the aircraft. Baker was granted two weeks' leave to the United Kingdom in early September. Towards the end of that month, No. 4 Squadron relocated to Serny and was soon after re-equipped with the <a href="Sopwith%20Snipe">Sopwith Snipe</a>. By the time of the conversion, Baker had achieved <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> status on the Sopwith Camel, having been credited with shooting down six German aircraft by early October.

Baker was promoted to temporary <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> and made a flight commander in No. 4 Squadron on 24 October. Two days later, Baker and Lieutenant <a href="Thomas%20Barkell">Thomas Barkell</a> led a formation of nine Snipes. As the patrol drew near <a href="Tournai">Tournai</a> in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed to shoot the Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.

On 28 October, Baker was credited with the destruction of a further three German aircraft from two separate patrols into Belgium that day. During the second excursion, he brought one Fokker down out of control, before shooting the other down over <a href="Ath">Ath</a>. He was airborne again on an offensive patrol the next day. Fifteen Snipes from No. 4 Squadron were detailed for the patrol, and as the party drew near Tournai they encountered approximately 60 Fokker planes already engaged with several British aircraft. Baker led five of the Snipes into the assault, but confusion reigned for several minutes before the men could gain their bearings in the fight. Baker assailed two Fokkers that had been pursuing another Snipe, and was able to destroy one of the aircraft. On 30 October, "considerable activity" was observed at the German aerodrome in Rebaix, and a formation of aircraft from No. 2 Squadron were detailed to bomb the area; an escort of eleven Snipes—including Baker—from No. 4 Squadron was provided. As the bombing was taking place, several Fokker aircraft appeared and were intercepted by the Snipes. In the ensuing battle, Baker critically damaged one of the Fokkers, resulting in the aircraft dropping towards the ground tail-first on its back. The Fokker proved to be Baker's twelfth, and final, aerial victory of the war; he had scored his last five victories in a period of three days.

On 4 November 1918, the whole of No. 80 Wing RAF—of which No. 4 Squadron was part—took to the sky in an effort to "harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road" and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of <a href="Leuze%2C%20Aisne">Leuze</a>. A formation of Sopwith Snipes from No. 4 Squadron had been utilised as an escort when the initial raid was carried out, and then to protect the bombers as they returned to the Allied lines. However, when the Australians had executed the latter duty, they were tailed by a patrol of twelve Fokkers. After seeing the bombers off, the Snipes wheeled around to confront the German aircraft. The battle raged for two or three minutes before dying out. As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered that three pilots were missing; Baker was among the three. Baker and fellow ace Lieutenant <a href="Arthur%20Palliser%20%28aviator%29">Arthur Palliser</a> were initially recorded as missing, but were later found to have fallen victim to "Rittmeister" <a href="Karl%20Bolle">Karl Bolle</a> during the battle.

Described as "the most gallant airman ... and ... a pilot far above the average" by one of the men in his squadron, Baker was buried in Escanaffles Communal Cemetery, Belgium. His aerial victories were broken down as seven aircraft and one balloon destroyed with an additional four planes driven down out of control, making him No. 4 Squadron's fourth highest scoring ace after Harry Cobby, Roy King and <a href="Edgar%20McCloughry">Edgar McCloughry</a>. A stained-glass window at St John's Church of England in Adelaide is dedicated to his memory. On 8 February 1919, the "London Gazette" carried the <a href="Posthumous%20recognition">posthumous</a> announcement of the award of the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> to Thomas Baker, reading:

Tawny owl

The tawny owl or brown owl ("Strix aluco") is a stocky, medium-sized <a href="owl">owl</a> commonly found in <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s across much of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and the upperparts are either brown or grey. Several of the eleven recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have both variants. The <a href="Bird%20nest">nest</a> is typically in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. This owl is <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> and highly territorial. Many young birds starve if they cannot find a vacant territory once parental care ceases.

This <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> hunts mainly <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, usually by dropping from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes a higher proportion of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the <a href="Eurasian%20Eagle%20Owl">eagle owl</a> or <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>.

Although many people believe this owl has exceptional night vision, its <a href="retina">retina</a> is no more sensitive than a human's and its asymmetrically placed ears are key to its hunting by giving it excellent directional hearing. Its nocturnal habits and eerie, easily imitated call, have led to a mythical association of the tawny owl with bad luck and death.

The tawny owl is a robust bird, in length, with an wingspan. Weight can range from . Its large rounded head lacks ear tufts, and the facial disc surrounding the dark brown eyes is usually rather plain. The <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate race</a> has two <a href="morphotype">morph</a>s which differ in their <a href="plumage">plumage</a> colour, one form having rufous brown upperparts and the other greyish brown, although intermediates also occur. The underparts of both morphs are whitish and streaked with brown. Feathers are moulted gradually between June and December. This species is <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>; the female is much larger than the male, 5% longer and more than 25% heavier.

The tawny owl flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and typically at a greater height. The flight of the tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe on the leading edge of the outer <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primaries</a>. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; <a href="Great%20grey%20owl">great grey</a>, <a href="eagle%20owl">eagle</a> and <a href="Ural%20owl">Ural owl</a>s are similar in shape, but much larger.

An owl's eyes are placed at the front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better <a href="binocular%20vision">binocular vision</a> than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's <a href="retina">retina</a> has about 56,000 light-sensitive <a href="rod%20cell">rod cell</a>s per square millimetre (36 million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> part of the <a href="Electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a> have been dismissed, it is still often said to have <a href="bird%20vision">eyesight</a> 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s.

Adaptations to night vision include the large size of the eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of <a href="cone%20cell">cone cell</a>s, since <a href="rod%20cell">rod cell</a>s have superior light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one <a href="Fovea%20centralis">fovea</a>, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a>.

Hearing is important for a nocturnal <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a>, and as with other owls, the tawny owl's two ear openings differ in structure and are asymmetrically placed to improve directional hearing. A passage through the skull links the eardrums, and small differences in the time of arrival of a sound at each ear enables its source to be pinpointed. The left ear opening is higher on the head than the larger right ear and tilts downward, improving sensitivity to sounds from below. Both ear openings are hidden under the facial disk feathers, which are structurally specialized to be transparent to sound, and are supported by a movable fold of skin (the pre-aural flap).

The internal structure of the ear, which has large numbers of auditory <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s, gives an improved ability to detect low-frequency sounds at a distance, which could include rustling made by prey moving in vegetation. The tawny owl's hearing is ten times better than a human's, and it can hunt using this sense alone in the dark of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.

The commonly heard female contact call is a shrill, "kew-wick" but the male has a quavering advertising song "hoo...ho, ho, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo". <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> used this owl's song in "<a href="Love%27s%20Labour%27s%20Lost">Love's Labour's Lost</a>" (Act 5, Scene 2) as "Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; Tu-who, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot", but this <a href="stereotype">stereotypical</a> call is actually a duet, with the female making the "kew-wick" sound, and the male responding "hooo". The call is easily imitated by blowing into cupped hands through slightly parted thumbs, and a study in <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a> found that this <a href="mimicry">mimicry</a> produced a response from the owl within 30 minutes in 94% of trials. A male's response to a broadcast song appears to be indicative of his health and vigour; owls with higher blood parasite loads use fewer high frequencies and a more limited range of frequencies in their responses to an apparent intruder.

Although both colour <a href="morphotype">morph</a>s occur in much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey morph becoming more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>n and <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>n subspecies have grey and white plumage, the <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>n race is dark grey-brown, and <a href="South%20Asia">South</a> and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n subspecies are 12% larger and 40% heavier, and have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a> which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.

The plumage colour is <a href="gene">gene</a>tically controlled, and studies in Finland and Italy indicate that grey-morph tawny owls have more reproductive success, better immune resistance, and fewer <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> than brown birds. Although this might suggest that eventually the brown morph could disappear, the owls show no colour preference when choosing a mate, so the adverse selection pressure is reduced. There are also environmental factors involved. The Italian study showed that brown-morph birds were found in denser woodland, and in Finland, <a href="Gloger%27s%20rule">Gloger's rule</a> would suggest that paler birds would in any case predominate in the colder climate.

The species was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20naturae">Systema naturae</a>" in 1758 under its current scientific name. The <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a> derives from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "strix" "owl" and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> "allocco", "tawny owl" (from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ulucus" "screech-owl").
The tawny owl is a member of the wood-owl genus "<a href="Strix%20%28genus%29">Strix</a>", part of the <a href="true%20owl">typical owl</a> family Strigidae, which contains all species of owl other than the <a href="Tytonidae">barn owls</a>. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are <a href="Hume%27s%20owl">Hume's owl</a>, "Strix butleri", (formerly considered to be <a href="Conspecificity">conspecific</a>), the <a href="Himalayan%20owl">Himalayan owl</a>, "Strix nivicolum", (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the <a href="Ural%20owl">Ural owl</a>, "S. uralensis", and the <a href="North%20America">North America</a>n <a href="barred%20owl">barred owl</a>, "S. varia". The <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early</a>–<a href="Middle%20Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a> "Strix intermedia" is sometimes considered a <a href="paleosubspecies">paleosubspecies</a> of the tawny owl, which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.

The tawny owl subspecies are often poorly differentiated, and may be at a flexible stage of subspecies formation with features related to the ambient temperature, the colour tone of the local habitat, and the size of available prey. Consequently, various authors have historically described between 10 and 15 subspecies. The currently recognised subspecies are listed below.

The tawny owl has a distribution stretching discontinuously across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain and the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> eastwards to western <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. The subspecies "S. a. mauritanica" extends the range into northwest Africa. This essentially <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> owl is absent from <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> (probably because of competition from the <a href="long-eared%20owl">long-eared owl</a>), and only a rare vagrant to the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic</a> and <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>.

This species is found in <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> and mixed forests, and sometimes mature <a href="conifer">conifer</a> plantations, preferring locations with access to water. Cemeteries, gardens and parks have allowed it to spread into urban areas, including central <a href="London">London</a>. Although tawny owls occur in urban environments, especially those with natural forests and wooded habitat patches, they are less likely to occur at sites with high noise levels at night. The tawny owl is mainly a lowland bird in the colder parts of its range, but breeds to in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and up to in <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>.

The tawny owl has a geographical range of at least 10 million km (3.8 million mi) and a large population including an estimated 970,000–2,000,000 individuals in Europe alone. Population trends have not been quantified, but there is evidence of an overall increase. This owl is not believed to meet the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> criterion of declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations and is therefore evaluated as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. In the UK it is on the <a href="RSPB">RSPB</a> Amber List of Concern. This species has expanded its range in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and populations are stable or increasing in most European countries. Declines have occurred in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="Albania">Albania</a>.

Tawny owls pair off from the age of one year, and stay together in a usually <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> relationship for life. An established pair's territory is defended year-round and maintained with little, if any, boundary change from year to year. The pair sit in cover on a branch close to a tree trunk during the day, and usually roost separately from July to October. Roosting owls may be discovered and "mobbed" by small birds during the day, but they normally ignore the disturbance.

The tawny owl typically nests in a hole in a tree, but will also use old <a href="European%20magpie">European magpie</a> nests, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a> <a href="drey">drey</a> or holes in buildings, and readily takes to <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>es. It nests from February onwards in the south of its range, but rarely before mid-March in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. The glossy white eggs are in size and weigh of which 7% is shell. The typical clutch of two or three eggs is incubated by the female alone for 30 days to hatching, and the <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, downy chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in a further 35–39 days. The young usually leave the nest up to ten days before fledging, and hide on nearby branches.

This species is fearless in defence of its nest and young, and, like other "<a href="Strix%20%28genus%29">Strix</a>" owls, strikes for the intruder's head with its sharp talons. Because its flight is silent, it may not be detected until it is too late to avoid the danger. Dogs, cats and humans may be assaulted, sometimes without provocation. Perhaps the best-known victim of the tawny owl's fierce attack was the renowned bird photographer <a href="Eric%20Hosking">Eric Hosking</a>, who lost his left eye when struck by a bird he was attempting to photograph near its nest in 1937. He later called his autobiography "An Eye for a Bird".

The parents care for young birds for two or three months after they fledge, but from August to November the juveniles disperse to find a territory of their own to occupy. If they fail to find a vacant territory, they usually starve. The juvenile survival rate is unknown, but the annual survival rate for adults is 76.8%. The typical lifespan is five years, but an age of over 18 years has been recorded for a wild tawny owl, and of over 27 years for a captive bird.

Predators of the tawny owl include large birds such as <a href="Ural%20owl">Ural owl</a>s, <a href="eagle%20owl">eagle owl</a>s, <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s, and <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a>s. <a href="Pine%20marten">Pine marten</a>s may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances have been recorded of <a href="Eurasian%20jackdaw">Eurasian jackdaw</a>s building nests on top of a brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> study showed that predation by mammals, especially <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.

This species is increasingly affected by <a href="avian%20malaria">avian malaria</a>, the incidence of which has tripled in the last 70 years, in parallel with increasing global temperatures. An increase of one degree Celsius produces a two- to three-fold increase in the rate of malaria. In 2010, the incidence in British tawny owls was 60%, compared to 2–3% in 1996.

The tawny owl hunts almost entirely at night, watching from a perch before dropping or gliding silently down to its victim, but very occasionally it will hunt in daylight when it has young to feed. This species takes a wide range of <a href="predation">prey</a>, mainly woodland <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, but also other <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s up to the size of a young <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>, and <a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s. In urban areas, birds make up a larger proportion of the diet, and species as unlikely as <a href="mallard">mallard</a> and <a href="kittiwake">kittiwake</a> have been killed and eaten.

Prey is typically swallowed whole, with indigestible parts regurgitated as <a href="Pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a>. These are medium-sized and grey, consisting mainly of rodent fur and often with bones protruding, and are found in groups under trees used for roosting or nesting.

Less powerful woodland owls such as the <a href="little%20owl">little owl</a> and the <a href="long-eared%20owl">long-eared owl</a> cannot usually co-exist with the stronger tawny owls, which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> the absence of the tawny owl allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl. Similarly, where the tawny owl has moved into built-up areas, it tends to displace <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a>s from their traditional nesting sites in buildings.

The tawny owl, like its relatives, has often been seen as an omen of bad luck; <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> used it as such in "<a href="Julius%20Caesar%20%28play%29">Julius Caesar</a>" (Act 1 Scene 3): "And yesterday the bird of night did sit/ Even at noon-day upon the market-place/ Hooting and shrieking." <a href="John%20Ruskin">John Ruskin</a> is quoted as saying "Whatever wise people may say of them, I at least have found the owl's cry always prophetic of mischief to me".

Wordsworth described the technique for calling an owl in his poem "There was a Boy".

<poem>
And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands
Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth
Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,
Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,
That they might answer him.—And they would shout
Across the watery vale, and shout again,
Responsive to his call,—with quivering peals,
And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud
Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild
Of jocund din!

Battle of Winterthur

The Battle of Winterthur (27 May 1799) was an important action between elements of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Danube">Army of the Danube</a> and elements of the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> army, commanded by <a href="Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Hotze">Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze</a>, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a>, part of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. The small town of <a href="Winterthur">Winterthur</a> lies northeast of <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, in Switzerland. Because of its position at the junction of seven roads, the army that held the town controlled access to most of Switzerland and points crossing the Rhine into southern Germany. Although the forces involved were small, the ability of the Austrians to sustain their 11-hour assault on the French line resulted in the consolidation of three Austrian forces on the plateau north of Zürich, leading to the French <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Zurich">defeat</a> a few days later.

By mid-May 1799, the Austrians had wrested control of parts of <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Switzerland</a> from the French as forces under the command of Hotze and Count <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Bellegarde">Heinrich von Bellegarde</a> pushed them out of the <a href="Grison%20Alps">Grisons</a>. After defeating <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean-Baptiste Jourdan</a>'s 25,000-man <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Danube">Army of the Danube</a> at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Ostrach">Ostrach</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Stockach</a>, the main Austrian army, under command of <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a>, crossed the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> at the Swiss town of <a href="Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a> and prepared to unite with the armies of Hotze and <a href="Friedrich%20Joseph%2C%20Count%20of%20Nauendorf">Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf</a>, on the plains surrounding Zürich.

The French <a href="Army%20of%20Helvetia">Army of Helvetia</a> and the Army of the Danube, now both under the command of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">André Masséna</a>, sought to prevent this merger. Masséna sent <a href="Michel%20Ney">Michel Ney</a> and a small mixed cavalry and infantry force from Zürich to stop Hotze's force at Winterthur. Despite a sharp contest, the Austrians succeeded in pushing the French out of the Winterthur highlands, although both sides took high casualties. Once the union of the Habsburg armies took place in early June, Archduke Charles attacked French positions at Zürich and forced the French to withdraw beyond the <a href="Limmat">Limmat</a>.

Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the revolution in France as a conflict between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. As revolutionary rhetoric grew more strident, they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family; this <a href="Declaration%20of%20Pillnitz">Declaration of Pillnitz</a> threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés continued to agitate for a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the <a href="French%20National%20Convention">French National Convention</a> declared war on Austria. In this <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun%20%281792%29">Verdun</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Neerwinden%20%281793%29">Neerwinden</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mainz">Mainz</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Amberg">Amberg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>, the efforts of <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> in northern <a href="Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">Italy</a> pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the <a href="Peace%20of%20Leoben">Peace of Leoben</a> (17 April 1797) and the subsequent <a href="Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Treaty of Campo Formio</a> (17 October 1797).

The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details. Convened at a small town in the mid-Rhineland, <a href="Second%20Congress%20of%20Rastatt">Rastatt</a>, the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies. <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Ferdinand of Naples</a> refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the <a href="Parthenopean%20Republic">Parthenopean Republic</a>. Encouraged by the French Republic, a republican uprising in the Swiss cantons led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a>. The <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a> was convinced that the Austrians were planning to start another war. Indeed, the weaker France seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British discussed this possibility. In mid-spring, the Austrians reached an agreement with <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Tsar Paul</a> of Russia by which <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Alexander Suvorov</a> would come out of retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60,000 troops.

The French Directory's military strategy in 1799 called for offensive campaigns on all fronts: central Italy, northern Italy, the Swiss cantons, the upper <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, and The Netherlands. Theoretically, the French had a combined force of 250,000 troops, but this was on paper, not in the field. As winter broke in 1799, General <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean-Baptiste Jourdan</a> and the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Danube">Army of the Danube</a>, at a paper strength of 50,000 and an actual strength of 25,000, crossed the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> between <a href="Basel">Basel</a> and <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a> on 1 March. This crossing officially violated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Treaty of Campo Formio</a>. The Army of the Danube advanced through the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> and, by mid-March, established an offensive position at the western and northern edge of the <a href="Swiss%20Plateau">Swiss Plateau</a> by the village of <a href="Ostrach">Ostrach</a>. <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">André Masséna</a> had already pushed into Switzerland with his force of 30,000, and successfully passed into the <a href="Grison%20Alps">Grison Alps</a>, <a href="Chur">Chur</a>, and Finstermünz on the <a href="Inn%20%28river%29">Inn</a>. Theoretically, his left flank was to link with Jourdan's right flank, commanded by <a href="Pierre%20Marie%20Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Ferino">Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino</a>, at the far eastern shore of <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a>.

The Austrians had arrayed their own army in a line from the <a href="State%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> to the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. A force of 46,000 under command of <a href="Count%20Heinrich%20von%20Bellegarde">Count Heinrich von Bellegarde</a> formed the defence of the <a href="Tyrol">Tyrol</a>. Another small Austrian force of 26,000 commanded by <a href="Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Hotze">Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze</a> guarded the <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a>. The main Austrian Army—close to 80,000 troops under the command of <a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles</a>—had wintered in the Bavarian, Austrian, and <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Salzburg">Salzburg</a> territories on the eastern side of the <a href="Lech%20%28river%29">Lech</a>. At the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Ostrach">Ostrach</a> (21 March) and <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281799%29">Stockach</a> (25 March), the main Austrian force pushed the Army of the Danube back into the Black Forest. Charles made plans to cross the upper Rhine at the Swiss town of <a href="Schaffhausen">Schaffhausen</a>. Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze brought a portion (approximately 8,000) of his force west, leaving the rest to defend the Vorarlberg. At the same time, <a href="Friedrich%20Joseph%2C%20Count%20of%20Nauendorf">Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf</a>, brought the left wing of the main Austrian force across the Rhine by Eglisau. They planned to unite with the main Austrian army, controlling the northern access points of <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a> and forcing an engagement with Masséna.

By mid-May, French morale was low. They had suffered terrible losses at Ostrach and Stockach, although these had been made up by reinforcements. Two senior officers of the Army of the Danube, <a href="Charles%20Mathieu%20Isidore%20Decaen">Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen</a> and <a href="Jean-Joseph%20Ange%20d%27Hautpoul">Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul</a>, were facing <a href="court-martial">courts-martial</a> on charges of misconduct, professed by their senior officer, Jourdan. <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Bernadotte">Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte</a> and <a href="Laurent%20de%20Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr</a> were sick, or claimed they were, and had left the army's encampments to recover their health. Masséna's force had been repelled by Hotze's army at <a href="Feldkirch%2C%20Vorarlberg">Feldkirch</a>, and forced to fall back, and LeCourbe's failure to push through against Bellegarde's Austrian force in the Tyrol meant Masséna had to pull his southern wing back as well as his center and northern wing, to maintain communication with the retreating armies on his flanks. At this point, also, the Swiss revolted again, this time against the French, and Zürich became the last defensible position Masséna could take.

Winterthur (; ) lies in a basin south and east of the <a href="T%C3%B6ss%20%28river%29">Töss</a> approximately northeast of Zürich. To the north and east of the town lies a ring of hills approximately high. To the west, the Töss runs on its course north toward the Rhine. The locale of a Roman settlement from 200 to 400, and the site of a medieval battle in 919, its location at seven crossroads gave it strategic importance in the effort to control north–south and east–west communication in the early days of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a>.

After the defeats at the battles at Ostrach and Stockach, and the Army of the Danube's retreat into the Black Forest, the <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a> had sacked Jean-Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command of both the <a href="Army%20of%20Helvetia">Army of Helvetia</a> and the Army of the Danube to <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">André Masséna</a>. Protecting the northern access to Zürich, Masséna gathered some of the best commanders he had available; eventually, three of them would become Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a dependable General of Division.

The situation for the French was dire. Not only had they been trounced in southwestern Germany, the legendary <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Alexander Suvorov</a> was on his way to northern Italy with 60,000 Russians to take command of Coalition forces there. Count Heinrich Bellegarde, positioned with 20,000 men in the Grisons, effectively isolated Masséna's force from any assistance out of Italy. Most threatening, Archduke Charles' main army lay less than a day away; in size alone, it could overwhelm him, or, if he withdrew to the west, its position cut off his avenue of withdrawal toward France. If Charles' left wing, commanded by Nauendorf, united with Hotze's force, approaching from the east, Masséna knew Charles would attack and very likely push him out of Zürich.

To prevent this merger of the Austrian forces, Masséna established a forward line centred at Winterthur, and under overall command of the experienced <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Tharreau">Jean Victor Tharreau</a>. The French forces were arrayed in an uneven semicircle, in which Winterthur formed the central part. The command of the Winterthur brigades was the most important. If the center could not hold its position, the flanks would be isolated and crushed. Masséna sent newly promoted General of Division <a href="Michel%20Ney">Michel Ney</a> to Winterthur on 27 May 1799 to take command of the center. Masséna recalled him from his assignment commanding an outpost of <a href="Claude%20Lecourbe">Claude Lecourbe</a>'s force in central Switzerland, and gave him a command more fitting with his new rank. Ney arrived with the reputation for boldness considered typical of cavalry officers, but with minimal experience in commanding mixed forces. Anxious to prove himself but aware of protocols, he had hurried to Tharreau's headquarters, but had to wait for his "letters of service" before he could take command. These arrived on 25 May. The troops at Winterthur included a brigade of four battalions commanded by <a href="Dominique%20Mansuy%20Roget">Dominique Mansuy Roget</a>, a weak brigade commanded by <a href="Th%C3%A9odore%20Maxime%20Gazan">Théodore Maxime Gazan</a>, and a cavalry brigade commanded by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Henri%20Walther">Frédéric Henri Walther</a>.

Like Ney, Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, the Austrian commander, was also a cavalry officer. Unlike Ney, he had broad field experience. The Swiss-born Hotze had entered the military service of the Duke of Württemberg in 1758 and had been promoted to "<a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a>", or captain of cavalry; he had campaigned briefly in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, but saw no combat. Later, he served in the Russian army in the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281768%E2%80%931774%29">Russo-Turkish War</a> (1768–74). With an Austrian commission, he joined the Habsburg imperial army, and served in the brief <a href="War%20of%20the%20Bavarian%20Succession">War of the Bavarian Succession</a> (1778–79). His campaigning in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, particularly at the <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Battle of Würzburg</a>, had earned him the confidence of Archduke Charles and elevation to the ranks of nobility by Charles' brother, <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>.

On 22 May 1799, <a href="Friedrich%20Joseph%2C%20Count%20of%20Nauendorf">Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf</a>, led a large column across the Rhine at <a href="Konstanz">Konstanz</a>, <a href="Stein%20am%20Rhein">Stein</a> and <a href="Eglisau">Eglisau</a>. Hotze's force had already crossed the Rhine further east, where it was still a mountain stream, and passed through the <a href="Grison%20Alps">Grisons</a>, into <a href="Toggenburg">Toggenburg</a>, and moved toward Zürich.

To prevent these two forces from joining with Archduke Charles' 100,000 men, on 22 May, Masséna and 23,000 troops of the Army of the Danube marched from Zürich in the direction of Winterthur. Once past Winterthur, they made their way another northeast and, on 25 May, the two armies clashed at <a href="Frauenfeld">Frauenfeld</a>. Out-numbered almost four to one, Hotze's force was badly mauled by the French; 750 of Hotze's men were killed or wounded, and 1,450 captured; in addition, Hotze lost two guns, and one color. His second-in-command, Major General <a href="Christoph%20Karl%20von%20Piacsek">Christoph Karl von Piacsek</a>, was wounded in action and died later of his wounds. Despite the superiority of the French numbers, though, Hotze extricated his force from the engagement, manoeuvred around the French position, and escaped in the direction of Winterthur.

Meanwhile, by 26 May Nauendorf established camp near <a href="Andelfingen%2C%20Switzerland">Andelfingen</a> and reacquired contact with the main Austrian force. Having united with Nauendorf, Archduke Charles awaited Hotze's force, coming from the east, before he would attack the French at Zürich. That same night, Hotze camped between Frauenfeld and <a href="H%C3%BCttwilen">Hüttwilen</a>, about southeast of Nauendorf's position, and sent his advance posts as far ahead as Islikon and <a href="Elgg">Elgg</a>, only east of Winterthur.

On the morning of 27 May, Hotze assembled his force into three columns and marched toward Winterthur. Opposite him, Michel Ney, newly in command of his division of approximately 3,000 men, deployed his force around the heights, the so-called Ober-Winterthur, a ring of low-lying hills some north of the city.

Given the size of the Austrian force approaching him, Ney planned to withdraw to Winterthur. Before he could implement this action, the over-all commander of the forward line, <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Tharreau">Jean Victor Tharreau</a>, had galloped to his position and said he would support Ney by sending <a href="Jean-de-Dieu%20Soult">Jean-de-Dieu Soult</a>'s division; Ney understood this to mean he was to make a stand along the entire outpost line, and that he would not be isolated. His small force would receive reinforcements from Soult's division. Consequently, Ney directed the weakest brigade, under the command of Gazan, to move up a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another brigade, under the command of Roget, to take the right, preventing any Austrian flanking manoeuvre.

By mid-morning, Hotze's advanced guard had encountered moderate French resistance first from Roget's brigade, and then, almost immediately, from Gazan's. The Austrian advance troops quickly overran Gazan's weak brigade and took possession of the woods surrounding the village of Islikon. After securing the villages of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze deployed two of his columns facing the French front, while a third angled to the French right, as Ney had expected he would.

By mid-morning, Ney had moved toward the front with Gazan's brigade and he could see the enemy advancing toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000 men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.

Ney now had two problems: he expected support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily and he did not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.

Finally accepting that Soult would not arrive, Ney could not hope to hold his position, much less push the Austrians back. He concluded that he must fall back to Winterthur. To cover the retreat, he instructed Walther and his cavalry to establish a position on the Töss, above the bridge at Stieg. From there, the cavalry could protect an orderly retreat. Amidst a muddy rivulet feeding the Töss, Ney positioned a second detachment guarding the village of Töss and the road leading to a ridge of the hills, where he placed a couple of cannons. From the ridge, his rear guard could fire its artillery on the Austrian advance.

For Walther, at the bridge, the position appeared defensible for as long as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from the position.

When the Archduke heard of Hotze's success in taking Winterthur crossroads, he directed his troops to augment Nauendorf's, and to take the village and the environs of Neftenbach, west-northwest of Winterthur. <a href="Nicolas%20Oudinot">Nicolas Oudinot</a>, whose men had secured Neftenbach as part of the French forward line, held out for most of the day, but was forced to retreat to Pfungen in the late afternoon; his position there was not defensible and he was pushed further back to the outskirts of Zürich. By taking Neftenbach, Charles placed a formidable group of troops between Ney's force and Hotze's flank and forced an uneven French withdrawal toward Zürich. Tharreau manoeuvred around the Töss, attempting to re-establish his forward line, but Masséna did not want a general engagement between Zürich and Neftenbach, not there and not then. The Armies of Switzerland and the Danube were not ready to take on Charles; Masséna's forces were not prepared for a battle on the scale required in facing Charles' entire army, and he needed the defences offered by Zürich to mount a proper line against the impending Austrian attack. Eventually, Tharreau withdrew the entire forward line to Zürich. The clash took 11 hours.

Hotze's force took relatively high casualties—1,000 men killed, wounded or missing (12.5 percent) of his entire force of 8,000—although his losses were comparable to Ney's 800 killed wounded or missing, from his 7,000-man force (11.5 percent). More importantly, though, Hotze succeeded not only in pushing the French back from Winterthur, but also in uniting his force with Nauendorf and Charles'. The unified Austrian force completed the semicircle around Masséna's positions at Zürich.

For the French, despite their success earlier at Frauenfeld, the action was considerably less successful. In the clash, Ney was sufficiently wounded that he took immediate leave, and remained out of action and command until 22 July. The conduct of the battle also demonstrated the weakness of the French command system in which personal animosity and competition between high-ranking officers, in this case, Soult and Tharreau, undermined French military objectives. Tharreau eventually charged Soult with insubordination; Soult had outright refused to go to Ney's assistance, despite specific, and direct, orders to move his division to Ney's flanks.

Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian tenacity and military skill. The "white coats", as the French called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French continued to hold this prejudice. This did not change until 1809 when the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aspern-Essling">Battle of Aspern-Essling</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Battle of Wagram</a> a few weeks later caused Napoleon to revise his opinion of the Austrian military.

Finally, the battle at Winterthur made possible the victory at Zürich. Once the Austrian armies united west, north and east of Zürich, Charles decided he had a sufficiently superior force to attack Masséna's positions in Zürich. His strategy, to develop a converging attack, was not entirely possible without another Austria corps, which was commanded by Suvorov, and positioned in the mountains in Italy; this would have made possible the near encirclement of Masséna's command at Zürich, making the French position untenable. Even so, at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Z%C3%BCrich">First Battle of Zürich</a> (4–7 June 1799), the Austrian army forced the French to abandon Zürich; Masséna withdrew across the <a href="Limmat">Limmat</a>, where he set up a defensive position on the low-lying hills overlooking the city and awaited his opportunity to reacquire the city.

Batman: Arkham City

Batman: Arkham City is a 2011 <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Rocksteady%20Studios">Rocksteady Studios</a> and published by <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Interactive%20Entertainment">Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment</a>. Based on the <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> superhero <a href="Batman">Batman</a>, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game "" and the second installment in the "" series. Written by veteran "Batman" writer <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a> with Paul Crocker and <a href="Sefton%20Hill">Sefton Hill</a>, "Arkham City" is inspired by the long-running comic book <a href="mythos">mythos</a>. In the game's main storyline, Batman is incarcerated in Arkham City, a huge new super-prison enclosing the decaying urban slums of fictional <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>. He must uncover the secret behind the sinister scheme, "Protocol 10", orchestrated by the facility's warden, <a href="Hugo%20Strange">Hugo Strange</a>. The game's leading characters are predominantly voiced by actors from the <a href="DC%20animated%20universe">DC Animated Universe</a>, with <a href="Kevin%20Conroy">Kevin Conroy</a> and <a href="Mark%20Hamill">Mark Hamill</a> reprising their roles as Batman and the <a href="Joker%20%28comics%29">Joker</a>, respectively.

The game is presented from the <a href="Virtual%20camera%23third-person%20view">third-person perspective</a> with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in both combat and exploration. Batman can freely move around the Arkham City prison, interacting with characters and undertaking missions, and unlocking new areas by progressing through the main story or obtaining new equipment. The player is able to complete side missions away from the main story to unlock additional content and collectible items. "Arkham City" gives Batman the new ability to glide using his cape, enabling him to cover greater distances than were possible in "Arkham Asylum". Batman's ally <a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> is another playable character, featuring her own story campaign that runs parallel to the game's main plot.

Rocksteady conceived ideas for a sequel while developing "Arkham Asylum", commencing serious development of "Arkham City"s story in February 2009. The layout of Arkham City has a virtual footprint five times that of "Arkham Asylum", and the city design was modified to fit around Batman's ability to swoop and glide. Over a year and $10 million were spent on the game's marketing campaign, and its release was accompanied by two music albums; one containing the game's score, and the other featuring 11 original songs inspired by the game from various mainstream artists.

The game received critical acclaim, particularly for its narrative, character and world designs, soundtrack, and Batman's combat and navigation abilities. It was tied for the highest-rated video game of 2011 according to review aggregator <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, and was the recipient of several awards including: "Game of the Year", "Best Action Game", "Best Action Adventure Game", "Best Adventure Game", and "Best Original Score" from various media outlets, and it is considered one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest video games of all time</a>. "Arkham City" was released worldwide for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> video game consoles, beginning in North America on October 18, 2011, with a <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> version following on November 22. A spin-off <a href="mobile%20game">mobile game</a>, "" was released in December. The game received several re-releases: a <a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a> edition containing all of the game's <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> in May 2012; <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a> and <a href="OS%20X">OS X</a> versions in November and December 2012, respectively; and a remastered version for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> in October 2016. A successor, "", was released in October 2013, and a narrative sequel, "", was released in June 2015.

"Batman: Arkham City" is an <a href="open%20world">open-world</a> <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> that incorporates tactics from <a href="stealth%20game">stealth game</a>s. It is presented from the <a href="third-person%20perspective">third-person perspective</a>, showing the playable character on screen and allowing the camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which is open to the player from the beginning of the game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the <a href="Grappling%20hook">grapnel gun</a>'s retracting rope to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use "Detective Vision", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform <a href="Forensic%20science">forensic</a> activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.

Using an improved version of the "Freeflow" combat system from "Arkham Asylum", the player can now counter multiple blows simultaneously, catch hurled projectiles, attack aerially, and administer a succession of consecutive strikes. Many of Batman's gadgets can now be used in combat. Enemies are armed with varying levels of armor and weapons; attacks from basic weapons like baseball bats and lead pipes inflict minor damage and can be countered, while guns inflict significant damage. Certain enemies must be disarmed in specific ways before they can be neutralized in combat: enemies with <a href="Electroshock%20weapon">stun batons</a> can only be attacked from behind; enemies with shields require aerial attacks to disarm; and enemies wearing body armor must be stunned with rapid successive strikes before they can be harmed. Larger enemies must be tackled with stuns and combo attacks, and can be manipulated to take out their allies. Disputes between gangs allied to rival villains often spark <a href="wikt%3Aturf%20war">turf war</a>s, which complicate the player's ability to move about Arkham City. Combat, among other actions, rewards the player with <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s that allow the player to periodically level Batman up and purchase upgrades to his <a href="Batsuit">Batsuit</a>, gadgets, and combat and stealth skills. Each category contains approximately 15 different upgrades. For instance, an upgraded grapnel gun can be used to remotely disarm enemies, while a combat upgrade makes it easier to activate special attacks.
Some gadgets obtained in "" are present at the start of "Arkham City", while others become available during play. Most of these have improved or new capabilities; for example, the <a href="Cryptography">Cryptographic</a> Sequencer, used for hacking security consoles, can also monitor shortwave radio channels, and the <a href="Zip-line">line launcher</a> can now be deployed as a tightrope or alter direction during flight. Other items returning from the first game include these: a remote-controlled <a href="batarang">batarang</a>; Explosive Gel that can now be detonated to knock down enemies in combat; and the grapnel gun, which can now be used while gliding to facilitate transportation. New items in Batman's arsenal include: <a href="smoke%20bomb">smoke bomb</a>s that disorient opponents and assist with stealth tactics; a Remote Electric Charge (REC) gun that can stun enemies and temporarily power motors; Freeze Blast grenades that encase targets in ice and can be thrown into water to create makeshift platforms; and the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines.

The game has approximately 40 hours of gameplay, with the main campaign lasting 25 hours and side missions lasting 15 hours. The side missions, which can be attempted at any time, feature prominent characters from the Batman universe. One such character, the <a href="Riddler">Riddler</a>, provides 440 optional "Riddler challenges" to solve. Most of these challenges consist of collecting trophies hidden in the city through the use of gadgets to disable traps and barriers. The player can mark Riddler trophies on the in-game map once found if they do not initially have the necessary equipment to complete the puzzle. The player can also reveal the locations of Riddler trophies on the map by identifying the Riddler's henchmen with "Detective Vision" and interrogating them, which requires the player to save the henchmen for last when engaging in combat with a wave of enemies. There are also environmental challenges which require the player to solve riddles by locating a specific item or location (which are rewarded with stories relating to the answer), and to locate question marks painted around the city, some of which can only be viewed in whole from certain vantage points. After completing a select number of challenges, Batman must rescue a civilian hostage held in one of the Riddler's death traps.

After completing the story mode on "normal" or "hard" difficulties, a "<a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game Plus</a>" mode is unlocked, enabling the player to replay the game with all of the gadgets, experience, and abilities that they have attained; enemies are tougher and the on-screen icon that warns players of imminent attacks is disabled. "Arkham City" features a series of challenge maps separate from the game's story mode. The maps focus on the completion of specific goals, such as eliminating successive waves of enemies in combat, subduing patrolling enemies while employing stealth, or traveling to a specific location as efficiently as possible. The methods and variety of abilities used to achieve these goals earn an overall performance score that is ranked online against other players.

<a href="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> is another playable character available via the "Catwoman" campaign, which was initially <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC) on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles but was later included with the PC version and "Game of the Year" editions. Catwoman's campaign features her own heist-focused storyline that intersects with the main story at specific points in the game. Her combat emphasizes agility and allows for the use of unique weapons such as clawed <a href="Gauntlet%20%28glove%29">gauntlets</a>, <a href="bolas">bolas</a>, and her iconic whip. A portion of the Riddler challenges are specific to Catwoman and can only be completed by her. Batman's allies <a href="Tim%20Drake">Robin</a> and <a href="Dick%20Grayson">Nightwing</a> are also playable via optional DLC and feature their own combat abilities and gadgets. Both characters are available in the challenge maps; Robin has his own main story narrative.

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of "Arkham City" include a <a href="stereoscopic%203D">stereoscopic 3D</a> (S3D) mode for 3D HDTVs and for 2D HDTVs via <a href="Anaglyph%203D%23Inficolor%203D">Inficolor 3D</a> glasses, while the PC version supports Nvidia 3D Vision on compatible monitors. It uses <a href="Darkworks%23TriOviz%20for%20Games%20Technology">TriOviz for Games Technology</a>, which is integrated with <a href="Unreal%20Engine%203">Unreal Engine 3</a>. The Wii U version uses the Wii U's <a href="Wii%20U%20GamePad">touch screen controller</a> to let the player manage Batman's equipment and upgrades, selectively detonate Explosive Gel placements, and view a map of the city. The Wii U version adds a Sonar mode which highlights points of interest nearby, and the Battle Armored Tech Mode (BAT Mode) that allows Batman to accrue energy during combat and, when activated, inflict increased damage.

The events of "Arkham City" are set one year after "Batman: Arkham Asylum". Quincy Sharp, the asylum's erstwhile director, has taken sole credit for halting the Joker's armed siege, using this distinction to become mayor of <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham City</a>. Declaring both the asylum and <a href="Blackgate%20Penitentiary">Blackgate Penitentiary</a> no longer suitable to contain the city's detainees, Sharp's administration orders both facilities closed and he purchases Gotham's most notorious slums, converting them into an immense prison enclosure known as Arkham City. This facility is subsequently placed in the care of psychiatrist Hugo Strange—who is secretly manipulating Sharp—and monitored by a rogue <a href="private%20military%20company">private military firm</a>, TYGER Security. Strange permits the inmates to do as they please, so long as they do not attempt to escape. A wary Batman maintains his own vigil over the new project, concerned that the chaotic situation there will get out of hand. Meanwhile, the Joker is suffering from a potentially fatal disease caused by his previous consumption of the Titan formula, an unstable steroid serum which turns men into maddened monsters.

At a press conference held by Bruce Wayne to declare his opposition to Arkham City, TYGER mercenaries arrest and imprison him in Arkham City. Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence "Protocol 10", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10.

There, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a> on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. Tracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze.

Freeze tells Batman that he has created a cure, but it is rendered useless via instability. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure and tracks one of his assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. When Batman returns to the Joker, he finds his health has been restored.

While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker.

Batman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates "Protocol 11", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. After Ra's commits suicide to avoid capture, Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. When Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure from Batman but is impaled and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, before she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease.

The healthy Joker that Talia impaled then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. Batman defeats Clayface despite Joker blowing up the theater floor. Batman drinks a portion of the antidote, and destroys Ra's' rejuvenating <a href="Lazarus%20Pit">Lazarus Pit</a> before the Joker can use it. As Batman debates curing his foe, Joker attacks him, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.

Rocksteady conceived the idea of a sequel before development of "Arkham Asylum" had concluded, developing ideas for both the story and setting so the games' narratives could be effectively connected; a secret room was hidden in the asylum warden's office in "Arkham Asylum" containing hints of how the sequel would progress, including blueprints for the Arkham City prison; the blueprints are quite similar to its final layout in "Arkham City". The original idea was to take the game out of the asylum setting and onto the streets of Gotham City while retaining the level of design detail put into the asylum. To that end they wanted to include locations from the Batman mythos that were notable and meaningful to the character, instead of a series of generic streets; Rocksteady was initially unsure how technical considerations would limit the scope of this idea.

Serious development of the game's story and concept started in February 2009, as teams were moved from "Arkham Asylum" to "Arkham City"s development as they completed the work on that game. By the time they had programmed Batman to dive and glide between buildings of the asylum, the adaption of the gameplay to the city was considered natural. Rocksteady decided to not include the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, because it would be unable to travel on the city's broken terrain. Batman's gliding provided a sufficient means of transportation, and it was considered that putting Batman in any vehicle would make it a completely different game. <a href="Sefton%20Hill">Sefton Hill</a>, "Arkham City"s director from Rocksteady Studios, stated that a key goal for the game was to deliver the "'Batman in Gotham' feeling." The sequel was described by Conroy as "really, really dark". While relating the game's dark nature to the animated movie "", Conroy also said, "It involves a lot of the villains and it goes to that area – it's that dark."

As part of the "Batman in Gotham" design philosophy, Batman's arsenal of moves and actions were expanded. Although the team developed several ideas for new moves, gadgets and abilities, they only went forward with those that they felt would be authentic to Batman. They also chose to have Batman start the game with access to the gadgets unlocked in "Arkham Asylum", to convey the impression that Batman is fully prepared for the inevitability of things going wrong in Arkham City. The studio reviewed the play and combat systems used in "Arkham Asylum", and built the new moves as natural extensions of the existing system as a means to "add even more depth and gameplay instead of changing them fundamentally". The number of animations were doubled to reflect the larger arsenal of moves at the player's disposal. The X-ray-like "Detective Vision" mode used to highlight certain objects in-game was redeveloped for "Arkham City" because it was considered to be too useful in "Arkham Asylum", resulting in some players using it throughout almost the entire game; the visual effect also obscured the game's design aesthetic. One idea was to introduce a time limit on its use, but it was considered that Batman "wouldn't make a gadget like that". Instead, the mode was designed to be difficult to use in certain situations such as obscuring navigational information, and combat where enemy strikes will blur the screen when "Detective Vision" is active. Rocksteady art director David Hego described the new "Detective Vision" as an "augmented reality mode".

Another way the developers wished to enhance the player's Batman experience was through the larger game world. "Arkham City" has a virtual footprint five times larger than that of "Arkham Asylum", and the navigational aspects were improved to offer the player "the freedom and exhilaration of gliding down alleyways and soaring above the skyline". Though the concepts were compared to an open world game, Hill notes that such freeform nature would not be appropriate for a Batman game because it would inhibit the atmosphere they wanted to create, and that "Arkham City" was designed to challenge the player to think like Batman to survive. To counterbalance the larger game world, the developers also sought to include more challenges and side missions while keeping the player alert as to the primary mission, such that the players constantly are aware of "extreme pressure of the challenges that they face". The Riddler Trophies were designed towards the end of the game's development and were incorporated into every area of the map without overpopulating it, resulting in 440 trophies. Rocksteady aimed to make the player think creatively when collecting trophies by requiring the use of gadgets to solve puzzles, rather than placing the trophies in obscure areas of the map as mere collection items.

With the open game world, Rocksteady included more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange was selected as a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman "vulnerable and exposed in a way that he has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a shaved head and contemporary costume design that were intended to move away from his traditional "Boy Wonder" image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The shaved head is inspired by cage fighters, because we thought that Robin might be doing that in his spare time to keep him on his toes. Still, we kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.

Rocksteady intended for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history were selected to show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character as long as it was not done for shock value, and as long as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.

The developers had considered adding a multiplayer element to the game, but ultimately decided against it. According to Hill, "If we use all of the energy that is required to create multiplayer and instead focus this on the single player, would that deliver a better overall game?", and decided in the affirmative.

Variety was added to the city itself, as certain areas were designed around the villains that control that particular territory. Dax Ginn, marketing game manager at Rocksteady Games, said, "If you move into Joker's territory, you get a very Joker-ized experience, and all the artwork on the buildings – whether that's graffiti, signage, or whatever it might be – gives you a dense kind of Joker experience. So our art team has really put a lot of effort in making that sort of transition between one turf zone to another – really helping the player feel like they're making a physical transition into another emotional space." The architecture was imbued with 19th century <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> design, such as Strange's Wonder Tower which was inspired by the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, while character designs employed a modern <a href="Hyperrealism%20%28visual%20arts%29">Hyperrealism</a> style. To keep the environments interesting, base color schemes such as Mr Freeze's ice-themed area, Joker's fire-themed steel mill, and Poison Ivy's jungle-themed area were populated with contrasting elements: for example, the steel mill uses large, white clown faces to contrast the oranges and reds used throughout. To develop the expanded environment of "Arkham City" and build a "natural urban environment" for Batman, Rocksteady expanded its workforce from 75 to over 100 people.

The game's release was accompanied by two albums of music released by <a href="WaterTower%20Music">WaterTower Music</a>. "Batman: Arkham City – Original Video Game Score" was released on October 18, 2011, and features 19 tracks written for the game by "Arkham Asylum" composers Nick Arundel and <a href="Ron%20Fish">Ron Fish</a>. "Batman: Arkham City – The Album" was released on October 4, 2011, via CD and <a href="digital%20distribution">digital download</a>. The album contains 11 original songs inspired by the game from mainstream artists including <a href="Daughtry%20%28band%29">Daughtry</a>, <a href="Panic%21%20at%20the%20Disco">Panic! at the Disco</a>, and <a href="Coheed%20and%20Cambria">Coheed and Cambria</a>. An extra song was made available via the Collector's edition of the album, and the Deluxe edition included a portion of Arundel's original score.

"Arkham City"s marketing campaign was designed to reach an audience outside of superhero fans and appeal to consumers who are attracted to games like the <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> series "<a href="Call%20of%20Duty">Call of Duty</a>". Warner Bros.'s marketing team decided that Batman's status as a cultural icon and superhero was unavoidable, so they decided to emphasize other elements of the character that could appeal to fans of first-person shooters and <a href="action%20game">action game</a>s. Black-and-white photographs of iconic personalities like inventor <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> and actor <a href="James%20Dean">James Dean</a> served as inspiration and a basis for the final marketing campaign used in advertisements and the game's cover art. The imagery, highlighted with blood and bathed in light was considered to move away from the classic superhero image and refocus on Batman's humanity. The black and white campaign was featured on 120 magazine covers and was targeted towards approximately 15 million consumers across a variety of social media and Warner Bros. products, in addition to a series of <a href="viral%20marketing">viral marketing</a> videos and stunts involving actors in costume attending press-related events. By April 2012, three gameplay trailers had gained approximately 6 million views. The viral segment of the campaign involved several audio recordings between characters from the game including Hugo Strange, Quincy Sharp, Riddler, and the Penguin; each recording could be found by solving a puzzle. The entire campaign spent more than a year in development, producing artwork, videos, DLC, printed advertisements, billboards, and events, and was estimated to have cost at least $10 million.

A six-issue, <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited</a> monthly comic series, also titled "" was released on May 11, 2011. The series bridges the plot between "Arkham Asylum" and "Arkham City". It was written by <a href="Paul%20Dini">Paul Dini</a> with art by Carlos D'Anda.

Confusion concerning the use of GFWL was raised when a distributor was told by Warner Bros. that the title did not use the Live system, but the use of GFWL was confirmed in late August.

On October 25, 2011, a Batman themed Xbox 360 console bundle was released, containing the game, a DVD of "Batman: Gotham Knight", a DVD of the "Green Lantern" film, the "Green Lantern" video game tie-in "", and a 250GB Xbox 360 console.

A Game of the Year edition was announced on April 23, 2012, containing the game and all of the released downloadable content (DLC). A free download of the animated movie "" was also included with versions released in the United States and Canada.

New purchases of the game for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 are provided with a unique code that unlocks the "Catwoman" DLC, enabling a series of missions for Catwoman, with unique weapons and moves. Although the missions were presented as part of the main game, on October 13, 2011, Warner Bros. announced that it would be restricted to new purchases. Users can also purchase the content separately. It was later announced that pre-owned copies purchased from GameStop would contain the necessary unlock code. A Warner Bros. rep confirmed that playing as Catwoman would not be required to complete the game. The Catwoman DLC also contains two alternate skins for the character: her appearances from "The Animated Series" and "".

"Harley Quinn's Revenge", a story-based campaign expansion, was released on May 29, 2012, for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, with a PC version coming out a week later. The campaign features a new story, new areas, new enemies, and both Batman and Robin as playable characters. The story takes place two weeks after the events of "Arkham City". The mega prison has since been evacuated, but Quinn returns and sets up in Joker's former base. The game follows Robin's search for Batman, who has gone missing while hunting Quinn; Batman has been acting differently following the end of the main game story, concerning his allies. On the same day, it was announced that all of the released DLC, including "Harley Quinn's Revenge", would be made available as part of the "Arkham City" Game of the Year edition.

"Batman: Arkham City" received critical acclaim. Aggregating review website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave the PlayStation 3 version of the game 96/100, the Xbox 360 version 94/100, and the PC version 91/100.

"<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Andrew Reiner awarded the game a perfect 10 score, labeling it "the best licensed video game ever made". Reiner said that the game could be the biggest and "most enjoyable timesink" of 2011, and concluded that the game surpassed every standard set by "Batman: Arkham Asylum" "in every way and stands tall as one of Batman's greatest moments." <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>'s Griffin McElroy praised the attention to detail, and mechanical excellence of the game environment, crediting Rocksteady for "breathing life into a staggeringly beautiful world; one which hums not only with opportunity, but ambition". McElroy criticized the game narrative as a series of excuses to encounter villains that were "one-dimensional punching [bags]", and that the character dialogue was clichéd. McElroy was also critical of the Riddler challenges, stating that they were "frustrating" when the player lacks the necessary items to complete them.

<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Christian Donlan considered that the game lacked the same "surprise" as its predecessor, but praised the overall improvement of bosses, animations and the scope of activities available. Donlan said that the game environment was intricate and very detailed, and the abilities provided for its traversal made it "hard not to feel like the world's greatest detective, on patrol". <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s <a href="Greg%20Miller%20%28Internet%20celebrity%29">Greg Miller</a> said "the voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight—these are the things that standout". Miller said that the Catwoman missions were a fun change of pace from the main gameplay, and that he "adored" the option to replay the game with unlocked abilities and more difficult enemies.

"<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>"s Tom Hoggins praised the game's sense of progress in discovering and mastering the character abilities, and the "show-stopping brutality" of the improved combat system. Hoggins highlighted the Catwoman campaign as a "delight" and fitting lithe contrast to Batman's strength, but lamented the campaign's short length. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Nick Cowen labeled it the best Batman game of all time, praising the variety of side missions and content, the large cast of iconic characters, and the satisfying challenge of the Riddler missions. The Australian "Official PlayStation Magazine" awarded a perfect score of 10 stating that the game "is not only the best superhero game ever made, it's one of the best games ever made ... it brings the Caped Crusader's world to life better than any comic, movie or television show before it". "Play3" (Germany) awarded a score of 92%, calling it "the best superhero game ever made". "<a href="GamesMaster%20%28magazine%29">GamesMaster</a>" awarded a score of 97%, saying it is "the gold standard by which all future videogames should be judged".

"Batman: Arkham City – Armored Edition" for Wii U received a mixed reception. Metacritic provided a score of 85/100. Eurogamer's Richard Leadbetter was critical of technical performance including issues with visual quality and inconsistent framerate. "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">EGM</a>"s Ray Carsillo said that the optional B.A.T. system made certain battles too easy. Carsillo also said it was the "clearly inferior version" of the game due to glitches and "tacked on gimmicks". Nintendo World Report's Patrick Barnett wrote that certain uses of the Wii U controller made it "the best way to experience "Arkham City"", but that some new features were a "nuisance". Barnett added that it was "on par, if not better, visually", than its counterparts. Joystiq's JC Fletcher opined that the persistent map screen and touch screen interface were appreciated, and complimented the use of <a href="augmented%20reality">augmented reality</a> to explore crime scenes. <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>'s Blake Peterson praised the real-time management of information, upgrades and equipment that he considered made Batman more vulnerable, although Barnett included this as a point of criticism.

For the "Harley Quinn's Revenge" DLC, IGN's Greg Miller scored the content 9 out of 10 and gave it an Editor's Choice designation. Miller said that it "is what downloadable content should be", but criticized the lack of variety in the missions and the lack of conclusion to some plot threads. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan gave the DLC a score of 7 out of 10, and said that Harley Quinn worked as well as the Joker as a narrative focus. Donlan said that Robin was "enormous fun to play", but criticized the DLC for not offering anything not present in the main game. <a href="Kotaku">Kotaku</a>'s Stephen Totilo was critical of the DLC, saying that it diminished his desire to replay the main game and describing it as "delicious a dessert as a poison-filled Joker pie to the face". Totilo said it presented an emotionless, inconclusive journey, composed of unused material from the main game.

"Arkham City" is one of the fastest selling games in history. Worldwide, two million units were sold in its first week from approximately 4.6 million shipped units, compared to "Arkham Asylum"s 4.3 million units sold in its entire release.

During launch week, issues were found to exist in the code-restricted content. Some customers discovered the code to be missing from their copy, preventing them from obtaining the Catwoman story missions. The problem was reported by customers in Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Warner Bros. issued a statement claiming that the missing codes had affected less than 0.5% of customers. Upon release in the United Kingdom, a technical issue rendered the game unplayable for some players, booting them from the game with an error message that the "downloadable content is corrupt." Rocksteady European community manager Sarah Wellock claimed that the fault lay with the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live online systems.

In early November 2011, Rocksteady confirmed that it was investigating reports by numerous users that save files for the Xbox 360 version of the game were being erased without prompting, resulting in players losing their progress and being unable to complete the game. On launch, performance issues arose for the PC version when <a href="DirectX">DirectX</a> 11 features were enabled; the developer acknowledged the inconvenience and recommended running the game with DirectX 9 until a title update was released to address this matter.

"Batman: Arkham Origins", the successor to "Arkham City", was announced in April 2013.

Oryzomys peninsulae

Oryzomys peninsulae, also known as the Lower California rice rat, is a species of <a href="rodent">rodent</a> from western <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Mexico">Mexico</a>. Restricted to the southern tip of the <a href="Baja%20California%20peninsula">Baja California peninsula</a>, it is a member of the genus "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>" of family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>. Only about twenty individuals, collected around 1900, are known, and subsequent destruction of its riverine habitat may have driven the species to <a href="extinction">extinction</a>.

Medium in size for its genus, it was first described as a separate species, but later lumped into other, widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009. It is distinctive in fur color—grayish brown on the forequarters and reddish brown on the hindquarters—and in some dimensions of its skull, with a high <a href="braincase">braincase</a>, robust <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones), and long <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a> (perforations of the <a href="palate">palate</a> between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>).

"Oryzomys peninsulae" was first collected in 1896 and <a href="Oldfield%20Thomas">Oldfield Thomas</a> described it in 1897 as a full species of "<a href="Oryzomys">Oryzomys</a>". It was retained as a distinct species related to "<a href="Oryzomys%20couesi">O. couesi</a>" and "<a href="Oryzomys%20palustris">O. palustris</a>" until 1971, when <a href="Philip%20Hershkovitz">Philip Hershkovitz</a> swept it, and other outlying populations of the same species group, as subspecies under an expanded concept of "O. palustris". <a href="Raymond%20Hall">Raymond Hall</a> concurred in the second edition (1981) of "Mammals of North America", arguing that "O. peninsulae" differed less from mainland "Oryzomys" populations (currently <a href="scientific%20classification">classified</a> as "O. couesi mexicanus") than some other forms he included in "O. palustris" differed from each other. After studies of the contact zone between North American "O. palustris" and Central American "O. couesi" in southern <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20Texas">Texas</a> and northeastern <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a> (by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994) made clear that the two are distinct from each other, "O. peninsulae" remained as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "O. couesi". In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican "Oryzomys" and used <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> and <a href="morphometrical">morphometrical</a> data to characterize four distinct "Oryzomys" species in the region. "O. peninsulae" and another isolated population, "<a href="Oryzomys%20nelsoni">O. nelsoni</a>" from the <a href="Islas%20Mar%C3%ADas">Islas Marías</a>, were both retained as separate species, as was "<a href="Oryzomys%20albiventer">O. albiventer</a>" from <a href="montane">montane</a> mainland Mexico. They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies, "O. couesi mexicanus", of "Oryzomys couesi".

The genus "Oryzomys" currently includes about eight species distributed from the eastern <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States</a> ("O. palustris") into northwestern <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20South%20America">South America</a> ("<a href="Oryzomys%20gorgasi">O. gorgasi</a>"). "O. peninsulae" is part of the "O. couesi" section, which is centered on the widespread Central American "O. couesi" and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the <a href="systematics">systematics</a> of this section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the group's true diversity. "Oryzomys" was previously a much larger genus, but most species were progressively removed in various studies, culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that excluded more than forty species from the genus. "Oryzomys" and many of the species removed from it are classified in the tribe <a href="Oryzomyini">Oryzomyini</a> ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> of family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.

"Oryzomys peninsulae" is a medium-sized member of the genus, smaller than "O. albiventer" but larger than "O. couesi mexicanus". Its fur is grayish-brown on the forequarters, but reddish-brown on the hindquarters; this coloration pattern is unique among western Mexican "Oryzomys". The underparts are a dirty white, the feet white above, and the tail dark or brownish above and dirty white below.

In the <a href="skull">skull</a>, the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is high, the <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones) are broad and squared, and the <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a>, which perforate the <a href="palate">palate</a> between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, are long and broad. The upper incisors are <a href="orthodont">orthodont</a>, with their cutting edge nearly vertical. Morphometrically, the skull of "O. peninsulae" is sharply distinct from other western Mexican "Oryzomys".

In fourteen specimens measured by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, total length was , averaging ; head and body length was , averaging ; tail length was , averaging ; hindfoot length was , averaging ; and occipitonasal length (a measure of total skull length) was , averaging .

Twenty-one specimens of "O. peninsulae" are known: six were caught at <a href="Santa%20Anita%2C%20Baja%20California%20Sur">Santa Anita</a> in 1896 by D. Coolidge, and <a href="Edward%20William%20Nelson">Edward William Nelson</a> and <a href="Edward%20Alphonso%20Goldman">Edward Alphonso Goldman</a> obtained fifteen additional individuals in 1906 at <a href="San%20Jos%C3%A9%20del%20Cabo">San José del Cabo</a>. The two localities, which are about apart, were both located along the Río San José, a river in southernmost <a href="Baja%20California%20Sur">Baja California Sur</a>, near the southern tip of the <a href="Baja%20California%20peninsula">Baja California peninsula</a>. Like other "Oryzomys" species, "O. peninsulae" is <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a>, spending much of its time in the water, but suitable habitat for such a species is estimated to be no more than on the arid Baja California peninsula.

Río San José no longer exists, having fallen prey to irrigation projects, and touristic development of its estuary has resulted in pollution. Biologists working in the area in 1979 and from 1991 to 1993 failed to find "O. peninsulae", casting doubt on its continued existence. The lack of records for over a century, small distribution, and destruction of the only known habitat led Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales to consider the <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> of "O. peninsulae" as "critically endangered, if not extinct". They noted that the status of the species had previously been obscured because it had been <a href="Lumpers%20and%20splitters">lumped</a> for decades with "O. couesi", a widely distributed and secure species.

It is uncertain how "Oryzomys peninsulae" arrived at its recent locale in Baja California Sur. In 1922, Nelson suggested that it may have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> from another part of Mexico in a shipment of farm products, but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from other western Mexican "Oryzomys" that the species exhibits.

The species's range may be <a href="Relict%20%28biology%29">relictual</a> in nature: while "Oryzomys" is currently found along the eastern coast of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> only as far north as coastal southern <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>, the past distribution of the genus may have extended further northward, perhaps even into the southwestern <a href="List%20of%20mammals%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States</a>, and from there south into Baja California. Subsequent disappearance of "Oryzomys" from the northern regions would have led to its observed <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct distribution</a>, with "O. peninsulae" isolated on the peninsula. This possibility is supported by the relatively close resemblance between "O. peninsulae" and "O. couesi mexicanus", from coastal western Mexico.

Vision in White

Vision In White is the first book of the Bride Quartet series of <a href="romance%20novels">romance novels</a>, written by <a href="Nora%20Roberts">Nora Roberts</a>. It spent two weeks atop the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in <a href="Paperback%23Trade%20paperback">trade paperback</a> format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by <a href="Oberon%20Media">I-Play</a> in 2010.

In her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. "Vision in White" was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.

The novel marked Roberts' return to <a href="contemporary%20romance">contemporary romance</a>. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie "Mac" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, "Vision In White" explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.

<a href="Nora%20Roberts">Nora Roberts</a> is a prolific author of <a href="romance%20novel">romance</a> and futuristic suspense novels. From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published. On average, she completed a book every 45 days. She does not outline the novels in advance or create character biographies, preferring to develop the plot as she goes.

According to "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>", three of the top-ten bestselling <a href="mass%20market%20paperbacks">mass market paperbacks</a> of 2008 were Roberts novels. Her new releases focused primarily on <a href="paranormal%20romance">paranormal</a> and fantasy romance. In 2009, Roberts returned to the traditional <a href="contemporary%20romance">contemporary romance</a> subgenre with "Vision in White". The novel was the first in her Bride Quartet, which also included "<a href="Bed%20of%20Roses%20%28novel%29">Bed of Roses</a>", "<a href="Savor%20the%20Moment">Savor the Moment</a>", and "<a href="Happy%20Ever%20After%20%28book%29">Happy Ever After</a>". Each novel in the series focuses on the love story of a different founder of Vows, a fictional wedding planning business.

"Vision in White" was released by <a href="Berkley%20Books">Berkley Books</a> on April 28, 2009. The novel was one of ten Roberts books released that year. Five of the releases were paperback reprints of books previously issued. Three were new hardcovers, including two published under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. "Vision in White" and its sequel, "Bed of Roses", were released in <a href="Paperback%23Trade%20paperback">trade paperback</a>. To help readers differentiate the new releases from the reprints, the covers of the two trade paperbacks included a medallion with the initials NR.

The novel follows the relationship of photographer Mackensie "Mac" Elliot and English teacher Carter Maguire. Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.

After seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of <a href="emotional%20manipulation">emotional manipulation</a>.

Their relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.

The four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks. Focused on their careers, the heroines have little time for outside relationships, and they rely heavily on each other for comfort, help, and distractions. A similar theme is seen in several of Roberts' other works; her <a href="In%20Death">In Death</a> series, written as J. D. Robb, has a heroine who has created a family from female friends and colleagues.

According to critic <a href="Betsy%20Prioleau">Betsy Prioleau</a>, "Vision In White"'s hero is a typical representation of one of the eight <a href="archetype">archetype</a>s of a romance hero: the professor. Several scenes in the novel show him teaching students or in parent-teacher conferences. Like most intellectual romance heroes, Carter is a "sober good guy", and the heroine is attracted to him primarily for his mind. In an unusual twist for a romance novel, however, the hero is the character who is ready for a commitment but must help the heroine overcome her fears. After seeing her mother divorce four husbands and discard countless boyfriends, Mac prefers to avoid emotional intimacy rather than risk the relationship splintering. Carter provides reassurance that their relationship is built on a solid foundation.

Critic <a href="Mary%20Ellen%20Snodgrass">Mary Ellen Snodgrass</a> calls "Vision In White" a story of the <a href="New%20Woman">New Woman</a>, with a strong heroine who is extremely proud of her significant career accomplishments. Roberts uses the heroine's choices of how to pose or spotlight her photography clients as pointed ways of celebrating both monogamy and "unconventional views of femininity". In one scene, Mac convinces a heavily pregnant woman to pose nude, despite her feelings of awkwardness; through the resulting photos, the client comes to believe that she is actually beautiful. In another poke at traditional stereotypes, Mac photographs a bride and groom posing together on a horse, evoking the metaphor of a knight coming to rescue the princess—but the couple are equals.

Roberts contrasts Mac's competence in business matters with her difficulties in dealing with an extremely dysfunctional family, a theme Roberts had previously used in the Chesapeake Bay Series ("Rising Tides", "<a href="Sea%20Swept">Sea Swept</a>", and "Inner Harbor") and the Calhoun Series. In "Visions in White", the family difficulties are caused by the heroine's mother, who is essentially a cross between the mothers in "<a href="Carolina%20Moon%20%28novel%29">Carolina Moon</a>" and "Tribute". Roberts shows that, as a result of her family's dysfunction, Mac has chosen to distance herself from deeper emotions. The camera allows Mac to interact with other people's happiness and lives without having to fully participate; as the book progresses, she gradually develops the courage to come out of her shell and fully participate in life.

The use of the wedding industry is, per Snodgrass, "a wry reprise of Roberts' career in fictional matchmaking". The novel celebrates the joy of a traditional wedding ceremony, including the playful ceremonies arranged by children playing dress-up. Roberts' treatment of these themes "validates the dress-up game of playing bride as both fantasy and a stabilizing preface on women's devotion to mate and family". Roberts included significant detail on the wedding planning industry, which Snodgrass posits is meant to highlight and celebrate the success the female characters had at niche marketing.

Jill M. Smith in "<a href="Romantic%20Times">Romantic Times</a>" gave the novel four out of five stars, labeling it a "wonderful and cozy read". A "Publishers Weekly" review highlighted the "gentle humor and likable cast" and predicted that readers would be eager to follow the characters through the rest of the series. In "<a href="Booklist">Booklist</a>", John Charles called the novel "thoroughly charming" and lauded the deep characterization and "sharp, clever writing" that combined to celebrate "friendship and love".

In a survey of readers, Snodgrass found mixed opinions. Many were delighted to see Roberts return to traditional contemporary romances, minus the elements of fantasy and magic that had woven through her more recent novels. Some praised the tight bonds of sisterhood that Roberts created for the four founders of Vows, but other readers complained that the character voices were too similar. A vocal minority pointed out similarities between this novel and Roberts' Calhoun series.

By February 2010, "Vision In White" and "Bed of Roses" had sold a combined 1 million print copies. Over 100,000 copies of "Vision in White" were sold in Canada alone between May and October 2009. The novel spent 32 weeks on the "USA Today" bestseller list, peaking at number 3. It was number 1 on the "New York Times" Bestseller List for trade paperback fiction for two weeks. It was the first of Roberts' novels to be a bestseller in trade paperback format.

Within months of the novel's release, computer gaming company <a href="Oberon%20Media">I-Play</a> began developing a downloadable casual-play game based on the story. Roberts' input was limited to approval of the graphics and the game's interpretation of the story line. The game followed the general plot of the novel, from the perspective of the heroine. More than 40 different locations from the book were featured, including Mac's office and Carter's kitchen. There were hidden-object tasks and several mini-games featuring wedding-related activities, such as cake decorating and floral arranging. Roberts was pleased with the final product, remarking that "to have a story translated into a game like this, it's tremendous fun for me. It's my initial vision, but I enjoy seeing how, when you translate it into that other medium, how somebody else's vision manages to affect it but keep the core of the story." The game was released in February 2010. According to Roberts' website, game sales did not match the developer's expectations, and plans for sequels to the game were cancelled.

Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)

Charles Eaton, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (21 December 1895 – 12 November 1979) was a senior officer and aviator in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), and later served as a diplomat. Born in <a href="London">London</a>, he joined the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> upon the outbreak of World War I and saw action on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> before transferring to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> in 1917. Posted as a bomber pilot to <a href="No.%20206%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 206 Squadron</a>, he was twice captured by German forces, and twice escaped. Eaton left the military in 1920 and worked in India until moving to Australia in 1923. Two years later he joined the RAAF, serving initially as an <a href="Flight%20instructor">instructor</a> at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a>. Between 1929 and 1931, he was chosen to lead three expeditions to search for lost aircraft in <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>, gaining national attention and earning the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> for his "zeal and devotion to duty".

In 1939, on the eve of World War II, Eaton became the inaugural commanding officer of <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 (General Purpose) Squadron</a> at the newly established <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Station Darwin</a> in Northern Australia. He was promoted <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in 1940, and appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> the following year. In 1943, he took command of <a href="No.%2079%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 79 Wing</a> at <a href="Batchelor%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Batchelor</a>, Northern Territory, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> during operations in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>. Retiring from the RAAF in December 1945, Eaton took up diplomatic posts in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, heading a <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> commission as <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">Consul-General</a> during the <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian National Revolution</a>. He returned to Australia in 1950, and served in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> for a further two years. Popularly known as "Moth" Eaton, he was a farmer in later life, and died in 1979 aged 83. He is commemorated by several memorials in the Northern Territory.

Charles Eaton was born on 21 December 1895 in <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>, London, the son of William Walpole Eaton, a butcher, and his wife Grace. Schooled in <a href="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a>, Charles worked in <a href="Battersea">Battersea Town Council</a> from the age of fourteen, before joining the <a href="London%20Regiment">London Regiment</a> upon the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Attached to a bicycle company in the 24th Battalion of the <a href="47th%20%281/2nd%20London%29%20Division">47th Division</a>, he arrived at the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in March 1915. He took part in <a href="Trench%20warfare">trench bombing</a> missions and attacks on enemy lines of communication, seeing action in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Battles of Aubers Ridge</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Festubert">Festubert</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Loos">Loos</a>, and <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">the Somme</a>.

On 14 May 1915, Eaton transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC), undergoing initial pilot training at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. While he was landing his <a href="Farman%20MF.11">Maurice Farman Shorthorn</a> at the end of his first solo flight, another student collided with him and was killed, but Eaton was uninjured. He was commissioned in August and was awarded his <a href="Flying%20badge">wings</a> in October. Ranked <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a>, he served with <a href="No.%20110%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 110 Squadron</a>, which operated <a href="Martinsyde%20G.100">Martinsyde G.100 "Elephant"</a> fighters out of <a href="Sedgeford">Sedgeford</a>, defending London against <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> airships. He was transferred to the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in April 1918, and posted the following month to France flying <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a> single-engined bombers with <a href="No.%20206%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 206 Squadron</a>. On 29 June, he was shot down behind enemy lines and captured in the vicinity of <a href="Nieppe">Nieppe</a>. Incarcerated in <a href="Holzminden%20prisoner-of-war%20camp">Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp</a>, Germany, Eaton escaped but was recaptured and <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led, after which he was kept in solitary confinement. He later effected another escape and succeeded in rejoining his squadron in the final days of the war.

Eaton remained in the RAF after the war. He married Beatrice Godfrey in St. Thomas's church at <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush">Shepherd's Bush</a>, London, on 11 January 1919. Posted to <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>, he was a pilot on the first regular passenger service between London and Paris, ferrying delegates to and from the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Peace Conference</a> at <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>. Eaton was sent to India in December to undertake aerial survey work, including the first such survey of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>. He resigned from the RAF in July 1920, remaining in India to take up employment with the Imperial Forest Service. After successfully applying for a position with the <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> Forestry Service, he and his family migrated to Australia in 1923. Moving to <a href="South%20Yarra%2C%20Victoria">South Yarra</a>, Victoria, he enlisted as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) at <a href="Laverton%2C%20Victoria">Laverton</a> on 14 August 1925. He was posted to <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, as a flight instructor, where he became known as a strict disciplinarian and a successful trainer. Here Eaton acquired his nickname of "Moth", the Air Force's basic trainer at this time being the <a href="De%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">De Havilland DH.60 Moth</a>. Promoted <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> in February 1928, he flew a Moth in the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Centenary%20Air%20Race">1929 East-West Air Race</a> from Sydney to Perth, as part of the celebrations for the <a href="Centenary%20of%20Western%20Australia">Western Australia Centenary</a>; he was the sixth competitor across the line, after fellow RFC veteran <a href="Jerry%20Pentland">Jerry Pentland</a>.

Regarded as one of the RAAF's most skilful cross-country pilots and navigators, Eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in <a href="Central%20Australia%20%28territory%29">Central Australia</a> between 1929 and 1931. In April 1929, he coordinated the Air Force's part in the search for aviators Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, missing in their aircraft the "<a href="Kookaburra%20%28aircraft%29">Kookaburra</a>" while themselves looking for <a href="Charles%20Kingsford%20Smith">Charles Kingsford Smith</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ulm">Charles Ulm</a>, who had force landed the "<a href="Southern%20Cross%20%28aircraft%29">Southern Cross</a>" in north <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> during a flight from Sydney. Three of the RAAF's five veteran DH.9 biplanes went down in the search—though all crews escaped injury—including Eaton's, which experienced what he labelled "a good crash" on 21 April near <a href="Tennant%20Creek">Tennant Creek</a> after the engine's pistons melted. The same day, Captain <a href="Lester%20Brain">Lester Brain</a>, flying a <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> aircraft, located the wreck of the "Kookaburra" in the <a href="Tanami%20Desert">Tanami Desert</a>, approximately east-south-east of <a href="Kalkarindji%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Wave Hill</a>. Setting out from Wave Hill on 23 April, Eaton led a ground party across rough terrain that reached the crash site four days later and buried the crew, who had perished of thirst and exposure. Not a particularly religious man, he recalled that after the burial he saw a perfect cross formed by <a href="cirrus%20cloud">cirrus cloud</a> in an otherwise clear blue sky above the "Kookaburra". The <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a> described the RAAF's search as taking 240 hours flying time "under the most trying conditions ... where a forced landing meant certain crash". In November 1930, Eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near <a href="Uluru">Ayers Rock</a>, but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a>. The next month, he was ordered to search for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had disappeared in the biplane "Golden Quest 2" while attempting to discover <a href="Lasseter%27s%20Reef">Lasseter's Reef</a>. Employing four DH.60 Moths, the RAAF team located the missing men near Dashwood Creek on 7 January 1931, and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by Eaton. Staying in nearby Alice Springs, he recommended a site for the town's new airfield, which was approved and has remained in use since its construction.
Eaton was awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> on 10 March 1931 "in recognition of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to Central Australia in search of missing aviators". The media called him the "'<a href="Knight-errant">Knight Errant</a>' of the desert skies". Aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the "Kookaburra", Eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he was test flying the <a href="Wackett%20Warrigal">Wackett Warrigal I</a> with <a href="Sergeant">Sergeant</a> Eric Douglas. Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls when he tried to recover, Eaton called on Douglas to bail out. When Douglas stood up to do so, the spin stopped, apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane. Eaton then managed to land the aeroplane, he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience. In December 1931, he was posted to <a href="No.%201%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 1 Aircraft Depot</a> at Laverton, where he continued to fly as well as performing administrative work. Promoted <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in 1936, he undertook a clandestine mission around the new year to scout for suitable landing grounds in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, primarily <a href="Timor">Timor</a> and <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a>. Wearing civilian clothes, he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in <a href="Kupang">Koepang</a>, Dutch Timor. Eaton was appointed commanding officer (CO) of <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 21 Squadron</a> in May 1937, one of his first tasks being to undertake another aerial search in Central Australia, this time for prospector Sir Herbert Gepp, who was subsequently discovered alive and well. Later that year, Eaton presided over the court of inquiry into the crash of a <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a> biplane in Victoria, recommending a gallantry award for Aircraftman <a href="William%20McAloney">William McAloney</a>, who had leapt into the Demon's burning wreckage in an effort to rescue its pilot; McAloney subsequently received the <a href="Albert%20Medal%20%28lifesaving%29">Albert Medal</a> for his heroism.
Following a 1937 decision to establish the first <a href="Northern%20Australia">north Australian</a> RAAF base, in April 1938 Eaton, now on the headquarters staff of <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, and Wing Commander <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, Director of Personnel Services at RAAF Headquarters, began developing plans for the new station, to be commanded by Jones, and a new squadron that would be based there, led by Eaton. The next month they flew an <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a> on an inspection tour of <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory, site of the proposed base. Delays meant that <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 (General Purpose) Squadron</a> was not formed until 6 February 1939 at Laverton. Jones had by now moved on to another posting but Eaton took up the squadron's command as planned. Promoted to <a href="wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 March, he and his equipment officer, Flying Officer Hocking, were ordered to build up the unit as quickly as possible, and established an initial complement of fourteen officers and 120 airmen, plus four Ansons and four Demons, within a week. An advance party of thirty <a href="Non-commissioned%20officer">NCOs</a> and airmen under Hocking began moving to Darwin on 1 July. Staff were initially accommodated in a former meatworks built during World War I, and life at the newly established air base had a "distinctly raw, pioneering feel about it" according to historian Chris Coulthard-Clark. Morale, though, was high. On 31 August, No. 12 Squadron launched its first patrol over the Darwin area, flown by one of seven Ansons that had so far been delivered. These were augmented by a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> of four <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s (replacing the originally planned force of Demons) that took off from Laverton on 2 September, the day before <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">Australia declared war</a>, and arrived in Darwin four days later. A fifth Wirraway in the flight crashed on landing at Darwin, killing both crewmen.

Once war was declared, Darwin began to receive more attention from military planners. In June 1940, No. 12 Squadron was "cannibalised" to form two additional units, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin</a> and <a href="No.%2013%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 13 Squadron</a>. No. 12 Squadron retained its Wirraway flight, while its two flights of Ansons went to the new squadron; these were replaced later that month by more capable <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s. Eaton was appointed CO of the base, gaining promotion to temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> in September. His squadrons were employed in escort, maritime reconnaissance, and coastal patrol duties, the overworked aircraft having to be sent to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, after every 240 hours flying time—with a consequent three-week loss from Darwin's strength—as deep maintenance was not yet possible in the Northern Territory. Soon after the establishment of Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin, Minister for Air <a href="James%20Fairbairn">James Fairbairn</a> visited the base. Piloting his own light plane, he was greeted by four Wirraways that proceeded to escort him into landing; the Minister subsequently complimented Eaton on the "keen-ness and efficiency of all ranks", particularly considering the challenging environment. When Fairbairn died in the <a href="1940%20Canberra%20air%20disaster">Canberra air disaster</a> shortly afterwards, his pilot was Flight Lieutenant Robert Hitchcock, son of Bob Hitchcock of the "Kookaburra" and also a former member of Eaton's No. 21 Squadron.

As senior air commander in the region, Eaton sat on the Darwin Defence Co-ordination Committee. He was occasionally at loggerheads with his naval counterpart, <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">Captain</a> E.P. Thomas, and also incurred the ire of trade unionists when he used RAAF staff to unload ships in <a href="Port%20Darwin">Port Darwin</a> during industrial action; Eaton himself took part in the work, shovelling coal alongside his men. On 25 February 1941, he made a flight north to reconnoitre Timor, Ambon, and Babo in <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Dutch New Guinea</a> for potential use by the RAAF in any Pacific conflict. By April, the total strength based at RAAF Station Darwin had increased to almost 700 officers and airmen; by the following month it had been augmented by satellite airfields at <a href="Bathurst%20Island%20%28Northern%20Territory%29">Bathurst Island</a>, <a href="Groote%20Eylandt">Groote Eylandt</a>, <a href="Batchelor%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Batchelor</a>, and <a href="Katherine%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Katherine</a>. Handing over command of Darwin to Group Captain <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a> in October, Eaton took charge of <a href="No.%202%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Service Flying Training School</a> near <a href="Wagga%20Wagga">Wagga Wagga</a>, New South Wales. His "marked success", "untiring energy", and "tact in handling men" while in the Northern Territory were recognised in the new year with his appointment as an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a>. Eaton became CO of No. 1 Engineering School and its base, <a href="Ascot%20Vale%2C%20Victoria">RAAF Station Ascot Vale</a>, Victoria, in April 1942. Twelve months later in <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, he formed <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a>, which subsequently deployed to <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> in Dutch New Guinea, comprising <a href="No.%2084%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.  84 Squadron</a> (flying <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a> fighters), <a href="No.%2086%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.  86 Squadron</a> (<a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters), and <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron</a> (<a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">A-31 Vengeance</a> dive bombers). His relations with <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area Command</a> in Townsville were strained; "mountains were made out of molehills" in his opinion, and he was reassigned that July to lead No. 2 Bombing and Gunnery School in <a href="Port%20Pirie">Port Pirie</a>, South Australia.
On 30 November 1943, Eaton returned to the Northern Territory to establish <a href="No.%2079%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 79 Wing</a> at Batchelor, comprising <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1</a> and <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadrons</a> (flying <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> light reconnaissance bombers), <a href="No.%2031%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 31 Squadron</a> (<a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> long-range fighters), and <a href="No.%2018%20%28Netherlands%20East%20Indies%29%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies)
Squadron</a> (<a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers). He developed a good relationship with his Dutch personnel, who called him "Oom Charles" (Uncle Charles). Operating under the auspices of <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area Command</a> (NWA), Darwin, Eaton's forces participated in the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a> and <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Campaign">North-Western Area Campaign</a>s during 1944, in which he regularly flew on missions himself. Through March–April, his Beaufighters attacked enemy shipping, while the Mitchells and Beauforts bombed Timor on a daily basis as a prelude to <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">Operations Reckless and Persecution</a>, the invasions of <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a> and <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a>. On 19 April, he organised a large raid against <a href="South%20Central%20Timor%20Regency">Su</a>, Dutch Timor, employing thirty-five Mitchells, Beauforts and Beaufighters to destroy the town's barracks and fuel dumps, the results earning him the personal congratulations of the <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> NWA, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">"King" Cole</a>, for his "splendid effort". On the day of the Allied landings, 22 April, the Mitchells and Beaufighters made a daylight raid on <a href="Dili">Dili</a>, Portuguese Timor. The ground assault met little opposition, credited in part to the air bombardment in the days leading up to it. In June–July, No. 79 Wing supported the <a href="Battle%20of%20Noemfoor">Allied attack on Noemfoor</a>. Eaton was recommended to be <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 28 October 1944 for his "Gallant and distinguished service" in NWA; this was promulgated in the "London Gazette" on 9 March 1945.

Completing his tour with No. 79 Wing, Eaton was appointed Air Officer Commanding <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area</a>, Melbourne, in January 1945. The operated off southern Australia during the first months of 1945, and the few combat units in Eaton's command were heavily engaged in <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine patrols</a> which sought to locate this and any other <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s in the area. The Air Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, considered the sporadic attacks to be partly "nuisance value", designed to draw Allied resources away from the front line of the South West Pacific war. In April, Eaton complained to Bostock that intelligence from <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> concerning its ships' movements eastwards out of <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a> was hours out of date by the time it was received at Southern Area Command, leading to RAAF aircraft missing their rendezvous and wasting valuable flying hours searching empty ocean. There had been no U-boat strikes since February, and by June the naval authorities indicated that there was no pressing need for air cover except for the most important vessels.

Eaton retired from the RAAF on 31 December 1945. In recognition of his war service, he was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20Orange-Nassau">Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau with Swords</a> by the Dutch government on 17 January 1946. The same month, he became Australian <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a> in Dili. He had seen an advertisement for the position and was the only applicant with experience of the area. While based there, he accompanied the provincial governor on visits to townships damaged in Allied raids during the war, taking care to be circumspect about the part played by his own forces from No. 79 Wing. In July 1947, Dutch forces launched a "<a href="Operation%20Product">police action</a>" against territory held by the fledgling <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">Indonesian Republic</a>, which had been declared shortly after the end of the war. Following a ceasefire, the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> set up a commission, chaired by Eaton as Consul-General, to monitor progress. Eaton and his fellow commissioners believed that the ceasefire was serving the Dutch as a cover for further penetration of republican enclaves. His requests to the Australian government for military observers led to deployment of the first peacekeeping force to the region; the Australians were soon followed by British and US observers, and enabled Eaton to display a more realistic impression of the situation to the outside world. The Dutch administration strongly opposed the presence of UN forces and accused Eaton of "impropriety", but the Australian government refused to recall him. Following the transfer of sovereignty in December 1949, he became Australia's first secretary and <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20of%20Indonesia">Republic of the United States of Indonesia</a>. In 1950, he returned to Australia to serve with the <a href="Department%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade%20%28Australia%29">Department of External Affairs</a> in Canberra. After retiring from public service in 1951, he and his wife farmed at <a href="Metung">Metung</a>, Victoria, and cultivated <a href="orchid">orchid</a>s. They later moved to <a href="Frankston%2C%20Victoria">Frankston</a>, where Eaton was involved in promotional work.

Charles Eaton died in Frankston on 12 November 1979. Survived by his wife and two sons, he was cremated. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the "Kookaburra", from an RAAF <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">Caribou</a> on 15 April 1981. His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, where he is commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of <a href="Karama%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Karama</a>, the suburb of <a href="Eaton%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Eaton</a> that includes <a href="Darwin%20International%20Airport">Darwin International Airport</a> and RAAF Base Darwin, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the <a href="Northern%20Territory%20Parliament">Northern Territory Parliament</a>, and a <a href="National%20Trust%20of%20Australia">National Trust</a> memorial at <a href="Tennant%20Creek%20Airport">Tennant Creek Airport</a>. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, <a href="Air%20Commodore">Air Commodore</a> Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented:

Fresh Blood (Supernatural)

"Fresh Blood" is the seventh episode of the <a href="paranormal">paranormal</a> <a href="drama">drama</a> "<a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Supernatural</a>"s <a href="Supernatural%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> on <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a>, and is the show's fifty-first episode overall. The episode was written by <a href="Sera%20Gamble">Sera Gamble</a> and directed by <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a>; it was first broadcast on November 15, 2007. The narrative follows the series' protagonists <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam</a> (<a href="Jared%20Padalecki">Jared Padalecki</a>) and <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean Winchester</a> (<a href="Jensen%20Ackles">Jensen Ackles</a>) as they have their final confrontation with hunter <a href="Gordon%20Walker%20%28Supernatural%29">Gordon Walker</a> (<a href="Sterling%20K.%20Brown">Sterling K. Brown</a>), who has been turned into a vampire.

It also features the demise of recurring antagonist Gordon Walker. Brown, who was forced to leave the show due to commitments to the <a href="Lifetime%20Television">Lifetime Television</a> series "<a href="Army%20Wives">Army Wives</a>", was horrified at Gordon's actions in the episode. <a href="Mercedes%20McNab">Mercedes McNab</a> of "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" and "<a href="Angel%20%281999%20TV%20series%29">Angel</a>" fame made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>, and was also busy filming the television series "<a href="Reaper%20%28TV%20series%29">Reaper</a>" during the episode's production.

The episode received ratings near the season average, and garnered generally positive reviews from critics. Brown's performance was praised, as well as the twist in his character's storyline. Also applauded were both Sam's confrontation with Dean over his recent reckless behavior and the resulting reconciliation at the episode's end. Many critics found the presence of character <a href="Bela%20Talbot">Bela Talbot</a> (<a href="Lauren%20Cohan">Lauren Cohan</a>) in the episode to be pointless, while the critic for "TV Guide" enjoyed McNab's cameo and wished it had been longer.

<a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Hunters">Hunter</a> <a href="Gordon%20Walker%20%28Supernatural%29">Gordon Walker</a> (Brown), who believes that <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam Winchester</a> (Padalecki) will one day turn evil and become involved in a demonic war against humanity, escapes from prison. He tracks down <a href="Bela%20Talbot">Bela Talbot</a> (Cohan)—a thief and frequent thorn in the Winchesters' sides—and threatens to kill her unless she reveals the location of the brothers. She refuses at first, but eventually acquiesces in exchange for a priceless <a href="Mojo%20%28African%20American%20culture%29">mojo bag</a>. Meanwhile, Sam and <a href="Dean%20Winchester">Dean</a> (Ackles) capture the vampire Lucy (McNab), who has previously taken two victims. They interrogate her, and discover that another vampire named Dixon spiked her drink with his own blood at a club, transforming her. Dixon had taken her back to his home, but she escaped to feed. Lucy, still believing that she has only been drugged, is then killed by Dean, as there is no known cure for vampirism.

The brothers locate and confront Dixon, but are interrupted by Gordon and fellow hunter Kubrick. Sam and Dean escape, but in the mayhem, Dixon kidnaps Gordon. The vampire later explains to Gordon that hunters killed his nest, and now he wants to rebuild his family. Though Dixon had planned on using Gordon as food, the hunter's continuous taunting prompts him to feed him his blood. When the brothers—having been informed by Bela of Gordon's location, which she discovered via <a href="Ouija%20board">Ouija board</a>—arrive at Dixon's hideout, they discover that the vampiric Gordon has escaped. Elsewhere, Gordon returns to Kubrick. He requests that he be allowed to live long enough to deal with Sam. Despite this, Kubrick attempts to kill him, so Gordon retaliates by punching into his guts.

As night approaches, the brothers have not been able to find Gordon. Dean decides to go after Gordon while Sam stays hidden, but Sam refuses. He then confronts Dean about his reckless behavior since his deal with a <a href="Characters%20of%20Supernatural%23Crossroads%20Demon">Crossroads Demon</a>, which left him only a year to live. Dean claims that he is not scared of his impending death, but Sam challenges this. Dean eventually relents, agreeing to behave more like his old self again. The two then prepare to wait out the night.

Gordon later calls Sam and Dean, threatening to kill a young woman if they do not meet him. They head to the location and find the woman, but Gordon uses a <a href="roller%20shutter">roller door</a> to separate the brothers. The woman is revealed to be a vampire turned by Gordon, and Dean is forced to shoot her with <a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29%23The%20Colt">the Colt</a>—a mystical gun capable of killing anything. He then attempts to help Sam, but Gordon prepares to bite him. Sam prevents this and <a href="garrote">garrote</a>s Gordon with a razor wire, decapitating the vampire. Sam and Dean later stop on the side of the road to check a rattling noise made by the <a href="Supernatural%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29%23Impala">Impala</a>. Sam is confused when Dean starts explaining the engine's problem. Dean, however, reasons that Sam should know how to fix the car when his remaining time runs out, and also notes that, as his older brother, he should be showing him the ropes.

"Fresh Blood" featured the final guest appearance by <a href="Sterling%20K.%20Brown">Sterling K. Brown</a> as the vampire hunter <a href="Gordon%20Walker%20%28Supernatural%29">Gordon Walker</a>. The character's story arc for the season was intended to be longer, but Brown's commitments to the <a href="Lifetime%20Television">Lifetime Television</a> series "<a href="Army%20Wives">Army Wives</a>" limited his return to only two appearances. The episode was "really hard" for the actor; though he was fine with the character dying, the idea of Gordon turning an innocent girl into a vampire was "horrific" to him. Although Gordon's actions in previous episodes were questionable, Brown had always believed the character to be "ultimately good". On this change, Brown commented, "His endgame is to kill Sam, and anyone else who has to experience detrimental effects because of that is not a concern of his. That was tough for me to process and get on board with." However, series creator <a href="Eric%20Kripke">Eric Kripke</a> reasoned that the character was now a monster and should follow his instincts instead of logic. The writer of "Fresh Blood", Sera Gamble, also penned Gordon's initial episode and helped Kripke conceptualize the character. She felt that she "lucked out" in being able to write the character's final appearance, and found there to be "something so satisfying about turning him into a vampire and chopping his head off with a razor wire".

<a href="Mercedes%20McNab">Mercedes McNab</a>, well known for portraying the vampire <a href="Harmony%20Kendall">Harmony Kendall</a> on the television series "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" and "<a href="Angel%20%281999%20TV%20series%29">Angel</a>", guest starred as the recently turned vampire Lucy. Although hesitant to play another vampire, McNab came to realize that the character was less of a vampire and more of a "girl who woke up and was basically drugged or was changed and didn't know what was going on". The actress also noted that Harmony was generally used for comic relief, whereas Lucy was intended to be "serious and more dramatic". Her previous experience with director <a href="Kim%20Manners">Kim Manners</a> on the television series "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Brisco%20County%2C%20Jr.">The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.</a>" also influenced her decision. Because many of her recent characters tended to die, McNab was delighted by Lucy's offscreen death. The actress was also working on an episode of "<a href="Reaper%20%28TV%20series%29">Reaper</a>" during the filming of "Fresh Blood", and the "Supernatural" production staff was able to fit her into the shooting schedule. The actress found them to be "really helpful" in making sure that her scenes did not take too long to film. Her portion of the opening scene only took a few hours to shoot, allowing her to return to "Reaper" the next morning.

<a href="Michael%20Massee">Michael Massee</a> returned as the hunter Kubrick, who believes himself to be on a mission from God to kill <a href="Sam%20Winchester">Sam Winchester</a>. Massee discussed his character with Brown beforehand, and envisioned him as a long-time friend of Gordon who could be depended upon. Brown described Kubrick as a "well-meaning...sweet guy", and noted that his wife had a "visceral response" to the character's death when later viewing the episode. <a href="Matthew%20Humphreys">Matthew Humphreys</a> portrayed the vampire Dixon, and considers him a "deeply misunderstood" character. The actor found it "easy to rationalize what he did" because Dixon was at odds with how to start his own family as a vampire, and he maintains that the character had no evil intentions behind his actions. Humphreys hopes to one day return to the role.

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took place in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. The opening sequence was filmed outside at night, though the subsequent scene—Lucy's interrogation and execution—occurred in a motel set constructed on a sound stage. Atypical to the series, the motel room did not have a noticeable theme. Production designer John Marcynuk commented, "That motel room was essentially a killing floor for the boys...and it was kind of a cold interrogation scene, so we tried to keep it not so friendly. When you walked through it, it definitely felt like a place [where] a murder had been committed. It wouldn't have been the first time a murder had been committed in that room, either. It was the type of place where bad things happen." Marcynuk took a different approach for Gordon's death scene, utilizing green tones and a cool color palette to create a greater visual contrast with the blood.

To lend a strong air of realism to Gordon's death, the scene was created by combining various special effects during filming with post-production visual effects. Plastic razor wire with blood tubing aided in the initial phases of the decapitation; it would slightly sink into Brown's neck as pressure was applied, forcing out the fake blood. For the aftermath, Brown laid down on the floor, and the visual effects department removed his head from the shot and recreated it as a three-dimensional model. The department decided to "push it a little bit farther" by having the head rocking into place and the mouth twitching, but <a href="Standards%20and%20Practices">Standards and Practices</a> found it too graphic and forced them to remove the motion. Established in the first-season episode "Dead Man's Blood" were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the design has been subtly improved with each vampire episode. Though the <a href="Prosthetic%20makeup">special effects makeup</a> department used molds of the actors' mouths to create the fanged <a href="Poly%28methyl%20methacrylate%29">acrylic</a> dentures, McNab noted that it was very difficult to speak while wearing them. Blood-like makeup around the actors' mouths helped to round out the vampiric visages.

The synthesized orchestral score of the episode was written by <a href="Christopher%20Lennertz">Christopher Lennertz</a>. He feels that "people associate the sound of violins with vampires" due to the "connection with Eastern Europe and counts", and thus used a "very violin-heavy" score for the episode, avoiding woodwinds, brass, and piano.

In its original broadcast, "Fresh Blood" was viewed by an estimated 2.88 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Tina Charles of "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" praised the episode, commenting that "it was really nice to get an enjoyable episode high on intensity, brotherly interaction, blood and gore". Although she had grown a "tad bit weary" of the character's continuous attempts to kill Sam, she was still "really sorry to see Sterling and Gordy go". Charles felt that his transformation was a "good twist", and liked that his "black-and-white beliefs" remained the same even after becoming a vampire. She also enjoyed the character of Lucy and her "really sad" ending, and wished that McNab's role had been larger. It was noted that the "brotherly interaction was front and center", and Charles was "beyond happy" that Sam confronted Dean about is behavior. The "moment that [she had] been waiting for all season long" finally came to be when Dean took Sam seriously and actually listened to him instead of replying with sarcasm. Charles also deemed the final scene with the brothers to be "just heartbreaking". Likewise, Karla Peterson of "<a href="The%20San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">The San Diego Union-Tribune</a>" not only gave the episode an A+, but ranked it as the sixth-best episode of the 2007-2008 television season. She praised writer Sera Gamble and director Kim Manners for "creating the best bonding scene we've had all season", and lauded Padalecki and Ackles for "making us care so much and believe so fully that a scene like this can leave us gasping".

Brett Love of "<a href="TV%20Squad">TV Squad</a>" posited that Gordon's return in the "great" episode was "well worth the wait". He noted that the revelation that Lucy was just an innocent girl was a "nice twist", and deemed it a "great choice" to have Gordon turned into a vampire. Love was sad to see Gordon depart from the series, finding the "outstanding" Brown to be "so intense and committed" to the role. However, he considered Bela's appearance to be unnecessary, and pointed out the implausibility of it being easier for Gordon to track down Bela than it would have been to just track down the Winchesters. Like Love, Julie Pyle of "<a href="Airlock%20Alpha">Airlock Alpha</a>" believed Bela's appearance "[felt] forced". She was saddened by the deaths of Gordon and Kubrick, and had hoped that their storylines would have been further explored. Pyle also criticized the episode's lighting, commenting, "With the added gore this season, the show should seem darker. Instead, it's like "Supernatural" Lite." While Maureen Ryan of "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" found the concept of Gordon hunting down Sam to be "inspired", she noted that "'Fresh Blood' didn't do much for [her]".

Recalling the demon <a href="Azazel%20%28Supernatural%29">Azazel</a>'s comments about the recently resurrected Sam in the episode "<a href="All%20Hell%20Breaks%20Loose%20%28Supernatural%29">All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two</a>"—that what came back may not be "one hundred percent pure Sam"—Don Williams of <a href="BuddyTV">BuddyTV</a> questioned if something really is wrong with Sam. Williams added Gordon's death to his list of Sam's recent out-of-character actions, which already included Sam's brutal execution of Jake Talley in "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two" and his killing of the Crossroads Demon in "Bedtime Stories". However, he did point out that both characters "kind of deserved to bite the dust". Peterson, too, noted the "cold, dead look in Sam's eyes" after the killing. On the other hand, Padalecki posited that the "darker side of Sam" was depicted when he killed Gordon "with pure hatred", but reasoned that Sam was thinking, "He's a vampire! He's killing people; it's time for him to go."

Prairie Avenue

Prairie Avenue is a north–south street on the <a href="South%20side%20%28Chicago%29">South Side of Chicago</a>, which historically extended from 16th Street in the <a href="Near%20South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">Near South Side</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area of Chicago</a> in <a href="Cook%20County%2C%20Illinois">Cook County, Illinois</a>, United States, to the city's southern limits and beyond. The street has a rich history from its origins as a major trail for horseback riders and <a href="carriage">carriage</a>s. During the last three decades of the 19th century, a six-<a href="City%20block">block</a> section of the street served as the residence of many of Chicago's elite families and an additional four-block section was also known for grand homes. The upper six-block section includes part of the historic <a href="Prairie%20Avenue%20District">Prairie Avenue District</a>, which was declared a <a href="Chicago%20Landmark">Chicago Landmark</a> and added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

Several of Chicago's most important <a href="history%20of%20Chicago">historical figures</a> have lived on the street. This is especially true of the period of recovery from the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871 when many of the most important families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the <a href="political%20history%20of%20Chicago">political history</a>, the <a href="Chicago%20architecture">architecture</a>, the <a href="culture%20of%20Chicago">culture</a>, the <a href="economy%20of%20Chicago">economy</a>, as well as the <a href="law%20and%20government%20of%20Chicago">law and government of Chicago</a>. The street has over time been influenced by the <a href="demographics%20of%20Chicago">demographics of Chicago</a>.

The importance of the street declined, but it still has landmark buildings and is the backbone of a historic district. Preservation battles regarding various properties on the street have been notable with one having been chronicled on the front page of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". In the early 21st century, parts of the street were redeveloped to host townhouses and condominiums. In the late 20th century and early 21st century the street was extended north to accommodate new high-rise condominiums, such as <a href="One%20Museum%20Park">One Museum Park</a>, along <a href="Roosevelt%20Road%20%28Chicago%29">Roosevelt Road</a> (12th Street). The redevelopment extended the street so that it has prominent buildings bordering <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a> with Prairie Avenue addresses.

Prairie Avenue once served as an <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trail linking <a href="Fort%20Dearborn">Fort Dearborn</a> to <a href="Forts%20of%20Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana">Fort Wayne</a> in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and thus derived its name from the vast <a href="midwest">midwest</a>ern <a href="prairie">prairie</a> land between the two endpoints. In 1812, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Dearborn">Battle of Fort Dearborn</a> occurred in the area that is now the northern section of the street, in what is known as the <a href="Near%20South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">Near South Side</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a>. Casualties of the battle, such as <a href="William%20Wells%20%28soldier%29">William Wells</a> and <a href="George%20Ronan">George Ronan</a>, were struck down here.

Over time, the district has evolved from an upscale neighborhood to a factory district and back to an upscale neighborhood. Zoning in 1853 anticipated residential development, although only one grand villa existed at the time. By 1877 the eleven-block area of Prairie Avenue as well as Calumet Avenue housed elite residences. By 1886 the finest mansions in the city, each equipped with its own carriage house, stood on Prairie Avenue. In the 1880s and 1890s, mansions for <a href="George%20Pullman">George Pullman</a>, <a href="Marshall%20Field">Marshall Field</a>, John J. Glessner and <a href="Philip%20Armour">Philip Armour</a> anchored a neighborhood of over fifty mansions known as "Millionaire's Row". Many of the leading architects of the day, such as <a href="Richard%20Morris%20Hunt">Richard Morris Hunt</a>, <a href="Henry%20Hobson%20Richardson">Henry Hobson Richardson</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a> designed mansions on the street. At the time of the 1893 <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition</a>, guidebooks described the street as "the most expensive street west of <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>". However, after <a href="Bertha%20Palmer">Bertha Palmer</a>, society wife of <a href="Potter%20Palmer">Potter Palmer</a>, built the <a href="Palmer%20Mansion">Palmer Mansion</a> that anchored the <a href="Near%20North%20Side%2C%20Chicago%23Gold%20Coast">Gold Coast</a> along <a href="Lake%20Shore%20Drive">Lake Shore Drive</a>, the elite residents began to move north.
By 1911, warehouses and factories cramped the Prairie Avenue District. Large industry overtook the district by 1950. Early 21st century deindustrialisation, urban congestion, and historic preservation have brought the return of trendy buildings, and restored as well as renovated structures. Simultaneously new infill housing is resuscitating the district. Now, the historic northern section of the street is part of the <a href="Chicago%20Landmark">Chicago Landmark</a> Prairie Avenue District that is listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>. It was declared a Chicago Landmark on December 27, 1979, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1972. The historic district includes the 1800 and 1900-blocks of South Prairie, the 1800 block of South Indiana and 211 through 217 East Cullerton.

In the 1850s, railroad related industries prospered near the lumber district along the South Branch of the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a>. Thus, the business district began to supplant the elegant residences along <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan</a> and Wabash Avenues south of Jackson Boulevard. Shortly after the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, the city's wealthy residents settled on Prairie Avenue due to its proximity to the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Loop</a> less than a mile away and the fact that traveling there did not involve crossing the <a href="Chicago%20River">Chicago River</a>. In 1870, Daniel Thompson erected the first large upper-Prairie Avenue home. <a href="Marshall%20Field">Marshall Field</a> followed in 1871 with a <a href="Richard%20Morris%20Hunt">Richard Morris Hunt</a> design. Prairie Avenue was the most posh Chicago address by the time of the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871.
Many of South Michigan Avenue's elegant villas were destroyed in the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> of 1871. The post-fire South Side of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> grew rapidly as all economic classes left the city's center. Many of Chicago's elite families settled along Prairie Avenue. By the 1870s and 1880s, Prairie Avenue was the location of elaborate houses between 16th Street and 22nd Street (now <a href="Cermak%20Road">Cermak Road</a>). In 1886, the urban elite, including <a href="George%20Pullman">George Pullman</a>, <a href="Marshall%20Field">Marshall Field</a>, <a href="Philip%20Armour">Philip Armour</a> and John B. Sherman all owned family homes in this area that created an opulent Prairie Avenue streetscape reminiscent of European city streets; as such, it was widely regarded as the city's most fashionable neighborhood. Businesses, such as the <a href="Pullman%20Company">Pullman Company</a>, <a href="Armour%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Armour & Company</a> and <a href="D.H.%20Burnham%20%26amp%3B%20Company">D.H. Burnham & Company</a>, with ties to Prairie Avenue had national and international reach and impact. Additional grand homes (including many <a href="Queen%20Anne%20Style%20architecture">Queen Anne Style architecture</a> and <a href="Richardsonian%20Romanesque">Richardsonian Romanesque</a>) were located on Prairie between 26th and 30th Streets starting in the mid-1880s. The last mansion, a three-story Georgian Revival residence with 21 rooms, was built in the district at 2126 Prairie Avenue in 1905.

However, as the start of the 20th century came, industry's pervasive reach, increased railroad soot, and an encroaching vice district, caused the area to become less desirable, and the social elite vacated the region for quieter neighborhoods such as <a href="Kenwood%2C%20Chicago">Kenwood</a>, the <a href="Near%20North%20Side%2C%20Chicago%23Gold%20Coast">Gold Coast</a> and more commonly the suburban <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Chicago%29">North Shore</a>. The "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" highlighted 1898 Prairie Avenue as a place that was undesirable to those for whom it was affordable, and unaffordable to those for whom it was desirable. Light industry and vacant lots overtook Prairie Avenue during the second half of the 20th century. The elegant mansions were mostly torn down or fell into extreme disrepair. By the 1970s, most of the residential buildings had been replaced by factories and parking lots. Starting in the late 1990s, the downtown housing market flourished in Chicago and the resulting boom that has transformed many neighborhoods revived Prairie Avenue, causing most of the factories to be demolished or converted to loft condominiums. The factories have been replaced by condominium projects and most of the remaining mansions have been renovated.
During the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s, upper Prairie Avenue residents were central to cultural and social fabric of the city. The economy was supported by the thousands of jobs created by the <a href="Pullman%20Car%20Company">Pullman Car Company</a> and <a href="Armour%20and%20Company">Armour and Company</a>. Chicago's richest man, Marshall Field, changed the buying habits of the city. John Shorthall saved the property from total chaos after the <a href="Great%20Chicago%20Fire">Great Chicago Fire</a> by saving property records. At one point in the 1880s, sixteen of the 60 members of the <a href="Commercial%20Club%20of%20Chicago">Commercial Club of Chicago</a> lived on Prairie Avenue. <a href="George%20Armour">George Armour</a> headed the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, which became the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute of Chicago</a>. 1801 South Prairie resident, <a href="William%20Wallace%20Kimball">William Wallace Kimball</a>, employed about 1500 people around the start of the 20th century in his organ and piano manufacturing company. John Glessner, a founder of <a href="International%20Harvester">International Harvester</a>, built what has been described as the centerpiece of the historic district.

As a home to many of Chicago's leading families, Prairie Avenue became the base of many important political movements. Woman's <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> had activists, such as Illinois Women Suffrage Association President Jane Jones, on Prairie Avenue. "Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Illinois", , pitted the public welfare of the city against the railroad industry and was the foundation for the public trust doctrine which facilitated the city's reclamation of much of the lakefront. Prairie Avenue residents bolstered other efforts to fight against the railroads. The concentration of wealth also made Prairie Avenue the target of complaints about taxation inequities.

Many of these leading families also took part in <a href="philanthropy">philanthropy</a>. John Shorthall, founder of Chicago Title & Trust and Prairie Avenue resident, created the Illinois Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and convened local and state societies to unite under a national organization (<a href="American%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals">American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a>) that could combine its political strength and lobby Congress. The <a href="Illinois%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> was a successor entity of the Armour Institute of Technology, which was an outgrowth of the generosity of Philip and <a href="Joseph%20Armour">Joseph Armour</a>.

Historic preservation in Chicago has saved some of the city's architectural heritage. The efforts of the <a href="Chicago%20Architecture%20Foundation">Chicago Architecture Foundation</a> and the <a href="Landmarks%20and%20Preservation%20Council%20of%20Illinois">Landmarks and Preservation Council of Illinois</a> have been at the forefront of these efforts. The <a href="Commission%20on%20Chicago%20Landmarks">Commission on Chicago Landmarks</a> (now part of the city's Department of Planning and Development) has designated the Prairie Avenue Historic District as a city landmark.
A few of the mansions of the heyday still remain in the 1800-block including the National Historic landmark designated <a href="John%20J.%20Glessner%20House">John J. Glessner House</a> designed in 1886 by architect <a href="Henry%20H.%20Richardson">Henry H. Richardson</a> for Glessner; these provide a sense of the street's former character. Glessner House, which was the subject of a notable preservation battle in the 1960s, is considered to be Richardson's finest urban residence. This district includes the <a href="Henry%20B.%20Clarke%20House">Henry B. Clarke House</a>, which although twice relocated is purported to be the city's oldest standing house. In addition to the Clarke House and the Glessner House, nine other houses from the late-19th century remain in the historic district portion of Prairie Avenue. Both the Glessner House and the Clarke House are on the <a href="National%20Historic%20Register">National Historic Register</a> and now serve as museums. Most of the Prairie Avenue families worshiped at the Chicago Landmark <a href="Second%20Presbyterian%20Church%20of%20Chicago">Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago</a>, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Marshall Field lived at 1905 South Prairie and purchased 1919 South Prairie for Marshall Field, Jr. It is believed that <a href="Solon%20Spencer%20Beman">Solon Spencer Beman</a> had contributed to the design of what is now known as the Marshall Field, Jr. Mansion. Then, Field hired <a href="Daniel%20Burnham">Daniel Burnham</a> to design extensions and additions to the property after purchasing it 1890. In 2007, the <a href="Commission%20on%20Chicago%20Landmarks">Commission on Chicago Landmarks</a> announced the rehabilitation of the Marshall Field Jr. Mansion, which had been vacant for 40 years and which was renovated as six private residences, won a Preservation Award.

Today, Prairie Avenue has buildings indexed in the Chicago Historic Resources Survey in the <a href="Near%20South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">Near South Side</a>, <a href="Douglas%2C%20Chicago">Douglas</a>, <a href="Grand%20Boulevard%2C%20Chicago">Grand Boulevard</a>, <a href="Washington%20Park%2C%20Chicago%20%28neighborhood%29">Washington Park</a> and <a href="Chatham%2C%20Chicago">Chatham</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community areas</a>. Among the properties listed is a simple two-flat used by Al Capone in the 1920s at 7244 South Prairie in Greater Grand Crossing. Other current prominent addresses are the Kimball House at 1801 South Prairie (Near South Side), 2801, 3564, 3566, and 3600 South Prairie (Douglas), and 4919 South Prairie (Grand Boulevard).

The <a href="William%20W.%20Kimball%20House">William Wallace Kimball House</a>, which is a three-story <a href="turret">turret</a>ed <a href="chateau">chateau</a>, was designed by <a href="Solon%20Beman">Solon Beman</a>, who is best known for his work in the <a href="Pullman%20District">Pullman District</a> of the <a href="Pullman%2C%20Chicago">Pullman</a> community area. Adjacent to the Kimball House and across from the Glessner House is the Coleman-Ames mansion at 1811 South Prairie. These two houses were formerly owned by <a href="R.R.%20Donnelley%20%26amp%3B%20Sons%20Company">R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company</a> and now jointly serve as the national headquarters for the <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a> (USSF), which leased them from 1991 until 1998 when it purchased them from the Chicago Architectural Foundation. The Kimball house, which has been the product of a $1 million renovation in the 1990s by the USSF was featured in <a href="Richard%20Gere">Richard Gere</a>'s "<a href="Primal%20Fear%20%28film%29">Primal Fear</a>" as well as several television shows.

<a href="Al%20Capone">Al Capone</a> and his family lived in the two-story <a href="red%20brick">red brick</a> duplex at 7244 South Prairie Avenue from 1923, which is shortly after he moved to Chicago, until 1931, when he was sent off to prison for <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> <a href="fraud">fraud</a>. The Capone family kept the home until his mother's death in 1952. In 1988, the privately owned house was nominated for the National Register of Historic Places by historians as the home of one of Chicago's most famous citizens. The nomination was withdrawn after local politicians and members of Italian-American groups sharply argued that it would appear to validate the life of a murderer and hoodlum. The house retains the security bars on the basement windows and the brick garage out back, which the Capone built for his bullet-proof <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a> <a href="limousine">limousine</a>.

In 2000, the <a href="Howard%20Van%20Doren%20Shaw">Howard Van Doren Shaw</a>-designed 1907 <a href="Georgian%20Revival">Georgian Revival</a> Platt Luggage Building at 2301 South Prairie was the subject of preservation debates when <a href="McCormick%20Place">McCormick Place</a> attempted to tear it down to build a parking garage. The conflict, which was not settled before <a href="Wrecking%20ball">wrecker</a>s had knocked a hole in a corner of the building and which included protests and a petition to the <a href="Illinois%20Supreme%20Court">Illinois Supreme Court</a>, was described on the front page of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". Preservationists, including the <a href="Landmarks%20Preservation%20Council%20of%20Illinois">Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois</a> and the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Historic%20Preservation">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>, eventually dropped their appeals once the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority committed to incorporating the original <a href="facade">facade</a> of the building into the exterior of the parking garage at an additional cost of $2.5 million to the project. The <a href="Harriet%20F.%20Rees%20House">Harriet F. Rees House</a> at 2110 South Prairie was spared demolition in 2014 and moved one block north to 2017 South Prairie.

A book on the history of the street, entitled "Chicago's Historic Prairie Avenue", was published on June 2, 2008, as part of Arcadia Publishing Co.'s Images of America series. William H. Tyre is the author. In 2006, the <a href="Prairie%20District%20Neighborhood%20Alliance">Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance</a>, a non-profit organization, was formed to provide representation for thousands of South Loop residents, including the Prairie District, Central Station and Museum Park, Motor Row, the South Michigan Ave Corridor, as well as other areas of the Near South Side.

In 2003, the area redevelopment was well underway. <a href="Deindustrialization">Deindustrialization</a> and <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a> had pushed out <a href="manufacturing">manufacturing</a>. As a result, factories were generally demolished, or converted to <a href="loft%20apartment">loft apartment</a> buildings. Some neglected mansions survive as restored or renovated properties in the historic district. Today, Prairie Avenue is undergoing a redevelopment that includes <a href="One%20Museum%20Park">One Museum Park</a> (1215 South Prairie Avenue) and <a href="One%20Museum%20Park%20West">One Museum Park West</a> (1201 South Prairie Avenue). These Prairie Avenue addresses border the <a href="Roosevelt%20Road">Roosevelt Road</a> side of <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a>. One Museum Park is the tallest building on <a href="Chicago%27s%20South%20Side">Chicago's South Side</a> and among the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20Chicago">tallest buildings in Chicago</a>. It surpassed <a href="340%20on%20the%20Park">340 on the Park</a> as the tallest all-residential building in Chicago, and it is second to the <a href="Trump%20World%20Tower">Trump World Tower</a> in the United States.

Panellus stipticus

Panellus stipticus, commonly known as the bitter oyster, the astringent panus, the luminescent panellus, or the stiptic fungus, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Mycenaceae">Mycenaceae</a>, and the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Panellus">Panellus</a>". A common and widely distributed species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, where it grows in groups or dense overlapping clusters on the logs, stumps, and trunks of <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> trees, especially <a href="beech">beech</a>, <a href="oak">oak</a>, and <a href="birch">birch</a>. During the development of the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>, the mushrooms start out as tiny white knobs, which, over a period of one to three months, develop into fan- or kidney-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> that measure up to broad. The caps are orange-yellow to brownish, and attached to the decaying wood by short stubby <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalks</a> that are connected off-center or on the side of the caps. The fungus was given its current <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">scientific name</a> in 1879, but has been known by many names since French mycologist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Jean Bulliard</a> first described it as "Agaricus stypticus" in 1783. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetic">Molecular phylogenetic</a> analysis revealed "P. stipticus" to have a close genetic relationship with members of the genus "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>".

"Panellus stipticus" is one of several dozen species of fungi that are <a href="bioluminescent">bioluminescent</a>. Strains from eastern North America are typically bioluminescent, but those from the Pacific coast regions of North America and from other continents are not. The luminescence is localized to the edges of the <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> and the junction of the gills with the stem and cap. Bioluminescence is also observable with <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> grown in laboratory culture, and the growth conditions for optimal light production have been studied in detail. Several chemicals have been isolated and characterized that are believed to be responsible for light production. <a href="Genetic%20analysis">Genetic analysis</a> has shown that luminescence is controlled by a single <a href="dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant allele</a>. The luminescent glow of this and other fungi inspired the term <a href="foxfire">foxfire</a>, coined by early settlers in eastern and southern North America. Modern research has probed the potential of "P. stipticus" as a tool in <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a>, because of its ability to detoxify various <a href="persistent%20organic%20pollutant">environmental pollutants</a>.

The species was first named "Agaricus stypticus" by the French botanist <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pierre%20Bulliard">Jean Bulliard</a> in 1783, and later <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> by <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> under this name in 1821. Fries later changed the genus as well as the spelling of the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">epithet</a> and called it "Panus stipticus". The species has had an extensive <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history and been shuffled to a number of <a href="genus">genera</a> by various authors, resulting in several <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>: "Agaricus flabelliformis" (<a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a>, 1792), "Pocillaria stiptica" (<a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a>, 1898), "Rhipidium stipticum" (<a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Wallroth">Karl Friedrich Wilhelm Wallroth</a>, 1833), "Crepidopus stipticus" (<a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a>, 1821), "Pleurotus stipticus" (<a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a>), "Lentinus stipticus" (<a href="Joseph%20Schr%C3%B6ter">Joseph Schröter</a>, 1885), and "Merulius stipticus" (<a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>). It was Finnish mycologist <a href="Petter%20Karsten">Petter Karsten</a> who in 1879 assigned its current name. "Panellus stypticus" is still used in the literature as a variant spelling.

"Panellus stipticus" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Panellus", and, in <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a>'s authoritative 1986 classification of the <a href="Agaricales">Agaricales</a>, it is also the type species of <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Panellus", an infrageneric (below the taxonomic level of genus) grouping of "Panellus" species characterized by the absence of <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the sides of the <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>. More recently, <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analyses of the sequences of their ribosomal large subunit genes have concluded that "Panellus stipticus" is closely related to the <a href="poroid">poroid</a> mushroom "Dictyopanus pusillus". The molecular analysis supports a previous assessment by mycologists <a href="Harold%20Bursdall">Harold Bursdall</a> and <a href="Orson%20K.%20Miller">Orson K. Miller</a>, who in 1975 suggested merging "Dictyopanus" into "Panellus" based on similarities in spore shape, stem structure, and the ability of dried fruit bodies to revive when moistened. Formerly grouped in the <a href="Tricholomataceae">Tricholomataceae</a> family, a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a> of gilled mushrooms with white spores, "P. stipticus" is now classified in the <a href="Mycenaceae">Mycenaceae</a>, after a large-scale phylogenetic analysis revealed "a previously unsuspected relationship between "Mycena" and "Panellus" (including "Dictyopanus")".

The fungus is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the bitter oyster, the luminescent panellus, the astringent panus, or the styptic fungus. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "stipticus" refers to its purported value in stopping bleeding. <a href="Etymology">Etymologically</a>, it is a <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> equivalent to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "astringens", deriving from στυπτικός ("styptikós"), itself from the verb στύφειν ("styphein"), "to contract".

The fungus normally exists unseen, in the form of a mass of threadlike <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetative</a> cells called a <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a>, inhabiting rotting wood; only when suitable environmental conditions of temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are achieved does the fungus produce the reproductive structures known as <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>, or mushrooms. The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of the fruit body is kidney- or clamshell-shaped, convex to roughly flat, with dimensions of by . The edges of the caps are scalloped with small rounded teeth, and curved slightly inward. The cap surface is dry, with a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked dried mud; the surface is also covered with small fine hairs that give it a somewhat woolly consistency. It may have several concentric ridges or zones. Fresh fruit bodies range in color from yellowish-orange to <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> to cinnamon; when dried they may be various shades of tan, brown or clay. The faded colors of dried fruit bodies tend to revive when moistened. On the underside of the cap, the <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are narrow and spaced closely together, often forked, buff-colored, and with numerous interconnecting cross-veins. Holding the cap in position is a <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> that is long by thick, and has an off-center attachment to the cap, either at or near the cap side. The dull-white stem is covered with minute silk-like fibers, and is narrower at the base where it attaches to the <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. Fruit bodies do not have any distinctive odor. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thin and tough, and dark yellow-brown to cream-colored.

Various microscopic characteristics may be used to help identify the fungus from other <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> similar species. A <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> of "P. stipticus", made by depositing a large number of spores in a small area, reveals their color to be white. Viewed with a <a href="optical%20microscope">microscope</a>, the spores are smooth-walled, elliptical to nearly <a href="wikt%3Aallantoid">allantoid</a> (sausage-shaped), with dimensions of 3–6 by 2–3 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. Spores are <a href="amyloid%20%28mycology%29">amyloid</a>, meaning that they will absorb <a href="iodine">iodine</a> and become bluish-black when stained with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>, but this staining reaction has been described as "relatively weak".

The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (the spore-bearing cells) are 15–20 by 2.5–3.5 µm, club-shaped, and clamped at the base. The spores are attached to the end of the basidia by four projections called <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> that are 1–3.5 µm long. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are hyphal cells in the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> that do not produce basidiospores; they also make up the surfaces of the fruit body (the pelli or "cuticles"). They are usually structurally distinct from the basidia, and their features may be used as microscopic characters to help distinguish and differentiate similar fungi. The <a href="cheilocystidia">cheilocystidia</a> are found on the gill edge; in "P. stipticus" they are narrowly club-shaped, cylindrical, spindle-shaped to <a href="wikt%3Abifurcate">bifurcate</a> at the apex. They are also thin-walled, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), abundant and crowded, and measure 17–45 by 3.5–6 µm. The pleurocystidia, located on the gill face, are 17–40 by 3–4.5 µm, spindle- or club-shaped, sometimes bifurcate at the apex, thin-walled, and hyaline. They are scattered or in dense clusters, mostly embedded in hymenium, occasionally protruding up to half the width of the hymenium.

The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> of the cap consists of a number of microscopically distinct layers of tissue. The cuticle of the cap (known as the <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>) is between 8–10 µm thick, and is made of a loose "textura intricata", a type of tissue in which the hyphae are irregularly interwoven with distinct spaces between them. The cuticle hyphae are thick-walled to thin-walled, with scattered inconspicuous cystidia measuring 40–55 by 3.5–5.5 µm. These cystidia located in the cap (pileocystidia) are cylindrical, thin-walled, yellow in Melzer's reagent, hyaline in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">KOH</a>, sometimes with amorphous dingy brown material coating the walls. Beneath the cuticle layer is a zone 54–65 µm thick, made of very loosely entwined, thin-walled hyphae, 2–3 µm in thickness, with clamps at the septa. Below this is a zone 208–221 µm in thickness, in which the densely compacted hyphae, 3–8 µm in diameter, have swollen, gelatinized walls, and often more or less a vertical orientation. This in turn is followed by a layer 520 µm in thickness, formed of loosely interwoven hyphae, 2–8 µm in width, some of which have thin walls with clamps at the septa, whilst others have somewhat thickened gelatinized walls. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> of the cap has a layer of upright hyphae bending into a lower layer of interwoven hyphae with diameters of 2.5–8 µm. The flesh of the gills is similar to that of the lower cap.

Species of "<a href="Crepidotus">Crepidotus</a>" having a similar shape can be distinguished by their brown spore print, compared with the white spore print of "P. stipticus". "<a href="Schizophyllum%20commune">Schizophyllum commune</a>" has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and longitudinally split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom ("<a href="Panus%20rudis">Panus rudis</a>") is larger, has a reddish-brown cap that fades to pinkish-tan, and shows lilac tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some "<a href="Paxillus">Paxillus</a>" species may have a similar appearance, but they have yellow-brown spore prints.

"Panellus stipticus" is considered too small and bitter to be <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>. Its taste has been described as acidic, acrid, or astringent. One 1992 study reported that the taste of the fruit bodies varies across the geographic range of the species. Those from eastern North America have a mildly acrid taste that takes time to develop, and cause uncomfortable drying in the mouth. In contrast, specimens from Japan, New Zealand, and Russia produce no sensation in the mouth, but cause significant constriction and a nauseating taste in the throat. The fruit bodies are reputed to have been used in <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> as a <a href="antihaemorrhagic">styptic</a> to staunch bleeding, and also as a "violent <a href="laxative">purgative</a>".

Fruit bodies first appear as tiny white knobs less than a cubic millimeter in size. In a day or two the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by the formation of a minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1 mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, and then start to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, which can be seen when the cap is about 2 mm in diameter.The young cap is spherical and its growth is at first <a href="wikt%3Aepinastic">epinastic</a>, its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special enclosed chamber. As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown—a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.

The fruit body projects out horizontally from the growing surface. If the position of a log is altered after young fruit bodies with the beginnings of gills have appeared, the stems of these attempt to readjust themselves in order to place the cap in a horizontal position. The cap are sometimes <a href="wikt%3Azonate">zonate</a> (marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones); this depends on changes in the <a href="humidity">humidity</a> of the environment, as variations in the amount of moisture will cause alternating periods of acceleration or slowing of growth.

A yellowish-brown pigment is diffused through the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a> of the hyphae and is much deeper in color just below the <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a> of the cap. In very young fruit bodies, stems and caps are very pale <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a>, but soon the color of the cap deepens and becomes cinnamon. The intensity of the color appears to be dependent on light, for when fruit bodies are grown in diffuse light (temperature and humidity being constant) they are a uniform pale buff color, but in bright light they are cinnamon or tan.

"Panellus stipticus" is common in northern <a href="temperate">temperate</a> regions of Europe, and has also been collected in Australia, New Zealand, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, Japan, and China. In North America, it is more common in the east than the west; the mushroom's northern range extends to Alaska, and it has been collected as far south as <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>.

"Panellus stipticus" is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> species, and causes a white rot. This is a form of wood decay in which the wood assumes a bleached appearance and where <a href="lignin">lignin</a> as well as <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> and <a href="hemicellulose">hemicellulose</a> is broken down by <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s secreted by the fungus. Fruit bodies are usually found in tightly overlapping clusters on the sides of hardwood trees, on logs, stumps, and fallen branches. Although most commonly found on dead wood, it can also grow opportunistically in the wounds of living trees. In North America, its preferred hosts are <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="birch">birch</a>, <a href="maple">maple</a>, <a href="hickory">hickory</a>, <a href="pecan">pecan</a>, and <a href="American%20hornbeam">American hornbeam</a>, while in Europe, it is commonly found growing on oak, birch, <a href="alder">alder</a>, <a href="beech">beech</a>, <a href="hazel">hazel</a>, <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a>, and <a href="Fraxinus">ash</a>. It has also been found growing on "<a href="Ericia">Ericia</a>" in North Africa. Although the fungus favors hardwoods, it has been reported to grow on <a href="loblolly%20pine">loblolly pine</a> and <a href="eastern%20white%20pine">eastern white pine</a>. Fruiting occurs September through November in Europe, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, and North America, although it may also sometimes be found in the spring. The fruit bodies are long-lasting and may be found year-round. It is an "early-stage" <a href="ecological%20succession">succession</a> fungus, not typically recorded from plantations over 20 years old.

The fruit bodies are frequently attacked by slugs, which may be important agents in the dispersal of its spores. <a href="White-tailed%20deer">White-tailed deer</a> are also known to consume the fungus.

"Panellus stipticus" uses a <a href="heterothallic">heterothallic</a>, tetrapolar <a href="mating%20in%20fungi">mating system</a>: each basidiospore develops into a self-sterile mycelium which, when grown alone, remains <a href="homokaryotic">homokaryotic</a> (i.e., with all cells genetically identical) indefinitely. Researchers have paired collections of "P. stipticus" from Japan and Eastern North America, and later, collections from New Zealand and Russia. Although the separated <a href="allopatric%20speciation">allopatric</a> populations differ in bioluminescence and taste, the results revealed a universal intercompatibility group over these geographical regions. In a 2001 study, Jin and colleagues also paired geographically representative collections of the fungus, but observed a reduced ability to cross between Northern Hemisphere and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>n collections, as well as between and within Oceanian collections.

<a href="Bioluminescence">Bioluminescence</a> refers to the ability of certain living things in the environment to produce light by the action of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s. Bioluminescent fungi are widespread, and over 70 species are known (<a href="List%20of%20bioluminescent%20fungus%20species">List of bioluminescent fungus species</a>). Although the intensity of their luminescence is generally low compared to many other bioluminescent organisms, fungi glow continuously for days, so their total emission is comparable with that of most brightly luminescent organisms, such as <a href="firefly">fireflies</a>. Luminous fungi are found growing on decaying wood, leading to the popular name of "<a href="foxfire">foxfire</a>" or "glow wood" when their glow is visible at night. The responsible <a href="oxidative%20enzyme">oxidative enzyme</a>s—known generically as <a href="luciferase">luciferase</a>s—produce light by <a href="oxidation">oxidizing</a> a <a href="pigment">pigment</a> called a <a href="luciferin">luciferin</a>. In some areas, "P. stypticus" is bioluminescent, and the fruit bodies of these strains will glow in the dark when fresh or sometimes when revived in water after drying.

An early record of luminescence noted in "P. stypticus" was made by the American naturalist Thomas G. Gentry in 1885. <a href="Job%20Bicknell%20Ellis">Job Bicknell Ellis</a>, reporting on the phenomenon for the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Mycology">Journal of Mycology</a>", wrote:

By careful examination, the luminosity was found to proceed from the gills and not the stipe, nor from any fragment of rotten wood attached to the specimen. This phosphoresence was not observed in all specimens brought in for examination, and seemed to depend on some peculiar condition of the air, having been noticed only in specimens gathered in damp weather or just before a storm.
Canadian mycologist <a href="Arthur%20Henry%20Reginald%20Buller">Buller</a> in 1924 described the gills of "P. stipticus" in North America as luminescent, and noted that the fungus glows most strongly at the time of spore maturation. Bioluminescence has not been observed in European specimens, in Pacific North American collections, nor in strains collected from New Zealand, Russia, and Japan. Although a number of reports have confirmed that eastern North American strains are luminescent, non-luminescent North American strains are also known. In general, the intensity of fungal bioluminescence decreases after exposure to certain contaminants; this sensitivity is being investigated as a means to develop bioluminescence-based <a href="biosensor">biosensor</a>s to test the toxicity of polluted soils. Most known luminescent fungi are in the genus "<a href="Mycena">Mycena</a>" or closely allied genera; this grouping of fungi—known as the "mycenoid lineage"—includes "P. stipticus" and three other "Panellus" species.

The <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> of this species, grown in <a href="in%20vitro">laboratory culture</a>, have also been shown to be bioluminescent. Early studies demonstrated that short-wave <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light (at a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of 280 <a href="nanometre">nm</a>) reversibly inhibited the luminescence of "P. stypticus" mycelia, while longer wavelength (366 nm) ultraviolet was stimulatory. Further, the fungus exhibited a pronounced diurnal periodicity, and maximum luminescence was noted between 6 and 9 pm, regardless as to whether the mycelial cultures were incubated in continuous light, continuous darkness, or a normal day-night cycle. The mycelia of "P. stipticus" grown submerged in liquid were non-luminescent, but became luminescent while growing on solid substrata. Dark-grown colonies were luminescent in the center, and light-grown colonies were brightest at the periphery. Other experiments have shown that growth temperature and <a href="pH">pH</a> have a significant effect on the level of bioluminescence, optimized at and pH 3–3.5. However, light had a significant effect on mycelial growth but not on bioluminescence, and the optimal light conditions for maximum bioluminescence were total darkness.

Bioluminescent tissue in the mature fruit body is restricted to the edge of the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with the stem, and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and the stem. Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.

Using techniques of <a href="complementation%20%28genetics%29">genetic complementation</a>, Macrae paired nonluminescent monocaryons with luminescent ones, and concluded that luminosity in "P. stipticus" is an inherited character, and governed by a single pair of <a href="allele">allele</a>s in which luminosity was <a href="dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant</a> over nonluminosity. Luminosity factors were independent of intersterility factors. In 1992, Lingle and colleagues agreed with Macrae about luminosity and stated that at least three different <a href="mutation">gene mutations</a> could lead to the loss of luminescence. They also reported that the maximum bioluminescence was found at 525 nm, and shifted to 528 nm in deeply pigmented fruit bodies.

After intercontinental compatibility tests, Petersen and Bermudes suggested that bioluminescence and compatibility were independent since bioluminescence seemed to be geographically restricted. This suggested that the ability or potential to interbreed must have been preserved since separation of "P. stypticus" into geographically isolated areas.

Several authors have suggested that the purpose of fungal bioluminescence is to attract <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s to the fruit body to help disseminate spores. However, there has been no direct observation of this phenomenon. In many species, the mycelium is luminescent, but the fruit body is not, which argues against this hypothesis. Mycelial bioluminence may also function to attract animals that can potentially carry fungal spores in well-hydrated areas, as light emission from the mycelium is higher when it is hydrated. This would presumably increase the chance that spores would be deposited in an environment that is already optimal for growth. <a href="Basidiomycete">Basidiomycete</a> mushrooms are known to be dependent on an adequate moisture supply for proper development. In species with a luminous mycelium, the mycelium would therefore have a dual function in performing the fungal translocation that permits transport of substances from the further environment back to the fruiting body, and in attracting disseminating vectors towards environments favorable for development of the species.

In general, bioluminescence is caused by the action of <a href="luciferase">luciferase</a>s, enzymes that produce light by the <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> of a <a href="luciferin">luciferin</a> (a <a href="pigment">pigment</a>). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in "Panellus stipticus", and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the <a href="sesquiterpene">sesquiterpene</a> panal, which has a <a href="cadinene">cadinene</a> keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-"O"-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-"O"-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> or <a href="primary%20amine">primary amine</a>s in the presence of <a href="iron%28II%29">iron(II)</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>, and a cationic <a href="surfactant">surfactant</a>, light is emitted by a <a href="chemiluminescence">chemiluminescence</a> reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of "<a href="in%20vivo">in vivo</a>" bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a> (SOD) appears to play a critical role in the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> (O) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.

As a white-rot fungus, "Panellus stipticus" contains enzymes that are able to break down <a href="lignin">lignin</a>, a complex <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of <a href="aromatic%20hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon rings</a> is <a href="laccase">laccase</a>, which <a href="enzyme%20catalysis">catalyzes</a> the addition of a <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group to <a href="phenol">phenol</a>ic compounds (<a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a>s). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> of land contaminated by <a href="Persistent%20organic%20pollutant">organic pollutants</a>, and to convert <a href="industrial%20waste">industrial waste</a>s rich in toxic polyphenols. "Panellus stipticus" has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of "P. stipticus" <a href="mycelia">mycelia</a> reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a "P. stipticus" culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-"p"-dioxin, a <a href="Polychlorinated%20dibenzodioxins">polychlorinated dioxin</a>.

Tropical Storm Brenda (1960)

Tropical Storm Brenda was the second named storm of the <a href="1960%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1960 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. It developed in the northeastern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> on July 28, and after moving ashore over the Florida Peninsula, it attained tropical storm status. Brenda accelerated northeast along the <a href="U.S.%20East%20Coast">U.S. East Coast</a>, ultimately peaking as a moderate storm with winds of before crossing the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a> and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>; it dissipated on July 31 over southern <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. The storm inflicted moderate damage in Florida, the worst since <a href="Hurricane%20Easy%20%281950%29">Hurricane Easy</a> of 1950, and dropped heavy rainfall as far north as <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Total damage is estimated at US$5 million, and only indirect deaths are blamed on the cyclone.

A weak <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> that organized in the northeast <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> began to intensify on July 28, while located west of the <a href="Tampa%20Bay">Tampa Bay</a>. Early in its life, the system had a broad circulation with primarily light winds, similar to that of a <a href="subtropical%20storm">subtropical storm</a>. The storm is estimated to have become a tropical depression earlier the previous day as it moved toward the northeast. It made landfall along the <a href="Florida">Florida</a> coast near <a href="Cross%20City%2C%20FL">Cross City</a> and continued inland, gradually accelerating. It likely attained tropical storm status at around 1200 UTC on July 28 while its center was situated west of Tampa. The cyclone was named Brenda after <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> aircraft confirmed that it had reached tropical storm strength.

Brenda tracked northward, hugging the Georgia and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> coasts before moving inland over <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> on July 29. It attained its peak winds of late that evening, while situated south of <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington</a>. The next morning, the storm emerged over the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> moving northeast at about . Brenda crossed the <a href="Delmarva%20Peninsula">Delmarva Peninsula</a> and rapidly tracked into southern <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. The storm crossed the state and eventually made another landfall in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> before making yet another landfall in coastal <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>.

At around 0000 UTC on July 31, Brenda moved into <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Shortly thereafter, it lost its tropical characteristics and transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a>. It dissipated by August 1 over southern <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Because Brenda was in the vicinity of land for most of its course, it was not able to intensify beyond tropical storm status.

In advance of the storm, <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings">tropical storm advisories</a> and wind warnings were issued from Florida to <a href="Maine">Maine</a>.

Rainfall from Tropical Storm Brenda affected at least 16 states. The heaviest precipitation fell in western Florida near <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a>, east of the storm's center; the <a href="Tampa%20International%20Airport">Tampa International Airport</a> recorded of rainfall. Extensive flooding occurred in the west-central Florida Peninsula. Wind gusts exceeded , and the storm produced high waves along the coast, leading to considerable erosion. However, storm tides were not severe. Around the <a href="Naples%2C%20Florida">Naples</a> area, Brenda's effects were primarily light, although small boat and dock facilities and roads sustained some damage. A private seawall at <a href="Clearwater%2C%20Florida">Clearwater</a> was breached in two places by the cyclone.

Brenda was considered the worst storm to strike the area since Hurricane Easy in 1950. While no casualties are directly blamed on the storm, at least one traffic-related death took place. According to an <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> Disaster Service report encompassing eight Florida counties, 11 houses sustained significant damage, while 567 suffered more minor damage. Around 590 families were affected overall. Total monetary damage is placed at near $5 million.

Tides along the <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a> of <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> were generally reported at above-normal. In and around Wilmington, the storm caused minor damage to roofs and windows of some beachfront structures. Power was temporarily interrupted due to fallen tree limbs. Heavy rainfall caused flooding on streams and rivers, and in some areas the precipitation helped to end a serious drought. Some boats were swamped, and the winds ripped the roof off a cottage at <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20North%20Carolina">Long Beach</a>. The heavy rain and high tides flooded tobacco fields.

Moderate rains extended northward into the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20states">Mid-Atlantic states</a>, with lighter totals reported farther north in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. At New York City, of precipitation fell, beating the one-day July record of set in 1872. The heavy rains flooded parts of <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">LaGuardia Airport</a>. Elsewhere, reports of were common throughout <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. High winds also affected portions of the northeastern United States, gusting to across southern New England. Tides often ran above-normal throughout the region. The storm caused travel delays and ran several ships aground, but otherwise inflicted little serious damage. The storm forced the cancellation of two <a href="American%20League">American League</a> baseball games and the postponement of several other sporting events.

St. Michael's Cathedral, Qingdao

St. Michael's Cathedral (; ), also called the Zhejiang Road Catholic Church (), is a <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> church in <a href="Qingdao">Qingdao</a> (Tsingtao), <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a> Province, China and is the seat of the Bishop of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Qingdao">Roman Catholic Diocese of Qingdao</a>. It is located in the oldest part of Qingdao, at 15 Zhejiang Road, on the east side of Zhongshan Road in <a href="Shinan%20District">Shinan District</a>. Built by <a href="Germany">German</a> missionaries, the cathedral stands at the top of a hill in the center of the old German-built part of the city. It is the largest example of <a href="Romanesque%20architecture%23Romanesque%20Revival">Romanesque Revival architecture</a> in the province, resembling a German cathedral of the 12th century.

St. Michael's Cathedral is the product of a strong German presence in Shandong Province in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the mid-19th century the European powers forcibly opened China to foreign trade. The <a href="Divine%20Word%20Missionaries">Divine Word Missionaries</a> built a church in the <a href="Jiaozhou%20Bay%20concession">Jiaozhou Bay concession</a> in Shandong in 1902, and in 1934 erected the cathedral, which remained nominally under their administration until 1964. In 1942 it came under the control of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Japanese Army</a>, returning to Chinese control when the Japanese left Qingdao in 1945. In the early 1950s, all foreign missionaries, including the Bishop of Qingdao, were either imprisoned or expelled from China, and during the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> (1966–1976) the cathedral was defaced and abandoned. In 1981, it was repaired by the government and reopened for services, and in 1992 it was listed as a Provincial Historic Building by the government of Shandong Province.

After China's defeat in the <a href="First%20Opium%20War">First Opium War</a>, the country was forcibly opened to foreign trade by a number of treaties collectively referred to as the <a href="Unequal%20Treaties">Unequal Treaties</a>. Following the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Nanjing">Treaty of Nanjing</a> (1842), the British established the first <a href="treaty%20ports">treaty ports</a>. Following China's <a href="Concession%20%28territory%29">concession</a> to the British Empire, other foreign powers including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal <a href="extraterritoriality">extraterritoriality</a> as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by foreign powers, such as the <a href="concessions%20in%20China">concessions in China</a>, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.

In the early 1890s, the German Empire had been considering occupying <a href="Jiaozhou%20Bay">Jiaozhou Bay</a> ("Jiaozhou" is romanized as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German) for building its first naval base in East Asia in order to expand into the interior of Shandong. In 1891 the <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing government</a> decided to make Qingdao (commonly spelled "Tsingtao") defensible against naval attack and began to improve the existing fortifications of the town. German naval officials observed and reported on this Chinese activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. In November 1897, the German Navy seized Jiaozhou Bay under the pretext of ensuring that reparations were paid for the murder of two German Catholic missionaries in the province. In the spring of 1898, the German government signed a treaty that allowed the Germans to lease an area of for 99 years (or until 1997, as the British did in Hong Kong's New Territories), to construct a railway to <a href="Jinan">Jinan</a>, the capital of Shandong province, and to exploit coalfields along the railroad.

The <a href="Kiautschou%20Bay%20concession">Kiautschou Bay concession</a>, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914. With an area of , it was located in the imperial province of <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a> (alternatively romanized as Shantung or Shan-tung in English and Schantung in German) on the southern coast of the <a href="Shandong%20Peninsula">Shandong Peninsula</a> ("Schantung-Halbinsel") in northern China. Tsingtao (Qingdao) was its administrative center. After the farmers and fishermen of the Chinese village sold their buildings and land and resettled in the rural communities further east, the Germans began to develop the area. Wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply were improvements that transformed the impoverished fishing village of Tsingtao into a modern German town. In a short time the area had the highest density of schools and "per capita" student enrollment in all of China; primary, secondary and vocational schools were funded by the <a href="German%20Empire">Imperial German</a> treasury and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> and Roman Catholic missions.
The cathedral was built by the <a href="Divine%20Word%20Missionaries">Divine Word Missionaries</a> (abbreviated "SVD," from their Latin name: "Societas Verbi Divini"), the first German Catholic missionary society. The order was founded in 1875 "for the propagation of the Catholic religion among pagan nations," at <a href="Steyl">Steyl</a> (today in the <a href="Limburg%20%28Netherlands%29">Limburg Province</a> of the Netherlands), by German Catholic priests fleeing the <a href="Kulturkampf">Kulturkampf</a>. The society's first mission was established in 1882 in southern Shantung, a district of more than 10 million people, which contained 158 Catholics. At the time, the area was part of the <a href="Apostolic%20Vicariate">Apostolic Vicariate</a> of Shantung, managed by Italian <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a>s, who were tasked with rebuilding the earlier Catholic mission work. However, the mission work proceeded slowly, due to insufficient personnel and resources. The southern half of the province, in particular, had been all but neglected. Consequently, it was transferred to the SVD on December 2, 1885, and became the <a href="Vicariate%20Apostolic%20of%20Southern%20Shan-tung">Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung</a>. The new Vicariate Apostolic was headquartered in <a href="Yanzhou">Yanzhou</a>, Shandong and headed by Bishop <a href="Johann%20Baptist%20von%20Anzer">Johann Baptist von Anzer</a>, SVD, who led it until November 24, 1903. By 1907, the mission numbered 35,378 Catholics and 36,367 <a href="catechumen">catechumen</a>s, and by 1924, 106,000 Catholics and 44,000 catechumens. The SVD's presence in Qingdao was first recorded when the mission purchased land there in 1899 and began building a mission hall.

In autumn 1898 Bishop von Anzer had Father Franz Bartels appointed as pastor in Qingdao. Bishop von Anzer also commissioned Bartels with planning and constructing the Catholic mission. Bartels initially stayed in a house that was part of a <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> temple. Adjacent to his house he had a provisional chapel built which served as a place of worship/service for the European inhabitants of Qingdao until 1902 when a mission hall with a chapel was built. Major Kopka von Lossow, commander of the Third Sea Battalion which was stationed in Qingdao, ordered about a hundred of his men to attend services every Sunday.

On a hill chosen by Bishop von Anzer, Father Bartels purchased some land on Qufu Road, having a printing house and the SVD mission hall erected in 1902. The mission hall was converted to a school in 1922, and was operating as of May 2010.

The Holy Ghost Convent was also built on the same hill, occupied by Franciscan sisters who worked as nurses and teachers.

The cathedral's original architect (commissioned by Bishop Augustin Henninghaus) designed a three-aisled <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> church, but the World War I <a href="Siege%20of%20Tsingtao">conquest of Qingdao</a> by the Japanese on November 16, 1914, put an end to the cathedral plans. The city reverted to Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">Republic of China</a>. The Vicariate Apostolic of Southern Shan-tung was renamed the Vicariate Apostolic of Yanzhoufu on December 13, 1924, and on February 22, 1925, the <a href="Apostolic%20Prefect">Apostolic Prefect</a>ure of Qingdao was established from its territory, with Bishop <a href="Georg%20Weig">Georg Weig</a>, SVD, appointed prefect on March 18 of that same year. On June 14, 1928, it was elevated to a Vicariate Apostolic. When construction resumed, the original Gothic plan no longer seemed appropriate for the modern townscape of Qingdao. Father Alfred Fräbel designed the present neo-Romanesque structure, built during the tenure of Bishop Weig, who is entombed in the cathedral.

Construction began on May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German architect living in Qingdao who had already completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came to power in Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, which show the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.

Some sources state that St. Michael's Cathedral was originally named "St. Emil's Church". A Latin inscription over the tomb of Bishop Weig states that the cathedral was consecrated to <a href="St.%20Michael%20the%20Archangel">St. Michael the Archangel</a> in 1934. In addition, a photo taken in 1935, currently in the <a href="German%20Federal%20Archives">German Federal Archives</a> is labeled "St. Michaels Kirche" ("St. Michael's Church"), and authoritative secondary print sources make no mention of "St. Emil's Church".

The Japanese reoccupied Qingdao in January 1938. Bishop <a href="Thomas%20Tien%20Ken-sin">Thomas Tien Ken-sin</a>, SVD was appointed Vicariate Apostolic of Qingdao, in November 1942, as Bishop Georg Weig had died the year before. That year, the Japanese placed a large sign over the main door of the cathedral that read "Under Management of the Japanese Army". On August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered to Allied forces, officially ending World War II, and in September 1945, Qingdao was liberated by forces of the <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a>, restoring the government of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China%20%281912%E2%80%931949%29">Republic of China</a>. The following year, on February 18, 1946, Bishop Tien was elevated to <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">Cardinal</a>, becoming the first Chinese Cardinal and to date the only SVD Cardinal. He traveled to <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican City</a> to accept the honor. His Vicariate Apostolic was elevated to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Qingdao">Diocese of Qingdao</a> on April 11. Upon his return on May 27, he was greeted by representatives of the government of Shandong Province, who had arranged a welcome in his honor, with the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Band">United States Marine Band</a> playing outside the main entrance of the cathedral. The Marine Band was attached to <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">Naval Forces Western Pacific</a>, headquartered in Qingdao at the time. During the <a href="Chinese%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> period (1946–1949), missionaries in Shandong Province experienced growing tensions with the Communists, spurring one of them, Father Augustin Olbert, SVD to write:
Father Olbert was appointed Bishop of Qingdao two years later.

On June 2, 1949, the <a href="People%27s%20Liberation%20Army">People's Liberation Army</a> entered Qingdao and both the city and Shandong Province have since been under <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20China">Communist</a> control. Bishop Tien fled to Taiwan with the <a href="Kuomintang">Kuomintang</a> government.

Soon after the Communists assumed control, a combination of assertive nationalism and socialist ideology led to the eradication of the Western presence in China, including Western culture and products. "The denunciation of anything Western as 'capitalist,' '<a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a>' and representative of the '<a href="imperialism">imperialist</a> world' reached a peak during the ideological extremism of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> (1950–1953) when the final vestiges of the Western economic and cultural presence were eradicated." Missionary and Communist ambitions simply were irreconcilable and the wide ideological gap could not be bridged. The stage had been set for the Communists' catastrophic assault on the missionary enterprise during the Civil War period (1946–1949) and the expulsion of virtually all foreigners in the early 1950s. Foreign missionaries who were suspected of being spies were arrested. Missionary institutes funded by foreign money were closed down and all foreign missionaries expelled from China. The SVD mission was not spared this fate. In 1951, the Diocese of Qingdao's Bishop Augustin Olbert, SVD was arrested, served 22 months in prison, and was then deported to Germany in 1953. Although the cathedral was closed by the government, Bishop Olbert remained Bishop of Qingdao until his death in 1964. Native Chinese clergy were not spared the government's Marxian contempt for religion during this period. Future Bishop of Qingdao Li Mingshu was sent to prison the same year Bishop Olbert was deported, and not released from labor camps until 1968. Sweeping arrests of Chinese bishops, priests, sisters and laity did not begin, however, until 1955. Afterwards, the Catholic resistance movement, encountering mass arrests and sentences to forced labor, was forced underground. Professor Jean-Paul Wiest, Research Associate at the Centre for the Study of Religion and Chinese Society wrote: "The witness of Bishop <a href="Ignatius%20Kung%20Pin-Mei">Gong Pinmei</a> of Shanghai and many others who chose jail, labor camps, and even death for the sake of their faith and their loyalty to the pope would sustain countless people in the years ahead." 

By late 1957, due to the prior expulsion of foreign clergy and the subsequent imprisonment of Chinese clergy, 120 out of 145 dioceses and prefectures apostolic were without ordinaries. The Diocese of Qingdao went without an <a href="Ordinary%20%28officer%29">ordinary</a> until the state-run <a href="Chinese%20Patriotic%20Catholic%20Association">Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association</a> consecrated and appointed Bishop Paul Han Xirang, <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor">OFM</a> without papal sanction in 1988.

The cathedral was badly damaged during the <a href="Cultural%20Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a> which lasted from 1966 to 1971. During this time St. Michael's Cathedral was defaced by the <a href="Red%20Guards%20%28China%29">Red Guards</a>. The crosses topping the twin <a href="Steeple%20%28architecture%29">steeples</a> were removed by the Red Guards, with two men falling to their deaths during the removal. An account of the cathedral's defacement is translated as follows:

The Chinese government subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document presented at the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a "preliminary assessment" of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman <a href="Ye%20Jianying">Ye Jianying</a> declared the Cultural Revolution "an appalling catastrophe" and "the most severe setback to [the] socialist cause since [1949]." The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China", adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist. It is true that he made gross mistakes during the "cultural revolution", but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his contributions to the Chinese revolution far outweigh his mistakes. His merits are primary and his errors secondary."

The change in prevailing political views was favorable to St. Michael's Cathedral; the Chinese government funded the cathedral's restoration efforts. New crosses were manufactured for the cathedral's restoration, and "after several years of repair, [the cathedral] was re-opened in April 1981" for religious services. In May 1999 the church was opened to the general public, allowing entry when <a href="Mass%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Mass</a> or other services are not being celebrated. In 2005, city workers repairing water pipes accidentally found the original crosses buried on Longshan Road, not far from the cathedral. They are currently stored in the north <a href="transept">transept</a>. The cathedral has been listed on the register of Provincial Historic Buildings by the government of Shandong Province since 1992.

The change in prevailing political views also allowed for rapprochement with Chinese clergy formerly imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. In 1985 Li Mingshu was allowed an official post teaching at the seminary of Jinan. In 1994 he was transferred to the service of the Diocese of Qingdao, and was appointed the Bishop of Qingdao in 2000. Upon his consecration as Bishop, he took the name "Joseph".

The cathedral stands atop a hill in the center of what was the original settlement of the city of Qingdao, at 15 Zhejiang Road (formerly Bremen Strasse) on the east side of Zhongshan Road in Shinan District. The church is built in the historic style of German Romanesque. It is <a href="cruciform">cruciform</a> in plan, having a nave flanked by a lower single aisle on either side, crossed by a transept, and with a semi-circular apse projecting at the east end.

The cathedral is long and the transept is wide, with an exterior height of . The towers are in height, and have <a href="Rhenish%20helm">Rhenish helm</a> spires, each topped by a cross. One tower contains a single large bell, and the other three smaller bells.

The <a href="Cathedral%20architecture%20of%20Western%20Europe%23West%20front">west front</a> rises to a balustrade between the towers at . It has three portals, with a <a href="rose%20window">rose window</a> above the central one. The building materials are reinforced concrete and granite, and the roofs are red tiles.

In his book, "German Architecture in China", Warner Torsten writes of the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral is far too large for the scale of Qingdao. Its position on top of a hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46 metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China – <a href="Tianjin">Tianjin</a>, Beijing, <a href="Dalian">Dalian</a>, or <a href="Jinan">Jinan</a>. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.

The total floor area of St. Michael's Cathedral is . While the exterior of the cathedral is neo-Romanesque, the interior has <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> and <a href="arch">arch</a>es of a <a href="Classical%20revival">Classical revival</a> style. Above the high nave and transept is an unvaulted <a href="Coffer">coffered ceiling</a>. Narrow vaults over the two aisles are so much lower than the nave that they function like <a href="ambulatory">ambulatories</a>. The nave can hold 1,000 people. The <a href="baptismal%20font">baptismal font</a> and statues have captions in English and Chinese.

The nave extends into a high vaulted <a href="apse">apse</a> (pictured right) at the <a href="Architectural%20development%20of%20the%20eastern%20end%20of%20cathedrals%20in%20England%20and%20France">east end</a>. The aisles on either side of the nave are continued around the apse, making an ambulatory. Seven chandeliers are suspended from the ceiling over the main aisle. Beneath the chancel arch stands the high altar, under an ornate <a href="baldachin">baldachin</a>. The <a href="Ciborium%20%28architecture%29">ciborium</a> over the high altar bears the Latin words "Venite Adoremus Dominum", "Come adore the Lord." Within the sanctuary stands a second, portable, altar, upon which most masses are celebrated.

According to <a href="Lonely%20Planet">Lonely Planet</a>, "The interior is splendid, with white walls, gold piping … and a marvellously painted apse."

The <a href="mural">mural</a> painted on the dome of the apse (pictured right) depicts Jesus seated on a cloud, red and golden rays radiating out of his golden <a href="Halo%20%28religious%20iconography%29">halo</a>. <a href="God%20the%20Father">God the Father</a>, pictured as a white-bearded man with triangular halo, looks down from a cloud above Jesus. A dove with a white halo, representing the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, flies just below God, wings outstretched, completing the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>. Above Jesus fly four <a href="cherubim">cherubim</a>. Seated to Jesus' right is <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary">Mary, his mother</a>, and to his left Saint <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. On the same cloud as Jesus, three angels flank on each side. Slightly below Jesus, Mary, and John, two more flanking angels are depicted kneeling on their own clouds and swinging <a href="censer">censer</a>s. Under the entire scene, a banner displays "<a href="Gloria%20in%20Excelsis%20Deo">Gloria in Excelsis Deo</a>".

In 2006, the construction and installation of a massive Jäger & Brommer pipe organ (pictured at left) was commissioned for St. Michael's Cathedral at a cost of 700,000 euros, to be ready in time for the <a href="2008%20Olympics">2008 Olympics</a>. The pipe organ sits upon the choir loft over the <a href="Cathedral%20architecture%20of%20Western%20Europe%23West%20front">west front</a> entrance.

The north transept contains three large murals featuring <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>: Jesus washing <a href="St.%20Peter">St. Peter</a>'s feet, the <a href="Sacred%20Heart">Sacred Heart</a>, and the "<a href="Piet%C3%A0">Pietà</a>". The north transept also contains the tombs of two bishops. One is of the first Vicar Apostolic of the <a href="Vicariate%20Apostolic">Vicariate Apostolic</a> of Qingdao, Bishop Georg Weig, <a href="Divine%20Word%20Missionaries">SVD</a> who supervised the construction of the cathedral. Bishop Weig's tombstone shows obvious signs of defacement, being chipped around the edges, and with broken stonework at its base. The other tomb contains part of the ashes of Bishop of Qingdao Paul Han Xirang, <a href="Franciscan">OFM</a>, the rest having been buried in his hometown, Han Village, <a href="Yucheng%20County">Yucheng County</a>, Shandong Province.

The south transept also contains three large murals: the <a href="Child%20Jesus">Holy child</a> praying, <a href="Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20de%20Lisieux">St. Thérèse of Lisieux</a> (patroness of missions), and the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus%20in%20art">Nativity</a>. The north and south arms of the transept each contain two altars.

The church is active and as of 2008 more than 10,000 Catholics in Qingdao attend services there. According to December 2009 and January 2010 church bulletins, mass is celebrated daily by Bishop Li Mingshu at 6 am, with additional masses on Sunday and festivals on Easter and Christmas. Services are held in Korean and Chinese, with one Korean and several Chinese priests on site.

Murder of Leigh Leigh

The murder of Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears, occurred on 3 November 1989 while she was attending a 16-year-old boy's birthday party at <a href="Stockton%20Beach">Stockton Beach</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, on the east coast of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The 14-year-old girl from <a href="Fern%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Fern Bay</a> was assaulted by a group of boys after she returned distressed from a sexual encounter on the beach that a reviewing judge later called non-consensual. After being kicked and spat on by the group, Leigh left the party. Her naked body was found in the sand dunes nearby the following morning, with severe genital damage and a crushed skull.

Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old who acted as a <a href="bouncer%20%28doorman%29">bouncer</a> at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was released on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having <a href="Statutory%20rape">sex with a minor</a>. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the <a href="Forensic%20identification">forensic evidence</a>. The murder investigation was reviewed by the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Crime%20Commission">New South Wales Crime Commission</a> in 1996, and by the <a href="Police%20Integrity%20Commission">Police Integrity Commission</a> in 1998, with the latter recommending the dismissal of the detective in charge of the investigation.

Leigh's murder received considerable attention in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more on the lack of parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. The media coverage of the murder has been cited as an example of <a href="victim%20blaming">blaming the victim</a>. Leigh's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled "A Property of the Clan", which was later revised and renamed "<a href="Blackrock%20%28play%29">Blackrock</a>", as well as a feature film <a href="Blackrock%20%28film%29">of the same name</a>.

Leigh Leigh, born Leigh Rennea Mears on 24 July 1975, was the daughter of Robyn Lynne Maunsell and Robert William Mears. Leigh's grandmother said that Leigh lived with her between the ages of about four and seven, though she did not disclose reasons for this living arrangement. Leigh's parents divorced when she was about seven years old. She moved back to live with her mother after her sister Jessie was born in 1983; her surname was subsequently changed to Leigh as this was the surname of her sister's father. At the time of her death she lived with her sister, mother and stepfather Brad Shearman on Fullerton Road, Fern Bay, having moved there nine months earlier from a <a href="Housing%20NSW">housing commission</a> flat near the Stockton ferry terminal. Leigh was a <a href="Year%20Eight">Year Eight</a> student at <a href="Newcastle%20High%20School%20%28Australia%29">Newcastle High School</a> who enjoyed school, according to her grandmother. She had attended three <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a>s successively: St Patrick's in <a href="Swansea%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Swansea</a>, Hamilton North Public School, and St Peter's in Stockton. Leigh spent most of her weekends and school holidays with her grandmother at her house in <a href="Kilaben%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kilaben Bay</a>. Her cousin and best friend Tracey stated she and Leigh enjoyed going to the cinema together, as well as roller-skating and "just hanging about". According to her aunt, Leigh had wanted to be a <a href="Veterinary%20physician">veterinarian</a>. Both Leigh's mother and her grandmother described her as a "typical teenager".

Newcastle High School student Jason Robertson's 16th birthday party was held on 3 November 1989 at the North Stockton Surf Club, a formerly abandoned building which the Stockton <a href="Lions%20Clubs%20International">Lions Club</a> had taken over four years prior, leasing it for various functions. Police estimated that about 60 people had attended the party, though figures as high as 100 were reported in the media. Most of the attendees were Year Ten students from Newcastle High School, though two 10-year-olds were seen at the party at one point. Many were drinking alcohol and smoking <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>, and some were having sex.

Fourteen-year-old Leigh had a written invitation to attend the party and permission from her mother to stay there until 11 pm; Leigh's mother had been assured that responsible adults would be present at the party. Matthew Webster and Guy Wilson, who acted as bouncers, were the only people aged over 18 at the party. Leigh was said to be very excited, as it was the first teenage party she had attended. According to police witness reports, Leigh was one of several under-age girls who were invited to the party for the purpose of getting them intoxicated and having sex with them. According to a police report, Webster approached another person at the party and said, "Hey dude, we're going to get Leigh <a href="Alcohol%20intoxication">pissed</a> and all go through her." Leigh was also one of several under-age people for whom an adult purchased alcohol before the party; she and her friend were given a bottle of <a href="Jim%20Beam">Jim Beam</a> whiskey, which they then mixed with <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a>. She was reported to have gotten heavily intoxicated very quickly. A 15-year-old boy, who for legal reasons could not be named and was referred to in official documentation as 'NC1', is quoted to have said, "I'm going to go and fuck [Leigh]." Shortly afterwards Leigh went to the beach with NC1; witnesses stated Leigh was so intoxicated that he "had to almost carry her".

When Leigh returned from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh and find out what had happened to her; Leigh "asserted she had been raped", replying "[NC1] fucked me" and "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick her up at 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.

Leigh was found naked except for her socks and shoes, with her <a href="knickers">knickers</a> and shorts around her right ankle. She was on her back with her legs apart. Her bra, which had its securing hook bent, was found nearby, as was her shirt and <a href="Sweater">jumper</a>, which were intertwined, inside out and stained with liquor. <a href="Atriplex">Saltbushes</a> nearby had been flattened. According to the police forensics report, a blood-stained rock weighing was found next to her, and blood stains were found up to from her body.

The <a href="Autopsy">postmortem</a> report stated Leigh's cause of death to be a fractured skull and injury to the brain. Leigh had been struck with great force several times, including at least three times in the head. The postmortem also found that Leigh had <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a>l haemorrhages, and multiple injuries to the jaw, ribs, liver and right kidney. Leigh had neck fingertip pressure injuries, indicating she had been choked before she died, though this was not the cause of death. Leigh's <a href="Blood%20alcohol%20content">blood alcohol</a> reading was 0.128, a level which, according to the <a href="University%20of%20Notre%20Dame">University of Notre Dame</a>, would have caused "significant impairment of motor coordination and loss of good judgment". There was no doubt that Leigh was violently sexually assaulted before she was murdered, and the evidence indicated that prior to the night of her murder she had not had sexual intercourse. Leigh had deep bruising to the left wall of her vagina, extensive bruising to her <a href="hymen">hymen</a> and two tears, one long, to her vulva. An analysis of the postmortem by Dr Johan Duflou, deputy director of the New South Wales Institute of Forensic Medicine, stated that an inflexible object, possibly a beer bottle, was likely to have caused most of her genital injuries. No semen was found in her body.

Twenty detectives, led by Detective Sergeant Lance Chaffey, were assigned to the case though the squad was reduced to fewer than ten members several weeks later. Crime reporter <a href="Mark%20Riley%20%28journalist%29">Mark Riley</a> wrote that police were going through the "exhaustive process" of cross-checking the stories of several dozen teenagers; by 5 November police had interviewed around 40 teenagers, stating they expected to interview around 20 more. The three suspects who emerged early in the investigation were Matthew Webster, Guy Wilson and NC1. In interviews on 5 November, NC1 admitted to having sex with Leigh, but said it was consensual. Wilson initially denied any wrongdoing, though in a later interview he admitted to pushing Leigh, pouring beer over her, spitting on her and throwing an empty beer bottle at her. Webster admitted to pouring beer on Leigh, but denied sexually assaulting or killing her. He originally told police he went to a <a href="pub">pub</a> after the party, but in an interview eight days later changed his story to state that he had gone for a walk. Webster also stated that two 14-year-old girls had approached him and NC1 at the party, asking for some "hash", and that the two of them had obtained a small bag of <a href="Hashish">resin</a> and exchanged it with the girls for $20. Blood samples were taken from two suspects; "<a href="The%20Newcastle%20Herald">The Newcastle Herald</a>" reported this as probably the first use of DNA tests in a <a href="Hunter%20Region">Hunter Valley</a> murder investigation. Clothing samples were also taken from several suspects.

In her book "Who Killed Leigh Leigh?", Kerry Carrington, a <a href="Criminology">criminologist</a> and prominent researcher of the murder, described the investigation as being "fuelled by mutual suspicion and by rumour and counter-rumour". People who attended the party complained of living in fear of being the next rumoured killer; Matthew Webster, Jason Robertson and two other boys appeared on the front page of "The Newcastle Herald" on 8 November with such complaints. For a time the most popular rumour was that Leigh had been murdered by her stepfather, and that he had been having sex with her for months. In November 1990 Detective Chaffey told journalist Mark Riley that police had heard this rumour so many times that they considered Shearman to be a suspect. Riley's article stated that the community of Stockton harboured suspicions about Shearman right until Webster was charged with murder. On 16 November Webster pleaded guilty to assaulting Leigh and to supplying cannabis resin to a minor. He was released on bail, with his sentencing scheduled for 21 February 1990. On 19 January Wilson pleaded guilty to assaulting Leigh; he was released on bail pending sentencing. On 28 January, upon being taunted by four boys regarding the murder, Webster assaulted one of them. On 31 January, Brad Shearman approached Guy Wilson in public, and punched him in the head three times after Wilson allegedly told him he would get Leigh's younger sister next. Shearman was charged and pleaded guilty to assault.

While he was still on bail on 16 February 1990, during his third interview with police, Webster admitted to killing Leigh. In the interview transcript, Webster initially denied killing Leigh, then "without being asked a further question" he stated, "Well, I did it. But I just can't believe ... it happened. It's just unbelievable." Webster went on to state that he saw Leigh while he was looking for his stash of beers. According to Webster, they walked to the saltbushes together, where he pulled off her clothes and stuck a finger in her vagina. Webster stated he lost his temper when Leigh rebuffed him, choking her for a while before killing her with a rock, specifically saying he killed Leigh because he "thought she would squeal on [him] for trying to rape her". After spending the weekend in a police cell, Webster appeared in court on 19 February where he was refused bail. On 21 March, while in custody, Webster was convicted and fined $250 for offensive behaviour in the 28 January assault. On 17 July Shearman was given a 12-month good behaviour bond for the 31 January assault; the judge did not record a conviction, taking into consideration that he had been provoked into attacking Wilson.

NC1 was the first to be sentenced, on 28 February 1990, after pleading guilty to having sex with someone under the <a href="age%20of%20consent">age of consent</a>. He was given six months' custody in a detention centre, the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence. Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, writing in "<a href="The%20Australian%20Feminist%20Law%20Journal">The Australian Feminist Law Journal</a>", said it was likely that prosecutors did not charge NC1 with rape, as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely due to a lack of evidence; Leigh's complaints about the incident as reported by witnesses were <a href="hearsay">hearsay</a> and therefore inadmissible in court. On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours' community service. In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual, and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody. A number of sources state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way the evidence was presented to the court.

On 19 March 1990 Wilson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for assaulting Leigh.

Charges were initially laid against Webster for sexual assault, though by the time the case went to trial they had been dropped without public explanation. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong, writing in "<a href="The%20Australian%20Feminist%20Law%20Journal">The Australian Feminist Law Journal</a>", stated it was likely that Webster was offered a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a> that would drop the lesser charges in exchange for his guilty plea for murder. Webster pleaded guilty to Leigh's murder on 24 October 1990. The guilty plea meant that no witnesses were called for the trial; Detective Chaffey instead read a list of facts to the court. Justice <a href="James%20Roland%20Wood">James Roland Wood</a> sentenced Webster to a minimum of 14 years in prison, with an additional six years during which he would be eligible for parole, saying that a <a href="life%20imprisonment">life sentence</a> was inappropriate in view of Webster's potential to be rehabilitated. Wood found that Webster's motivation for killing Leigh was his fear she would report his sexual assault. Five Stockton citizens volunteered to give <a href="character%20evidence">character evidence</a> at his trial, describing the teenager as a quiet "gentle giant" from a good family. Others expressed amazement at this description of Webster, who was also known as "fat Matt, the thug of Stockton". Webster served his sentence at <a href="Parklea%20Correctional%20Centre">Parklea Correctional Centre</a>.

While acknowledging that plea bargains such as the one Webster was probably offered are common and help avoid expensive and time-consuming trials, Byrne-Armstrong stated that accepting Webster's confession helped create a <a href="legal%20fiction">legal fiction</a> that he unquestionably acted alone in both sexually assaulting and murdering Leigh. The actual level of sexual violence that Leigh sustained was accordingly, she said, "all but erased" from the sentencing, and it appeared Justice Wood had only been given the limited information from the post-mortem report that would have corroborated Webster's confession.

Webster was the first person in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> to be sentenced under the "<a href="truth%20in%20sentencing">truth in sentencing</a>" legislation, which meant he could not be released under any circumstances before the end of his 14-year non-parole period; under the previous legislation a person of Webster's age would probably have been released after only nine years. Webster appealed the length of his prison term to the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Court%20of%20Criminal%20Appeal">New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal</a>, where Justices Gleeson, Lee and Allen dismissed his appeal in July 1992. In their view the crime was "so gross that nothing less of a very severe sentence would accord with the general moral sense of the community".

Webster's first application for parole in February 2004 was denied as he had not yet undertaken <a href="work%20release">work release</a>. After completing a few months of this program, Webster was released on parole on 10 June 2004 after serving 14½ years. The conditions of his parole specified that he would only be allowed to visit <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> or Stockton with permission from his probation and parole officer. Webster's parole was discussed in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Parliament of New South Wales</a>, with Minister <a href="John%20Hatzistergos">John Hatzistergos</a> responding to queries and concluding that the option to supervise Webster's re-integration into society was better than the alternative of releasing him without supervision at the end of his sentence. Following his release, Leigh's family stated they harboured "no ill thoughts" towards Webster and wished him well in the "re-establishment of his life". Webster's parole was revoked in November 2004 after he was arrested for assault; he pleaded not guilty, citing self-defence. He was released from prison in May 2005 after the charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence.

Leigh's death received widespread and ongoing coverage in both the Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her <a href="reduplication">reduplicated</a> name. Between 1989 and 1994, "The Newcastle Herald" ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being referred to as a "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, stating "I think one of the main things is that people can identify with people involved. Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed I think it would be long forgotten."

Various sources considered the media coverage prior to Webster's arrest to be focused on finding something to blame other than her murderer. After Webster's arrest the media continued to search for any outside agency that might have been responsible for the event. From the beginning, media reports highlighted the lack of parental supervision at the party, and in sentencing Webster, Justice Wood made comments criticising the lack of parental supervision. Researchers Jonathan Morrow and Mehera San Roque in the "<a href="Sydney%20Law%20Review">Sydney Law Review</a>" wrote that Wood's comments "might as well have been quoted from the very newspapers that were covering the crime"; his comments, in turn, were heavily reported in the media. Webster's sentencing also received considerable media coverage, possibly due to his youth and the length of his sentence, as well as curiosity about the newly established "truth-in-sentencing" principles. His appeal regarding the length of his sentence received similar coverage.

According to observations by Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, media references to Leigh being sexually assaulted "almost completely disappeared" in less than a year, as did the references to her being assaulted by the group of boys. They stated that the fact that NC1 was not charged with raping Leigh had created the legal fiction that his sex with her was consensual. The "unsustainable assumption" that Leigh consented to sex was the turning point in her being blamed for her own assault and murder on the grounds that, because she was supposedly sexually promiscuous, Leigh had somehow "asked for [the attack]". In addition to sexual promiscuity and the lack of parental supervision, Carrington states that media attention also shifted to the presence of drugs and alcohol at the party; Morrow and San Roque credit media attention to these factors as taking attention away from the abuse that Leigh suffered before she died. The epithet "<a href="slut">slut</a>" in a pretrial psychological report also became a topic of focus for the media:

Carrington accused the media of completely missing the point that the report was not stating the views of the psychiatrist, rather it was the psychiatrist's interpretation of Webster's feelings. She also considered Mark Riley's extended coverage of the case, which she described at one point as "journalistic <a href="voyeurism">voyeurism</a>", to be the most profound case of shifting the blame from the assailants to Leigh herself. One of Riley's articles in particular was considered by her to have suggested that Leigh's discussions with her mother about sex and Leigh's looks and physical development had contributed to her murder. Morrow and San Roque also criticised Riley's article, stating it "disturbingly ... married parental blame with the well-documented notion that the rape victim herself is presumably to blame for her attack". Several writers, including <a href="Eva%20Cox">Eva Cox</a> and <a href="Adele%20Horin">Adele Horin</a>, rejected the concept that Leigh was in any way responsible for her sexual assault and murder. The media coverage of the murder has been considered by multiple sources to be part of a wider culture of <a href="victim%20blaming">victim blaming</a>.

Police were criticised over their handling of the investigation, including their failure to identify perpetrators in a timely manner. It took police over three months to press charges against Webster even though they had established within ten days that he had lied about his whereabouts, had publicly stated his intention to rape Leigh, and had the opportunity to commit the crime.

Criticism was also raised regarding the relatively few convictions. Despite several people's admissions to police that they physically attacked Leigh at the party, only Wilson was charged with assault, and the adult who admitted to supplying her with alcohol prior to the party was never charged. NC1 admitted to having sex with another under-age girl at the party, though he was not charged with that offence. With the exception of the charges against Webster that were dropped without explanation, nobody was ever charged with raping or sexually assaulting Leigh in spite of the presence of graphic forensic evidence of genital injuries. During a report on "<a href="Radio%20National">Radio National</a>", Leigh's mother said that when she asked Detective Chaffey why others were not being charged, he asked her if she knew "how much it costs to run an investigation".

Police took blood and clothing samples from suspects, including the shirt Wilson was wearing on the night of the murder, which he admitted had a bloodstain on it, but it is not known whether any DNA tests were carried out. Kerry Carrington speculated that the reports of evidence being sent for testing may have been a fabrication to obtain a confession. Leigh's grandmother told Carrington that she called <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> to enquire about the results, as a detective on the case had informed Leigh's family that this was where the suspects' clothing had been sent. Scotland Yard informed her that they had not received anything from Australia for forensic testing in the relevant timespan.

The only record of forensic testing that has been uncovered is an acknowledgement by a forensic biologist of four items being received for testing on 6 November 1989: three items of Leigh's clothing, and the blood-stained rock found near her body. The acknowledgement, however, indicates that other items were not sent for testing. Results from the supposed tests were never made available, nor was information on why the other items were not sent. According to Carrington, four years after the investigation a detective involved in the case told her that none of the samples taken from suspects were tested. Samples taken from Webster were not used in his prosecution. Professor Harry Boettcher, a forensic scientist, said that if police did not actually test the samples it would be "professional negligence – indefensible". In 2009 a solicitor who acted on behalf of Leigh's family stated that given the advances in <a href="DNA">DNA</a> testing technology, it was time to re-examine the evidence.

Several factors have led to speculation that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh with his left hand as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets to the other side of the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.

Carrington and Johnson speculated that Leigh was assaulted by the group of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others because they were afraid she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the media about the murder for the first time in 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.

After being told that nobody was going to be charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a campaign for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20into%20the%20New%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Service">Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service</a>, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.

In May 1993 a victim's compensation case had awarded Leigh's mother and sister a combined total of $29,214. An appeal, aided by Carrington's research, was lodged against the original victim's compensation payout. In May 1995, in a landmark legal decision, Judge Joseph Moore approved the appeal, awarding Leigh's mother and sister an additional $134,048. Moore said the evidence indicated that Leigh rejected NC1's sexual advances, and that "his intercourse with her was without her consent." He also acknowledged that whoever sexually assaulted Leigh had never been brought to justice, and the lack of convictions for assault, specifically naming Jason Robertson and three other boys as those who assaulted her in addition to Webster and Wilson. Leigh's mother abandoned her efforts to have the case re-opened in 1997, citing "exhaustion and survival".

In October 1996, Police Minister <a href="Paul%20Whelan">Paul Whelan</a> made an announcement in the Parliament of New South Wales, stating that the murder would be reviewed by the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Crime%20Commission">New South Wales Crime Commission</a>. Acknowledging that nobody had ever been charged with Leigh's sexual assault, Whelan stated the upcoming review was "our one opportunity to right the terrible wrongs that occurred on the night that Leigh died".

In March 1998 the Crime Commission released its findings, stating that the crimes that resulted in convictions occurred substantially in the way described to the courts, that no further charges would be laid as Webster had acted alone in both the murder and the assault that immediately preceded it, and that police had not acted inappropriately in their decision not to charge other persons. It did, however, criticise some police procedures and practices. The review did not comment on the discrepancies between Webster's confession and the forensic evidence, and it did not clarify whether forensic evidence was ever sent for testing. A representative for the Commission refused to comment on whether Wilson's blood-stained shirt was ever tested. One expert opinion obtained by the Commission wrote that it was "likely [Webster] engaged in sexual behaviour which demeaned Leigh and to which he will never admit because he is ashamed and embarrassed", and Dr Johan Duflou said that a finger or penis was unlikely to have caused Leigh's severe genital damage. Hillary Byrne-Armstrong stated that these expert opinions, which contradict Webster's confession, raised questions on how the Commission concluded that Leigh's sexual assault occurred in the manner to which he had confessed, also raising doubts about several of the Commission's other findings. The Crime Commission released one of their two reports on the matter; their second unpublished report was handed over to the <a href="Police%20Integrity%20Commission">Police Integrity Commission</a> (PIC) for investigation.

Twenty-six people, mainly police officers, were interviewed in 1998 as part of the subsequent PIC inquiry. Several witnesses from the party, as well as Webster, Wilson and NC1 were also questioned. The inquiry heard allegations that police assaulted four people during interviews: Webster, Wilson, NC1 and another unnamed suspect referred to as NC5, a relative of Webster who was 17 at the time of the murder. Admitting to the inquiry that he killed Leigh and insisting that he was alone in doing so, Webster stated that police repeatedly punched and kicked him when he refused to confess to her murder. According to Scott Tucker writing in "The Newcastle Herald", police were also accused of threatening violence, falsifying reports and withholding evidence; one of the officers being investigated had his police locker raided by <a href="Internal%20affairs%20%28law%20enforcement%29">internal affairs</a>, who discovered several records on the murder that had previously been listed as missing. Carrington was also summoned to give evidence, though she was not informed why; her book, "Who Killed Leigh Leigh", which criticised police over their handling of the investigation, had been released earlier that year. Carrington was cross-examined for three days, longer than any of the police officers who were questioned, in what was described by Hillary Byrne-Armstrong as "an inquisition on just about every word she had spoken [or] written" in relation to Leigh's murder". Byrne-Armstrong accused the PIC of summoning Carrington for the sole purpose of attacking her credibility on issues they had no intention of investigating, and to discredit someone who had attracted considerable media attention for criticising police.

The PIC released their review in October 2000. The review recommended the dismissal of Detective Sergeant Chaffey for "gross dereliction" of duty, also recommending criminal charges against five other investigative officers. The review stated that Webster was falsely arrested, as police arrested him for the purpose of questioning, something for which they did not have the power, and that he was probably assaulted by police while he was in custody. Police received further criticism after it was uncovered that they had interviewed NC1 without contacting his parents, and did not question him about Leigh's murder, only about his intercourse with her. Following the review, Chaffey retired "a little earlier than [he] intended", but dismissed the review's findings, stating he was proud of his team's performance. In October 2001, the <a href="Director%20of%20Public%20Prosecutions%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Director of Public Prosecutions</a> declined to press criminal charges against any of the officers, on the grounds they had suffered emotional hardship and their careers had already been destroyed. The case, which was described on "<a href="PM%20%28ABC%20Radio%29">PM</a>" as "one of the longest ever investigations into police conduct in New South Wales", prompted changes in the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Police%20Force">New South Wales Police Force</a>, including the reform of record-keeping procedures.

Newcastle's Freewheels Theatre commissioned <a href="Nick%20Enright">Nick Enright</a> to produce a play that explored themes around the rape and murder. Titled "A Property of the Clan", it premiered at the Freewheels Theatre in Newcastle in 1992, and was performed at the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">National Institute of Dramatic Art</a> in 1993. The title was taken from the controversial quote in the psychological report on Webster made in preparation for his trial. Enright omitted the criminal acts and the murder from the play, instead focusing on the drama, its participants and the aftermath of the murder. The play was shown at various high schools in the Newcastle area, and following its positive reception was shown at high schools nationally, winning several awards. However, Newcastle High School, where both Leigh and Webster had been students, declined to show it. The play is set in the fictional town of Blackrock, and the rape and murder victim is named Tracy. Leigh's family requested that the name be changed, as 'Tracey' was the name of Leigh's cousin and best friend. The name remained, despite other revisions to the script; the play was retitled "<a href="Blackrock%20%28play%29">Blackrock</a>". It was performed by the <a href="Sydney%20Theatre%20Company">Sydney Theatre Company</a> in 1995 and 1996.

"Blackrock" was developed into a <a href="Blackrock%20%28film%29">film of the same name</a>, which was partially filmed in Stockton and released in 1997. The community of Stockton opposed filming in the area, stating the memories of the events were still fresh and the details of the script were "too close for comfort". When filmmakers arrived in Stockton the local media treated them with hostility, and locations that had previously been reserved were no longer available. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite the choice of Stockton for filming. Leigh's family were opposed to the film, saying the filmmakers were "feasting on an unfortunate situation" and portraying Leigh negatively. Associate professor Donna Lee Brien of <a href="Central%20Queensland%20University">Central Queensland University</a> stated that some fictional aspects in the film portrayed Leigh in a negative manner, though the book "Reel Tracks" by Rebecca Doyle credited the film with correcting misinformation reported in the media regarding the murder, as well as with providing a forum for reflection on the events. The film received a mixed-to-positive reception in Australia, but performed poorly when shown elsewhere; Brien stated that because the film lacked the "poignant and powerful narrative support of Leigh's tragedy", it was deemed by critics to be "shallow and clichéd".

Agaricus deserticola

Agaricus deserticola, commonly known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Agaricaceae">Agaricaceae</a>. Found only in southwestern and western North America, "A. deserticola" is adapted for growth in dry or <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a> habitats. The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are <a href="secotioid">secotioid</a>, meaning the <a href="spore">spore</a>s are not forcibly discharged, and the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> does not fully expand. Unlike other "<a href="Agaricus">Agaricus</a>" species, "A. deserticola" does not develop true <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a>, but rather a convoluted and <a href="anastomosis">networked</a> system of <a href="spore">spore</a>-producing tissue called a <a href="gleba">gleba</a>. When the <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.

The fruit bodies can reach heights of tall with caps that are up to wide. The tough woody <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> are wide, thickening towards the base. Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground in fields, grasslands, or arid ecosystems. Other mushrooms with which "A. deserticola" might be confused include the <a href="desert%20fungi">desert fungus</a> species "<a href="Podaxis%20pistillaris">Podaxis pistillaris</a>" and "<a href="Montagnea%20arenaria">Montagnea arenaria</a>". The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of "Agaricus deserticola" mushrooms is not known definitively. Formerly named "Longula texensis" (among several other <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>), the fungus was transferred to the genus "Agaricus" in 2004 after <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis showed it to be closely related to species in that genus. In 2010, its <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> was changed to "deserticola" after it was discovered that the name "Agaricus texensis" was <a href="Illegitimate%20name">illegitimate</a>, having been previously published for a different species.

The species was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> scientifically as "Secotium texense" by <a href="Miles%20Joseph%20Berkeley">Miles Joseph Berkeley</a> and <a href="Moses%20Ashley%20Curtis">Moses Ashley Curtis</a> in 1873, based on specimens sent to them from western Texas. <a href="George%20Edward%20Massee">George Edward Massee</a> transferred it to the genus "Gyrophragmium" in 1891, because of its resemblance to the species "<a href="Gyrophragmium%20delilei">Gyrophragmium delilei</a>", and because he felt that the structure of the volva as well as the internal <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of the gleba excluded it from "Secotium". In 1916, <a href="William%20Alphonso%20Murrill">William Murrill</a> listed the species in "<a href="Gymnopus">Gymnopus</a>", but did not explain the reason for the generic transfer. In a 1943 publication, <a href="Sanford%20Myron%20Zeller">Sanford Zeller</a> compared a number of similar <a href="secotioid">secotioid</a> genera: "<a href="Galeropsis">Galeropsis</a>", "<a href="Gyrophragmium">Gyrophragmium</a>" and "<a href="Montagnea">Montagnea</a>". He concluded that the species did not fit in the limits set for the genus "Gyrophragmium" and so created the new genus "Longia" with "Longia texensis" as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. The generic name was to honor <a href="William%20Henry%20Long">William Henry Long</a>, an American mycologist noted for his work in describing <a href="Gasteromycetes">Gasteromycetes</a>. Zeller also mentioned two additional <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>: "Secotium decipiens" (<a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Peck</a>, 1895), and "Podaxon strobilaceous" (<a href="Edwin%20Bingham%20Copeland">Copeland</a>, 1904).

Two years later in 1945, Zeller pointed out that the use of the name "Longia" was untenable, as it had already been used for a genus of <a href="rust%20%28fungus%29">rusts</a> described by <a href="Hans%20Sydow">Hans Sydow</a> in 1921, so he proposed the name "Longula" and introduced the new combination "Longula texensis" in addition to "L. texensis" var. "major". The species was known by this name for about 60 years, until a 2004 <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> study revealed the taxon's close evolutionary relationship with "<a href="Agaricus">Agaricus</a>", a possibility insinuated by <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> a century before. This resulted in a new name in that genus, but it soon came to light that the name "Agaricus texensis" had already been used, ironically enough, by Berkeley and Curtis themselves in 1853, for a taxon now treated as a synonym of "<a href="Flammulina%20velutipes">Flammulina velutipes</a>". Since this made the new "Agaricus texensis" an <a href="homonym%20%28biology%29">unusable homonym</a>, Gabriel Moreno and colleagues published the <a href="nomen%20novum">new name</a> "Agaricus deserticola" in 2010. The mushroom is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the gasteroid Agaricus.

The <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a> of "Agaricus deserticola" has been under debate since the taxon was first described. It was thought by some mycologists to be a member of the <a href="Gasteromycetes">Gasteromycetes</a>, a grouping of fungi in the basidiomycota that do not <a href="ballistospore">actively discharge</a> their spores. The Gasteromycetes are now known to be an artificial assemblage of <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> similar fungi without any unifying <a href="monophyly">evolutionary relationship</a>. When the species was known as a "Gyrophragmium", Fischer thought it to be close to "Montagnites", a genus he considered a member of the family <a href="Agaricaceae">Agaricaceae</a>. Conrad suggested a relationship with "Secotium", which he believed to be close to "Agaricus". <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> said of "Gyrophragmium": "[it] has no place in the Gasteromycetes. Its relations are more close to the Agarics. It is the connecting link between the two passing on one hand through "Secotium" to the true Gasteromycetes." <a href="Elizabeth%20Eaton%20Morse">Elizabeth Eaton Morse</a> believed that "Gyrophragmium" and the <a href="secotioid">secotioid</a> genus "<a href="Endoptychum">Endoptychum</a>" formed a transition between the Gasteromycetes and the <a href="Hymenomycetes">Hymenomycetes</a> (the gilled fungi).

The species is now thought to have evolved from an "Agaricus" ancestor, and adapted for survival in dry habitats. These adaptations include: a cap that does not expand (thus conserving moisture); dark-colored gills that do not forcibly eject spores (a mechanism known to depend on <a href="turgor%20pressure">turgor pressure</a> achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments); and a <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that remains on the fruit body long after it has matured. This form of growth is called <a href="secotioid">secotioid</a> development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi like "<a href="Battarrea%20phalloides">Battarrea phalloides</a>", "<a href="Podaxis%20pistillaris">Podaxis pistillaris</a>", and "<a href="Montagnea%20arenaria">Montagnea arenaria</a>". <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> analysis based on the sequences of the partial <a href="60S">large subunit</a> of <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> and of the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal transcribed spacer</a>s shows that "A. deserticola" is closely related to but distinct from "<a href="Agaricus%20aridicola">A. aridicola</a>". A separate analysis showed "A. deserticola" to be closely related to "<a href="Agaricus%20arvensis">A. arvensis</a>" and "<a href="Agaricus%20abruptibulbus">A. abruptibulbus</a>".

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> of "Agaricus deserticola" can grow up to in height. Fresh specimens are usually white, but will age to a pale <a href="tan%20%28color%29">tan</a>; dried fruit bodies are light gray or tan mixed with some yellow. The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is in diameter, initially conic, later becoming convex to broadly convex as it matures. The cap is composed of three distinct tissue layers: an outer <a href="volva%20%28mycology%29">volval</a> layer, a middle cuticular layer (<a href="pileipellis">cutis</a>), and an inner (<a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">tramal</a>) layer which supports the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>. The surface of the cap is white with yellow-brown to brown-tipped raised small scales; these scales result from the breakup of the volva and the cutis.

Initially, the caps are covered by a <a href="peridium">peridium</a>—an outer covering layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, the lower part of the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">lamellae</a>, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.

The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is cylindrical, long and thick. It is shaped like a narrow club, and the base may reach widths up to . It is typically white, staining yellow to orange-yellow or pink when bruised, and becomes woody with age. Mature specimens develop longitudinal grooves in maturity. Numerous white <a href="rhizoid">rhizoid</a>s are present at the base of the stem; these root-like outgrowths of fungal <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> help the mushroom attach to its <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. The apex of the stem extends into the gleba to form a "columella" that reaches the top of the cap. The internal gills are free from attachment to the stem, but are attached full-length to the inside of the cap. The <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> is thick, white, and often sloughs off as the cap expands.

A larger <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of the mushroom has been described by Zeller, "A. deserticola" var. "major" (originally "Longula texensis" var. "major"), whose range overlaps that of the typical variety. Its caps are scalier than the typical variety, and range from or more in diameter, with a stem and up to thick.

In deposit, such as with a <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>, the <a href="spore">spore</a>s appear almost black, tinged with purple. The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a <a href="germ%20pore">germ pore</a>. They are <a href="nonamyloid">nonamyloid</a> (not absorbing <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when <a href="staining">stained</a> with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5–7.5 by 5.5–6.5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the <a href="basidium">basidium</a> (the spore-bearing cell) through the <a href="sterigma">sterigma</a>. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other "Agaricus" species, the spores of "A. deserticola" are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.

Schaeffer's <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical test</a> is often used to help identify and differentiate "Agaricus" species. In this test, <a href="aniline">aniline</a> plus <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> are applied to the surface of the fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms. "Agaricus deserticola" has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Arvensis" in the genus "Agaricus".

Species that resemble "A. deserticola" include the <a href="desert%20fungi">desert fungi</a> "<a href="Montagnea%20arenaria">Montagnea arenaria</a>" and "<a href="Podaxis%20pistillaris">Podaxis pistillaris</a>". "Montagnea arenaria" is a whitish stalked <a href="puffball">puffball</a> with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva at the base of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. "Podaxis pistillaris" has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.

The <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a> of the fruit bodies of "Agaricus deserticola" is not known definitively, and there are conflicting opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided. However, one popular <a href="field%20guide">field guide</a> to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.

In one early study of the mushroom's development, the fruit bodies appeared above the surface of the ground two or three days after rainfall or an irrigation, and required between five and eight days to mature. Slender and fragile <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s—dense masses of <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e that form root-like structures—grow horizontally below the soil surface. Fruit bodies start as enlarged tips on the rhizomorphs, and manifest as numerous small, almost-spherical protuberances just beneath the surface of the soil. When the fruit bodies reach a diameter of about , the stem and peridial regions begin to be distinguishable; the peridial region first appears as a small swelling at the apex of the much larger stem regions.

The fruit bodies push upward through the soil when they are about tall. As growth progresses, the stem elongates and the peridium becomes more rounded, increasing in size until maturity. At about the time the peridium reaches or slightly more in diameter, the columella exerts an upward tension on the tissue of the <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a>, and it begins to pull away from the stem. Typically, the veil tissue is weakest near the attachment to the stem, rather than to the attachment at the edge of the peridium, and the veil separates from the stem. The lower edge of the peridium is further stretched as it is pulled upward and outward. Usually, the arid environment causes the gleba to dry out rapidly. If the veil tissue at the base of the stem is stronger than that attached to the edge of the peridium, the veil can rip so it remains attached to the stem as a <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a>. Scales begin to appear on the surface of the peridium of some specimens at about this time.
Like other "Agaricus" species, "A. deserticola" is <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a>—feeding off dead or decaying organic matter. The fruit bodies are found growing singly to sometimes more numerous, at low elevations, and typically in sandy soil. 
The species' usual habitats include drylands, <a href="coastal%20sage%20scrub">coastal sage scrub</a>, and desert ecosystems. It also grows in lawns and fields. The range of the fungus is restricted to southwestern and western North America, where it fruits throughout the year, typically during or following cold, wet weather. Zeller gives a range that includes as its eastern border central Texas, and extends westward to <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego County, California</a>, and north to <a href="Josephine%20County%2C%20Oregon">Josephine County, Oregon</a>. The mushroom used to be common in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20area">San Francisco Bay area</a> before land development reduced its preferred habitats. "A. deserticola" has been collected in several states in northwestern Mexico, including <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>, <a href="Chihuahua%20%28state%29">Chihuahua</a>, and <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>.

21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry

The 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was an <a href="infantry">infantry</a> <a href="regiment">regiment</a> in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. It was organized in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester, Massachusetts</a> and mustered into service on August 23, 1861.

After garrison duty at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, the regiment served with the <a href="Burnside%20Expedition">Coast Division</a> commanded by <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Maj. Gen.</a> <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>. The Coast Division was deployed in January 1862 for operations on the coast of North Carolina, and participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Roanoke%20Island">Battle of Roanoke Island</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Bern">Battle of New Bern</a> among other engagements. Burnside's division was recalled to Virginia in July 1862. The 21st Massachusetts was then attached to the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> and participated in several of the largest battles of the Civil War, including the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a>, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>. The most devastating engagement of the war for the 21st was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chantilly">Battle of Chantilly</a>, fought on September 1, 1862, during which the unit suffered 35 percent casualties. From March 1863 to January 1864, the 21st served with Burnside in the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Ohio">Department of the Ohio</a>, seeing action in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee. In May 1864, the regiment rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Lt. Gen.</a> <a href="Ulysses%20Grant">Ulysses Grant's</a> <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>. The regiment was a favorite of <a href="Clara%20Barton">Clara Barton</a>, the famed battlefield nurse, who was also from <a href="Worcester%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester County, Massachusetts</a>.

By the end of its three years of service, the 21st Massachusetts had been reduced from 1,000 men to fewer than 100. Of these losses, 152 were killed in action or died from wounds received in action, approximately 400 were discharged due to wounds, 69 were taken prisoner, and approximately 300 were discharged due to disease, resignation, or desertion. Those of the 21st who chose to re-enlist at the end of their initial three-year commitment were eventually consolidated with the 36th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry on October 21, 1864.

Following the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a> on July 21, 1861 (the first major engagement of the war and a disastrous defeat for the untested Union army), citizens of the northern states began to realize that the Civil War would not end quickly. Additional troops would be needed beyond the <a href="75%2C000%20volunteers">75,000 volunteers</a> that had been called out for 90 days of service. As a result, over the summer of 1861, volunteers rushed to enlist for a term of three years. The 21st Massachusetts was among the "three year regiments" organized after the First Battle of Bull Run.

The regiment was formed during July and August 1861. The designated camp of assembly was the Agricultural Fair Grounds in Worcester. The majority of the companies were from Worcester County with nearly every town in that county represented on the regiment's rolls. <a href="Hampden%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Hampden</a>, <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Hampshire</a>, and <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Massachusetts">Franklin</a> Counties were also represented.

The first commanding officer of the 21st was <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Col.</a> Augustus Morse, who was involved in the comb making industry in <a href="Leominster%2C%20Massachusetts">Leominster, Massachusetts</a> and had been a major general in the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia prior to the war. According to Charles Walcott, the regimental historian, despite Morse's decades of experience with the State Militia, he was, "entirely destitute of soldierly enthusiasm or spirit, wonderfully ignorant of military drill and maneuvres, and a wretched disciplinarian."

The regiment, originally numbering slightly more than 1,000 men, departed Worcester on August 23, 1861. They were armed with inferior <a href="smoothbore">smoothbore</a> <a href="musket">musket</a>s that had been converted from <a href="flintlock">flintlock</a> to <a href="percussion%20lock">percussion lock</a>. After a brief, but tense, three-day encampment in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, the regiment moved to the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in <a href="Annapolis%2C%20Maryland">Annapolis, Maryland</a>, arriving on August 30. The regiment garrisoned the Naval Academy for four months. It was a comfortable post. <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Maj.</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Clark">William S. Clark</a> of the 21st wrote that the regiment was "delightfully situated, enjoying the very romance of war."

During their stay in Annapolis, the men of 21st assisted in the escape of a slave belonging to Maryland Governor <a href="Thomas%20Holliday%20Hicks">Thomas Holliday Hicks</a>. While the slave was hidden in a chimney in one of the Naval Academy barracks, Governor Hicks's repeated demands for his return were refused by the officers of the regiment.

On December 20, 1861, the 21st was assigned to the Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. <a href="Ambrose%20Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a> for operations in North Carolina. The 21st was the first regiment selected by <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brig. Gen.</a> <a href="Jesse%20Reno">Jesse Reno</a> for his brigade. The 21st Massachusetts would gain a great respect and affection for Reno, who first led their brigade and later the IX Corps of which the 21st was a part.

As the regiment prepared for departure, Colonel Augustus Morse decided to remain at the Naval Academy, feeling that garrison duty was, according to historian James Bowen, "more to his taste." <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lt. Col.</a> Albert Maggi, an Italian by birth who had served under <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>, took command of the regiment on January 2, 1862. Maggi had been openly insubordinate to Morse due to the latter's lack of military discipline. His assumption of command, as well as the issue of new <a href="Pattern%201853%20Enfield">Enfield</a> rifled muskets, improved the morale of the regiment.

The 21st, about 960 strong, boarded the steamer "Northerner" on January 6, 1862. The fleet transporting Burnside's North Carolina Expedition encountered harsh weather off the coast of Cape Hatteras. Prolonged poor weather and the shallowness of <a href="Hatteras%20Inlet">Hatteras Inlet</a> resulted in weeks of delay as the fleet struggled to enter <a href="Pamlico%20Sound">Pamlico Sound</a>. Finally, just as most of the vessels began to run low on potable water, the fleet entered the sound and made for <a href="Roanoke%20Island">Roanoke Island</a> on February 5, 1862.

Maj. Gen. <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> had ordered Burnside to make Roanoke Island his first target. Capture of the island would allow control of both Pamlico and <a href="Albemarle%20Sound">Albemarle</a> Sounds, opening up a possible southern invasion route to Richmond. Coordinating with a naval flotilla commanded by Admiral <a href="Louis%20M.%20Goldsborough">Louis M. Goldsborough</a>, Burnside launched an <a href="amphibious%20assault">amphibious assault</a> (one of the first of the Civil War) resulting in the Battle of Roanoke Island on February 7 and 8, 1862. After landing, the 21st spent a cold, wet night on picket duty. On February 8, it joined in the assault on the Confederate fort at the center of the island. Moving through swamps and knee-deep water, Reno's brigade, including the 21st, advanced around the Union left flank on the west side of the fort. After firing steadily on the fort for some time and taking moderate casualties, the 21st was ordered by Brig. Gen. Reno to storm the fort. According to the regimental historian, the 21st Massachusetts was the first regiment to mount the earthworks of the fort; however, the honor was also claimed by the <a href="9th%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">9th New York</a>. The Union forces were victorious in capturing the Confederate fort on Roanoke Island and took approximately 2,500 Confederate soldiers prisoner. The 21st suffered 13 killed and 44 wounded, or eight percent casualties, during the engagement.

After the battle, the 21st took up camp in the former Confederate fort, remaining there for nearly a month. During that time, Lt. Col. Maggi, determined to make the 21st as disciplined as a regiment of <a href="Regular%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">Regulars</a>, enforced stern standards for drill and dress parades. After the near mutiny of one company, Maggi submitted his resignation. Maj. William S. Clark, a professor of chemistry at <a href="Amherst%20College">Amherst College</a>, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assumed command of the regiment on February 28, 1862.

Burnside's next target, according to McClellan's orders, was the city of <a href="New%20Bern%2C%20North%20Carolina">New Bern, North Carolina</a>. The Coast Division boarded their transports on March 4, made their way up the <a href="Neuse%20River">Neuse River</a>, and disembarked about down river of New Bern on March 12. The 21st, numbering 675 men, led their brigade in the march on New Bern, discovering many abandoned fortifications. On March 14, the division participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Bern">Battle of New Bern</a>. The Confederate defenses were roughly centered on a brick yard converted into a makeshift fort. The 21st, approaching the enemy position, was soon ordered to assault the brick yard and the battery therein. Lt. Col. Clark led four companies of the 21st and temporarily occupied the brick yard. As they captured the battery, Clark stood atop one of the guns, urging his men forward. In their advanced position, the 21st suffered significant casualties and was soon forced to abandon the brickyard. However, the Union forces were eventually victorious, and the city of New Bern was captured. After the battle, Maj. Gen. Burnside presented the first cannon captured by the 21st to Amherst College in honor of <a href="First%20Lieutenant%23United%20States">1st Lt.</a> Frazar Stearns, son of the President of Amherst College, and <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> of the 21st, who was killed during the engagement. Lt. Col. Clark received a promotion to colonel for his conduct during the Battle of New Bern. The regiment suffered 58 casualties, or eight percent (23 killed, 35 wounded).

Following the engagement at New Bern, the 21st was among the regiments selected for an expedition to destroy the <a href="Dismal%20Swamp%20Canal">Dismal Swamp Canal</a> which would cripple the Confederacy's shipbuilding activities at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. A portion of Reno's brigade was transported by steamers to Camden County and engaged in the relatively minor <a href="Battle%20of%20South%20Mills">Battle of Camden</a> on April 19, 1862. The 21st, at this stage, numbered 500 men, having lost numerous soldiers to disease while in an unsanitary camp at New Bern. After the Battle of Camden, Reno eventually abandoned the expedition against the canal and the brigade returned to New Bern on April 22. In the course of the mission, the 21st Massachusetts had light casualties of three percent (four killed, 11 wounded, and one missing).

The Coast Division's next assignment was supposed to be the capture of <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>. However, the failure of McClellan's <a href="Peninsular%20Campaign">Peninsular Campaign</a> required the recall of the Coast Division to Virginia. The 21st broke their camp in New Bern and boarded schooners on July 2, 1862, while hearing conflicting rumors of McClellan's success or defeat. They arrived in <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>, on July 9.

During July, two additional divisions were consolidated under Maj. Gen. Burnside's command to form the <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28ACW%29">IX Corps</a>. At the beginning of August, Brig. Gen Jesse Reno assumed the command of the Corps and was ordered to support the advance of Maj. Gen. <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">John Pope's</a> <a href="Army%20of%20Virginia">Army of Virginia</a> towards <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>. The 21st, along with the rest of the Corps, was quickly transported to <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg</a> and then marched overland to join Pope's forces on August 14, 1862, in the vicinity of <a href="Culpeper%20Court%20House%2C%20Virginia">Culpeper Court House, Virginia</a>.

As <a href="General%20%28CSA%29">Gen.</a> <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> advanced on Pope's position along the <a href="Rapidan%20River">Rapidan River</a>, Pope quickly withdrew his army north. The brigade to which the 21st belonged, now commanded by Col. <a href="Edward%20Ferrero">Edward Ferrero</a>, frequently found itself in the position of rear guard during this movement, skirmishing with the advancing Confederate cavalry. By the time the 21st reached <a href="Warrenton%2C%20Virginia">Warrenton, Virginia</a>, on August 27, it was clear to the men that something was wrong. Pope was seen riding by the regiment, "looking warm and excited", and the men learned that <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28CSA%29">Lt. Gen.</a> <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Thomas Jackson</a> had flanked the Union army and was now in their rear.

The 21st, now numbering 425 men, crossed Bull Run on August 29 and discovered that Union forces had already engaged Jackson's men in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bull%20Run">Second Battle of Bull Run</a>. Just after noon, the 21st's brigade took up a position near the center of the Union lines. Over the course of the afternoon they witnessed several brigades advance into the woods in their front only to see them beaten back by the Confederates. Finally, the order came for Ferrero's brigade, including the 21st, to advance, unsupported, into the woods. As the brigade stepped off, Brig. Gen. Reno ordered it to halt and personally protested the order to Maj. Gen. Pope. The order was rescinded and, according to <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Capt.</a> Walcott of the 21st, "we thanked God that General Reno stood between us and General Pope."

After resting on their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light fighting in their front. Over the course of the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on <a href="Henry%20House%20Hill">Henry House Hill</a> to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the Union army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.

As the Union army retreated towards Washington, it paused to re-group at <a href="Centreville%2C%20Virginia">Centreville, Virginia</a>. On August 31, 1862, Gen. Lee ordered Lt. Gen. Jackson to flank the Union right and to cut the Union army off from Washington. This flanking effort resulted in the Battle of Chantilly which would prove to be the most disastrous engagement of the entire war for the 21st Massachusetts.

On September 1, the regiment, now numbering 400, marched northwest from Centreville with the rest of Ferrero's brigade. Although the men did not know it, they were among the handful of brigades chosen by Pope to deflect Jackson's flanking movement. Forming battle lines in a field not far from Chantilly Plantation, the 21st watched the <a href="51st%20New%20York%20Volunteer%20Infantry">51st New York</a> advance into thick woods to probe the enemy lines. Orders were soon given to Col. Clark to lead the 21st into the woods to support the 51st. The woods were very dense and the advance was disorderly. Making matters worse, a powerful thunderstorm burst out as the 21st entered the woodland. Unknowingly, the regiment obliqued far to the left and lost contact with the 51st New York. Encountering a body of troops in their front and unable to identify them through the torrential rain, Col. Clark presumed he had found the 51st, ordered the 21st to rest in place and sent officer <a href="Lt.%20Colonel%20Joseph%20Parker%20Rice">Lt. Colonel Joseph Parker Rice</a> forward to make contact. The troops were, in fact, men of <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early's</a> brigade and, before this could be ascertained, the Confederates unleashed a devastating volley on the unsuspecting 21st. "In the sudden anguish and despair of the moment," wrote Capt. Walcott, "the whole regiment seemed to be lying bleeding on the ground." Col. Clark immediately ordered a withdrawal and the 21st left more than 100 dead or wounded in the woods.

Reaching the open fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. <a href="Philip%20Kearny">Philip Kearny</a> to fill a hole in the center of the Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode out in front of the regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting warnings that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when most of the men around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst</a>.

Jackson's flanking maneuver was successfully deflected and the Battle of Chantilly was fought to a stalemate. But the 21st had suffered severely with 35 percent casualties (38 killed, 76 wounded, 26 missing).

Early in September 1862, the IX Corps, Reno commanding, returned to the Army of the Potomac. Gen. Lee, emboldened by his victories, invaded Maryland and McClellan moved the Army of the Potomac northwest from Washington to meet the Confederates. Portions of the armies clashed during the <a href="Battle%20of%20South%20Mountain">Battle of South Mountain</a>, during which the 21st played only a small part. Psychologically, however, it was a devastating fight in that it saw the death of Maj. Gen. Reno, who had been the 21st's brigade commander at the start of the war. "There was not a man in the 21st who did not love him," Capt. Walcott of the 21st wrote, "he always stood "with" his men in battle."

As McClellan's Army slowly advanced, Lee took up a defensive position in <a href="Sharpsburg%2C%20Maryland">Sharpsburg, Maryland</a>, along <a href="Antietam%20Creek">Antietam Creek</a>. The 21st, leaving two companies behind at South Mountain for guard detail, now numbered only 150 men. On September 16, the IX Corps took up a position on the left flank of the Union army, near a stone bridge soon to be known as <a href="Burnside%27s%20Bridge">Burnside's Bridge</a>.

The next day, McClellan began his attack with several advances by the Union right flank, far from the position of the 21st. For much of the day, the IX Corps could hear the fighting and awaited orders to take the bridge in their front. The 21st even was fortunate enough to have a mail call that morning, and the men sat down to read letters from home while fighting raged around the Dunker Church two miles (3 km) away. Finally, orders came at noon and Ferrero's brigade was moved closer to the bridge. It was a difficult target. On the opposite bank, a wooded bluff rose above the creek. Concealed there was a small force of 400 Confederates who would successfully hold thousands of Union troops at bay for hours. The men of the 21st watched several successive charges on the bridge by brigades of the IX Corps, all of which were repulsed. Finally, Ferrero's brigade was ordered forward. Reaching the bridge at a run, the 21st was ordered to take up a position next to the left abutment, supplying covering fire, while the 51st New York Infantry and the <a href="51st%20Pennsylvania%20Infantry">51st Pennsylvania Infantry</a> finally carried the position. As the Confederates retreated, Ferrero's brigade was soon stationed at the top of the bluff. Later in the afternoon, around sunset, a Confederate counterattack nearly drove the IX Corps back across Antietam Creek. Ferrero's brigade held the bluff, however, playing a key role in checking the counterattack, and taking severe casualties in the process. The 21st listed 10 killed and 35 wounded, casualties of 30 percent.

On November 7, 1862, Maj. Gen. McClellan was removed from command of the Army of the Potomac and replaced with Maj. Gen. Burnside. Over the course of November, Burnside moved the army south to <a href="Falmouth%2C%20Virginia">Falmouth, Virginia</a>, opposite the <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock River</a> from Fredericksburg. The 21st arrived in Falmouth on November 19. Nearly a month passed before Burnside could organize a crossing of the river and an assault on the city and the heights beyond. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a> took place on December 13, 1862.

The 21st crossed the Rappahannock on December 12 via the pontoon bridges that had been constructed by the Union army and spent the night along the west bank of the river. On the morning of the 13th, the regiment was ordered to the west part of the city, near the base of the heights. Here they removed the grey overcoats that had been issued to them for fear of being mistaken for Confederates. From this position, the 21st watched an assault by a portion of the II Corps over the open plain leading to heights and were shocked by the carnage that resulted from the failed attack. Just after this assault, Ferrero's brigade was ordered to attack the heights and the 21st formed a line of battle on the open ground slightly after noon. The 21st advanced, according to Walcott, "under the best directed artillery fire we had ever suffered or seen." Color bearers were repeatedly shot down. One, Sgt. <a href="Thomas%20Plunkett">Thomas Plunkett</a>, was hit by an artillery shell that took off his right arm and left hand. Despite his wounds, he managed to keep the colors from falling. The flag is today in the collection at the <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">Massachusetts State House</a> and still bears the stains from Plunkett's wounds. Plunkett was awarded the <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> for his bravery at Fredericksburg.

The 21st did not reach the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight depression in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost a third of its numbers at Frederickburg.

Following his failure at Fredericksburg, Burnside was reassigned to the Department of the Ohio. The IX Corps, which he had formerly commanded, was reassigned with him. The 21st Massachusetts boarded trains for <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> on March 28, 1863. They were then transported to <a href="Mount%20Sterling%2C%20Kentucky">Mount Sterling, Kentucky</a>, to combat Confederate <a href="guerrillas">guerrillas</a>. In April, due to the reduced numbers of the regiment (now about 200) several officers, being effectively without commands, chose to resign their commissions, including Col. William S. Clark. Command of the regiment passed to Lt. Col. <a href="George%20P.%20Hawkes">George P. Hawkes</a>.

The regiment saw light duty around <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>, during the summer of 1863. In September, Burnside launched his effort to capture <a href="eastern%20Tennessee">eastern Tennessee</a> from Confederate hands. The 21st marched for <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville, Tennessee</a>, on September 12, 1863. During the <a href="Knoxville%20Campaign">Knoxville Campaign</a>, the 21st saw minor action, acting primarily in support of artillery due to their small numbers.

After roughly a month's furlough back in Massachusetts during February and March 1864, the 21st returned to the Army of the Potomac as part of a newly reorganized <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28Union%20Army%29">IX Corps</a>, rejoining the army a day before the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Battle of the Wilderness</a> on May 4, 1864. Lt. Gen. <a href="Ulysses%20Grant">Ulysses Grant</a> had become <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">general-in-chief</a> of the Union army and intended to follow the Army of the Potomac in the field, relentlessly pushing Lee's Confederate army over the course of the summer of 1864. Walcott of the 21st wrote, "There was to be little of the romance or strategy of war in that horribly bloody work of that summer's campaign in Virginia."

During this campaign, the 21st suffered heavy casualties during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Spotsylvania">Battle of Spotsylvania</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bethesda%20Church">Battle of Bethesda Church</a>. In the latter engagement, the 21st acted as rear guard and bore the brunt of a fierce attack but held their position. Grant's <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> concluded with several assaults on <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Petersburg, Virginia</a>, on June 15–18, 1864. The 21st again took considerable casualties during these attacks, particularly during the assault on June 17. Maj. Henry Richardson, commanding the 21st, was wounded in the thigh during the engagement and was shortly thereafter sent home. Now numbering less than 100 men, the regiment had been reduced to a tenth of its original size. Company A, by this time, had only three men on its active roster.

Following these failed assaults, both armies settled into trench warfare around Petersburg. There were numerous attempts, during the summer of 1864, on the part of the Union army, to dislodge the Confederates from their lines. One of the most disastrous for the Union army was the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Crater">Battle of the Crater</a> during which explosives were detonated in a large mine tunneled beneath the Confederate entrenchments, temporarily creating a gap in their lines. Elements of the IX Corps, under the command of Maj. Gen. Burnside, were to charge through the gap, but instead became trapped in the enormous crater. Brig. Gen. <a href="James%20H.%20Ledlie">James Ledlie's</a> division, of which the 21st was a part, led the attack. The division had been selected at the last minute over the <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">United States Colored Troops</a> who had actually trained for the operation. Unprepared, Ledlie's division delayed in their attack, allowing the Confederates time to regroup. The 21st managed to advance, mingled with other regiments, to the furthest point penetrated by Union troops but by the afternoon they made the retreat "pell mell" with the rest of Burnside's IX Corps.

On August 18, 1864, the 21st's three-year enlistment came to an end. More than three-quarters of the remaining men chose to re-enlist. These men were consolidated into a battalion of three companies commanded by Capt. Orange S. Sampson. The day after their consolidation, the battalion participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Globe%20Tavern">Battle of Globe Tavern</a>. The final engagement in which the remaining companies of the 21st participated as an independent unit was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poplar%20Springs%20Church">Battle of Poplar Springs Church</a> on September 30, 1864, during which the Union army attempted to extend its lines westward, further encircling Petersburg. Capt. Orange Sampson, commanding the 21st, was killed in this engagement.

On October 21, 1864, the battalion was consolidated with the <a href="36th%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">36th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</a>. When the 36th was mustered out in June 1865, the three companies that had belonged to the 21st were consolidated with the <a href="56th%20Massachusetts%20Volunteer%20Infantry">56th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry</a>. They were finally mustered out of service on July 8, 1865.

The Civil War nurse <a href="Clara%20Barton">Clara Barton</a> was born and raised in <a href="Oxford%2C%20Massachusetts">Oxford, Worcester County, Massachusetts</a>, and knew many of the men in the 21st Massachusetts. More than 40 of them had been her students when she was a teacher before the war. She therefore took an acute interest in their welfare. During the Maryland Campaign, she visited frequently with the regiment and cared for its wounded during the Battle of Antietam. Sgt. Plunkett, the color bearer of the 21st who suffered such grievous wounds during the Battle of Fredericksburg, credited Barton with saving his life. She was at his side when he was first treated, personally arranged his transport home, and carried on correspondence with him after the war. Barton declared the 21st her favorite regiment and, in turn, the men of the 21st voted her a "daughter" of the regiment.

After the war, Col. <a href="William%20S.%20Clark">William S. Clark</a> became a prominent figure in early American/Japanese relations. After establishing the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>), Clark was invited by the government of Japan to establish a similar institution, the Sapporo Agricultural College (now the <a href="University%20of%20Hokkaido">University of Hokkaido</a>). Clark's fame persists in Japan where he is a household name due to the revolutionary western ideas he brought to <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and the influence he had on the development of the island. His military experience during the Civil War was an important factor in earning the respect of his Japanese superiors.

Today, the history of the 21st Massachusetts is interpreted by the Southern Piedmont Historical Reenactment Society (SPHRS), a reenacting group based in North Carolina. While dedicated primarily to the history of the <a href="49th%20North%20Carolina%20Infantry">49th North Carolina Infantry</a>, the SPHRS does represent the 21st at living history events and reenactments throughout the year.

2007–2008 Nazko earthquakes

The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquakes were a series of small <a href="volcano%20tectonic%20earthquake">volcanic earthquakes</a> measuring less than 4.0 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter magnitude scale</a>. They took place in the sparsely populated <a href="Nazko%2C%20British%20Columbia">Nazko</a> area of the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Interior">Central Interior</a> of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a> starting on October 9, 2007 and ending on June 12, 2008. They occurred just west of <a href="Nazko%20Cone">Nazko Cone</a>, a small tree-covered <a href="cinder%20cone">cinder cone</a> that last erupted about 7,200 years ago.

No damage or casualties resulted from the Nazko earthquakes, which were too small to be felt by people, but local <a href="seismograph">seismograph</a>s recorded them. The <a href="earthquake%20swarm">earthquake swarm</a> occurred at the eastern end of a known volcanic zone called the <a href="Anahim%20Volcanic%20Belt">Anahim Volcanic Belt</a>. This is an east-west trending line of volcanic formations extending from the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Coast">Central Coast</a> to the Central Interior of British Columbia.

The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is interpreted to have originated below the surface. The character of the <a href="seismic%20wave">seismic wave</a>s indicated that the swarm originated from a magmatic source. It could have formed as a result of rock fracturing at the tip of a <a href="dike%20%28geology%29">dike</a> and/or by movement along <a href="fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a> planes due to changes in the local <a href="stress%20field">stress field</a> by the expansion and movement of <a href="magma">magma</a>. This magmatic activity is potentially linked to the hypothesized <a href="Anahim%20hotspot">Anahim hotspot</a>, a <a href="mantle%20plume">mantle plume</a> that is probably responsible for older <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a> throughout the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This <a href="volcanic%20belt">volcanic belt</a> includes the <a href="Rainbow%20Range%20%28Chilcotin%20Plateau%29">Rainbow</a>, <a href="Ilgachuz%20Range">Ilgachuz</a> and <a href="Itcha%20Range">Itcha</a> range <a href="shield%20volcano">shield volcano</a>es west of the Nazko swarm. Individual Anahim volcanoes generally become older to the west of the Nazko swarm, indicating that the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a> is moving in a westerly direction with respect to the <a href="hotspot%20%28geology%29">hotspot</a>, carrying the volcanoes along with it at a rate of to per year. Because the area where the 2007–2008 Nazko earthquake swarm originated is at the eastern end of the volcanic belt, it probably represents the youngest portion of the hotspot track. This suggests any future volcanic earthquakes will occur in the Nazko region or further to the east.
Before the Nazko earthquake swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot was not known to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than <a href="Magnitude%20%28mathematics%29">magnitude</a> 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, but at least one earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Canada">Natural Resources Canada</a> has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.

Even though earthquake swarms can be dangerous, scientists are able to model such events to analyze their structure. During the earthquake swarm in 2007, a group of scientists investigated the possibility that a volcanic eruption would occur. Five additional seismographs were placed in the earthquake zone, and scientists closely monitored the seismic activity. After additional data were gathered, scientists with the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a>, and other organizations, agreed that the Nazko earthquakes probably originated from movement of magma beneath the surface near Nazko Cone. However, because of the number and small size of the Nazko earthquakes, no volcanic eruption is likely. Other recent earthquakes in North America that have been attributed to magma but did not result in a volcanic eruption include the 2003 earthquakes under <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="California">California</a> and a 2004 earthquake swarm at <a href="Jordan%20Craters">Jordan Craters</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>.

More than 1,000 earthquakes were recorded by regional seismic networks within three weeks of October 20, 2007. Because the seismometers that recorded the Nazko swarm were more than away from where the earthquakes took place, the locations of the <a href="hypocenter">hypocenter</a>s were measured with poor resolution. Following the earthquake, five seismometers were placed by the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">Geological Survey of Canada</a> from September 2007 to June 2008 close to the hypocenter. Analysis of the data recorded by these seismometers indicates a much larger total number of earthquakes. For example, at least 597 earthquakes were recognized during a period of only six hours.

At least two episodes of earthquakes constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, a total of 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes in the development of the earthquake swarm. <a href="Pearson%20product-moment%20correlation%20coefficient">Correlation coefficients</a> were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.

The earthquake swarm was noted on October 12, 2007 in the <a href="Prince%20George%20Citizen">Prince George Citizen</a> by citizen staff, three days after the earthquakes began. Scientists mentioned in the report were seismologist <a href="John%20Cassidy%20%28seismologist%29">John Cassidy</a> of Natural Resources Canada and volcanologist <a href="Catherine%20Hickson">Catherine Hickson</a>, who was part of the Geological Survey of Canada at the time. At the time of the report, scientists did not know the origin of the swarm. Seismologist John Cassidy stated, "the depth is enough to rule out hydrothermal but it's up in the air as to whether the cause is tectonic shifts or volcanic activity. If it is volcanic there are certain characteristics that we would expect, there's a tremor-like character to it. And so we'll be looking for the types of events that we see beneath volcanoes and we'll be looking to see if they're getting closer to the surface or if they're migrating at all."

Even if the Nazko swarm were a warning of a volcanic eruption, Hickson doubted it would turn out to be a highly <a href="explosive%20eruption">explosive eruption</a> like those that can occur in <a href="subduction">subduction-zone</a> volcanoes. "We're not talking about an injection of tonnes of ash many kilometers into the air like the <a href="1980%20Mount%20St.%20Helens%20eruption">1980 Mount St. Helens eruption</a> or the 1991 <a href="Mount%20Pinatubo">Mount Pinatubo</a> eruption. We're talking about something very small, relatively localized that should have a fairly limited impact... but it'll be extremely exciting", Hickson said. If an eruption were to occur, Hickson suggested that it would be characterized by a <a href="lava%20fountain">lava fountain</a> that sends globs of lava into the air. This is similar to those that occur in Hawaii. Hickson said that a Nazko eruption could be a tourist attraction, but warned that noxious gases such as <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> would be released during the event.

Because no seismographs were close enough to the Nazko swarm zone before the earthquakes began, employees of <a href="Natural%20Resources%20Canada">Natural Resources Canada</a> placed seismographs in the area to monitor future earthquakes in the area more clearly. An infrasound station is also being established, which is able to measure <a href="sound%20wave">sound wave</a>s that would normally go unnoticed by human hearing. These stations can detect volcanic eruptions and the release of gas at volcanic vents, and can be used in combination with other geophysical data to monitor fluid flow within volcanoes. Employees of Natural Resources Canada have also visited two communities that were adjacent to the 2007–2008 earthquake swarm to renew information about the Nazko swarm, collect samples, and examine some of the more poorly studied volcanic deposits in the Nazko region. The Natural Resources Canada employees also measured carbon dioxide levels during the earthquake swarm. Carbon dioxide is usually discharged at faults in volcanically active areas and can collect in <a href="soil">soil</a> and under snow. Because of this, carbon dioxide concentrations can provide information on volcanic activity in the subsurface. The Nazko swarm did not cause any discernible discharge of carbon dioxide, which is normal for non-eruptive events.
The 2007–2008 Nazko earthquake swarm is one of numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include the <a href="Mount%20Meager%20massif">Mount Meager massif</a> (seventeen events), <a href="Mount%20Cayley">Mount Cayley</a> (four events), <a href="Mount%20Garibaldi">Mount Garibaldi</a> (three events), <a href="Silverthrone%20Caldera">Silverthrone Caldera</a> (two events), <a href="Castle%20Rock%20%28volcano%29">Castle Rock</a> (two events), <a href="Hoodoo%20Mountain">Hoodoo Mountain</a> (eight events), <a href="Crow%20Lagoon">Crow Lagoon</a> (four events), <a href="The%20Volcano%20%28British%20Columbia%29">The Volcano</a> (five events), and the <a href="Mount%20Edziza%20volcanic%20complex">Mount Edziza volcanic complex</a> (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active <a href="magma%20chamber">magma chamber</a>s, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes with a history of significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.

If magma were to rise towards the surface of Nazko, new earthquake swarms would occur, with a significant increase in the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200 years ago.

Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri

Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri (c. 1955 – 2008) was a <a href="Pintupi%20language">Pintupi-Luritja</a>-speaking <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous</a> artist from Australia's <a href="Western%20Desert%20cultural%20bloc">Western Desert</a> region, and sister of artist <a href="Molly%20Jugadai%20Napaltjarri">Molly Jugadai Napaltjarri</a>. Daisy Jugadai lived and painted at <a href="Haasts%20Bluff%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory</a>. There she played a significant role in the establishment of Ikuntji Women's Centre, where many artists of the region have worked.

Influenced by the <a href="Hermannsburg%20School">Hermannsburg School</a>, Jugadai's paintings reflect her "<a href="Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">Tjuukurrpa</a>", the complex spiritual knowledge and relationships between her and her landscape. The paintings also reflect fine observation of the structures of the vegetation and environment. Jugadai's works were selected for exhibition at the <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a>s five times between 1993 and 2001, and she was a section winner in 2000. Her paintings are held in major collections including the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>, <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> and the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>.

Daisy Jugadai was born circa 1955 at <a href="Haasts%20Bluff%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Haasts Bluff, Northern Territory</a>, daughter of artists Narputta Nangala and Timmy Jugadai Tjungurrayi. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous people operate using a different conception of time from non-Indigenous Australians, often estimating dates through comparisons with the occurrence of other events.

The people of Papunya and Haasts Bluff, such as Daisy, speak a variety of the <a href="Pintupi%20language">Pintupi language</a> referred to as Pintupi-Luritja, a <a href="Western%20Desert%20language">Western Desert dialect</a>. "<a href="Napaljarri%20%28skin%20name%29">Napaltjarri</a>" (in Western Desert dialects) or "Napaljarri" (in Warlpiri) is a <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20kinship">skin name</a>, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the <a href="kinship%20system">kinship system</a> of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular <a href="totem">totem</a>s. Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus "Daisy Jugadai" is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers.

Jugadai's childhood was spent at both Haasts Bluff and a nearby camp, Five Mile, while she was schooled at Papunya. She married Kelly Multa, and they had a daughter, Agnes. They lived on an <a href="outstation">outstation</a>, Kungkayunti, but Daisy moved back to Haasts Bluff when Kelly died. It was not until the 1990s that she was remarried, to an <a href="Elcho%20Island">Elcho Island</a>er, after which she travelled regularly between <a href="Arnhem%20Land%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Arnhem Land</a> and Haasts Bluff. Jugadai died in 2008, her funeral held at Haasts Bluff, where she was born. Daisy Jugadai had an older sister, artist <a href="Molly%20Jugadai%20Napaltjarri">Molly Jugadai Napaltjarri</a>, and another sister, Ester, who predeceased her.

The <a href="contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a> movement began in the western desert in 1971, when Indigenous men at <a href="Papunya">Papunya</a> took up painting, led by elders such as <a href="Kaapa%20Tjampitjinpa">Kaapa Tjampitjinpa</a>, and assisted by teacher <a href="Geoffrey%20Bardon">Geoffrey Bardon</a>. This initiative, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly following the commencement of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and 1990s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the <a href="Papunya%20Tula">Papunya Tula</a> artists' company, had been men, and there was resistance amongst the Pintupi men of central Australia to women painting. However, many women in the communities wished to participate, and in the 1990s many began to create paintings. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, Yuendumu, Balgo, and on the <a href="outstation%20movement">outstations</a>, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.

Daisy Jugadai came from a family of painters, including her uncle Uta Uta Tjangala and her mother.
She learned to draw during her schooling at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first experience as a painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai was one of a range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with a significant role in the centre's establishment. She began with <a href="screen%20printing">screen printing</a> and <a href="linocut">linocut</a> printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular '<a href="dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">dreamings</a>' or "Tjukurrpa" for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, "Tjukurrpa" refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included <a href="Honeypot%20ant">honey ant</a>, <a href="Triodia%20%28plant%20genus%29">spinifex</a> and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where her family had lived for many years.

Throughout the 1990s, Daisy Jugadai was a regular exhibitor at the <a href="Araluen%20Centre%20for%20Arts%20and%20Entertainment">Araluen Art Centre</a> in Alice Springs, and well as other major exhibitions such as the Australian Heritage Art Awards in Canberra in 1994. Recognition came in 1993, in two forms: an award of a Northern Territory Women's Fellowship; and the purchase by the Araluen Arts Centre of a work exhibited in its annual art award. Within her community she was an administrator as well as an artist. A member of the Ikuntji Women's Centre and a representative on Ikuntji Community Council, Daisy was one of those who successfully lobbied to have artist Marina Strocchi appointed as an art centre coordinator in the early 1990s. The respect between the two women was mutual: Daisy was one of a group of artists whose work was selected for an exhibition that toured regional Australian public galleries in 1999–2000, "Ikuntji tjuta – touring", which was curated by Marina Strocchi, the art centre coordinator who had first helped develop the Ikuntji centre in Haasts Bluff some years earlier.

Works by Daisy Jugadai are held by the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>, <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> and the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>. They are also held in major private collections, such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection), as well as by <a href="Edith%20Cowan%20University">Edith Cowan University</a>. First exhibiting in the <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a>s in 1993, she was a finalist on several occasions including 1995, 1998 and 2001, and a section winner in 2000. Her 1994 entry in the award, "Karu kapingku pungu (Creek after rain)", belongs to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. Her work is also featured alongside other Indigenous artists such as <a href="Gloria%20Petyarre">Gloria Petyarre</a> in the Melbourne international airport terminal, completed in 1996. "Antiti, near Five Mile", a 1998 painting, has appeared as cover art on an issue of the <a href="Medical%20Journal%20of%20Australia">Medical Journal of Australia</a>.

Alone amongst the Ikuntji artists, Daisy Jugadai worked at an easel. She cited the <a href="Hermannsburg%20School">Hermannsburg School</a>, a group of Indigenous artists including <a href="Albert%20Namatjira">Albert Namatjira</a> who began painting at <a href="Hermannsburg%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Hermannsburg Mission</a> in the 1930s, as an influence on her work. "Memory and Five Mile Creek" (1995) represents the country of her childhood. It shows the hills of the region in elevation rather than in plan, and represents the range of vegetation typical of that country. Curator Marina Strocchi notes how Daisy Jugadai's painting reflects close observation of the complex structures of the vegetation and environment, its features "obsessively detailed", with the artist "devotedly [including] all the <a href="Bushfood">bush tucker</a> of that area", as well as choosing "a time of year in which to depict her country". Vegetation would be carefully painted with a trimmed brush, while even finer detail, such as pollen, would be rendered using a matchstick. Clouds were always the final features to be included. Despite this devotion to detail, Daisy preferred to paint large canvasses. "Memory and Five Mile Creek" was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2004–05 exhibition "Aboriginal Art Post 1984" and reviewer Miriam Cosic, while noting its "naive charm", also drew attention to the work's title and the implication that, like other more explicitly political painters of her era, "she too is talking of violent dispossession".

Artist Mandy Martin, who participated in a 2005 collaboration with several painters from the Haasts Bluff region, thought that Daisy's rendering of bush tucker was achieved with a "stylised but dazzling personal language". Writer and critic Morag Fraser described Daisy's work as "extraordinary", observing that in Daisy's paintings "nature is so wholly internalised, and its rendering so uninhibited." A distinguished artist in her community, her death coincided with a vigorous renewal of artistic expression amongst her successors.

Wintjiya Napaltjarri

Wintjiya Napaltjarri (born between ca. 1923 to 1934) (also spelt Wentjiya, Wintjia or Wentja), and also known as Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1, is a <a href="Pintupi%20language">Pintupi</a>-speaking <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous</a> artist from <a href="Australia">Australia's</a> <a href="Western%20Desert%20cultural%20bloc">Western Desert</a> region. She is the sister of artist <a href="Tjunkiya%20Napaltjarri">Tjunkiya Napaltjarri</a>; both were wives of Toba Tjakamarra, with whom Wintjiya had five children.

Wintjiya's involvement in <a href="contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a> began in 1994 at <a href="Haasts%20Bluff%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Haasts Bluff</a>, when she participated in a group painting project and in the creation of <a href="batik">batik</a> fabrics. She has also been a printmaker, using <a href="drypoint">drypoint</a> etching. Her paintings typically use an <a href="iconography">iconography</a> that represents the eggs of the flying ant ("<a href="waturnuma">waturnuma</a>") and <a href="hair-string%20skirt">hair-string skirt</a>s ("nyimparra"). Her palette generally involves strong red or black against a white background.

A finalist in the 2007 and 2008 <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a>s, Wintjiya's work is held in several of Australia's public collections including the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>, the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>, the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> and the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>. Her work is also held in the <a href="Kluge-Ruhe%20Aboriginal%20Art%20Collection">Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>.

A 2004 reference work on Western Desert painters suggests Wintjiya was born in about 1923; the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests 1932; expert Vivien Johnson reports two possible years: 1932 or 1934. The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians have a different conception of time, often estimating dates by comparisons with the occurrence of other events.

<a href="Napaljarri%20%28skin%20name%29">Napaljarri</a> (in <a href="Warlpiri%20language">Warlpiri</a>) or Napaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) is a <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20kinship">skin name</a>, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the <a href="kinship%20system">kinship system</a> of central Australian Indigenous people. These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems. Although often used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans. Thus Wintjiya is the element of the artist's name that is specifically hers. She is sometimes referred to as Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1; there is another artist from the same region, Wintjiya Morgan Napaljarri (also called Wintjiya Reid Napaltjarri), who is known as Wintjiya No. 2.

Wintjiya came from an area north-west or north-east of Walungurru (the <a href="Pintupi%20language">Pintupi-language</a> name for <a href="Kintore%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Kintore, Northern Territory</a>). Johnson reports that Wintjiya was born at Mulparingya, "a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore", west of <a href="Alice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Alice Springs</a>. As was the case for a number of artists from the region, Wintjiya's family walked into the <a href="Haasts%20Bluff%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Haasts Bluff</a> settlement in the 1950s, moving to <a href="Papunya%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Papunya</a> in the 1960s. In 1981, Kintore was established and the family moved there. Her native language is Pintupi, and she speaks almost no English. She is the sister of artist <a href="Tjunkiya%20Napaltjarri">Tjunkiya Napaltjarri</a>, the two women being the second and third wives of Toba Tjakamarra, father (by his first wife, Nganyima Napaltjarri) of one of the prominent founders of the <a href="Papunya%20Tula">Papunya Tula</a> art movement, <a href="Turkey%20Tolson%20Tjupurrula">Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula</a>. Wintjiya and Toba had five children: sons Bundy (born 1953) and Lindsay (born 1961 and now deceased); and daughters Rubilee (born 1955), Claire (born 1958) and Eileen (born 1960). Superficially frail by 2008, she nevertheless had the stamina and agility to teach her granddaughter the skills of chasing and capturing <a href="goanna">goanna</a>s.

Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials, assisted by teacher <a href="Geoffrey%20Bardon">Geoffrey Bardon</a>. Their work, which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures, rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia, particularly after the introduction of a government-sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983. By the 1980s and '90s, such work was being exhibited internationally. The first artists, including all of the founders of the <a href="Papunya%20Tula">Papunya Tula</a> artists' company, were men, and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting. However, many of the women wished to participate, and in the 1990s many of them began to paint. In the western desert communities such as Kintore, <a href="Yuendumu%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Yuendumu</a>, <a href="Balgo%2C%20Western%20Australia">Balgo</a>, and on the <a href="outstation%20movement">outstations</a>, people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale.

Since the 1970s Wintjiya had created artefacts such as "<a href="Erythrina%20vespertilio">ininti</a>" seed necklaces, mats and baskets, using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of <a href="Triodia%20%28plant%20genus%29">spinifex</a> grass. When the women of Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, started creating canvasses, their works bore little resemblance to those of their male peers (who had been painting for some years). Wintjiya's first efforts were collaborative, as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1992. She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce "a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared <a href="dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">Dreamings</a>" (dreamings are stories used to pass "important knowledge, cultural values and belief systems" from generation to generation). Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were square, as well as two that were ; Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations. Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite <a href="cataract">cataract</a>s interfering with their vision. As was the case for <a href="Makinti%20Napanangka">Makinti Napanangka</a>, an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions. Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed: Johnson suggests 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that it was 1994. In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: "the widows' camp outside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence".

Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases. In 2001 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased a collaborative <a href="batik">batik</a>, created by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists, together with one completed by Wintjiya alone. These works were the product of a batik workshop run for the women of Haasts Bluff by <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory Education Department</a> staff Jill Squires and Therese Honan in the months following June 1994. The works, including several by Wintjiya, were not completed until 1995. Circular markings, used by Wintjiya in both these batiks and her subsequent paintings, represent the eggs of the flying ant ("waturnuma"), one of the main subjects of her art. She also portrays "tree-like organic motifs" and representations of hair-string skirts ("nyimparra"). The sisters also gained experience with <a href="drypoint">drypoint</a> etching; works produced by Wintjiya in 2004 – "Watiyawanu" and "Nyimpara" – are held by the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>.

Wintjiya's work was included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting hosted by <a href="Flinders%20University">Flinders University</a> in the late 1990s. Reviewing the exhibition, Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya's "Watanuma" that it was a germinal painting, with fine use of muted colour, and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work. Likewise, Marina Strocchi has noted the contrast between some of the subtle colours used in batik and Wintjiya's characteristic painting palette, which is "almost exclusively stark white with black or red". Hetti Perkins and Margie West have suggested that in paintings by Kintore women artists such as Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, "the viscosity of the painting's surface seems to mimic the generous application of body paint in women's ceremonies".

Wintjiya's painting "Rock holes west of Kintore" was a finalist in the 2007 <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a>. Another of her works, "Country west of Kintore", was accepted as a finalist in 2008. Works by Wintjiya have appeared in many significant exhibitions including: "Papunya Women" group exhibition (Utopia Art Gallery, Sydney, 1996); "Raiki Wara: Long Cloth from Aboriginal Australia and the Torres Strait" (<a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a> 1998–99); "Twenty-five Years and Beyond: Papunya Tula Painting" (<a href="Flinders%20University%20Art%20Museum">Flinders University Art Museum</a>, 1999); "Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius" (<a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>, 2000) and "Land Marks" (National Gallery of Victoria, 2006). Her first solo exhibition was at Wolloongabba Art Gallery in Brisbane in 2005, while in 2010 there was one at a Melbourne gallery. Also in 2010, a print by Wintjiya was selected for inclusion in the annual <a href="Fremantle%20Arts%20Centre">Fremantle Arts Centre</a>'s Print Award. In 2013, she was one of sixteen finalists in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards.

Works by Wintjiya are held in major private collections such as Nangara (also known as the Ebes Collection). Her work has been acquired by several major public art institutions including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a>, and the National Gallery of Victoria. Internationally, her work is held in the Aboriginal Art Museum at <a href="Utrecht%20%28city%29">Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands, and the <a href="Kluge-Ruhe%20Aboriginal%20Art%20Collection">Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>. Works by Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya are traded in the auction market, fetching prices of a few thousand dollars.

In 2018 Wintjiya's work was included in the exhibition "Marking the Infinite: Contemporary Women Artists from Aboriginal Australia" at <a href="The%20Phillips%20Collection">The Phillips Collection</a>.

Russian battleship Sevastopol (1895)

Sevastopol () was the last of three ships in the of <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s built for the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> in the 1890s.

Named for the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege of Sevastopol</a> during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, the ship was commissioned into the First Pacific Squadron of the <a href="Russian%20Pacific%20Fleet">Russian Pacific Fleet</a> and was stationed at <a href="Port%20Arthur%20naval%20base">Port Arthur</a> (today <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Lüshunkou District</a>, <a href="Dalian">Dalian</a>, <a href="Liaoning">Liaoning</a>, China), a Russian naval base acquired from China in 1898 as part of the <a href="Kwantung%20Leased%20Territory">Kwantung Leased Territory</a>. One of the first ships to use Harvey nickel-steel armor and Popov radios, she displaced at <a href="Full-load%20displacement">full load</a> and was long <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a>, and mounted a main battery of four guns in two twin turrets. She was laid down in May 1892, launched on 1 June 1895 and completed in 1899. Her sea trials lasted until 1900.

"Sevastopol" saw service in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05. Slightly damaged during a surprise attack on Port Arthur in early February, the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port. The most notable of these was the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a>, where she was damaged by several shells but managed to make it back to port with the remnants of the Russian Fleet, leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded. Immediately after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Port%20Arthur">surrender of Port Arthur</a>, "Sevastopol" was <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> to prevent her capture by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. The Japanese never raised her. The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port.

The design of the "Petropavlovsk"-class ships was derived from the battleship , but was greatly enlarged to accommodate an armament of four and eight guns. While under construction their armament was revised to consist of more powerful 12-inch guns and the 8-inch guns were replaced by a dozen guns. The ships were <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a>, with a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of .

They were also armed with six <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s, four tubes above water and two submerged tubes, all mounted on the <a href="broadside">broadside</a>. They carried 50 mines to be used to protect her <a href="anchorage%20%28shipping%29">anchorage</a>.

The Russians could not manufacture the <a href="Harvey%20armor">Harvey armor</a> used by "Sevastopol", so the ship's armor was ordered from <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel">Bethlehem Steel</a> in America, although only her <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="belt%20armor">armor belt</a> was made from Harvey armor and the rest was <a href="nickel%20steel">nickel steel</a>. The armor belt was thick. The main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of of armor and her <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> armor ranged from in thickness.

"Sevastopol", named for the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%931855%29">siege of Sevastopol</a> during the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, was laid down at the <a href="Admiralty%20Shipyard">Galernii Island shipyard</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> on 7 March 1892. Construction was led by two engineers, E. P. Andruschenko and N. I. Afanasyev, and began on 7 May 1892, about the same time as the battleship was laid down. The ceremony was attended by <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Russia">Alexander III of Russia</a> and then-<a href="Tsesarevich">Tsesarevich</a> <a href="Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a>. "Sevastopol" was launched on 1 June 1895 and, after the completion of her hull and decks in 1898, was transferred to <a href="Kronstadt">Kronstadt</a> where her armor and guns were installed. "Sevastopol" was finished in 1899 and Nikolai Chernishev became her captain, a post which he would retain until 17 March 1904, when <a href="Nikolai%20Essen">Nikolai Essen</a> assumed command.

"Sevastopol" began her sea trials on 16 October 1899, and was commissioned after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy. She and her sister ships were transferred to <a href="L%C3%BCshunkou%20District">Port Arthur</a>, which was then the base of the First Squadron of the <a href="Russian%20Pacific%20Fleet">Russian Pacific Fleet</a>. In September 1900, Popov radios were installed on "Sevastopol" and her sister <a href="Russian%20battleship%20Poltava%20%281894%29">"Poltava"</a>, the first Russian battleships to have them. They were also painted white, the same color as the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron. She then left for Port Arthur, arriving on 13 April 1901. As Russia was not at war with any <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> countries at that time, "Sevastopol" stayed in port, inactive.

After the Japanese victory in the <a href="First%20Sino-Japanese%20War">First Sino-Japanese War</a> of 1894–1895, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control <a href="Manchuria">Manchuria</a> and Korea, resulting in tensions between the two nations. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The situation was worsened by Russia's failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. The final straws were the news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These actions caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was inevitable. As tensions with Japan increased, the Pacific Squadron began <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">mooring</a> in the outer harbor at night in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea.

In early February 1904, the Japanese Navy launched a surprise <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Arthur">attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur</a>. "Sevastopol" was hit by one shell, either six or eight inches in diameter, that wounded two men on her bridge. She soon turned in pursuit along with other ships of the Russian fleet, all firing their forward guns, but she failed to score any hits. On 26 March 1904, "Sevastopol" was accidentally rammed by , damaging a propeller. After the attack on Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron tried to break out several times. During one attempt on 23 June, Admiral <a href="Wilgelm%20Vitgeft">Wilgelm Vitgeft</a>, commanding the Pacific Fleet, retreated after encountering the Japanese fleet. Approaching the harbor, "Sevastopol" moved slightly out of formation and hit a mine that killed 11 and caused severe flooding, but managed to get inside the harbor and drop anchor. She was under repair for six weeks, during which time a fire broke out on deck, killing two and wounding 28. The Russian battleships were too big to fit into the dry dock at Port Arthur, so large <a href="Caisson%20%28engineering%29">caissons</a> were built to provide access to the ships' hulls. On 9 August, with the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Japanese Third Army</a> assaulting the outer defenses of Port Arthur, the First Pacific Squadron sortied from its base. Even though "Sevastopol" was not fully repaired, she sailed with the rest of the fleet with one gun in her aft turret remaining inoperable. They later engaged the Japanese fleet in what would become the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Battle of the Yellow Sea</a>.

Although in the center of the Russian line during the battle, "Sevastopol" was only slightly damaged during the day. In the evening, the Russians massed their fire on the Japanese flagship , at that time away. The Japanese battleships returned fire and "Sevastopol" suffered several shell hits to her superstructure, which killed one man and wounded 62 others. A few minutes later, "Mikasa" was hit by two shells and one shell from and "Sevastopol", which caused 40 casualties. Soon after that, when it seemed that the Russians would be able to escape to Vladivostok, two 12-inch shells from penetrated the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind "Tsesarevich", including "Sevastopol", to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. Prince Pavel Ukhtomski, second in command of the squadron, who was on the "Peresvet", proceeded to signal the other Russian ships via <a href="Flag%20semaphore">semaphore</a> to steam back to Port Arthur, although the signals were only gradually recognized by "Pobeda", "Poltava", and "Sevastopol". "Sevastopol" had one and two guns knocked out during the battle.

Returning to Port Arthur on 10 August, the squadron found that the city was already under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by <a href="Baron">Baron</a> <a href="Nogi%20Maresuke">Nogi Maresuke</a>. On 23 August, "Sevastopol" bombarded a Japanese battery in an effort to escape along with nine smaller ships, but after she neutralized the battery, she returned to port after a Japanese lookout spotted the approaching ships. As she was maneuvering back into Port Arthur, she struck another mine and required repairs. On 5 December the Third Army captured <a href="203%20Hill">203 Meter Hill</a>, a crucial position that overlooked the harbor. From there, the Japanese were able to fire on "Sevastopol" and other ships of the First Pacific Squadron that had survived the Yellow Sea battle. The ships at that time were about away from the hill, placing them within range of Japanese shore artillery. By 9 December four battleships and two cruisers had been sunk by the Japanese. "Sevastopol", although hit five times by shells, managed to move away from the western harbor and out of range of the guns to the minor harbor of White Wolf, where she could be defended by torpedo nets and booms. Within the defensive surroundings of White Wolf, Essen started to plan a sortie through the blockade to Vladivostok or a rendezvous with the Second Pacific Squadron, at that time coaling at Madagascar. At the same time, the commanding <a href="Gensui%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy%29">admiral</a> of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>, <a href="T%C5%8Dg%C5%8D%20Heihachir%C5%8D">Tōgō Heihachirō</a>, as instructed by <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> in Tokyo, ordered the destruction of the battleship by six waves of <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, along with some torpedo boats that were launched from the and "Mikasa".

The torpedo boat and destroyer attacks lasted three weeks, during which 80 torpedoes were launched at "Sevastopol". Of these, four hit. The four successful torpedoes were launched on 18 December. Three of them hit the torpedo nets that had been placed around the ship, while the other hit one of the ship's propellers. Although severely damaged, "Sevastopol" remained afloat and sank two destroyers and damaged six others, killing 35 sailors and five officers. A Japanese cruiser attempting to attack "Sevastopol" was sunk by a mine in the harbor. When he received news of the surrender of the land fortifications on 2 January 1905, Essen decided to surrender, but scuttled the ship in of water by opening the <a href="seacock">seacock</a>s on one side so that the ship could not be salvaged by the Japanese. His other option, a run to Vladivostok, had already been eliminated due to the damage to his propellers by the torpedo. For the act of scuttling "Sevastopol", Essen was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20George">Order of St. George</a>. Nevertheless, a dispatch from <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> reported that it sank as a result of a Japanese torpedo attack.

Due to the depth of water in which she had sunk, and her position, "Sevastopol" was the only battleship that was not salvaged by the Japanese at Port Arthur. What remains of her is still outside the entrance to Port Arthur. "Poltava", one of her sister ships, was also scuttled at Port Arthur and re-floated as the Japanese .

Smooth toadfish

The smooth toadfish ("Tetractenos glaber") is a species of fish in the pufferfish family <a href="Tetraodontidae">Tetraodontidae</a>. It is native to shallow coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Australia, where it is widespread and abundant. French naturalist <a href="Christophe-Paulin%20de%20La%20Poix%20de%20Fr%C3%A9minville">Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville</a> described the species in 1813, though early records confused it with its close relative, the <a href="common%20toadfish">common toadfish</a> ("T. hamiltonii"). The two are the only members of the genus "<a href="Tetractenos">Tetractenos</a>" after going through several <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> changes since discovery.

Up to long with distinctive leopard-like dark markings on its dorsal side, the smooth toadfish has a rounded front and tapers to a narrow tail at the back. Unlike most of its relatives, it does not have prominent spines on its body. Like other pufferfish, it can inflate itself with water or air. It forages for its preferred foods—<a href="molluscs">molluscs</a> and <a href="crustaceans">crustaceans</a>—in sand and mud of the bottom <a href="sediment">sediment</a>. Often an unwanted catch by anglers, the smooth toadfish is highly poisonous because of the <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a> present in its body, and eating it may result in death.

French naturalist <a href="Christophe-Paulin%20de%20La%20Poix%20de%20Fr%C3%A9minville">Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville</a> described the smooth toadfish in 1813 as "Tetrodon glaber", based on a specimen collected in <a href="Adventure%20Bay%2C%20Tasmania">Adventure Bay</a> in southeastern <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> by <a href="Claude%20Riche">Claude Riche</a>. This <a href="holotype">holotype</a> was then catalogued in the collection of French naturalist <a href="Alexandre%20Brongniart">Alexandre Brongniart</a>, but was subsequently lost; upon his death, Brongniart's collection was bequeathed to the Paris Museum and the specimen did not appear there nor at any other institution. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "glaber" is from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "glăber", meaning "bald". Fréminville's description was overlooked by many subsequent authorities, resulting in the confusion of this species with the closely related <a href="common%20toadfish">common toadfish</a> ("Tetractenos hamiltoni"); it is unclear with many records which species was being referred to, though those from <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and Tasmania belong to this species. This issue in the scientific literature was not fully resolved until 1983.

French naturalist <a href="Auguste%20Dum%C3%A9ril">Auguste Duméril</a> erected a new genus in publishing the species as "Aphanacanthe reticulatus" in 1855 from a description authored by his countryman <a href="Gabriel%20Bibron">Gabriel Bibron</a>, who had died suddenly, Later Latinised to "Aphanacanthus", it was linked to a presumed type species "Tetrodon reticulatus", from a manuscript by Bibron. In 1959, <a href="Yseult%20Le%20Danois">Yseult Le Danois</a> equated this species name to "Tetractenos hamiltoni", but New Zealand zoologist Graham Hardy later reviewed the specimens labelled as "T. hamiltoni" and found that they should be assigned to "T. glaber". The genus name "Aphanacanthe"—not "Aphanacanthus", as the original spelling takes priority—would have taken precedence over the current genus name "Tetractenos". However, it is a "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>" as it does not provide enough detail or information to diagnose or properly describe the species, since Duméril had only written a (French) translation of the genus name—αφανης "qui nе parait pas", ἃκανθα, "épine" ("with no thorns").

British ichthyologist <a href="Charles%20Tate%20Regan">Charles Tate Regan</a> described "Spheroides liosomus" in 1909 from specimens collected in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a>, <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders Island</a> and <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip</a>. He noted its lack of spines compared with specimens of "Tetrodon hamiltonii", and hence argued that it was a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist <a href="Gilbert%20Percy%20Whitley">Gilbert Whitley</a> equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the <a href="Combinatio%20nova">combination</a> "Spheroides glaber" in 1955, and later "Gastrophysus glaber" in 1964.

The smooth toadfish was assigned to the genera "Tetrodon" (now "<a href="Tetraodon">Tetraodon</a>") and "Sphaeroides", both of which became <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxa</a>. The smooth toadfish was assigned to several other genera after it became clear that it fell outside a more restricted definition of "Tetr(a)odon", including "<a href="Torquigener">Torquigener</a>". Recognising that the smooth and common toadfish were distinct enough from other species to warrant their own genus and that no valid genus name existed, Hardy reassigned the two species to the new genus "Tetractenos" in 1983.

Common names include smooth toadfish, smooth toado, slimey toadfish or smooth blowie. Along with related toadfish species, the smooth toadfish is known in Australia as a "toadie". "Gaguni" is a <a href="Tharawal%20language">Tharawal</a> name for toadfish in the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> region, the word recorded by <a href="William%20Dawes%20%28British%20Marines%20officer%29">William Dawes</a> as "ca-gone" in his 1791 diaries of the Sydney language.

With a <a href="Fish%20measurement">total</a> adult length of anywhere from , the smooth toadfish has an elongate body with a rounded back and flattened belly. The body narrows posteriorly to the slender tail, and its fins are all elongate and rounded. The <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> has 9 to 11 rays. The <a href="Fish%20fin%23AnchPectoral">pectoral fin</a> has 15 to 18 rays, the first of which is very short. It arises well below the level of the eye. The <a href="Fish%20fin%23AnchAnal">anal fin</a> has 7–9 rays and <a href="Fish%20fin%23AnchCaudal">caudal fin</a> has 11. The smooth toadfish has a small mouth with thin lips at its apex and a tiny chin. The round eyes are <a href="wikt%3Aadnate">adnate</a> (unable to rotate), their upper border is level with the profile of the back and the lower border is well above the mouth. In a slightly depressed area just in front of the eyes are two small nipple-shaped structures (papillae) that are the nasal organs. The openings face to the rear of the fish and are closed by flaps attached to the walls closest to the fish's midline. The first <a href="Branchial%20arch">pharyngobranchial gill arch</a> is elongated and narrow with many tiny teeth. The smooth toadfish has tiny spines that are entirely within the skin layer; these run along its back from the nasal organs almost to the dorsal fin, and along its sides from the eye to the pectoral fine, and along its underparts from behind its mouth to its vent. The skin is smooth even when the fish is fully inflated. It swallows water or air via a flap in its throat to swell itself up.

The base colour of the upperparts is pale tan to yellow-green, heavily marked with irregular brown spots in a reticulated pattern, and several broad dark brown bands, including ones between the eyes, between the pectoral fins and at the level of the dorsal fin. Reminiscent of a leopard's spots, the reticulated pattern continues on the upper lateral side along the body of the fish, becoming silver-white on the lower lateral parts. The chin and belly are white. The fins have a faint yellow-orange tinge, more noticeably in the tail fin. Fieldwork in Sydney waters found females to be larger and heavier than males. Smooth toadfish grow <a href="Indeterminate%20growth">steadily larger</a> as they grow older, with one long individual calculated to be 13 years old from examination of its <a href="otolith">otolith</a>s. Their <a href="gonad">gonad</a>s develop when they reach a total length of about . The smooth toadfish can be distinguished from the otherwise similar common toadfish by its lack of spines and its larger- and bolder-patterned markings on its upperparts.

The smooth toadfish is found along <a href="Australia">Australia</a>'s eastern and southeast coast, from <a href="Moreton%20Bay">Moreton Bay</a> in southeastern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> to <a href="Port%20Lincoln">Port Lincoln</a> in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> as well as <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a> and Tasmania. It is one of the most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of <a href="Port%20Philip%20Bay">Port Philip Bay</a>. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3 m (10 ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of <a href="seagrass">seagrass</a> beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the seagrass patches. They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1.5 m (5 ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5–6 m (11–20 ft). A South Australian field study on <a href="Wrack%20%28seaweed%29">wrack</a> and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing <a href="green%20algae">green algae</a>.

Although its movements are poorly known, tagging patterns indicate that the smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries. It can venture well into freshwater past <a href="Brackish%20water">brackish</a> areas. In 1964 a school of toadfish were found in the <a href="Lang%20Lang%20River">Lang Lang River</a> at the <a href="South%20Gippsland%20Highway">South Gippsland Highway</a>—34 km (21 mi) from <a href="Western%20Port">Western Port</a> Bay and well beyond tidal areas.

Its large range, abundance and stable population mean the smooth toadfish is classified as "Least Concern" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. Although no decline in numbers has been recorded, the effects of disappearance of its habitat—<a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s and seagrass beds—is unknown.

The breeding habits of estuary-dwelling pufferfish have been little researched in general. Fieldwork in the <a href="Hawkesbury%20River">Hawkesbury River</a> and tributaries north of Sydney found that the smooth toadfish breeds between April and July, building up fat stores in its liver from February to April beforehand.

The smooth toadfish has strong jaws that readily crush <a href="shellfish">shellfish</a> and crustaceans. It feeds predominantly on <a href="Benthos">benthic</a> (bottom-dwelling) organisms in the <a href="Substrate%20%28marine%20biology%29">substrate</a> of the bodies of water in which it forages. Its diet includes molluscs such as <a href="black%20mussel">black mussel</a>s, <a href="Plebidonax%20deltoides">pipis</a>, white sunset shells ("<a href="Soletellina%20alba">Soletellina alba</a>") and oysters ("<a href="Crassostrea">Crassostrea</a>"), crustaceans such as <a href="Heloecius">semaphore crab</a>s and <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a>, and <a href="brown%20algae">brown algae</a>. The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab ("<a href="Mictyris%20longicarpus">Mictyris longicarpus</a>") predominated in <a href="Cowan%20Creek">Cowan Creek</a> while the black mussel did so in nearby <a href="Berowra%20Creek">Berowra Creek</a>. Field experiments showed it was a consumer of oysters and the gastropod "<a href="Bembicium%20auratum">Bembicium auratum</a>", and had a major impact on their numbers.

Because it is a common <a href="estuarine%20fish">estuarine fish</a>, it has been used in studies of <a href="Heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a> contamination in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their <a href="hepatocyte">liver cells</a> may be more effective at removing these elements. <a href="Lead">Lead</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> and <a href="nickel">nickel</a> levels corresponded with those in the <a href="sediment">sediment</a> from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and <a href="selenium">selenium</a> in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water. Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased <a href="lipid">lipid</a> levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to <a href="organochloride">organochlorine</a> pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.

Notorious for taking bait from <a href="fish%20hook">fish hook</a>s, the smooth toadfish is an unwanted catch for anglers as its flesh is highly poisonous and unfit for human consumption. Its lack of spines makes it easier to handle than other toadfish when it inflates itself after being caught. Its toxicity had been reported by local aborigines in Sydney to William Dawes in the late 18th century. A man named John Buff was fatally poisoned after catching and eating toadfish in <a href="Duck%20River%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Duck River</a> in 1821 near Parramatta; his case and subsequent coroner's inquest were published in the "<a href="Sydney%20Gazette">Sydney Gazette</a>". The smooth toadfish was responsible for the deaths of the wife and two children of Captain Bell of <a href="New%20Town%2C%20Tasmania">New Town</a> near Hobart in a widely publicised case in March 1831. Colonial surgeon <a href="James%20Scott%20%28surgeon%29">James Scott</a> wrote,

An inquest into the deaths took place on 29 March 1831. The family's three servants, one of whom appeared to have been poisoned as well and was ill, were placed in custody separately to stop them communicating with each other while the investigation proceeded. The jury replicated the effects by feeding the fish to (and poisoning) two cats. The jury learnt that the servant, Speed, had caught the 20 or so fish and taken them home to eat. A neighbour called out to him not to eat the fish as they were "no good", but he took it as a joke. The inquest concluded with a finding of accidental death, with some deliberation over whether Speed should have been charged with manslaughter or even murder after hearing the warning. Warnings about toadfish were subsequently issued.

Its toxicity is due to <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a>, which is concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include <a href="ataxia">ataxia</a>, in addition to numbness and/or <a href="paresthesia">paraesthesia</a> (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.

Psilocybe aztecorum

Psilocybe aztecorum is a species of <a href="psilocybin%20mushroom">psilocybin mushroom</a> in the family <a href="Hymenogastraceae">Hymenogastraceae</a>. Known from Arizona, Colorado, central Mexico, India and Costa Rica, the fungus grows on decomposing woody debris and is found in mountainous areas at elevations of , typically in meadows or open, grassy conifer forests. The mushrooms have convex to bell-shaped <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> in diameter, atop slender cylindrical <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stems</a> that are up to long. The color of the caps <a href="hygrophanous">changes with variations in hydration</a>, ranging from dark <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> brown to straw yellow or whitish when dry. The base of the stem is densely covered with conspicuous white <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s, a characteristic uncommon amongst "<a href="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>" species.

The species was first reported by French mycologist <a href="Roger%20Heim">Roger Heim</a> in 1956 as a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "<a href="Psilocybe%20mexicana">Psilocybe mexicana</a>" before he officially <a href="species%20description">described</a> it under its current name a year later. Named for its association with the <a href="Nahua%20people">Nahua people</a> also called <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s, "P. aztecorum" may have been one of the sacred mushroom species, or "teonanácatl" (A <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> word translated variously as "sacred mushroom" or "flesh of the gods"), reported in the <a href="Aztec%20codices">codices</a> of 16th-century Spanish chronicler <a href="Bernardino%20de%20Sahag%C3%BAn">Bernardino de Sahagún</a>. The mushrooms are still used for spiritual ceremonies by Nahua Indians in the <a href="Popocat%C3%A9petl">Popocatépetl</a> region, although this traditional usage is waning. The variety "P. aztecorum" var. "bonetii" has smaller <a href="spore">spore</a>s than the main variety, and is found at lower elevations with <a href="Montezuma%20pine">Montezuma pine</a> ("Pinus montezumae") and <a href="sacred%20fir">sacred fir</a> ("Abies religiosa"). "P. aztecorum" may be distinguished from similar <a href="temperate">temperate</a> species such as "<a href="Psilocybe%20baeocystis">P. baeocystis</a>" and "<a href="Psilocybe%20quebecensis">P. quebecensis</a>" by their ranges, and by differences in the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of microscopic structures like <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>.

The species was first mentioned by French mycologist <a href="Roger%20Heim">Roger Heim</a> in 1956 based on material collected by American <a href="ethnomycologist">ethnomycologist</a> <a href="R.%20Gordon%20Wasson">R. Gordon Wasson</a> in <a href="Paso%20de%20Cort%C3%A9s">Paso de Cortés</a>, on the slopes of Popocatépetl mountain in Mexico. Heim originally named the species as a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of "<a href="Psilocybe%20mexicana">Psilocybe mexicana</a>"; limited to dried mushroom material for analysis, he only described the spores, which he explained were "relatively longer and narrower than that of "Psilocybe mexicana"". A year later, Heim renamed the fungus "Psilocybe aztecorum" and officially <a href="species%20description">described</a> it, in addition to several other Mexican "<a href="Psilocybe">Psilocybe</a>" taxa. Some of these mushrooms, including "P. aztecorum", were illustrated in the popular American weekly magazine "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" ("<a href="Seeking%20the%20Magic%20Mushroom">Seeking the Magic Mushroom</a>"), in which Wasson recounted the <a href="psychedelic%20experience">psychedelic visions</a> that he experienced during the <a href="divination">divinatory</a> rituals of the <a href="Mazatec%20people">Mazatec people</a>, thereby introducing psilocybin mushrooms to Western popular culture.

In 1978, Mexican mycologist and "Psilocybe" specialist <a href="Gast%C3%B3n%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Gastón Guzmán</a> <a href="Emendation%20%28taxonomy%29">emended</a> the description of "P. aztecorum" to include the color variation of the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> resulting from its strongly <a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a> nature, the <a href="Mycena">mycenoid</a> form, the <a href="rhizoid">rhizoid</a>s at the base of the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>, the <a href="lignicolous">lignicolous</a> habitat, and the size of the spores—all features that he thought were either confused, or not sufficiently detailed, in Heim's original description. In the same publication, Guzmán also characterized the variety "P. aztecorum" var. "bonetii", distinguished from the main variety by its smaller spores. He had originally described this variant as a separate species, "Psilocybe bonetii", in 1970. Further, Guzmán later published "<a href="Psilocybe%20natarajanii">Psilocybe natarajanii</a>", originally described by him from <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> in southern India, as a <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> of "P. aztecorum" var. "bonetii"; this putative synonymy, however, is confirmed by neither <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a> nor <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a>. Guzmán called the main variety "P. aztecorum" var. "aztecorum"; for this reason, the species authority is often cited as ""P. aztecorum" var. "aztecorum" R. Heim emend. Guzmán".

"Psilocybe aztecorum" is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of Guzmán's <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Aztecorum", a group of bluing (i.e., <a href="psilocybin">psilocybin</a>-containing) "Psilocybe" mushrooms characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white when dry; spores that appear asymmetrical when seen in side view; and <a href="pleurocystidia">pleurocystidia</a> that, when present, are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent). Other species <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> in section "Aztecorum" are "<a href="Psilocybe%20baeocystis">P. baeocystis</a>" and "<a href="Psilocybe%20quebecensis">P. quebecensis</a>".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "aztecorum" refers to the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> Indians of central Mexico, who used this mushroom in traditional ceremonies long before the <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish came to America</a>. The variety "P. aztecorum" var. "bonneti" is named after Dr. Federico Bonet (died 1980), <a href="emeritus">emeritus</a> professor of the <a href="Escuela%20Nacional%20de%20Ciencias%20Biol%C3%B3gicas">Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biológicas</a>, who assisted Guzmán with his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">doctoral</a> studies. The popular names of "P. aztecorum" are "niños" or "niñitos" (children or little children), or in the Nahuatl language "apipiltzin" which means "niños del agua" ("children of the water"), alluding to their habitat along <a href="ravine">ravine</a>s.

The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is convex to bell-shaped, sometimes developing a broad <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a> before expanding and flattening in age; it reaches a diameter of . In maturity, the cap eventually forms a central depression, and, in some old specimens, opens into the hollow stem. The cap surface is slimy to the touch, and has translucent striations along the margin when moist. The cap is strongly <a href="hygrophanous">hygrophanous</a>, meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration. The color ranges from yellowish brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish gray in age, with greenish-gray tints on the margin. The color later changes to whitish from the center to the margin, finally remaining completely white; dried specimens are straw-colored to pale brownish. In contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms, the cap of "P. aztecorum" does not have a strong bluing reaction upon injury—only the margin stains slightly green-blue.

The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are <a href="adnation">adnate</a> (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill) or adnexed (reaching the stem, but not attached to it), and are light violet gray to dark violet brown. They are either uniform in color, or have whitish edges. The hollow <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is by thick, equal in width throughout or thicker at the top, cylindric or sometimes flattened, and either straight or with turns and windings. Its surface is smooth, silky-<a href="wikt%3Afibrillose">fibrillose</a>, whitish to greyish, and stains blue-green irregularly when touched or in age. The base of the stem is densely covered with well-developed white <a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s. Young mushrooms have a white cobweb-like <a href="partial%20veil">partial veil</a> that does not last long before it disappears, although it sometimes remains as a non-permanent <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> on the upper part of the stem. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is whitish to yellowish or reddish yellow in the cap, or reddish brown in the stem, and shows little or no bluing reaction to injury. Like most of the bluing "Psilocybe" mushrooms, the odor and taste of "P. aztecorum" is slightly farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour) in fresh specimens; dried specimens have a more intense odor. A drop of dilute <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH) stains the cap, stem, and flesh reddish brown; sometimes, the stem does not stain or stains slightly yellowish red. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is blackish violet.

The spores are elongated-ellipsoid in face view, roughly terete (more or less cylindrical but usually tapering at both ends), slightly inequilateral or asymmetrical in side view—the so-called "mango" form. They typically have dimensions of 12–14 by 6.6–7.7 by 6–7.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>, although some spores have irregular shapes and are strongly elongated, up to 23 μm. Spores are thick-walled (generally between 1–1.5 μm), dark yellowish brown, and have a broad <a href="germ%20pore">germ pore</a>. The variety "bonetii" has smaller spores measuring 10–13 by 6–7.5 by 6–7 μm.

The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8 μm, and may be attached to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (<a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> on the edge of a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen bottle), with dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2 μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5 μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.

The subhymenium (a layer of cells immediately below the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) consists of spherical cells that are interwoven with <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e; this layer is hyaline to yellowish or brownish, and does not have <a href="pigment">pigment</a> crusted on the walls of the hyphae. The epicutis (the upper of two layers of the <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a>) is made of a thin gelatinous layer of hyaline or brownish hyphae measuring 1.5–2.5 μm in diameter. The hypodermium (the cuticle tissue layer under the epicutis) is hyaline, and has elongated to roughly spherical hyphae that are 10–18 μm in diameter. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present in the hyphae of "P. aztecorum".

"<a href="Psilocybe%20pseudoaztecorum">Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum</a>", found in India, differs from "P. aztecorum" in the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of the pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia. The characteristic filamentous neck present in the cystidia of "P. aztecorum" is absent in "P. pseudoaztecorum". "P. pseudoaztecorum" had been previously described by K. Natarajan and N. Raman as "P. aztecorum", but they published the taxon with a new name after consultation with Guzmán. Fresh specimens of "P. aztecorum" resemble "<a href="Psilocybe%20pelliculosa">P. pelliculosa</a>", but this latter species is found only in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> region of the United States and Canada. Like "P. aztecorum", the caps of the South African species "<a href="Psilocybe%20natalensis">P. natalensis</a>" also bleach to nearly white when dried. The closely related "<a href="Psilocybe%20baeocystis">P. baeocystis</a>" also bleaches in color to white when dry. Found in northwest North America from <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> to <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a> and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, "P. baeocystis" has thinner cheilocystidia than "P. aztecorum" (typically measuring 20–32 by 4.4–6 μm) and its pleurocystidia, when present, are found only near the gill edge. "<a href="Psilocybe%20quebecensis">P. quebecensis</a>", known only from <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, Canada, has pleurocystidia measuring 12–25 by 5–10 μm. Although the <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> of the species comprising section "Aztecorum" is not known with certainty, Guzmán has suggested that "P. aztecorum" was the ancestor of "P. baeocystis" in northwestern North America and of "P. quebecensis" in northeastern North America.

A <a href="lignicolous">lignicolous</a> species, "Psilocybe aztecorum" lives in and decays dead wood, leaves, sticks, or other similar organic debris. Mushrooms typically fruit in groups of 5 to 20, sometimes in bundles. Usual <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a> include wood debris buried in soil, twigs or very rotten logs, and, rarely, <a href="pine%20cone">pine cone</a>s. The mushroom is found in <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s (a low-density forest or wooded area that allows sunlight to penetrate to the forest floor) containing <a href="Hartweg%27s%20pine">Hartweg's pine</a> ("Pinus hartwegii") in addition to grasses such as "<a href="Festuca%20tolucensis">Festuca tolucensis</a>" and "<a href="Muhlenbergia%20quadridentata">Muhlenbergia quadridentata</a>", and the <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> plant "<a href="Alchemilla%20procumbens">Alchemilla procumbens</a>", at elevations of . Heim found the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> specimens at an altitude of in an alpine <a href="pine">pine</a> forest. "P. aztecorum" fruits from August to October.

"Psilocybe aztecorum" is known only from the high mountains of central Mexico, such as <a href="Trans-Mexican%20Volcanic%20Belt">Sierra Nevada</a>, <a href="Nevado%20de%20Toluca">Nevado de Toluca</a>, and <a href="Matlalcueitl%20%28volcano%29">La Malinche</a> in the States of <a href="Mexico%20State">Mexico</a>, <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a>, and <a href="Tlaxcala">Tlaxcala</a>. According to Guzmán, it is likely that the species also grows in other areas with high mountains, such as the States of <a href="Nuevo%20Leon">Nuevo Leon</a>, <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a>, <a href="Colima">Colima</a>, and <a href="Chiapas">Chiapas</a>, which have ecological conditions similar to those of the known localities. Variety "bonetii" grows in the same substrata as the type variety, mainly on <a href="humus">humus</a>, but only in forests with <a href="Montezuma%20pine">Montezuma pine</a> ("Pinus montezumae") and <a href="sacred%20fir">sacred fir</a> ("Abies religiosa"), between elevation; it has not been recorded from Hartweg's pine forests. Also known only from Mexico, in the states of Mexico and <a href="Morelos">Morelos</a>, and in the <a href="Distrito%20Federal%20de%20M%C3%A9xico">Federal District</a>, "P. aztecorum" var. "bonetii" usually fruits from August to November. According to Guzmán, "P. aztecorum" should be of <a href="Conservation%20of%20fungi">conservation</a> concern owing to <a href="habitat%20loss">loss</a> of its natural habitat.

"Psilocybe aztecorum" contains the <a href="psychoactive">psychoactive</a> compound <a href="psilocybin">psilocybin</a>. In 1958, Swiss chemist <a href="Albert%20Hofmann">Albert Hofmann</a> reported a relatively low concentration of 0.02% psilocybin, but this analysis was performed on two-year-old specimens. <a href="Jonathan%20Ott">Jonathan Ott</a> and Guzmán indicated the presence of psilocybin in the variety "bonartii". In terms of psychoactive <a href="potency%20%28pharmacology%29">potency</a>, <a href="Paul%20Stamets">Paul Stamets</a> rates "P. aztecorum" as "moderately to highly active".

The statue of the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> "god of flowers", <a href="Xochipilli">Xochipilli</a>, a 16th-century stone <a href="effigy">effigy</a> unearthed on the side of the volcano <a href="Popocat%C3%A9petl">Popocatépetl</a>, depicts a single figure seated cross-legged upon a temple-like base; his body is covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms. Circular patterns on his kneecaps, right forearm, and headdress have been interpreted by <a href="R.%20Gordon%20Wasson">R. Gordon Wasson</a> as stylized fruit bodies of "Psilocybe aztecorum". Wasson says that the convex shape and incurved margins depicted in these images show the mushroom caps just before maturity. "P. aztecorum" is, in addition to "<a href="Psilocybe%20caerulescens">P. caerulescens</a>", one of two mushrooms thought to be the species described by 16th-century Spanish chronicler <a href="Bernardino%20de%20Sahag%C3%BAn">Bernardino de Sahagún</a> as the "teonanácatl". The word "teonanácatl" () has been variously translated as "sacred or divine mushroom" or as "flesh of the gods". These mushrooms, considered holy <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s by the Aztecs, were consumed during spiritual and divinatory rituals to induce hallucinatory visions.

"Psilocybe aztecorum" is still used ceremonially by the <a href="indigenous%20people%20of%20Oaxaca">indigenous people of Oaxaca</a>, and by <a href="Nahua%20people">Nahua people</a> in the Popocatépetl region, although this usage is gradually diminishing. Traditional <a href="folk%20healer">folk healer</a>s, or "curanderos", maintain familiarity with psychoactive mushrooms (and other mind-altering plants used in ceremonial rituals), and diagnose illnesses by having the client ingest the mushrooms. One <a href="Mixe%20people">Mixe</a> "curandero" initiation ritual involves ingestion of mushrooms following a period of "abstinence from talking, sexual intercourse, and all foods except nuts for three days, whereupon the individual goes up to a mountain, subsists on nothing but a little honey, and prays to God for the power to heal."

Major urinary proteins

Major urinary proteins (Mups), also known as αu-globulins, are a <a href="protein%20subfamily">subfamily</a> of proteins found in abundance in the <a href="urine">urine</a> and other <a href="secretion">secretion</a>s of many animals. Mups provide a small range of identifying information about the donor animal, when detected by the <a href="vomeronasal%20organ">vomeronasal organ</a> of the receiving animal. They belong to a larger <a href="protein%20family">family</a> of proteins known as <a href="lipocalin">lipocalin</a>s. Mups are encoded by a <a href="gene%20cluster">cluster of genes</a>, located adjacent to each other on a single stretch of DNA, that varies greatly in number between species: from at least 21 functional genes in mice to none in humans. Mup proteins form a characteristic <a href="glove">glove</a> shape, encompassing a <a href="Ligand%20%28biochemistry%29">ligand</a>-binding pocket that accommodates specific small organic chemicals.

Urinary proteins were first reported in rodents in 1932, during studies by <a href="Thomas%20Addis">Thomas Addis</a> into the cause of <a href="proteinuria">proteinuria</a>. They are potent human <a href="allergen">allergen</a>s and are largely responsible for a number of <a href="animal%20allergy">animal allergies</a>, including to cats, horses and rodents. Their <a href="endogenous">endogenous</a> function within an animal is unknown but may involve regulating energy expenditure. However, as secreted proteins they play multiple roles in chemical communication between animals, functioning as <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a> transporters and stabilizers in rodents and pigs. Mups can also act as protein pheromones themselves. They have been demonstrated to promote <a href="aggression">aggression</a> in male mice, and one specific Mup protein found in male mouse urine is sexually attractive to female mice. Mups can also function as <a href="kairomone">signals between different species</a>: mice display an instinctive fear response on the detection of Mups derived from predators such as cats and rats.

Humans in good health excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 physicians and scientists have been interested in <a href="proteinuria">proteinuria</a>, the excess of protein in human urine, as an indicator of <a href="kidney%20disease">kidney disease</a>. To better understand the <a href="etiology">etiology</a> of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in <a href="animal%20testing">laboratory animals</a>. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including <a href="Thomas%20Addis">Thomas Addis</a>, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, it was not until the 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the <a href="liver">liver</a> of males and secreted through the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).

Since they were named, the proteins have been found to be differentially expressed in other <a href="exocrine%20gland">glands</a> that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include <a href="lacrimal%20gland">lacrimal</a>, <a href="parotid">parotid</a>, <a href="submaxillary">submaxillary</a>, <a href="Sublingual%20gland">sublingual</a>, <a href="preputial%20gland">preputial</a> and <a href="mammary">mammary</a> glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term "urinary Mups" (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.

Between 1979 and 1981, it was estimated that Mups are encoded by a <a href="gene%20family">gene family</a> of between 15 and 35 genes and <a href="pseudogene">pseudogene</a>s in the mouse and by an estimated 20 genes in the rat. In 2008 a more precise number of Mup genes in a range of species was determined by analyzing the <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> of whole <a href="genome">genome</a>s.

The mouse <a href="reference%20genome">reference genome</a> has at least 21 distinct Mup genes (with <a href="open%20reading%20frame">open reading frame</a>s) and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with <a href="reading%20frame">reading frame</a>s disrupted by a <a href="nonsense%20mutation">nonsense mutation</a> or an incomplete <a href="gene%20duplication">gene duplication</a>). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 <a href="megabase">megabase</a>s of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral "Class A Mups" and 15 central "Class B Mups". The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed through a number of <a href="Gene%20duplication%23Gene%20duplication%20as%20an%20evolutionary%20event">sequential duplications</a> from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means they are likely to be unstable and may <a href="copy%20number%20variation">vary in number</a> among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes, but what, if any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using <a href="Shotgun%20sequencing">current DNA sequencing technology</a>. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse <a href="whole%20genome%20sequence">whole genome sequence</a> with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.

Rat urine also contains <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> urinary proteins; although they were originally given a different name, α2-<a href="Alpha%20globulin">globulins</a>, they have since become known as rat Mups. Rats have 9 distinct Mup genes and a further 13 pseudogenes clustered together across 1.1 megabases of DNA on chromosome 5. Like in mice, the cluster formed by multiple duplications. However, this occurred independently of the duplications in mice, meaning that both rodent species expanded their Mup gene families <a href="parallel%20evolution">separately, but in parallel</a>.

Most other mammals studied, including the pig, cow, cat, dog, bushbaby, macaque, chimpanzee and orangutan, have a single Mup gene. Some, however, have an expanded number: horses have three Mup genes, and <a href="gray%20mouse%20lemur">gray mouse lemur</a>s have at least two. Insects, fish, amphibia, birds and <a href="marsupial">marsupial</a>s appear to have disrupted <a href="synteny">synteny</a> at the chromosomal position of the Mup gene cluster, suggesting the gene family may be specific to placental mammals. Humans are the only <a href="placental%20mammal">placental mammal</a>s found not to have any active Mup genes; instead, they have a single Mup pseudogene containing a mutation that causes <a href="RNA%20splicing">missplicing</a>, rendering it dysfunctional.

Mups are members of a large family of low-<a href="molecular%20weight">molecular weight</a> (~19 <a href="kDa">kDa</a>) proteins known as <a href="lipocalin">lipocalin</a>s. They have a characteristic <a href="tertiary%20structure">structure</a> of eight <a href="beta%20sheet">beta sheet</a>s arranged in an <a href="Antiparallel%20%28biochemistry%29">anti-parallel</a> beta barrel open on one face, with <a href="alpha%20helix">alpha helices</a> at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a <a href="Calyx%20%28zoology%29">cup-like pocket</a> that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydro<a href="thiazole">thiazole</a> (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-<a href="heptanone">heptanone</a> (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as <a href="pheromones">pheromones</a>—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an <a href="innate%20behavior">innate behavioural</a> response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male <a href="Urine%20spraying">urine scent marks</a>. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">variable sites</a> are located on the surface of the proteins and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.

Rat Mups bind different small chemicals. The most common ligand is 1-Chloro<a href="decane">decane</a>, with 2-methyl-N-phenyl-<a href="Acrylamide">2-propenamide</a>, <a href="hexadecane">hexadecane</a> and 2,6,11-trimethyl decane found to be less prominent. Rat Mups also bind <a href="limonene">limonene</a>-1,2-epoxide, resulting in a disease of the host's kidney, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>-droplet <a href="nephropathy">nephropathy</a>, that progresses to cancer. Other species do not develop this disorder because their Mups do not bind that particular chemical. Accordingly, when <a href="knockout%20mouse">transgenic mice</a> were engineered to express the rat Mup, their kidneys developed the disease.
The Mup found in pigs, named "salivary lipocalin" (SAL), is expressed in the salivary gland of males where it tightly binds <a href="androstenone">androstenone</a> and <a href="androstenol">androstenol</a>, both pheromones that cause female pigs to assume a <a href="Lordosis%20behavior">mating stance</a>.

<a href="Isothermal%20titration%20calorimetry">Isothermal titration calorimetry</a> studies performed with Mups and associated ligands (pyrazines, alcohols, thiazolines, 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone, and N-phenylnapthylamine,) revealed an unusual binding phenomena. The <a href="active%20site">active site</a> has been found to be suboptimally hydrated, resulting in ligand binding being driven by <a href="Enthalpy">enthalpic</a> <a href="dispersion%20forces">dispersion forces</a>. This is contrary to most other proteins, which exhibit <a href="entropy">entropy</a>-driven binding forces from the reorganisation of <a href="water%20molecule">water molecule</a>s. This unusual process has been termed the "<a href="nonclassical%20hydrophobic%20effect">nonclassical hydrophobic effect</a>".

Studies have sought to find the precise function of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins have been shown to promote <a href="puberty">puberty</a> and accelerate the <a href="estrus%20cycle">estrus cycle</a> in female mice, inducing the <a href="Vandenbergh%20effect">Vandenbergh</a> and <a href="Whitten%20effect">Whitten effect</a>s. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in <a href="transgenic%20bacteria">transgenic bacteria</a>, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote <a href="aggressive">aggressive</a> behaviour in males, even in the absence of urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate <a href="olfactory%20sensory%20neuron">olfactory sensory neuron</a>s in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific <a href="sensory%20receptor">sensory receptor</a>s, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.
Consistent with a role in male-male aggression, adult male mice secrete significantly more Mups into their urine than females, juveniles or <a href="castrated">castrated</a> male mice. The precise mechanism driving this <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">difference between the sexes</a> is complex, but at least three hormones—<a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>, <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> and <a href="thyroxine">thyroxine</a>—are known to positively influence the production of Mups in mice. Wild <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> urine contains variable combinations of four to seven distinct Mup proteins per mouse. Some <a href="Inbred%20strain">inbred laboratory mouse strains</a>, such as <a href="BALB/c">BALB/c</a> and <a href="C57BL/6">C57BL/6</a>, also have different proteins expressed in their urine. However, unlike wild mice, different individuals from the same strain express the same protein pattern, an artifact of many generations of <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>. One unusual Mup is less variable than the others: it is consistently produced by a high proportion of wild male mice and is almost never found in female urine. When this Mup was made in bacteria and used in behavioural testing, it was found to attract female mice. Other Mups were tested but did not have the same attractive qualities, suggesting the male-specific Mup acts as a sex pheromone. Scientists named this Mup "darcin" as a humorous reference to <a href="Fitzwilliam%20Darcy">Fitzwilliam Darcy</a>, the <a href="romantic%20hero">romantic hero</a> from "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a>". Taken together, the complex patterns of Mups produced has the potential to provide a range of information about the donor animal, such as <a href="gender">gender</a>, fertility, <a href="Dominance%20hierarchy">social dominance</a>, age, <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> or <a href="kinship">kinship</a>. Wild mice (unlike laboratory mice that are genetically identical and which therefore also have identical patterns of Mups in the urine) have individual patterns of Mup expression in their urine that act as a "<a href="barcode">barcode</a>" to uniquely identify the owner of a scent mark.

In the house mouse, the major MUP gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity. Wild mice breeding freely in semi-natural enclosures showed <a href="inbreeding%20avoidance">inbreeding avoidance</a>. This avoidance resulted from a strong deficit in successful matings between mice sharing both MUP haplotypes (complete match). In another study, using white-footed mice, it was found that when mice derived from wild populations were inbred, there was reduced survival when such mice were reintroduced into a natural habitat. These findings suggest that inbreeding reduces fitness, and that scent signal recognition has evolved in mice as a means of avoiding <a href="inbreeding%20depression">inbreeding depression</a>.

In addition to serving as social cues between members of the same species, Mups can act as <a href="kairomone">kairomone</a>s—chemical signals that transmit information between species. Mice are instinctively afraid of the smell of their natural <a href="predator">predator</a>s, including cats and rats. This occurs even in laboratory mice that have been isolated from predators for hundreds of generations. When the chemical cues responsible for the <a href="fear">fear</a> response were purified from cat saliva and rat urine, two homologous protein signals were identified: Fel d 4 ("<a href="Felis%20domesticus">Felis domesticus</a>" allergen 4), the product of the cat "Mup" gene, and Rat n 1 ("<a href="Rattus%20norvegicus">Rattus norvegicus</a>" allergen 1), the product of the rat "Mup13" gene. Mice are fearful of these Mups even when they are made in bacteria, but mutant animals that are unable to detect the Mups showed no fear of rats, demonstrating their importance in initiating fearful behaviour. It is not known exactly how Mups from different species initiate disparate behaviours, but mouse Mups and predator Mups have been shown to activate unique patterns of sensory neurons in the nose of recipient mice. This implies the mouse perceives them differently, via distinct <a href="neural%20circuit">neural circuit</a>s. The <a href="Vomeronasal%20organ%23Sensory%20epithelium%20and%20receptors">pheromone receptors</a> responsible for Mup detection are also unknown, though they are thought be members of the <a href="V2R%20receptor">V2R receptor</a> class.

Along with other members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary proteins can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known; however, <a href="molecular%20mimicry">molecular mimicry</a> between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse "Mup17" gene, known as Mus m 1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Rat n 1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered a risk factor for childhood <a href="asthma">asthma</a> and is a leading cause of <a href="laboratory%20animal%20allergy">laboratory animal allergy</a> (LAA)—an occupational disease of <a href="laboratory%20animal">laboratory animal</a> technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> to Rat n 1.

"Mup" genes from other mammals also encode allergenic proteins, for example Fel d 4 is primarily produced in the <a href="submandibular%20gland">submandibular salivary gland</a> and is deposited onto <a href="dander">dander</a> as the cat grooms itself. A study found that 63% of <a href="Allergy%20to%20cats">cat allergic</a> people have antibodies against the protein. Most had higher <a href="titre">titre</a>s of antibodies against Fel d 4 than against <a href="Fel%20d%201">Fel d 1</a>, another prominent cat allergen. Likewise, "Equ c1" ("<a href="Equus%20caballus">Equus caballus</a>" allergen 1) is the protein product of a horse "Mup" gene that is found in the liver, sublingual and submaxillary salivary glands. It is responsible for about 80% of the antibody response in patients who are chronically exposed to horse allergens.

While the detection of Mups excreted by other animals has been well studied, the functional role in the producing animal is less clear. However, in 2009, Mups were shown to be associated with the regulation of energy expenditure in mice. Scientists found that genetically induced obese, diabetic mice produce thirty times less Mup <a href="RNA">RNA</a> than their lean siblings. When they delivered Mup protein directly into the bloodstream of these mice, they observed an increase in energy expenditure, physical activity and body temperature and a corresponding decrease in <a href="glucose%20intolerance">glucose intolerance</a> and <a href="insulin%20resistance">insulin resistance</a>. They propose that Mups' beneficial effects on energy metabolism occurs by enhancing <a href="mitochondrial">mitochondrial</a> function in skeletal muscle. Another study found Mups were reduced in diet-induced obese mice. In this case, the presence of Mups in the bloodstream of mice restricted glucose production by directly inhibiting the <a href="gene%20expression">expression of genes</a> in the liver.

No. 1 Wing RAAF

No. 1 Wing was an <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> active during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The wing was established on 1 September 1917 as the 1st Training Wing and commanded the AFC's pilot training <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a>s in England until April 1919, when it was disbanded. It was reformed on 7 October 1942 as a fighter unit comprising two Australian and one British flying squadrons equipped with <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> aircraft, and a mobile fighter sector headquarters. The wing provided air defence to <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> and several other key <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> bases in <a href="northern%20Australia">northern Australia</a> until the end of the war, and was again disbanded in October 1945.

During its first months at Darwin, No. 1 Wing intercepted several of the <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Australia%2C%201942%E2%80%9343">air raids conducted against Northern Australia</a> by the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%20Air%20Force">Imperial Japanese Army Air Force</a> and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. Although the wing was hampered by mechanical problems with its Spitfires and suffered heavy losses in some engagements, it eventually downed a greater number of Japanese aircraft than it lost in combat. After the final Japanese air raid on northern Australia in November 1943, No. 1 Wing saw little combat, which led to its personnel suffering from low morale. The wing's two Australian flying squadrons were replaced with British units in July 1944, and subsequent proposals to move these squadrons to more active areas were not successful.

The 1st Training Wing was formed at <a href="Minchinhampton">Minchinhampton</a>, England on 1 September 1917. It commanded <a href="No.%205%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5</a>, <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6</a>, <a href="No.%207%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSquadron%20RAAF">No. 7</a> and <a href="No.%208%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 8 Squadrons</a> of the AFC. The wing's role was to train replacement pilots for the four operational AFC <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a> in Palestine and France. Each of the training squadrons provided replacements to a specific operational squadron; No. 5 trained pilots for <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No.1 Squadron</a>, No. 6 supported <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, No. 7 was aligned with <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> and No. 8 supported <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron</a>. By the time Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Oswald%20Watt">Oswald Watt</a> was appointed to command the wing in February 1918, its headquarters had moved to <a href="Tetbury">Tetbury</a>. In keeping with their varied responsibilities, the 1st Training Wing's squadrons operated a wide variety of aircraft and most were split between several bases. From the spring of 1918 No. 5 and No. 6 Squadrons were stationed at <a href="Aston%20Down">Minchinhampton Airfield</a> while No. 7 and No. 8 Squadrons were at Leighterton Airfield. Both facilities had been purpose-built for the AFC over the autumn and winter of 1917/1918. As of April 1918 the wing's units were manned by approximately 1000 personnel, making it the largest single body of Australian airmen anywhere in the world at that time. Watt proposed moving the 1st Training Wing to France, but this did not eventuate.

Following the war the 1st Training Wing continued to conduct pilot training courses in England. This activity was undertaken to strengthen the AFC and keep pilots and ground crew occupied until they were repatriated to Australia. Most of the wing's personnel were given leave in April 1919 and several of its pilots took part in a fly-past over <a href="London">London</a> on <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a>. The four training squadrons were disbanded on 6 May 1919, the day the wing left Minchinhampton to begin the journey back to Australia. The last entry in the 1st Training Wing's war diary had been made in April that year. Watt placed a strong emphasis on safety, but the 1st Training Wing's trainee pilots inevitably suffered flying accidents, resulting in at least 17 fatalities between 1917 and 1919. At least 15 other members of the wing died from disease or were killed in accidents on the ground.

In 1919 the AFC was disbanded and succeeded by the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a>, which was in turn replaced with an independent Australian Air Force on 31 March 1921 (the "Royal" prefix was added in August). The first proposal for the RAAF's force structure considered by the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> included two fighter wings, designated No. 1 Wing and No. 2 Wing, each comprising two fighter squadrons. In July 1920 the Air Council, which oversaw the Air Board, approved the establishment of a base at <a href="Laverton%2C%20Victoria">Laverton, Victoria</a>, to house No. 1 Wing and its component squadrons (No. 1 and No. 2 Squadrons) as well as <a href="No.%201%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 1 Aircraft Depot</a>. No. 1 and No. 2 Squadrons were formed in January 1922, but in July that year No. 2 Squadron was disbanded and No. 1 Squadron reduced to a cadre. The RAAF's proposed force structure was subsequently amended in 1924 so as not to include any fighter squadrons or wing headquarters.

On 20 September 1939 the <a href="War%20cabinet%23Australia">Australian War Cabinet</a> approved the formation of a RAAF Expeditionary Force for overseas service which would have included a wing designated No. 1 Fighter Wing as well as two wings of bombers. Under the approved structure for the Expeditionary Force, No. 1 Fighter Wing was to command No.7 and <a href="No.%2015%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 15 Squadrons</a>. This plan proved short-lived as on 20 October the Government announced that the formation of the Expeditionary Force would not proceed, with the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a> instead being the RAAF's main contribution to overseas campaigns.

At the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> in December 1941 the RAAF did not possess any modern fighters in or near Australia. Following the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">Bombing of Darwin</a> on 19 February 1942, which caused heavy damage to the military installations at the town and ships in its harbour, the Australian Government began to urgently look for fighter aircraft. As the Australian aviation industry was not capable of producing fighter aircraft at the time, the government sought assistance from Britain and the United States. Britain was initially unable to allocate fighters to Australia due to its heavy commitments in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a> and elsewhere. The US Government responded by providing the RAAF with what became a steady flow of <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawk</a> aircraft.

Japanese air units attacked the Darwin area multiple times during 1942. The P-40 equipped <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>' (USAAF) <a href="49th%20Operations%20Group">49th Fighter Group</a> was deployed to Darwin following the 19 February raid, and its first squadron became operational there in mid-March. The group's three squadrons were ready for operations in late April, and subsequently intercepted all Japanese daylight raids on the area. The 49th Fighter Group began to withdraw from Darwin in August 1942 and was replaced by two Australian P-40 squadrons; <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a> arrived in August and <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a> in October. During its time at Darwin the 49th Fighter Group shot down 79 Japanese aircraft and lost 21 P-40s. As well as bombing targets near Darwin, Japanese air units also occasionally struck other small Australian towns, attacked shipping sailing off the north coast and flew reconnaissance sorties over Allied bases.

In May 1942 the Australian Minister for External Affairs <a href="H.%20V.%20Evatt">H.V. "Doc" Evatt</a> travelled to the United States and Britain to seek additional aircraft for the RAAF. Evatt first visited the United States, where the government agreed to increase the number of aircraft it would provide to Australia. He then travelled to London and met with Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. In this meeting, Evatt requested that Britain provide an <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> to serve with the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>, and an allocation of Spitfire fighters for the RAAF. Evatt had not received advice from the RAAF on the Spitfire's suitability for Australian conditions, and appears to have assumed that it would perform as well in Australia as it had in Europe. While Britain could not spare an aircraft carrier, after several days of discussions Churchill agreed on 28 May to send three fully equipped Spitfire squadrons to Australia. The squadrons selected were <a href="No.%20452%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 452 Squadron RAAF</a>, <a href="No.%20457%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 457 Squadron RAAF</a> and <a href="No.%2054%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 54 Squadron RAF</a>, all of which had seen combat over Europe against the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>. Under the agreement each squadron would be initially equipped with 16 Spitfires and a further 15 aircraft would be sent to Australia each month as replacements. Churchill's role in sending Spitfire units to Australia led to No. 1 Wing often being referred to as the "Churchill Wing".
Delays in shipping Spitfires to Australia disrupted No. 1 Wing's formation. In late June 1942 the British Government diverted all but six of the initial 48 aircraft to Egypt to reinforce the three RAF Spitfire squadrons there after the German victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gazala">Battle of Gazala</a>; most of these aircraft were allocated to <a href="No.%2092%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 92 Squadron RAF</a> with the remainder forming a reserve to replace future losses. The Australian Government protested against this action, but reluctantly accepted it after Churchill refused to counteract the diversion. During the same period, the men of the three Spitfire squadrons sailed from <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on board the <a href="MV%20Stirling%20Castle">MV "Stirling Castle"</a> on 21 June and disembarked at <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> with the six remaining Spitfires on 13 August. A shipment of 43 Spitfires left England on 4 August and arrived in Australia in late October, and further deliveries continued to be made until June 1945.

The deployment of Spitfires to Australia was kept secret so that the Japanese were not alerted to their presence, and the Australian Government directed that the aircraft be referred to as Capstans (after the <a href="Capstan%20%28cigarette%29">brand of cigarettes</a>) and their <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Merlin</a> engines as Marvels. General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, the commander of Allied forces in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Area</a>, agreed that the Australian Government could choose when to announce the presence of the Spitfires, but warned against exaggerating the impact they were likely to have.

No. 1 Wing was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a> on 7 October 1942. Its initial commander was Group Captain <a href="Allan%20Walters">Allan Walters</a> and the <a href="wing%20leader">wing leader</a> was Wing Commander <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>, Australia's top-scoring <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> of the war. At this time the RAAF had received 71 tropicalised variants of the <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_%28early_Merlin-powered_variants%29%23Mk_Vc_and_V.C2.A0.28trop.29_.28types_349_and_352.2F6.29">Spitfire Vc</a> and another 33 were en route to Australia. These aircraft differed from the standard Spitfire Vc in that they were optimised for use in desert and tropical areas and had been fitted with a Vokes air filter beneath their nose to reduce the amount of sand and dust which entered the engine; Caldwell believed that this modification reduced the Spitfires' performance. As well as the three Spitfire squadrons, No. 1 Wing also included No. 10 Mobile Fighter Sector Headquarters. Many of the squadrons' most experienced pilots were posted to other units before they departed Britain, and only 37 of the 95 pilots in the wing as at May 1943 had previously seen combat.

Following its formation the wing undertook training in the Richmond area until late December 1942. Its performance during these exercises was hindered by a lack of previous contact between the Australian and British pilots which was exacerbated by the three squadrons being based at different airstrips in the Sydney region. Several accidents occurred, resulting in the deaths of four pilots. Richmond's base commander, Group Captain Paddy Heffernan, found that the veterans of the European theatre of operations "tended to consider themselves invincible", and reacted with disdain when he warned them that the Japanese <a href="A6M%20Zero">A6M Zero</a> could outmanoeuvre the Spitfire. On 29 December the wing held a formal dinner at RAAF Station Richmond which was attended by H.V. Evatt, Minister for Air <a href="Arthur%20Drakeford">Arthur Drakeford</a>, Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, and Group Captain Heffernan.

The wing was ready for combat operations at the end of 1942 and was assigned responsibility for defending Darwin against Japanese air attacks. The bulk of the units departed Richmond in air, land and sea parties during January 1943, following an advance party that had set out on 31 December. No. 54 and No. 452 Squadrons' air parties arrived at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">RAAF Station Darwin</a> and <a href="Batchelor%20Airfield">Batchelor Airfield</a> respectively on 17 January, and No. 457 Squadron began to operate from <a href="Livingstone%20Airfield">Livingstone Airfield</a> on 31 January. No. 452 Squadron subsequently moved to <a href="Strauss%20Airfield">Strauss Airfield</a> on 1 February. The Darwin area had been attacked 50 times by the time No. 1 Wing arrived. Conditions at Strauss and Livingstone were primitive, with these airfields comprising narrow dirt runways and tree-lined taxiways. The pilots were not familiar with operating from such under-developed airfields, and the squadrons at Strauss and Livingstone suffered a high accident rate during February and March 1943. The airmen also found the region's hot and humid climate to be oppressive. This was the first time that Spitfires had operated in a tropical environment, and the aircraft were found to have lesser performance than in other climatic conditions. The region's remoteness also contributed to supply difficulties, and No. 1 Wing continually suffered from a shortage of spare parts for its Spitfires. Despite these limitations to Spitfire operations, the wing's arrival improved the morale of Allied military units near Darwin and allowed No. 77 Squadron to be transferred from Darwin to <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> in New Guinea. No. 1 Wing first saw combat on 6 February 1943 when a No. 54 Squadron Spitfire shot down a <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-46">Mitsubishi Ki-46</a> "Dinah" reconnaissance aircraft near Darwin. Another Dinah overflew Darwin the next day but was not intercepted, and no further Japanese aircraft ventured into the area during the month.

No. 1 Wing engaged in its first large-scale battles during March 1943. On 2 March, No. 54 and No. 457 Squadrons intercepted 16 Japanese aircraft, which had attacked <a href="Coomalie%20Creek%20Airfield">Coomalie Creek Airfield</a>. Four of the raiders were shot down, two of them by Wing Commander Caldwell. This engagement led Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> to announce on 4 March that Spitfires were operational in Australia. His statement in the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> was greeted with cheers from the members of parliament present and No. 1 Wing received positive media coverage. Winston Churchill also took an interest in the wing's operations and sent a cable expressing satisfaction with its combat debut. On 7 March four No. 457 Squadron aircraft intercepted and shot down a Dinah about from Darwin. The entire wing intercepted a force of over 40 Japanese bombers and fighters that attacked Darwin on 15 March, shooting down eight raiders but losing four Spitfires and three pilots. No. 452 Squadron's commander, Squadron Leader R.E. Thorold-Smith, was one of those killed. Thorold-Smith was leading the wing at the time, and its attacks were uncoordinated for the remainder of the engagement as none of the other pilots assumed his responsibilities. Nine military personnel and five civilians were also wounded by approximately 100 bombs dropped on Darwin during the raid. The Spitfires used <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a>ing tactics during the battle, causing some to run dangerously low on fuel; the USAAF units previously based at Darwin had discovered that these tactics were not effective against the highly maneuverable Japanese fighters. No. 1 Wing did not see action again during March and April, and its flying was limited to training exercises which usually lasted for less than an hour.
The wing's <a href="Raid%20on%20Darwin%20%282%20May%201943%29">next battle</a> on 2 May 1943 led to controversy. On that day, 33 Spitfires intercepted a force of 27 Japanese fighters and 25 bombers after they attacked Darwin. No. 54 Squadron engaged the fighters while the other squadrons attacked the bombers. In the 25-minute engagement, the wing shot down between six and ten Japanese aircraft for the loss of five Spitfires. Five more Spitfires also made forced landings due to fuel shortages and three broke off after suffering engine failures; all but two of these aircraft were later repaired. Following the raid, General MacArthur's General Headquarters stated in its regular communique that the Allied losses at Darwin had been "heavy", a term it had not previously applied to fighting in the <a href="North%20Western%20Area%20Campaign">North Western Area</a>. This led to criticism of No. 1 Wing in the Australian media and the <a href="Advisory%20War%20Council%20%28Australia%29">Advisory War Council</a> requested that Air Vice Marshal Jones provide it with a report explaining the losses caused by mechanical problems and fuel shortage. In his report, Jones stated that the wing's equipment was in good condition and attributed its losses to tactical errors made by Caldwell, adverse weather conditions and the pilots' inexperience with their aircraft. Caldwell rejected this criticism of his leadership, and argued after the war that Jones had not properly investigated the engagement. To avoid further losses from fuel shortages the Spitfires were fitted with <a href="drop%20tank">drop tank</a>s and banned from dogfighting.

The raid of 2 May marked the start of an upsurge in Japanese aerial activity over northern Australia. A detachment of six No. 457 Squadron aircraft was deployed to <a href="Milingimbi%20Island">Milingimbi Island</a> on 9 May after the <a href="Milingimbi%20Airport">airfield there</a> was attacked. This detachment intercepted subsequent raids on 10 and 28 May, shooting down four Japanese for the loss of three Spitfires. On 20 June No. 1 Wing intercepted two Japanese raids on Darwin. While the raiders bombed the suburb of <a href="Winnellie%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Winnellie</a> and RAAF Station Darwin, the Allied fighters shot down nine bombers and five fighters and damaged another ten aircraft for the loss of two Spitfires. This was the most successful engagement fought by the RAAF over Darwin up to that time, and General MacArthur sent a congratulatory message to the defenders. The battle also received positive media coverage which restored public confidence in No. 1 Wing. The facilities which housed No. 54 Squadron's photographic and parachute sections were badly damaged during the raid, but the unit's ground crew did not suffer any casualties. Several days after the engagement Group Captain Walters was posted to take command of <a href="No.%205%20Service%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 5 Service Flying Training School</a> and Caldwell was appointed the wing's acting commanding officer. On 22 June No. 1 Wing was scrambled to intercept two large forces of incoming aircraft, but was subsequently directed by ground control to not engage them after it was determined that the Japanese force was made up only of fighters.
Air combat continued over Darwin in late June. The wing intercepted a further raid on the town on 28 June when 42 Spitfires were <a href="Scrambling%20%28military%29">scrambled</a> to intercept nine bombers escorted by nine fighters. In the subsequent engagement four Japanese fighters and two bombers were shot down; Allied losses were limited to a single Spitfire destroyed during a forced landing. Two days later, No. 1 Wing intercepted a force of 27 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi G4M</a> "Betty" bombers escorted by 23 Zeros which was en route to attack the USAAF <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a> base at <a href="Fenton%20Airfield">Fenton airstrip</a> and shot down six bombers and two fighters. The wing lost six Spitfires during this battle, including three to mechanical problems. Enough of the Japanese force made it through the defences to attack Fenton, and three USAAF <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a>s were destroyed and seven damaged. June had been the most successful month in No. 1 Wing's history, its strength declined considerably due to losses from combat and mechanical problems. At the end of June the commander of the North Western Area, Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>, requested 22 Spitfires from Vice Air Marshal Jones to bring the wing up to strength. In response, RAAF Headquarters stated that it would dispatch 17 Spitfires to Darwin during the next week and was preparing an additional 33 aircraft which had recently arrived in Australia.

No. 1 Wing saw further action in July 1943. On 3 and 4 July, Dinahs flew over the Darwin area without being intercepted. These preceded a major raid against Fenton on 6 July by 26 bombers and 21 fighters. The wing scrambled 33 aircraft to meet this force, and shot down nine of the raiders, losing seven Spitfires due to air combat or mechanical problems; a B-24 was also destroyed on the ground. The wing's high losses in this engagement were partially attributed to the worn state of the Spitfires' engines, and Bladin again signalled RAAF Headquarters to seek the immediate delivery of new aircraft. These began to arrive at No. 1 Wing's bases on 10 July. The attack on 6 July was the last major raid on the Darwin area, and the Spitfires saw little action during the remainder of the month and early August with flying operations limited to exercises and false alerts. By this time, the wing had been credited with 63 confirmed 'kills' and a further 13 probably destroyed. In exchange, it had lost 44 aircraft, though only 17 were due to Japanese action. The Japanese <a href="official%20history">official history</a> produced after the war praised the effectiveness of No. 1 Wing and the radar stations around Darwin, stating that from mid-1943 they were at "the highest level in the world". Nevertheless, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, who replaced Bladin on 22 July, assessed the fighter force near Darwin as not being adequate to counter an invasion, and noted that the Spitfires had been forced to break off some engagements after running low on fuel. To counter these perceived shortfalls he requested units equipped with long ranged <a href="P-38%20Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a> fighters. This request was not met, as all Lightning-equipped units were committed to the fighting in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.

In late July 1943, No. 1 Wing's headquarters was disbanded to make it easier to deploy the Spitfire squadrons to different areas as the need arose. Under the new command arrangements, the squadrons reported directly to the North-Western Area's headquarters for administrative purposes and <a href="No.%205%20Fighter%20Sector%20RAAF">No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters</a> controlled all fighter operations. This change also aimed to end the confusion which existed at the time between whether the wing leader or senior ground controller in the fighter sector headquarters was responsible for directing the Spitfires during battle. No. 5 Fighter Sector Headquarters was redesignated No. 1 Wing on 25 September when Wing Commander <a href="Peter%20Jeffrey%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Peter Jeffrey</a> assumed command from Caldwell, who had been appointed <a href="No.%202%20Operational%20Conversion%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 2 Operational Training Unit's</a> chief flying instructor. The headquarters' role remained unchanged.
In the meantime, No. 1 Wing continued to respond to Japanese aerial activity over northern Australia. On the night of 13/14 August 18 Japanese aircraft raided Fenton and Coomalie Creek airfields. No. 57 and No. 452 Squadrons scrambled Spitfires but they were unable to intercept the raiders. At this time the remainder of the wing was holding a dinner at Darwin to celebrate the anniversary of its return to Australia. No. 1 Wing had greater success on 17 August when it shot down all four of the Dinahs dispatched to the Darwin area that day; three were destroyed by No. 457 Squadron and the fourth by Caldwell who was flying with No. 452 Squadron. This success led to celebrations within the wing and Baldin sent the pilots a message congratulating them for "100 per-cent de-lousing Fenton. Appreciate the pageant". Another night raid took place on 20/21 August, but the ten Spitfires scrambled did not make contact with the 18 raiders. From August the Japanese bomber units mainly conducted attacks on the Darwin area at night so that their aircraft were not intercepted by Spitfires.

No. 1 Wing fought its last major engagements during September and November 1943. On 7 September, the Japanese dispatched a twin-engined reconnaissance aircraft escorted by 20 fighters to the Darwin area. The 48 Spitfires scrambled in response to this force were led by Flight Lieutenant Bob Foster. This was Foster's first experience in leading the wing, and he misdeployed No. 54 and 452 squadrons' aircraft, leading to them being 'bounced' by Japanese fighters. In the subsequent combat three Spitfires were shot down while the wing claimed one fighter destroyed and two 'probables'. No. 457 Squadron was able to gain a height advantage on the Japanese and shot down four fighters without loss. A further two night raids were made against Fenton on 15 and 27 September but the Spitfires scrambled in response were unable to find the bombers on either occasion. No. 1 Wing experienced a major turnover of personnel during September as pilots completed their nine-month tours of duty. This led to a loss of experienced airmen, but the new pilots were often better trained than the men they replaced. No attacks took place during October, and the wing did not make contact with the Japanese until 6 November when a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> of six Spitfires which been deployed to <a href="Kalumburu%2C%20Western%20Australia">Drysdale River Mission</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> on the 3rd of the month failed in an attempt to intercept a reconnaissance aircraft near the settlement. In the early hours of 12 November nine Spitfires were scrambled to intercept nine Japanese aircraft which were bound for Darwin and Fenton. Two Betty bombers were shot down over Darwin Harbour by Flying Officer John Smithson and no Allied aircraft were lost. Both these aircraft were commanded by senior officers, and their deaths led to the cancellation of further Betty bomber operations in the Darwin area.

The raid on 12 November 1943 was the last Japanese attack on northern Australia. In December the Japanese transferred several of the air units based in the islands north of Australia to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands to counter Allied offensives. Few Japanese aircraft were subsequently based within of Darwin, and the focus of the Allied forces in the North-Western Area shifted from defending northern Australia to attacking Japanese positions in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a> (NEI) and western New Guinea. As a result, No. 1 Wing had little to do and morale declined. Spitfires were scrambled in response to several false alerts during the last months of the year, but flying was heavily curtailed by the monsoon from November. Most of the wing's veteran pilots were posted to other units at the end of 1943 and were replaced with less experienced aircrew.

On 25 February 1944 Wing Commander <a href="Dick%20Cresswell">Dick Cresswell</a>, who had previously commanded No. 77 Squadron, was appointed No. 1 Wing's new wing leader. Cresswell's posting to this role was made upon the request of Jeffrey, who tasked him with reducing the wing's rate of flying accidents. Cresswell achieved this through instructing pilots to make 'power on' approaches and landings and having the Spitfires' wheels modified. On 8 March, No. 1 Wing was ordered to urgently dispatch No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons to the vicinity of <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, Western Australia in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force <a href="Western%20Australian%20emergency%20of%20March%201944">would raid the area</a>. Both squadrons arrived at <a href="Perth%20Airport">RAAF Station Guildford</a> on 12 March after a long flight in severe weather conditions during which one Spitfire crashed at <a href="Carnarvon%2C%20Western%20Australia">Carnarvon</a> and another made a forced landing at <a href="Gingin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gingin</a>. On the day of their arrival the two squadrons assumed responsibility for air defence of the Perth-<a href="Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia">Fremantle</a> area alongside the <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>-equipped <a href="No.%2085%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 85 Squadron RAAF</a>. No attack eventuated and the Spitfire squadrons were directed to return to Darwin on 20 March. During this period the Kittyhawk-equipped <a href="No.%2084%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 84 Squadron</a> was transferred from <a href="Horn%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Horn Island</a> to Livingstone Airfield to replace the Spitfires while they were at Perth; this unit arrived at Livingstone on 12 March and departed twelve days later. On 18 April the wing made <a href="strafing">strafing</a> attacks on Japanese positions in the <a href="Babar%20Islands">Babar Islands</a>. Later that month No. 452 Squadron converted to the more advanced <a href="Supermarine_Spitfire_%28late_Merlin-powered_variants%29%23Mk_VIII_.28type_360.29">Mark VIII Spitfire</a>. In May 1944, No. 1 Wing's headquarters and No. 57 and 457 Squadrons were deployed to <a href="Exmouth%20Gulf">Exmouth Gulf</a> in Western Australia to protect the facilities which had been established to refuel the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> before <a href="Operation%20Transom">Operation Transom</a>, during which it attacked <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> in Java. This deployment was hampered by a shortage of transport aircraft and inadequate facilities at Exmouth Gulf and the airstrips en route to the area. Cresswell also left the wing in May to become the wing leader of <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a>. On 12 June No. 452 Squadron aircraft shot down a Dinah. Despite the limited Japanese air activity, Air Vice Marshal Cole continued to regard No. 1 Wing as being "essential" to the defence of the North Western Area and in May reported that he could not release it for other duties.
No. 1 Wing was restructured from July 1944. On 1 July, No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons were transferred to <a href="No.%2080%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 80 Wing RAAF</a>, which had been formed to conduct offensive operations in the NEI under the command of Clive Caldwell. They were replaced by two British units; <a href="No.%20548%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 548</a> and <a href="No.%20549%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 549 Squadrons RAF</a>. This put the wing in a unique position: all of its flying squadrons were now British units. The new RAF squadrons had been formed in Australia, as a result of a further meeting between H.V. Evatt and Winston Churchill in July 1943, at which Evatt had requested additional RAF units. They were formed from British pilots and Australian ground crew at <a href="Lawnton%2C%20Queensland">Lawnton, Queensland</a> on 15 December 1943 but did not receive their Mark VIII Spitfires until April the next year. No. 548 Squadron was initially stationed at Livingstone Airfield, and its air echelon arrived there on 10 June after a flight in which four Spitfires made forced landings when they ran low on fuel. No. 549 Squadron's air echelon arrived at Strauss Airfield on 16 June and its rear echelon completed its movement from Queensland on 14 July. On 20 July, two No. 54 Squadron Spitfires operating out of <a href="Mungalalu%20Truscott%20Airbase">Truscott Airstrip</a> shot down a Dinah. This was the last Japanese aircraft to be destroyed over Northern Australia.

After July 1944, No. 1 Wing's combat flying was limited to occasional raids on Japanese positions. Aircraft from the wing strafed <a href="Selaru">Selaroe</a> in the <a href="Tanimbar%20Islands">Tanimbar Islands</a> on 5 September. After the raid Jeffrey told Caldwell that it had been conducted only as a means of boosting his pilots' morale. Caldwell believed that the danger of flying Spitfires to the edge of their range in such operations outweighed the benefits which could be gained, and did not allow his pilots to participate in them. Group Captain Brian "Blackjack" Walker assumed command of No. 1 Wing in October; he had previously served at Darwin as <a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron RAAF's</a> commander. From 24 October the wing's three squadrons were all stationed at Darwin's civil airfield, which was located from RAAF Station Darwin. On 27 November seven Spitfires, five of which were drawn from No. 549 Squadron, escorted <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a>s to <a href="Cape%20Lore">Cape Lore</a>, Timor and strafed the area before the bombers made their attack. This was the longest operational flight made by Spitfire fighters during the war.

Boredom continued to be a major problem for No. 1 Wing, and morale declined sharply in 1945 after No. 80 Wing left Darwin for the NEI and most of the Spitfires were grounded due to cooling system problems. Frustrations caused by a lack of opportunities for air combat were a common problem across the RAAF's fighter squadrons in the SWPA, and contributed to the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" of April 1945 when Caldwell and seven other officers attempted to resign in protest against their units being primarily tasked with attacking isolated Japanese garrisons. The Australian and British governments discussed replacing the RAF pilots with Australians or transferring the squadrons to a more active area, and in July 1945 Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">William Bostock</a>, who led <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, proposed transferring two No. 1 Wing squadrons to Borneo to operate in the ground attack role. This did not eventuate and the only action undertaken by the wing during 1945 was an attack made by six Spitfires on Japanese positions at <a href="Cape%20Chater">Cape Chater</a>, Timor on 3 June. Following the end of the war, No. 1 Wing's headquarters closed at Darwin on 12 October 1945, and the three British squadrons were disbanded on 31 October.

2009 U.S. Open Cup Final

The 2009 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup Final was played on September 2, 2009, at <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Memorial%20Stadium">Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium</a> in Washington, D.C. The match determined the winner of the <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">2009 U.S. Open Cup</a>, a tournament open to amateur and professional soccer teams affiliated with the <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a>. This was the 96th edition of the oldest competition in United States soccer. The match was won by <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders FC</a>, who defeated <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a> 2–1. <a href="Clyde%20Simms">Clyde Simms</a> scored D.C. United's only goal. <a href="Fredy%20Montero">Fredy Montero</a> and <a href="Roger%20Levesque">Roger Levesque</a> scored Seattle's two goals as the club became the second <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a> in <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS) history to win the tournament in their inaugural season.

D.C. United entered the tournament as the competition's defending champions. They had previously won the <a href="1996%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup">tournament in 1996</a> as well. Both Sounders FC and D.C. United had to play through two <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20qualification">qualification rounds</a> for MLS teams before entering the official tournament. Prior to the final, there was a public dispute between the owners of the two clubs regarding the selection of D.C. United to host it at their home field, RFK Stadium.

As the tournament champions, Sounders FC earned a berth in the preliminary round of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League</a>. The club also received a $100,000 cash prize, while D.C. United received $50,000 as the runner-up.

The U.S. Open Cup is an annual American soccer competition open to all <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">United States Soccer Federation</a> affiliated teams, from amateur adult club teams to the professional clubs of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a> (MLS). In 2009, Major League Soccer, which has teams that play in both the United States and Canada, was allowed to enter eight of its U.S.-based teams in the tournament. The top six MLS teams from the previous season qualified automatically, and the remaining two spots are determined by preliminary <a href="2009%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20qualification">qualification matches</a>. The eight MLS entries begin play in the third round of the tournament.

In 2009, MLS expanded into the Seattle market adding a new team to the league, <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC">Seattle Sounders FC</a>. As an <a href="expansion%20team">expansion team</a>, they had to play through the qualification matches before entering the tournament. Likewise, <a href="D.C.%20United">D.C. United</a> did not finish among the top six <a href="2008%20Major%20League%20Soccer%20season">2008 MLS teams</a>, and therefore had to play through qualification rounds before entering the official tournament.

Prior to their first qualification match against <a href="Real%20Salt%20Lake">Real Salt Lake</a>, Sounders FC coach Sigi Schmid asserted that the U.S. Open Cup was important to the club and that they were playing to win. Sounders FC played U.S. Open Cup home games at the <a href="Starfire%20Sports%20Complex">Starfire Sports Complex</a> in <a href="Tukwila%2C%20Washington">Tukwila, Washington</a>. The facility is smaller than the club's home stadium for league matches, <a href="Qwest%20Field">Qwest Field</a>, but Sounders FC representatives preferred the atmosphere at Starfire for smaller cup matches.

On April 28, 2009, Sounders FC defeated Real Salt Lake 4–1 in their first qualification match. <a href="Sebastian%20Le%20Toux">Sebastian Le Toux</a> scored two goals, and <a href="Roger%20Levesque">Roger Levesque</a> had three <a href="Assist%20%28football%29">assists</a> in front of a sold-out crowd at Starfire. Sounders FC hosted their second qualification match on May 26, 2009, also at Starfire, this time against the <a href="Colorado%20Rapids">Colorado Rapids</a>. Reserve player <a href="Kevin%20Forrest">Kevin Forrest</a> scored the only goal in the match as Seattle defeated the Rapids 1–0, securing their entry into the third round of the official cup competition as one of the eight teams representing MLS.

On July 1, 2009, Sounders FC traveled to Portland and defeated the <a href="Portland%20Timbers%20%282001%E2%80%9310%29">Timbers</a> of the <a href="USL%20First%20Division">USL First Division</a>, the team's <a href="Portland%20Timbers%E2%80%93Seattle%20Sounders%20rivalry">historic rival</a>, 2–1 in front of a sold-out crowd. Roger Levesque and <a href="Nate%20Jaqua">Nate Jaqua</a> both scored for Seattle. The following week, in a quarterfinal match at Starfire, Sounders FC defeated visiting <a href="Kansas%20City%20Wizards">Kansas City</a> 1–0 on a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty kick</a> in the 89th minute scored by <a href="Sebastien%20Le%20Toux">Sebastien Le Toux</a>. Three weeks later, on July 21, Sounders FC won their semifinal match 2–1 over the <a href="Houston%20Dynamo">Houston Dynamo</a> at Starfire. Seattle took the lead for good when <a href="Stephen%20King%20%28soccer%29">Stephen King</a> scored a goal five minutes into <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a>, sending Sounders FC to the cup final.

MLS clubs were first included in the U.S. Open Cup tournament in 1996. D.C. United won the tournament that year, and repeated their success in 2008. In 2009, the club began its title defense in the MLS qualification rounds. This meant that they had to win six games instead of the four needed to obtain the cup in 2008.

In their first qualifying match on March 28, 2009, they hosted <a href="FC%20Dallas">FC Dallas</a> at <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Memorial%20Stadium">RFK Stadium</a> in Washington, D.C. They defeated Dallas 2–0, with <a href="Helbert%20Frederico%20Carreiro%20da%20Silva">Fred</a> and <a href="Brandon%20Barklage">Brandon Barklage</a> scoring in the 21st and 66th minutes, respectively. D.C. United's second qualification match was also played at RFK Stadium, on May 20, 2009. In a high-scoring match against the <a href="New%20York%20Red%20Bulls">New York Red Bulls</a>, D.C. won 5–3. <a href="Chris%20Pontius%20%28soccer%29">Chris Pontius</a> scored two of United's five goals, qualifying D.C. for the third round of the official tournament.

On June 30, 2009, D.C. United began official cup competition against the <a href="Ocean%20City%20Barons">Ocean City Barons</a> of the <a href="USL%20Premier%20Development%20League">USL Premier Development League</a>. The match, hosted by United at <a href="Maryland%20SoccerPlex">Maryland SoccerPlex</a> in <a href="Boyds%2C%20Maryland">Boyds, Maryland</a>, ended with D.C. on top 2–0. As a fourth-tier club, the Barons lineup had featured amateur players while United's included only three regular starters. The match remained scoreless for 74 minutes before D.C. took the lead on a penalty kick by late substitution <a href="Christian%20Gomez">Christian Gomez</a>. One week later, on July 7, D.C. United hosted their quarterfinal match at the SoccerPlex again and defeated the <a href="Harrisburg%20City%20Islanders">Harrisburg City Islanders</a> of the <a href="USL%20Second%20Division">USL Second Division</a> 2–1. On July 21, 2009, D.C. United hosted another lower tier team in their semifinal match at the SoccerPlex. This time they defeated the <a href="Rochester%20Rhinos">Rochester Rhinos</a> of the <a href="USL%20First%20Division">USL First Division</a> 2–1. The match was tied 1–1 until the 82nd minute when <a href="Thabiso%20Khumalo">Boyzzz Khumalo</a>'s goal propelled D.C. into the cup final.

Both Seattle Sounders FC and D.C. United submitted bids to <a href="United%20States%20Soccer%20Federation">U.S. Soccer</a> to host the final. D.C. United's bid included a proposal to host the match at RFK Stadium, their home stadium in Washington, D.C. with a capacity of 45,596. Sounders FC's bid proposed to host the match at Qwest Field, their home stadium in Seattle, with a capacity of 32,400 for soccer matches. The procedure for selecting the winning bid was kept private. When D.C. United's bid was chosen, Sounders FC general manager <a href="Adrian%20Hanauer">Adrian Hanauer</a> expressed skepticism that it had been better than the Seattle bid. He further noted that if Seattle had hosted the match, it likely would have sold out. This prompted a reply from D.C. United president <a href="Kevin%20Payne%20%28soccer%29">Kevin Payne</a>, who argued that D.C. United had won the bidding process fairly, and said that he was offended by Hanauer's comments. Following this public disagreement, D.C. United launched a marketing campaign to sell more match tickets, which included a new web site, WeWinTrophies.com, which chronicled the club's history of titles as an original MLS franchise. The campaign also included an open letter in local newspapers stating that Sounders FC and its fans did not think D.C. deserved to host the match and declared D.C. fans as "the standard" for support in the league. Videos from local celebrities were posted on the team's official blog urging fans to attend the final. Ticket discounts and special pricing on <a href="concession%20stand">concessions</a> for the match were also announced as part of the special marketing effort for the cup final.

Prior to meeting in the U.S. Open Cup final, Sounders FC and D.C. United had met only once, on June 17 at Qwest Field in Seattle. In that meeting, Sounders FC squandered a 3–1 second half lead by allowing D.C. United to score two goals late in the match. It ended in a 3–3 tie.

Since 1996, when MLS teams were first included in the tournament, the home team had won nine times and lost only twice in the final match. Commenting on what his team brings to the game, Sounders FC coach <a href="Sigi%20Schmid">Sigi Schmid</a> stated, "We bring a clean slate. We haven't had any negative experiences in championship games, so we want to just build up a positive legacy for our team and we know we have a chance to make some history for our team. Every player knows that and that's something we want to try and do." D.C. United had previously won the U.S. Open Cup twice in 1996 and 2008 and this was their fourth appearance ever in the tournament final. D.C. United president Kevin Payne simply stated, "We want to win anything we enter."

Sounders FC general manager Adrian Hanauer commented on his club's desire to win the cup and a berth into the <a href="CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">CONCACAF Champions League</a>, "That's one step towards our stated goal of competing in the world club championships, because the winner of the CONCACAF Champions League wins a spot in the <a href="FIFA%20Club%20World%20Cup">World Club Championships</a>."

The 2009 U.S. Open Cup Final was played on September 2 at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. A total of 17,329 fans attended the match, 38% of the stadium's available capacity. Approximately 200 Sounders FC fans sat together in the upper deck. Both the travel distance and the mid-week scheduling made it difficult for Seattle fans to attend. Live television coverage was provided nationally by <a href="Fox%20Soccer%20Channel">Fox Soccer Channel</a>.

Both clubs had used a mix of reserve players and starting (first choice) players in previous tournament matches, but for the final neither team used reserve players in their starting lineups. Seattle took the field in a <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%234%E2%80%934%E2%80%932%20diamond%20or%204%E2%80%931%E2%80%932%E2%80%931%E2%80%932">4-4-2</a> formation while D.C United was in a <a href="Formation%20%28association%20football%29%233%E2%80%934%E2%80%933">3-4-3</a> formation. The match kicked off at 7:37 pm local time.

Five minutes into the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender <a href="Leonardo%20Gonz%C3%A1lez">Leonardo González</a> to receive a diagonal pass from <a href="Clyde%20Simms">Clyde Simms</a>. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Josh%20Wicks">Josh Wicks</a> parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a <a href="direct%20free%20kick">direct free kick</a> from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle <a href="midfielder">midfielder</a> Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate <a href="Freddie%20Ljungberg">Freddie Ljungberg</a>, whose shot on goal was barely saved by Wicks, who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of Wicks, who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.

As the players took the field for the second half, D.C. coach <a href="Tom%20Soehn">Tom Soehn</a> decided to replace <a href="Helbert%20Frederico%20Carreiro%20da%20Silva">Fred</a>, who had been a non-factor in the first half, with <a href="Santino%20Quaranta">Santino Quaranta</a>. In the 60th minute, Gomez, Pontius and <a href="Luciano%20Emilio">Luciano Emilio</a> combined inside Seattle's <a href="Penalty%20area">18-yard box</a> for a United opportunity, but Pontius mishit the shot, which resulted in an easy save for Seattle's goalkeeper, <a href="Kasey%20Keller">Kasey Keller</a>. Seven minutes later, another failed D.C. United opportunity resulted in a Sounders FC counterattack, where Freddie Ljungberg's shot was saved by Wicks. The rebound rolled in front of <a href="Fredy%20Montero">Fredy Montero</a>, who dove feet first and kicked the ball into the goal, giving Sounders FC a 1–0 lead. Following the goal, frustrated D.C. United goalkeeper Josh Wicks stomped on Montero's leg while he was still on the ground. After consulting with the <a href="fourth%20official">fourth official</a>, referee Alex Prus showed Wicks a red card for his behavior, dismissing him from the match. United's backup goalkeeper, <a href="Milos%20Kocic">Milos Kocic</a>, was substituted for Christian Gomez after the incident, and D.C. played with 10 men for the remainder of the match.

Despite being down a man, D.C. United controlled possession of the ball as the match progressed towards full-time. Just four minutes before full-time, Seattle's Sebastian Le Toux pushed D.C. defender <a href="Dejan%20Jakovic">Dejan Jakovic</a> off the ball, <a href="Dribble%23Association%20football">dribbled</a> in towards goal, and then provided a centering pass to teammate Roger Levesque who scored, extending the Seattle lead to 2–0. With time ticking away, United desperately threw every man forward and managed to narrow the scoring difference to one in the 89th minute when Simms kicked home a loose ball after a Quaranta free kick. During the five minutes of <a href="stoppage%20time">stoppage time</a>, D.C. continued with repeated crosses and shots attempting to get an equalizer.

In the end, Sounders FC was able to withstand D.C.'s late push for a 2–1 victory, becoming the second MLS expansion team in league history (<a href="Chicago%20Fire%20%28soccer%29">Chicago Fire</a> was the first) to win the U.S. Open Cup in their inaugural season. Players and coaches ran onto the field after the final whistle, jumped up and down together and hurried to a corner of the field to acknowledge the Sounders FC fans cheering in the upper deck.

In the post-game press conference, Josh Wicks discussed his ejection, saying: "It was a mistake on my part and I've got to learn my lesson. The fourth official made a call and the ref made the final decision. That was it. I've got no excuses for it. Tremendously, very, very disappointing." One month after the stomping incident, U.S. Soccer announced that Wicks would be suspended from the U.S. Open Cup tournament for five matches.

After the victory, many Sounders FC fans gathered at <a href="King%20County%20International%20Airport">King County International Airport</a> to greet the team as they returned to Seattle. The trophy was put on display at several events around Seattle in the weeks following Sounders FC's victory. On September 19, the cup was presented to Sounders FC fans to carry in the <a href="Seattle%20Sounders%20FC%23Supporters">March to the Match</a> prior to a Sounders FC league game at Qwest Field against <a href="C.D.%20Chivas%20USA">Chivas USA</a>.

By winning the U.S. Open Cup tournament, Sounders FC earned a berth in the preliminary round of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20CONCACAF%20Champions%20League">2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League</a>. Seattle also received the winner's $100,000 cash prize, while D.C. United received $50,000 as the tournament runner-up. Kevin Forrest, whose game-winning goal against Colorado allowed Sounders FC to qualify for the tournament, received a share of the prize money and a medal, despite being released by the team before the final.

In January 2010, the club's success in the U.S. Open Cup tournament was listed among the many reasons the <a href="Washington%20State%20Senate">Washington State Senate</a> passed a resolution honoring Sounders FC.

On October 5, 2010, Seattle returned to the <a href="2010%20U.S.%20Open%20Cup%20Final">final</a> and defeated the <a href="Columbus%20Crew">Columbus Crew</a> 2–1 to repeat as U.S. Open Cup champion. This time Sounders FC hosted the final at Qwest Field, drawing an attendance of 31,311 which broke the 81-year-old record for the event.

Norwich Market

Norwich Market (also known as Norwich Provision Market) is an <a href="Market%20square">outdoor market</a> consisting of around 200 <a href="market%20stall">stalls</a> in central <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, England. Founded in the latter part of the 11th century to supply <a href="Normans">Norman</a> merchants and settlers moving to the area following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>, it replaced an earlier market a short distance away. It has been in operation on the present site for over 900 years.

By the 14th century, Norwich was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the market was ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it provided a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the market was reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14th century, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15th century, a <a href="Norwich%20Guildhall">Guildhall</a> was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government and law enforcement. The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.

In the <a href="Georgian%20era">Georgian era</a>, Norwich became an increasingly popular destination with travellers and developed into a fashionable shopping town. Buildings around the market were developed into luxury shops and <a href="coaching%20inn">coaching inn</a>s. The eastern side of the market was particularly fashionable and became known as Gentleman's Walk. The area around the market had become very congested by the 19th century, but the council was unable to raise funds for improvement and few alterations were made. Because many of the market's stalls were privately owned, the council was unable to rearrange the market into a more rational layout.

Following the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the local authority began to systematically buy up all the stalls on the market, eventually bringing the entire market into public ownership. It was radically redesigned in the 1930s: stalls were arranged into parallel rows and a new <a href="City%20Hall%2C%20Norwich">City Hall</a> was built along the entire western side of the marketplace to replace the by then inadequate Guildhall. This new arrangement survived with few significant changes for the rest of the 20th century. By the 1990s, the market was becoming decrepit and, in 2003, proposals were made for another radical rebuilding of the area. These proposals were extremely controversial and were abandoned in 2004 in favour of a scheme which retained the parallel rows of stalls, but replaced the old stalls with steel units of four stalls each. The rebuilt market was completed in early 2006 and is one of the largest markets in Britain.

The <a href="county%20town">county town</a> of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> is a city on the <a href="River%20Wensum">River Wensum</a> in the <a href="East%20of%20England">East of England</a>. Its origins are unclear, but by the reign of <a href="%C3%86thelstan">King Æthelstan</a> (924–939) the city was a major trading centre and one of the most important <a href="Ancient%20borough">boroughs</a> in England. The <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> settlement was centred around <a href="Tombland">Tombland</a>, a large open space at the point where the roads into Norwich converged. The plain of Tombland was the site of Norwich's market.
Following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a> (1066–1071), Norwich was radically redesigned. <a href="Norwich%20Cathedral">Norwich Cathedral</a> was built immediately to the east of Tombland and much of the old town to the southwest of Tombland was cleared for the <a href="motte">motte</a> of <a href="Norwich%20Castle">Norwich Castle</a>. A new Norman town was built west of the Castle, in an area known as Mancroft. The new town at Mancroft included a market of its own to provide for the Norman settlers and merchants moving into the area, and possibly also to supply the castle's garrison. The exact date of the foundation of the market at Mancroft is not recorded, but it is known to have been operational by the time the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> was compiled in 1086. Granting the right to trade in Norman England was a part of the <a href="Royal%20Prerogative">Royal Prerogative</a> and, as with most fairs and markets of the period, the market at Mancroft was operated under licence from the King. The <a href="King%27s%20Clerk">King's Clerk</a> had jurisdiction over all trade conducted at the market, and tolls and rents were collected on behalf of the King.

Almost no records survive of the Norman market in the 11th to 13th centuries. It is known that shortly after the market's establishment, a <a href="toll%20house">tollhouse</a> was built nearby, which served as a collection point for taxes on trade. Although the precise location of the tollhouse is not recorded, it was immediately north of the market on part of the site now occupied by the Guildhall. At some point soon after its construction, the tollhouse also became the centre for the civil administration of the city. Although the Tombland market retained its charter to host an annual horse fair, over time the market at Mancroft supplanted that at Tombland as the principal market of the area. At the end of the 11th century, the Tombland market was removed during construction work on Norwich Cathedral.
By the start of the 14th century, Norwich was one of Europe's major cities. <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> was at this time one of the most densely populated areas in England, producing large amounts of grain, sheep, cattle and poultry. Much of this produce was traded in <a href="Port%20of%20Norwich">Norwich, an inland port</a> roughly at the centre of the region. The City, meanwhile, had industrialised, its growth based on textiles, leather and metalworking, as well as being the administrative centre of the region. By 1300, Norwich had a population of between 6,000–10,000, with a total of around 20,000 people living in the area. (One 19th century historian estimated Norwich's population pre-1349 at as high as 70,000.) It was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the country, and was considered the second city of England. Aside from occasional <a href="fair">fair</a>s, the majority of all goods produced in or imported to the region passed through the market at Mancroft. While there is some evidence that the market operated daily for a period around 1300, it generally operated on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The market had by this time taken on roughly the layout it retains today. It was a long rectangular open space aligned north–south, with the tollhouse (the Guildhall after 1413) marking the northern end and the very large church of <a href="St%20Peter%20Mancroft">St Peter Mancroft</a> marking the southern end. (St Peter Mancroft was built in 1430–55 incorporating an earlier church built in 1075 and was financed by the market's merchants. It retains its association with the market; all stallholders retain the right to hold their weddings in the church and to be buried in the churchyard.) The marketplace sloped downwards from west to east. A long straight passageway called the Nethererowe or Nether Row (later renamed Gentleman's Walk) marked the eastern boundary. Another passage called the Overerowe, or Over Row (later renamed St Peter's Street, and since 1938 occupied by <a href="City%20Hall%2C%20Norwich">City Hall</a>), marked the western boundary.

The mediaeval market was divided into sections, each dealing with a particular trade. The stalls of the market were arranged in rows. They varied in width from to . Highly valuable, in the early years of the market they were generally owned by major institutions such as trade guilds and religious bodies, and generated a high income from rents. They also provided a steady income for the King, and later the city, from <a href="Ground%20rent">perpetual rents</a>. The marketplace was surrounded by retail buildings, construction of which began in about 1300. These were fixed, permanent structures, some of which had multiple storeys and cellars.

The northern section of the main market place, immediately south of the tollhouse, housed <a href="fishmonger">fishmonger</a>s, butchers, <a href="ironmonger">ironmonger</a>s and <a href="wool">wool</a>sellers. This section of the market also housed the <a href="murage">murage</a> loft after 1294, where tolls to fund the building of Norwich's <a href="city%20walls">city walls</a> were collected. The southern section of the main market place, north of St Peter Mancroft, housed a bread market and a number of stalls associated with Norwich's significant cloth and leather industries. A broad space between the main marketplace and the Nethererowe was kept clear for the use of country <a href="smallholder">smallholder</a>s, who would set up temporary booths and tents to sell their wares.

South of St Peter Mancroft was a second marketplace dealing in wheat, poultry, cattle and sheep. Pigs, horses, timber and dye were not traded in the main market, but had dedicated markets elsewhere in the city. (The modern Norwich place names of Timberhill, St John Maddermarket and Rampant Horse Street derive from their origins as the sites of the mediaeval timber, dye and horse markets respectively.)

In 1341, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">King Edward III</a> visited Norwich for a <a href="jousting">jousting</a> tournament, coinciding with the completion of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, <a href="Isabella%20of%20France">Isabella of France</a>, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city in perpetuity. The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's <a href="bailiff">bailiff</a>s (the rulers of the city).

With the powers of the King's Clerk abolished, the bailiffs of Norwich set about regulating the operation of the market for what they felt was the greatest benefit to the city. To encourage fair competition among the market's traders, it was forbidden to sell foodstuffs before the Cathedral bell had tolled for <a href="Lady%20Mass">Lady Mass</a> (6.00 am). The practice of <a href="forestalling">forestalling</a> (meeting merchants on their way to the market either to buy their goods for resale, or to prevent them from attending the market and thus make goods of the type they were selling scarce and hence more expensive) was forbidden. Trading anywhere other than in the market was strongly discouraged and the right to re-sell goods at a profit was restricted to <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City">Freemen of the city</a>. The prices of bread and beer were fixed, and a set of standardised weights and measures was introduced, against which measures used by merchants would regularly be checked. Shortly after the transfer of the market to the city a <a href="market%20cross">market cross</a> was erected near the centre of the main market (opposite the present day entrance to Davey Place), the design of which is not recorded.
In mid-1348, the outbreak of <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> known as the <a href="Great%20Mortality">Great Mortality</a> (later referred to as the Black Death), which had swept across Europe during the past year, reached England for the first time with an outbreak in the south coast port of <a href="Melcombe%20Regis">Melcombe</a>. The plague spread gradually over the rest of the country with devastating effect, causing a mortality estimated at between 30%–45%. In late March 1349, the outbreak reached East Anglia and, for reasons which are not understood, increased drastically in intensity. In 1349–50 alone, more than half the population of East Anglia died. In 1369, East Anglia, whose farming economy had collapsed in the wake of the plague, was struck by famine.

Although the market continued to operate, in the immediate aftermath of the plague it was at a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's <a href="churchyard">churchyard</a>. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by <a href="draper">draper</a>s and <a href="linen">linen</a> merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.

Although social order was maintained throughout the plague years, the economy of the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, in the wake of the catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along <a href="King%20Street%2C%20Norwich">King Street</a> near <a href="Dragon%20Hall%2C%20Norwich">Dragon Hall</a> in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded there. This ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.

The market soon began to recover from the plague years to become a major trading hub again. Records of 1565 show 37 butchers' stalls alone in the market, and Norwich also became a major centre for the import of exotic foods. Sugar, figs and prunes were traded in the market in the 16th century, and it is recorded that 20,000 oranges and 1,000 lemons were provided for the 1581 <a href="St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Day">St Bartholomew's Day</a> fair.

In 1404, Norwich secured a <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> granting it autonomy as "The County of the City of Norwich". The local council was restructured into a body headed by a Mayor and administered by <a href="Sheriff">Sheriff</a>s and <a href="Aldermen">Aldermen</a>; the Mayor also formally became Clerk of the Markets, but in practice the running of the markets was always delegated to deputies.

By this time, the tollhouse was proving inadequate as the seat of local government and between 1407 and 1413 it was demolished, along with an adjoining site which had housed a vegetable market, and was replaced by a new <a href="Norwich%20Guildhall">Guildhall</a>. In keeping with Norwich's status, it was one of the largest civic buildings in England outside London and housed all aspects of local government and justice for the new council. The Guildhall cost between £400–£500 to build. (As it was built primarily using <a href="Unfree%20labour">pressed labour</a>, modern equivalents of the building costs are virtually meaningless. The annual income of the city council at the time the Guildhall was built was around £120.) The eastern face of the Guildhall was built in a distinctive black and white checked design, representing the <a href="exchequer">exchequer</a>. The <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> of the tollhouse was retained for use as a <a href="dungeon">dungeon</a>, while a new basement served as a <a href="Village%20lock-up">lock-up</a> from the opening of the Guildhall until the 1980s.

The murage loft in the market, redundant since the completion of the city walls, took over the functions of the old tollhouse and became the offices of the market supervisor and the collection office for market tolls and taxes.

Between 1501 and 1503, Mayor John Rightwise had the original market cross demolished and replaced with an elaborate new cross. This was octagonal in shape, stood on a plinth wide, and rose to a height of . The central structure contained an <a href="Oratory%20%28worship%29">oratory</a>, occupied by a priest.
Rightwise's new market cross only survived in its original form for a short time. During the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> of the 1530s, the <a href="rood">rood</a> on the <a href="pinnacle">pinnacle</a> was pulled down and the oratory became a storeroom. The octagonal plinth became a shopping arcade of small stalls. In 1549, a temporary <a href="gallows">gallows</a> was erected at the cross for the mass execution of 60 of the participants in <a href="Kett%27s%20Rebellion">Kett's Rebellion</a>, who had congregated in the marketplace during their brief capture of Norwich. In 1574, a local law was enacted demanding that all unemployed men were to assemble at the market cross each morning at 5.00 am, along with the tools of their trade, and remain there for an hour in the hope that they would be offered work; a <a href="bonesetter">bonesetter</a> was hired to treat any men who claimed they were unfit for work through injury. The success of this scheme is not recorded.

By the 17th century, the building was known as the Market House, and was used for the sale of grain and other goods sold by the <a href="bushel">bushel</a>; a set of approved measures were chained to the pillars for public use. The archaic title of "Keeper of the Cross" was bestowed on the man appointed to sweep the marketplace weekly.

The market cross also served as the focal point of Norfolk's <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliamentary</a> elections. Candidates would bring large crowds of voters in by cart from the surrounding countryside and ply them with large quantities of free alcohol to ensure their support. Candidates would pay for lodgings for the voters, but, in closely fought elections, more voters than usual would be shipped in and every <a href="inn">inn</a> in the city would fill, forcing voters to sleep in and around the cross. <a href="Thomas%20Browne">Sir Thomas Browne</a> described the voters around the market cross as "like flocks of sheep" during the unusually close elections of 1678, at the height of the <a href="Exclusion%20Crisis">Exclusion Crisis</a>. Following the counting of the vote, the winning candidate would be carried three times around the market, followed by torch-bearers and trumpeters. By this time, the crowds would generally be extremely drunk on the liquor provided by the candidates, and elections would often degenerate into drunken revelry or fighting.

Although it was popular with travelling vendors, particularly of small fancy goods, the maintenance of the market cross was costly and unpopular with Norwich's citizens. In 1732 the cross was demolished, and the stone was sold for £125. In 2005 the base of the cross was rediscovered in excavations during renovation of the market area, but has since been re-covered. Its site is now outlined in red stones embedded in the market floor.

With few fixed structures in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a public open space on days when the market was not operational. Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession of the <a href="Craft%20Guild">Craft Guild</a>s at <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20%28feast%29">Corpus Christi</a>. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution of many of the mediaeval guilds, and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.

The inauguration ceremony was conducted by the civic authorities and by the surviving, and still powerful, Guild of St George, and combined elements of a public festival and a religious carnival. Four <a href="whiffler">whiffler</a>s (city officials carrying swords) marched ahead of the procession to clear a path. Behind the whifflers, the incoming and outgoing mayors rode side-by-side, preceded by trumpeters and standard-bearers carrying the banners of England and St George, and followed by the city's Sheriffs and Aldermen in ceremonial gowns of violet and red, respectively. The procession was flanked by the city's <a href="Wait%20%28musician%29">waits</a> (musicians playing loud wind instruments, usually the <a href="shawm">shawm</a>) (a mediaeval double reed wind instrument with conical wooden body), and accompanied by <a href="dick%20fool">dick fool</a>s (clowns carrying wands and wearing red and yellow gowns adorned with bells and cats' tails) and a man costumed as a dragon.

As well as the mayoral inaugurations, the marketplace was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their windows with lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18th century, temporary <a href="triumphal%20arch">triumphal arch</a>es would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.

The market was also the location for public punishment of wrongdoers, and <a href="stocks">stocks</a> and a <a href="pillory">pillory</a> were set at a prominent position at the eastern end of the Guildhall. The stocks were used for the punishment of relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations on the price of bread, public brawling or incivility to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as <a href="sedition">sedition</a>. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory their ears were cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.

By the 17th century, the market had also become the venue for many travelling entertainments. Exotic animals were displayed, including lions, tigers, camels and jackals, and displays by conjurers, puppeteers, singers, acrobats and other entertainers also regularly took place. Displays of human deformities were also popular; records exist from the 1670s and 1680s of the Mayor granting exhibition licences to, among others, "a monstrous man with 2 bodies brought from the Indies by Sir <a href="Thomas%20Grantham">Thomas Grantham</a>", "a girl of sixteen with no bones", "a monstrous hayrie child", and "a monstrous man taken from amongst the hills of <a href="Corinthia">Corinthia</a>, he feeds on the roots of trees etc". Stages erected by <a href="charlatan">charlatan</a>s selling medicines and demonstrating miracle cures were often erected near the Guildhall, prompting regular complaints from fishmongers that the crowds were blocking access to their stalls; on at least one occasion one of these travelling doctors had his licence withdrawn 'because of possible damage to the city's economy by the distraction of "idle minds" from their work'.

Improvements in Norfolk's road infrastructure and the development of the <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> system made Norwich an increasingly popular destination with travellers. Norwich was recovering from the plague years and was a major city, with attractions and social events second only to London itself. The increasingly prosperous country landowners of Norfolk and <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> began visiting Norwich more frequently and staying for longer when they did so.

By the end of the 17th century many of the strict regulations regarding trade in Norwich were lifted or relaxed, and Norwich became a fashionable shopping town. Shops catering for the growing wealthy classes, such as booksellers, vintners and gunsmiths, grew around the market plain, especially in the large buildings along the eastern side of the market, the Nethererowe, which became so popular with the gentry it became known as Gentleman's Walk. Gentleman's Walk acquired a number of luxury shops, including John Toll's drapers from which <a href="Elizabeth%20Fry">Elizabeth Gurney</a> (later Elizabeth Fry) watched the <a href="British%20general%20election%2C%201796">election of 1796</a>, the wine and spirit dealership of <a href="Thomas%20Bignold">Thomas Bignold</a> who in company with other local shopkeepers founded a mutual association to provide fire insurance for the area's shops which became <a href="Norwich%20Union">Norwich Union</a>, and Saunders Coffee House, patronised by the young <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio</a> and <a href="William%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Earl%20Nelson">William Nelson</a>.

By this time, a row of stalls bordering on St Peter Mancroft's churchyard had developed into a row of three and four-storey houses running east to west, and a second row of buildings running north to south ran through the main market square. This row of houses cut off the main market from the eastern strip housing the butchers and fishmongers, known as the Upper Market, leaving only two narrow passageways as direct links between the two-halves of the market square. (Although the buildings dividing the upper and lower markets were demolished in the 1930s, one of these connecting passages survives as Pudding Lane. The name "Pudding Lane" derives from "ped", an archaic word for the large baskets from which itinerant traders sold goods in the market.)

With increased numbers of people visiting Norwich, trade boomed in the inns around the marketplace. In addition to the existing taverns, at least four very large <a href="coaching%20inn">coaching inn</a>s opened along Gentleman's Walk. By the latter half of the 18th century stagecoaches were leaving one or other of the inns almost daily to London, and the inns also served as the hub of a network of frequent services throughout East Anglia.
Built around long narrow yards, as well as serving food and drink and providing lodgings, these coaching inns also served as temporary warehouses, auction rooms and gambling halls for travellers doing business in the market. The best known was the Angel, parts of which dated to the 15th century. As well as providing the other functions of the Norwich inns, its yard also served as a popular theatre and venue for other performers. (Despite its significance as a city, Norwich did not have a dedicated theatre until 1758.) However, in 1699 part of the building collapsed during a performance by <a href="Thomas%20Doggett">Thomas Doggett</a>'s troupe of players, killing a woman and injuring many of the audience. The reputation of the Angel was severely damaged, and although still used for small-scale entertainments such as puppet shows, it was never again used for full-scale theatrical performances.

Meanwhile, the livestock market south of St Peter Mancroft was becoming overwhelmingly crowded on market days. Eventually part of the eastern side of the castle mound was levelled, and in 1738 the livestock sales were moved to this new site. The old hay market remained on the old site for more than a century, until it was also moved to the new livestock market site in the early 19th century. The new livestock market was one of the last significant livestock markets in a British city centre, and developed a reputation as "the cruellest in the country".

The relocation of the livestock market had done little to resolve the problems of congestion in and around the market. Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport, and the narrow alleys were also dark, dangerous and mostly unpaved. Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18th century, this had been with flint pebble <a href="cobblestone">cobblestone</a>s which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse. William Chase, editor of the first Norwich Directory, lobbied in the late 18th century for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market. However, the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry, which had suffered badly from the loss of export markets during the <a href="French%20Wars">French Wars</a>, and funds for improvements were limited. By the beginning of the 19th century the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman's Walk. In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the problems facing the area, but little action was taken. Local councils had no powers to levy <a href="Rates%20%28tax%29">rates</a> to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents, via public appeals, or through long term borrowing, and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds.
In 1813 the yard of the King's Head coaching inn was widened to create Davey Place, a new street between the market and Back of the Inns, at that time a narrow passageway which ran parallel to Gentleman's Walk behind the coaching inns. (Although the inns no longer remain, Back of the Inns survives as a street name.) In 1820 the Gasolier, Norwich's first <a href="gas%20lamp">gas lamp</a>, was installed in the market outside the entrance to Davey Place. Exchange Street, a new road running north from the northeast corner of the market, was completed in 1828 and a roadway was installed alongside the existing footpath. London Street, the main road connecting the market with the older areas of the city around Tombland and the Cathedral was widened in 1856. In 1860 the decrepit fish market adjacent to the Guildhall, by now over 700 years old, was replaced with a new <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> building. In 1863 Gentleman's Walk was paved properly with <a href="York%20stone">York stone</a>, and in 1874 the cobbles of the marketplace were replaced by timber blocks. Although by this time the market operated on all working days, Sunday trading laws meant it was closed on Sundays. The market space on Sundays was used for public assemblies and gatherings.
Meanwhile, <a href="Norwich%20railway%20station">Norwich railway station</a> had opened in 1844. Although many Norwich residents were reluctant to use the railway, and goods carriers initially found it more convenient to continue to collect goods from the coaching inns, as railway usage gradually increased the number of coaches and carts calling at the inns slowly dwindled, reducing congestion. In 1899 the Angel inn—renamed the Royal Hotel in 1840 on the occasion of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s wedding—finally closed, and was replaced with <a href="George%20Skipper">George Skipper</a>'s Royal Arcade, a shopping centre in the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style.

Although the civic authorities initially resisted installing tramways in the city centre owing to concerns about nuisance and disruption, they eventually relented; by the end of the 19th century Norwich had a total of of tram routes, including a route along Gentleman's Walk itself. While schemes to rationalise the layout of the market's stalls had been proposed since the 18th century, they had foundered on the fact that so many of the stalls were privately owned.

In the wake of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> the council's Markets Committee began a programme of gradually buying back all the privately owned stalls, with the intention of encouraging demobilised servicemen to work on the market. Within a few years the market was entirely publicly owned, and the council took responsibility for the upkeep of the market. The city also bought out and closed many of the 30 or more inns in the area, transferring their licences to the growing suburbs.
Meanwhile, the Guildhall, designed to serve the post-plague city with a population of around 6,000, was hopelessly inadequate as the administrative centre of a major modern city. As an interim solution the row of buildings dividing the upper and main markets had mostly been taken into public ownership and converted into civic offices, and in January 1914 the 1860 fish market had also been enlarged and converted into offices. The <a href="Liberal%20welfare%20reforms">Liberal welfare reforms</a> of the early 20th century and the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201929">Local Government Act 1929</a> had greatly increased the role of local government in public health and welfare, and by the 1930s Norwich council was suffering from a severe lack of office space.

The council opted for a radical redevelopment of the area around the upper market. The row of buildings from St Peter Mancroft to the Guildhall, which divided the upper and lower markets, were demolished, opening up the marketplace, as were the buildings along the western side of the market. The mixture of stalls and booths which occupied the market itself were all removed, and replaced by 205 stalls in uniform parallel rows, topped with multi-coloured sloping roofs (known locally as "tilts"). During the rebuilding of the market square, the existing stalls were relocated to a number of temporary locations in the area to allow them to continue trading, including the courtyard and rear of the City Hall development and surrounding streets. In 1938 the coverings of the stalls were given the multi-coloured stripes for which they became famous.
In 1932, despite concerns from some local residents and businesses about the huge expense at a time of recession, a new building was envisaged to replace the demolished civic buildings, spanning the entire length of the western edge of the now unified marketplace. From over 140 entries a design by <a href="Charles%20Holloway%20James">Charles Holloway James</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Rowland%20Pierce">Stephen Rowland Pierce</a> was selected. Heavily influenced by Scandinavian architecture, the design attracted negative criticism at the time, with <a href="John%20Piper%20%28artist%29">John Piper</a> saying that "fog is its friend". Opened by <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> in 1938 as <a href="City%20Hall%2C%20Norwich">City Hall</a>, the building proved extremely successful, and was described by <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as "the foremost English public building between the Wars". <a href="Norwich%20War%20Memorial">Norwich's war memorial</a>, designed by <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a> and opened in 1927 outside the Guildhall, was moved to a long narrow memorial garden on a raised terrace between City Hall and the enlarged market shortly after the opening of City Hall. The Guildhall remained in use as a law court until 1985, and its basement remained in use as cells until that time.

Although superficially the market remained little changed in the decades following the 1930s redevelopment, by the 1960s it was falling into disrepair, and it no longer met modern hygiene regulations. A lack of funds delayed improvement works, and renovation works did not begin until February 1976. Hot and cold running water and refrigeration were provided to those stalls handling food, and many of the stalls were converted into lockable units. New electrical mains cables were installed throughout the market, the site was resurfaced, and the elegant but ageing 19th century lavatories were demolished. Aside from the demolition of the Victorian toilets, the only significant visible alteration was the addition of corrugated plastic covers over the walkways between the stalls. Although competition from supermarkets was by this time affecting shopping patterns, and the decline of <a href="market%20garden">market garden</a>ing meant a virtual end to stall-holders selling their own produce, the market survived competitive pressures. Many stalls diversified into specialist foods, clothing and other goods and the high number of stalls allowed the market to sell a range of goods as great as that provided by the supermarkets.

While the 1976 renovations prolonged the life of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.

These plans were extremely controversial. All three envisaged reducing the number of stalls from 205 to 140–160 to increase space, and all three involved splitting the market into isolated clusters of stalls, significantly altering its character and appearance. The "<a href="Eastern%20Daily%20Press">Eastern Daily Press</a>" organised a campaign against the perceived unattractiveness of the designs, the proposed reduction in the number of stalls which would mean stallholders losing their jobs and the remaining stallholders facing rent increases to cover the difference, and the change to the character of central Norwich that such a radical redesign of the market would entail. A petition of over 12,000 signatories rejecting all three proposed designs was gathered.

Following a public meeting on 26 January 2004 the council backed down, and Hereward Cooke, deputy leader of the council, said that "We are finding out what the stall-holders and people of Norwich want and we will try our best to fulfill their wishes". Architect Michael Innes proposed a new design, which was accepted by the council. The new design was put in place in 2005.
Innes's design retained the market's layout of parallel rows of stalls with striped coloured roofs. The new stalls were built as steel and aluminium prefabricated units consisting of four stalls each, each stall having a level floor accessed by a step. These "pods" were arranged in rows, with wide walkways between the "pods". Transparent retractable canopies were installed above the aisles, which could be opened and closed centrally.

To allow the market to continue trading while the rebuilding took place, a set of temporary stalls were built in Gentleman's Walk and surrounding streets. A third of the market's stalls at a time traded from these temporary stalls while their stalls in the main market were replaced, a process taking four months for each third of the market. The rebuilding was officially completed on 25 March 2006. Although generally popular with traders and shoppers, the redesign was criticised by "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", who described it as "an anaemic shopping mall for health and safety inspectors: straight lines, wipe-clean boxy cubicles, all life and love drained out."

Meanwhile, in November 2004 engineers identified cracks in the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were closed to the public as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by <a href="Paul%20de%20Monchaux">Paul de Monchaux</a> on the original site of the memorial.

Supermarkets continued to affect shopping patterns. In 1979 fruit and vegetable stalls occupied 70 of the market's 205 stalls; by 1988 greengrocers occupied only 28 stalls, and by 2010 there were only seven remaining fruit and vegetable stalls on the market. A wide variety of other stalls have taken their place, and the market remains active. One of the largest markets in Britain, it is a tourist attraction as well as remaining heavily used by local residents, and is a focal point of the city.

History of Mars observation

The recorded history of observation of the planet <a href="Mars">Mars</a> dates back to the era of the ancient <a href="Egyptian%20astronomy">Egyptian astronomers</a> in the <a href="2nd%20millennium%20BCE">2nd millennium BCE</a>. <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese</a> records about the motions of Mars appeared before the founding of the <a href="Zhou%20Dynasty">Zhou Dynasty</a> (1045 BCE). Detailed observations of the position of Mars were made by <a href="Babylonian%20astronomy">Babylonian astronomers</a> who developed arithmetic techniques to predict the future position of the planet. The ancient <a href="Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophers</a> and <a href="Hellenistic%20astronomy">Hellenistic</a> <a href="astronomers">astronomers</a> developed a <a href="geocentric%20model">geocentric model</a> to explain the planet's motions. Measurements of Mars' angular diameter can be found in ancient Greek and <a href="Indian%20astronomy">Indian</a> texts. In the 16th century, <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> proposed a <a href="Heliocentrism">heliocentric model</a> for the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> in which the planets follow circular orbits about the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. This was revised by <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, yielding an <a href="elliptic%20orbit">elliptic orbit</a> for Mars that more accurately fitted the observational data.

The first <a href="Telescope">telescopic</a> observation of Mars was by <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> in 1610. Within a century, astronomers discovered distinct <a href="Classical%20albedo%20features%20on%20Mars">albedo features</a> on the planet, including the dark patch <a href="Syrtis%20Major%20Planum">Syrtis Major Planum</a> and <a href="polar%20ice%20cap">polar ice cap</a>s. They were able to determine the planet's <a href="rotation%20period">rotation period</a> and <a href="axial%20tilt">axial tilt</a>. These observations were primarily made during the time intervals when the planet was located in <a href="Opposition%20%28planets%29">opposition</a> to the Sun, at which points Mars made its closest approaches to the Earth.

Better telescopes developed early in the 19th century allowed permanent Martian <a href="albedo">albedo</a> features to be mapped in detail. The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840, followed by more refined maps from 1877 onward. When astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the <a href="Absorption%20line">spectroscopic signature</a> of water in the Martian atmosphere, the idea of <a href="life%20on%20Mars">life on Mars</a> became <a href="wikt%3Apopularise">popularized</a> among the public. <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a> believed he could see a network of artificial <a href="Martian%20canal">canals on Mars</a>. These linear features later proved to be an <a href="optical%20illusion">optical illusion</a>, and the atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an <a href="Planetary%20habitability">Earth-like environment</a>.

Yellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s, which <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20M.%20Antoniadi">Eugène M. Antoniadi</a> suggested were windblown sand or dust. During the 1920s, the range of Martian surface temperature was measured; it ranged from . The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only trace amounts of oxygen and water. In 1947, <a href="Gerard%20Kuiper">Gerard Kuiper</a> showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere. The first standard nomenclature for Mars albedo features was adopted in 1960 by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a>. Since the 1960s, multiple robotic <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. The discovery of <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s on Earth that <a href="Mars%20meteorite">originated on Mars</a> has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet.

The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by ancient <a href="Egyptian%20astronomy">Egyptian astronomers</a>. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the <a href="apparent%20retrograde%20motion">apparent retrograde motion</a> of the planet, in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression. Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a>, on the <a href="Ramesseum">Ramesseum</a> ceiling, and in the <a href="Senenmut">Senenmut</a> star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.

By the period of the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Neo-Babylonian Empire</a>, <a href="Babylonian%20astronomers">Babylonian astronomers</a> were making systematic observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 <a href="synodic%20period">synodic period</a>s, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements—such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>.

Chinese records of the appearances and motions of Mars appear before the founding of the <a href="Zhou%20Dynasty">Zhou Dynasty</a> (1045 BCE), and by the <a href="Qin%20Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> (221 BCE) astronomers maintained close records of planetary conjunctions, including those of Mars. Occultations of Mars by Venus were noted in 368, 375, and 405 CE. The period and motion of the planet's orbit was known in detail during the <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> (618 CE).

The early <a href="Greek%20astronomy">astronomy of ancient Greece</a> was influenced by knowledge transmitted from the <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with <a href="Nergal">Nergal</a>, their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war, <a href="Ares">Ares</a>. During this period, the motions of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks; <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>'s "<a href="Works%20and%20Days">Works and Days</a>" ("c." 650 BCE) makes no mention of the planets.

The Greeks used the word "planēton" to refer to the seven celestial bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a <a href="geocentric">geocentric</a> view that these bodies moved about the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. In his work, "<a href="The%20Republic%20%28Plato%29">The Republic</a>" (X.616E–617B), the Greek philosopher <a href="Plato">Plato</a> provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>, Mars, <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, and the fixed stars. In his dialogue "<a href="Timaeus%20%28dialogue%29">Timaeus</a>", Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.

<a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, a student of Plato, observed an <a href="occultation">occultation</a> of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational evidence to support the Greek sequencing of the planets. His work "<a href="On%20the%20Heavens">De Caelo</a>" presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer <a href="Hipparchus">Hipparchus</a> when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the <a href="deferent%20and%20epicycle">epicycle</a> that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the <a href="deferent%20and%20epicycle">deferent</a>.

In <a href="Roman%20Egypt">Roman Egypt</a> during the 2nd century CE, <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemaeus">Claudius Ptolemaeus</a> (Ptolemy) attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a <a href="equant">point offset</a> from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform <a href="angular%20velocity">rate of rotation</a>. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>", which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.

In the 5th century CE, the <a href="Indian%20astronomy">Indian astronomical</a> text "<a href="Surya%20Siddhanta">Surya Siddhanta</a>" estimated the <a href="angular%20size">angular size</a> of Mars as 2 <a href="Minute%20of%20arc">arc-minutes</a> (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000 km (1,296,600 <a href="yojana">yojana</a>, where one yojana is equivalent to eight km in the "Surya Siddhanta"). From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6,070 km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788 km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The result may have been influenced by the work of Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.
In 1543, <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> published a heliocentric model in his work "<a href="De%20revolutionibus%20orbium%20coelestium">De revolutionibus orbium coelestium</a>". This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun. His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the "<a href="Prutenic%20Tables">Prutenic Tables</a>" by the German astronomer <a href="Erasmus%20Reinhold">Erasmus Reinhold</a> in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.

On October 13, 1590, the German astronomer <a href="Michael%20Maestlin">Michael Maestlin</a> observed an <a href="occultation">occultation</a> of Mars by Venus. One of his students, <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>, quickly became an adherent to the Copernican system. After the completion of his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a>. With access granted to Tycho's detailed observations of Mars, Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables. After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a> and the Sun was located at one of the <a href="Focus%20%28geometry%29">foci</a>. His model became the basis for <a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion">Kepler's laws of planetary motion</a>, which were published in his multi-volume work "<a href="Epitome%20Astronomiae%20Copernicanae">Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae</a>" (Epitome of Copernican Astronomy) between 1615 and 1621.

At its closest approach, the <a href="angular%20size">angular size</a> of Mars is 25 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s (a unit of <a href="Degree%20%28angle%29">degree</a>); this is much too small for the <a href="Naked%20eye%20resolution">naked eye to resolve</a>. Hence, prior to the invention of the <a href="telescope">telescope</a>, nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky. The Italian scientist <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610. This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet, so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited <a href="Planetary%20phase">phases</a> of partial darkness similar to <a href="Venus">Venus</a> or the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size. Polish astronomer <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a> succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.

In 1644, the Italian Jesuit <a href="Daniello%20Bartoli">Daniello Bartoli</a> reported seeing two darker patches on Mars. During the <a href="Opposition%20%28planets%29">oppositions</a> of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its closest approaches to the Earth, the Italian astronomer <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Riccioli">Giovanni Battista Riccioli</a> and his student <a href="Francesco%20Maria%20Grimaldi">Francesco Maria Grimaldi</a> noted patches of differing <a href="albedo">reflectivity</a> on Mars. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>. On November 28, 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as <a href="Syrtis%20Major%20Planum">Syrtis Major Planum</a>, and possibly one of the polar <a href="ice%20cap">ice cap</a>s. The same year, he succeeded in measuring the rotation period of the planet, giving it as approximately 24 hours. He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars, guessing that it is about 60% of the size of the Earth, which compares well with the modern value of 53%. Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars's southern polar ice cap was by the Italian astronomer <a href="Giovanni%20Domenico%20Cassini">Giovanni Domenico Cassini</a>, in 1666. That same year, he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a rotation period of 24 40. This differs from the currently-accepted value by less than three minutes. In 1672, Huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at the north pole.

After Cassini became the first director of the <a href="Paris%20Observatory">Paris Observatory</a> in 1671, he tackled the problem of the physical scale of the Solar System. The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from <a href="Kepler%27s%20third%20law">Kepler's third law</a>, so what was needed was the actual size of one of the planet's orbits. For this purpose, the position of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> was measured against the background stars from different points on the Earth, thereby measuring the <a href="diurnal%20parallax">diurnal parallax</a> of the planet. During this year, the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun (a <a href="Perihelia">perihelic</a> opposition), which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth. Cassini and <a href="Jean%20Picard">Jean Picard</a> determined the position of Mars from <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, while the French astronomer <a href="Jean%20Richer">Jean Richer</a> made measurements from <a href="Cayenne">Cayenne</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments, the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10% of the correct value. The English astronomer <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results.

In 1704, Italian astronomer <a href="Jacques%20Philippe%20Maraldi">Jacques Philippe Maraldi</a> "made a systematic study of the southern cap and observed that it underwent" variations as the planet rotated. This indicated that the cap was not centered on the pole. He observed that the size of the cap varied over time. The German-born British astronomer Sir <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> began making observations of the planet Mars in 1777, particularly of the planet's polar caps. In 1781, he noted that the south cap appeared "extremely large", which he ascribed to that pole being in darkness for the past twelve months. By 1784, the southern cap appeared much smaller, thereby suggesting that the caps vary with the planet's seasons and thus were made of ice. In 1781, he estimated the rotation period of Mars as 24 39 21.67 and measured the <a href="axial%20tilt">axial tilt</a> of the planet's poles to the orbital plane as 28.5°. He noted that Mars had a "considerable but moderate atmosphere, so that its inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours". Between 1796 and 1809, the French astronomer <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Flaugergues">Honoré Flaugergues</a> noticed obscurations of Mars, suggesting "ochre-colored veils" covered the surface. This may be the earliest report of yellow clouds or storms on Mars.

At the start of the 19th century, improvements in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component <a href="achromatic%20lens">achromatic lens</a> of the German optician <a href="Joseph%20von%20Fraunhofer">Joseph von Fraunhofer</a> that essentially eliminated <a href="Coma%20%28optics%29">coma</a>—an optical effect that can distort the outer edge of the image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a <a href="refracting%20telescope">refracting telescope</a>. During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20M%C3%A4dler">Johann Heinrich Mädler</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Beer">Wilhelm Beer</a> used a Fraunhofer <a href="refracting%20telescope">refracting telescope</a> to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8° south of the <a href="equator">equator</a> as their point of reference. (This was later named the <a href="Sinus%20Meridiani">Sinus Meridiani</a>, and it would become the zero <a href="Meridian%20%28astronomy%29">meridian</a> of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, Mädler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature ""a"".

Working at the <a href="Vatican%20Observatory">Vatican Observatory</a> during the opposition of Mars in 1858, Italian astronomer <a href="Pietro%20Angelo%20Secchi">Angelo Secchi</a> noticed a large blue triangular feature, which he named the "Blue Scorpion". This same seasonal cloud-like formation was seen by English astronomer <a href="J.%20Norman%20Lockyer">J. Norman Lockyer</a> in 1862, and it has been viewed by other observers. During the 1862 opposition, Dutch astronomer <a href="Frederik%20Kaiser">Frederik Kaiser</a> produced drawings of Mars. By comparing his illustrations to those of Huygens and the English natural philosopher <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a>, he was able to further refine the rotation period of Mars. His value of 24 37 22.6 is accurate to within a tenth of a second.
Father Secchi produced some of the first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as "canali", which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'. In 1867, English astronomer <a href="Richard%20A.%20Proctor">Richard A. Proctor</a> created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer <a href="William%20R.%20Dawes">William R. Dawes</a>. Proctor named the various <a href="albedo">lighter or darker</a> features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer <a href="Camille%20Flammarion">Camille Flammarion</a> and the English astronomer <a href="Nathaniel%20Everett%20Green">Nathan Green</a>.

At the <a href="University%20of%20Leipzig">University of Leipzig</a> in 1862–64, German astronomer <a href="Johann%20Karl%20Friedrich%20Z%C3%B6llner">Johann K. F. Zöllner</a> developed a custom <a href="photometer">photometer</a> to measure the reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an <a href="albedo">albedo</a> of 0.27. Between 1877 and 1893, German astronomers <a href="Gustav%20M%C3%BCller">Gustav Müller</a> and <a href="Paul%20Friedrich%20Ferdinand%20Kempf">Paul Kempf</a> observed Mars using Zöllner's photometer. They found a small <a href="phase%20coefficient">phase coefficient</a>—the variation in reflectivity with angle—indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities. In 1867, French astronomer <a href="Pierre%20Janssen">Pierre Janssen</a> and British astronomer <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a> used <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a>s to examine the atmosphere of Mars. Both compared the <a href="optical%20spectrum">optical spectrum</a> of Mars to that of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. As the spectrum of the latter did not display <a href="absorption%20lines">absorption lines</a> of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. This result was confirmed by German astronomer <a href="Hermann%20Carl%20Vogel">Herman C. Vogel</a> in 1872 and English astronomer <a href="Edward%20W.%20Maunder">Edward W. Maunder</a> in 1875, but would later come into question.

A particularly favorable perihelic opposition occurred in 1877. The English astronomer <a href="David%20Gill%20%28astronomer%29">David Gill</a> used this opportunity to measure the diurnal parallax of Mars from <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a>, which led to a parallax estimate of . Using this result, he was able to more accurately determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun, based upon the relative size of the orbits of Mars and the Earth. He noted that the edge of the disk of Mars appeared fuzzy because of its atmosphere, which limited the precision he could obtain for the planet's position.

In August 1877, the American astronomer <a href="Asaph%20Hall">Asaph Hall</a> discovered the two <a href="moons%20of%20Mars">moons of Mars</a> using a telescope at the <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Observatory">U.S. Naval Observatory</a>. The names of the two satellites, <a href="Phobos%20%28moon%29">Phobos</a> and <a href="Deimos%20%28moon%29">Deimos</a>, were chosen by Hall based upon a suggestion by <a href="Henry%20George%20Madan">Henry Madan</a>, a science instructor at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> in England.

During the 1877 opposition, Italian astronomer <a href="Giovanni%20Schiaparelli">Giovanni Schiaparelli</a> used a telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called "canali", which were later shown to be an <a href="optical%20illusion">optical illusion</a>. These "canali" were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term "canali" was popularly mistranslated in English as "<a href="Martian%20canal">canals</a>". In 1886, the English astronomer <a href="William%20F.%20Denning">William F. Denning</a> observed that these linear features were irregular in nature and showed concentrations and interruptions. By 1895, English astronomer <a href="Edward%20Maunder">Edward Maunder</a> became convinced that the linear features were merely the summation of many smaller details.

In his 1892 work "La planète Mars et ses conditions d'habitabilité", <a href="Camille%20Flammarion">Camille Flammarion</a> wrote about how these channels resembled man-made canals, which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying Martian world. He advocated for the existence of such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more advanced than humans.

Influenced by the observations of Schiaparelli, <a href="Percival%20Lowell">Percival Lowell</a> founded an <a href="Lowell%20Observatory">observatory</a> with telescopes. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions. He published books on Mars and life on the planet, which had a great influence on the public. The "canali" were found by other astronomers, such as <a href="Henri%20Joseph%20Perrotin">Henri Joseph Perrotin</a> and <a href="Louis%20Thollon">Louis Thollon</a> using a <a href="Refracting%20telescope">refractor</a> at the <a href="Nice%20Observatory">Nice Observatory</a> in France, one of the largest telescopes of that time.

Beginning in 1901, American astronomer <a href="A.%20E.%20Douglass">A. E. Douglass</a> attempted to photograph the canal features of Mars. These efforts appeared to succeed when American astronomer <a href="Carl%20O.%20Lampland">Carl O. Lampland</a> published photographs of the supposed canals in 1905. Although these results were widely accepted, they became contested by Greek astronomer <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20M.%20Antoniadi">Eugène M. Antoniadi</a>, English naturalist <a href="Alfred%20Russel%20Wallace">Alfred Russel Wallace</a> and others as merely imagined features. As bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight "canali" were observed. During an observation in 1909 by Flammarion with a telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no "canali" were seen.

Surface obscuration caused by yellow clouds had been noted in the 1870s when they were observed by Schiaparelli. Evidence for such clouds was observed during the oppositions of 1892 and 1907. In 1909, Antoniadi noted that the presence of yellow clouds was associated with the obscuration of albedo features. He discovered that Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy. He suggested windblown sand or dust as the cause of the clouds.

In 1894, American astronomer <a href="William%20Wallace%20Campbell">William W. Campbell</a> found that the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars is similar to that of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer <a href="Walter%20S.%20Adams">Walter S. Adams</a> in 1925.

<a href="Baltic%20German">Baltic German</a> astronomer <a href="Hermann%20Struve">Hermann Struve</a> used the observed changes in the orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's <a href="Oblate%20spheroid">oblate</a> shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter. In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist <a href="Edgar%20William%20Woolard">Edgar W. Woolard</a> in 1944.

Using a vacuum <a href="thermocouple">thermocouple</a> attached to the <a href="Hooker%20Telescope">Hooker Telescope</a> at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>, in 1924 the American astronomers <a href="Seth%20Barnes%20Nicholson">Seth Barnes Nicholson</a> and <a href="Edison%20Pettit">Edison Pettit</a> were able to measure the thermal energy being radiated by the surface of Mars. They determined that the temperature ranged from at the pole up to at the midpoint of the disk (corresponding to the <a href="equator">equator</a>). Beginning in the same year, <a href="radiometric">radiated energy measurements</a> of Mars were made by American physicist <a href="William%20Coblentz">William Coblentz</a> and American astronomer <a href="Carl%20Otto%20Lampland">Carl Otto Lampland</a>. The results showed that the night time temperature on Mars dropped to , indicating an "enormous <a href="wiktionary%3Adiurnal">diurnal</a> fluctuation" in temperatures. The temperature of Martian clouds was measured as . In 1926, by measuring spectral lines that were <a href="redshift">redshift</a>ed by the orbital motions of Mars and Earth, American astronomer <a href="Walter%20Sydney%20Adams">Walter Sydney Adams</a> was able to directly measure the amount of oxygen and water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. He determined that "extreme desert conditions" were prevalent on Mars. In 1934, Adams and American astronomer <a href="Theodore%20Dunham%2C%20Jr.">Theodore Dunham, Jr.</a> found that the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars was less than one percent of the amount over a comparable area on Earth.

In 1927, Dutch graduate student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made a determination of the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer <a href="Willem%20de%20Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a> and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the <a href="Near-Earth%20object">near Earth</a> <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> <a href="433%20Eros">Eros</a> from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer <a href="Eugene%20K.%20Rabe">Eugene K. Rabe</a> was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, as well as the other planets in the <a href="inner%20Solar%20System">inner Solar System</a>, from the planet's gravitational <a href="Perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">perturbations</a> of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.

During the 1920s, French astronomer <a href="Bernard%20Lyot">Bernard Lyot</a> used a <a href="polarimeter">polarimeter</a> to study the surface properties of the Moon and planets. In 1929, he noted that the <a href="polarized%20light">polarized light</a> emitted from the Martian surface is very similar to that radiated from the Moon, although he speculated that his observations could be explained by frost and possibly vegetation. Based on the amount of sunlight scattered by the Martian atmosphere, he set an upper limit of 1/15 the thickness of the Earth's atmosphere. This restricted the surface pressure to no greater than . Using <a href="infrared">infrared</a> spectrometry, in 1947 the Dutch-American astronomer <a href="Gerard%20Kuiper">Gerard Kuiper</a> detected <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> in the Martian atmosphere. He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the Earth. However, because he overestimated the surface pressure on Mars, Kuiper concluded erroneously that the ice caps could not be composed of frozen carbon dioxide. In 1948, American meteorologist <a href="Seymour%20L.%20Hess">Seymour L. Hess</a> determined that the formation of the thin Martian clouds would only require of water precipitation and a <a href="vapor%20pressure">vapor pressure</a> of .

The first standard nomenclature for Martian albedo features was introduced by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named "La Planète Mars". The Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) was established by the IAU in 1973 to standardize the naming scheme for Mars and other bodies.

The <a href="International%20Planetary%20Patrol%20Program">International Planetary Patrol Program</a> was formed in 1969 as a consortium to continually monitor planetary changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars. Their images allow Martian seasonal patterns to be studied globally, and they showed that most Martian dust storms occur when the planet is closest to the Sun.

Since the 1960s, robotic <a href="spacecraft">spacecraft</a> have been sent to <a href="Exploration%20of%20Mars">explore Mars</a> from orbit and the <a href="Mars%20landing">surface</a> in extensive detail. In addition, remote sensing of Mars from Earth by ground-based and orbiting telescopes has continued across much of the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. These include <a href="infrared">infrared</a> observations to determine the composition of the surface, <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> and <a href="submillimeter">submillimeter</a> observation of the atmospheric composition, and <a href="radio">radio</a> measurements of wind velocities.

The <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> (HST) has been used to perform systematic studies of Mars and has taken the highest resolution images of Mars ever captured from Earth. This telescope can produce useful images of the planet when it is at an <a href="angular%20distance">angular distance</a> of at least 50° from the Sun. The HST can take images of a <a href="Sphere">hemisphere</a>, which yields views of entire weather systems. Earth-based telescopes equipped with <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a>s can produce useful images of Mars, allowing for regular monitoring of the planet's weather during oppositions.

<a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> emission from Mars was first observed by astronomers in 2001 using the <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a>, and in 2003 it was shown to have two components. The first component is caused by X-rays from the Sun scattering off the upper Martian atmosphere; the second comes from interactions between <a href="ion">ion</a>s that result in an exchange of charges. The emission from the latter source has been observed out to eight times the radius of Mars by the <a href="XMM-Newton">XMM-Newton</a> orbiting observatory.

In 1983, the analysis of the <a href="Shergotty%20meteorite">shergottite</a>, <a href="nakhlite">nakhlite</a>, and <a href="Chassigny%20%28meteorite%29">chassignite</a> (SNC) group of meteorites showed that they may have <a href="Mars%20meteorite">originated on Mars</a>. The <a href="Allan%20Hills%2084001">Allan Hills 84001</a> meteorite, discovered in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> in 1984, is believed to have originated on Mars but it has an entirely different composition than the SNC group. In 1996, it was announced that this meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s of Martian <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. However, this finding remains controversial. Chemical analysis of the Martian meteorites found on Earth suggests that the ambient near-surface temperature of Mars has most likely been below the freezing point of water (0 C°) for much of the last four billion years.

Witches' Sabbath (The Great He-Goat)

Witches' Sabbath or The Great He-Goat () are names given to an <a href="Oil%20painting">oil</a> <a href="mural">mural</a> by the Spanish artist <a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a>, completed sometime between 1821 and 1823. It explores themes of violence, intimidation, aging and death. <a href="Satan">Satan</a> hulks, in the <a href="Goat%23Religion%2C%20mythology%20and%20folklore">form of a goat</a>, in moonlit silhouette over a <a href="coven">coven</a> of terrified witches. Goya was then around 75 years old, living alone and suffering from acute mental and physical distress.

It is one of the fourteen "<a href="Black%20Paintings">Black Paintings</a>" that Goya applied in oil on the plaster walls of his house, the <a href="Quinta%20del%20Sordo">Quinta del Sordo</a>. The paintings were completed in secret: he did not title any of the works or leave a record of his intentions in creating them. Absent of fact, "Witches' Sabbath" is generally seen by some art historians as a satire on the <a href="credulity">credulity</a> of the age, a condemnation of superstition and the <a href="Witch-hunt">witch trials</a> of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>. As with the other works in the group, "Witches' Sabbath" reflects its painter's disillusionment and can be linked thematically to his earlier etching "<a href="The%20Sleep%20of%20Reason%20Produces%20Monsters">The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</a>" as well as the "<a href="The%20Disasters%20of%20War">Disasters of War</a>" print series, another bold political statement published only posthumously.

Around 1874, some fifty years after his death, the plaster murals were taken down and <a href="Transfer%20of%20panel%20paintings">transferred to canvas</a> supports. "Witches' Sabbath" was much wider before transfer – it was the broadest of the "Black Paintings". During the transfer about of the painting was cut from the right-hand side. At its reduced dimensions of 141 × 436 cm (56 × 172 in), its framing is unusually tightly <a href="Cropping%20%28image%29">cropped</a>, which some critics find adds to its haunted, spectral aura, although others believe it distorts Goya's intentions by moving the centre of balance and reducing the painting's impact.

Goya did not title any of the 14 "Black Paintings"; their modern names came about after his death. They are not inscribed, mentioned in his letters, and there are no records of him speaking of them. The works today are known by a variety of titles, most of which date to around the 1860s: his children were largely responsible for the names, with close friend <a href="Bernardo%20de%20Iriarte">Bernardo de Iriarte</a> contributing the rest. The title "El Gran Cabrón" ("The Great He-Goat") was given by painter <a href="Antonio%20Brugada">Antonio Brugada</a> (1804–1863). The <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a> term for a Witches' Sabbath, "<a href="Akelarre%20%28witchcraft%29">akelarre</a>", is the source of the Spanish title "Aquelarre" and a derivation of "akerra", the Basque word for a male goat, which may have been combined with the word "larre" ("field") to arrive at "akelarre".
The historical record of Goya's later life is relatively scant; no accounts of his thoughts from this time survive. He deliberately suppressed a number of his works from this period  – most notably the "<a href="The%20Disasters%20of%20War">Disasters of War</a>" series – which are today considered amongst his finest. He was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness, the latter possibly from anxiety caused by an undiagnosed illness that left him deaf from the early 1790s. Goya had been a successful and royally placed artist, but withdrew from public life during his final years. From the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside Madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio. The house had become known as "La Quinta del Sordo" (The House of the Deaf Man), after the nearest farmhouse had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man.

Art historians assume Goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 <a href="History%20of%20Spain%20%281810%E2%80%9373%29%23Reaction%20%281814%E2%80%931820%29">restoration of the Bourbon monarchy</a>, and that he viewed these developments as reactionary means of social control. In his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into <a href="Medievalism">Medievalism</a>. It is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform, but like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored Bourbon monarchy and Catholic hierarchy rejected the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201812">Spanish Constitution of 1812</a>.

Goya went to exile in <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">France</a> in 1824, and ownership of the house passed to his grandson Mariano. An 1830 inventory by Brugada indicates that the work took a full wall between two windows on the first floor, opposite "<a href="A%20Pilgrimage%20to%20San%20Isidro">A Pilgrimage to San Isidro</a>". On the wall to the right were "<a href="Saturn%20Devouring%20His%20Son">Saturn Devouring His Son</a>" and "<a href="Judith%20and%20Holofernes%20%28Goya%29">Judith and Holofernes</a>". "<a href="Leocadia%20%28Goya%29">Leocadia</a>", "<a href="Two%20Old%20Men">Two Old Men</a>" and "<a href="Two%20Old%20Men%20Eating%20Soup">Two Old Men Eating Soup</a>" were on the left wall. Art historian <a href="Lawrence%20Gowing">Lawrence Gowing</a> observed that the lower floor was divided thematically, with a male side – "Saturn" and "A Pilgrimage to San Isidro" – and a female side – "Judith and Holofernes", "Witches' Sabbath" and "Leocadia". The house changed owners a number of times before March 1873, when it came into the possession of the Belgian <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20%C3%89mile%20d%27Erlanger">Frédéric Émile d'Erlanger</a>, who speculated that the area would appreciate in value over the coming years. The murals had deteriorated badly after many years on the walls. To preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas under the direction of the art restorer of the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a>, <a href="Salvador%20Martinez%20Cubells">Salvador Martinez Cubells</a>. Following their exhibition at the Paris <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281878%29">Exposition Universelle</a> in 1878, where they were met with little reaction, d'Erlanger donated them to the Spanish state in 1881.

Satan preaches from a raised earth mound and is dressed in <a href="clerical%20clothing">clerical clothing</a> that may be a <a href="soutane">soutane</a>. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the <a href="Canaanite%20religion">Canaanite</a> idol <a href="Molech">Molech</a>, as illustrated by <a href="Athanasius%20Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a>.

He holds court before a circle of crouched and mostly terrified women, accepted by art historians as a <a href="coven">coven</a> of witches. Some bow their heads in fear, others look towards him in open-mouthed and rapt awe. Describing the women, art historian Brian McQuade writes that the "sub-humanity of the gathered group is underlined by their bestial features and moronic stares". Satan's absolute power over the women has been compared to that of the king in Goya's 1815 "<a href="The%20Junta%20of%20the%20Philippines">The Junta of the Philippines</a>", where authority is gained not from respect or personal charisma, but through fear and domination. The women are a mixture of old and young, and have similar twisted features; all but one are scowling, nervous and obsequious. Goya's use of tone to create atmosphere is reminiscent of both <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a> and <a href="Jusepe%20de%20Ribera">Jusepe de Ribera</a>. The latter was an admirer of <a href="Caravaggio">Caravaggio</a> and utilised <a href="tenebrism">tenebrism</a> and <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>. Goya learned from these sources, and from <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, some of whose prints he owned.

An old woman sits to the right of the goat; her back to the viewer. Her face is half hidden, and she wears a white-hooded headdress resembling a nun's <a href="Religious%20habit">habit</a>. She sits alongside bottles and vials on the ground to her right. Art critic <a href="Robert%20Hughes%20%28critic%29">Robert Hughes</a> wonders if they "contain the drugs and <a href="Potion">philtre</a>s needed for the devilish ceremonies". The eyes of some figures are lined with white paint. The faces of the two main figures – the goat and the woman to the far right – are hidden. The woman is separated from the group, she is perhaps a <a href="postulant">postulant</a> about to be initiated into the coven. She may represent Goya's maid and probable lover Leocadia Weiss, whose <a href="La%20Leocadia">full-length portrait</a> appears in the same series.

As with the other "Black Paintings", Goya began with a black background which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in the figure of the Devil. Like the other works in the series, "Witches' Sabbath" is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, <a href="Prussian%20blue">Prussian blue</a>, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of <a href="smalt">powdered glass</a>, <a href="orpiment">orpiment</a> and <a href="iron%20oxide">iron oxide</a>s. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings began with preparatory drawings. "Witches' Sabbath" is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.

Art historian <a href="Fred%20Licht">Fred Licht</a> notes that Goya's brushwork appears "clumsy, ponderous, and rough" and lacking finish compared to his earlier work. Licht believes this was a deliberate ploy to physically convey dismay at human inadequacy and his own feelings of personal doubt. Unique in the series, "Witches' Sabbath" was not significantly altered by Goya after his initial work.

There is no record of Goya's thoughts during this period. He completed the series during a period recuperating from illness, possibly <a href="lead%20poisoning">lead poisoning</a>, when he was in considerable mental and physical pain, and withdrew from public life. "Witches' Sabbath" is believed to be a rather bitter, but silent, protest against the royalists and clergy who had retaken control of Spain after the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> of 1807–14. Advocates of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> had sought to redistribute land to the peasants, to educate women, publish a <a href="vernacular%20Bible">vernacular Bible</a> and, by replacing superstition with reason, put an end to the <a href="Inquisition">Inquisition</a>. Witch hunting, seen during the <a href="Basque%20witch%20trials">Logroño Inquisition</a>, was an appalling regression to liberals such as Goya. As court painter Goya was a part of the established order; surviving evidence indicates he was acquiesced to the wishes of his patrons. Yet numerous paintings and etchings have emerged since, suggesting he had convictions favouring liberalism, enlightenment, and reason. He seems to have kept such beliefs private, only expressing them in his private art; his more sensitive works were not published at the time, probably for fear of reprisal or persecution. In "Witches' Sabbath" Goya mocks and ridicules the superstition, fear and irrationality of the ignorant placing their faith in <a href="ghoul">ghoul</a>s, <a href="Quackery">quack doctors</a> and tyrants.

Goya had used witchcraft imagery in his 1797–98 "<a href="Caprichos">Caprichos</a>" print series, and in his similarly titled 1789 painting "<a href="Witches%27%20Sabbath%20%28Goya%2C%201798%29">Witches' Sabbath</a>". In both the 1789 and 1822 Sabbath pictures, the Devil is presented as a goat surrounded by a ring of terrified women. The earlier painting uses witchcraft imagery in a manner that inverts the order of traditional Christian iconography. The goat extends his left rather than right hoof towards the child, the quarter moon faces out at the left hand corner of the canvas. These inversions may be metaphor for the <a href="rationalism">irrational</a> undermining of the liberals who argued for scientific, religious and social progress. Many of the scientific bodies then active were condemned as subversive and their members accused as "agents of the devil".

Describing the techniques employed in the "Black Paintings", particularly the visible black ground paint, art historian <a href="Barbara%20Maria%20Stafford">Barbara Stafford</a> said that "by brusquely inlaying spots of light with prevailing darkness, Goya's <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a>ed and painted visions demonstrated the powerlessness of the unmoored intellect to unify a monstrously hybrid experience according to its own "a priori" transcendental laws."

Between 1874 and 1878 restorer Salvador Martinez Cubells was tasked with retouching the goat's horns and a number of the witches' faces. He removed more than of landscape and sky to the right of the postulant witch, where the paint had been badly damaged. This alteration significantly shifted the work's centre of balance; the young woman was no longer near the middle of the composition, thus reducing both her prominence and the possibility that she is seen to be the focus of the work.

Some art historians have speculated that the area removed was beyond restoration since it is unlikely that such a large section of painting by an artist of Goya's stature would be lightly discarded. Still, the removal may have been for aesthetic reasons, with the empty space on the right viewed as unnecessary; its removal intended to bring balance to a canvas perceived as overlong. If this was Cubells' reasoning, it was misguided (he was not an accomplished painter and lacked insight into Goya's intentions); Goya had often used empty space to dramatic and evocative effect.

This can be seen in both "<a href="The%20Dog%20%28Goya%29">The Dog</a>" from the same series, and his print "<a href="Unfortunate%20events%20in%20the%20front%20seats%20of%20the%20ring%20of%20Madrid%2C%20and%20the%20death%20of%20the%20Mayor%20of%20Torrej%C3%B3n">Unfortunate events in the front seats of the ring of Madrid, and the death of the Mayor of Torrejón</a>", where he left large empty areas. This seems to have been a reaction against contemporary conventions of balance and harmony, and was a precursor to works by modern artists such as <a href="Francis%20Bacon%20%28artist%29">Francis Bacon</a>, who greatly admired Goya's depiction of what Bacon described as "the void".

The painting is in poor condition. Time and a complicated transfer – which involved mounting crumbling plaster onto canvas – have caused extensive damage and significant paint loss. The work seems to have been seriously damaged even before its removal from the walls of Goya's home; the base of dry plaster may have contributed to its early deterioration. <a href="Fresco">Fresco</a>s completed on dry (rather than wet) plaster cannot survive for a long period on a roughened surface. <a href="Evan%20Connell">Evan Connell</a> believes that in applying oil to plaster Goya "made a technical mistake that all but guaranteed disintegration".

Many of the "Black Paintings" were significantly altered during the restoration of the 1870s, and critic <a href="Arthur%20Lubow">Arthur Lubow</a> describes the works hanging in the Prado today as "at best a crude facsimile of what Goya painted". We know the effect of many of Martinez Cubells' changes from his accounts, but they inevitably lack objectivity. More reliable are two overlapping photographs taken in preparation for the restoration by Jean Laurent, now in the <a href="Courtauld%20Institute">Courtauld Institute</a>'s Witt Library.

They show the painting "in situ" in the Quinta del Sordo and are the most reliable indicators of its appearance before restoration. But Laurent's work presents difficulties, not least because some areas of the photographs lack resolution and contain indistinct passages. Photographs from this period tended to darken yellow and red areas while lightening blues and violets.

Alloxylon pinnatum

Alloxylon pinnatum, commonly known as Dorrigo waratah, is a tree of the family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> found in <a href="Temperate%20rainforest%23Australian%20temperate%20rainforests">warm-temperate rainforest</a> of south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales in eastern Australia. It has shiny green leaves that are either <a href="wikt%3Apinnate">pinnate</a> (lobed) and up to long, or <a href="wikt%3Alanceolate">lanceolate</a> (spear-shaped) and up to long. The prominent pinkish-red flower heads, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, appear in spring and summer; these are made up of 50 to 140 individual flowers arranged in <a href="Panicle">corymb</a> or <a href="raceme">raceme</a>. These are followed by rectangular woody seed pods, which bear two rows of winged seeds.

Known for many years as "Oreocallis pinnata", it was transferred to the new genus "<a href="Alloxylon">Alloxylon</a>" by <a href="Peter%20Henry%20Weston">Peter Weston</a> and <a href="Michael%20Douglas%20Crisp">Mike Crisp</a> in 1991. This genus contains the four species previously classified in "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis</a>" that are found in Australasia. Its terminal tubular flowers indicate that the species is pollinated by birds. Classified as "near threatened" under the Queensland <a href="Nature%20Conservation%20Act%201992">Nature Conservation Act 1992</a>, the Dorrigo waratah has proven difficult to keep alive in cultivation.

The Dorrigo waratah is a rainforest tree that reaches high, with a non-<a href="Buttress%20root">buttressed</a> trunk of <a href="diameter%20at%20breast%20height">diameter at breast height</a> (dbh). The bark is greyish brown and covered in many small pimples, rendering it sandpaper-like in texture. The green foliage consists of several distinct juvenile and adult leaf forms, which are <a href="phyllotaxis">arranged alternately</a> along the stems. Juvenile leaves are light green and at first <a href="Leaf%23Divisions%20of%20the%20blade">simple</a>, with a single blade. Successive leaves on more mature plants become more complex, or <a href="wikt%3Apinnate">pinnate</a>, with deep lobes; these leaves are up to long with 2–11 leaflets. Some adult leaves are simple—with a single lanceolate leaf blade—and up to long; these are generally located near the flower heads. Among the green foliage there are occasional yellow leaves. New branchlets and leaves are covered in brown hair.

The pinkish-red compound flowerheads, known as <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s, are up to 20 cm (8 in) across in spring to summer, and contain between 50 and 140 smaller flowers, arranged in a <a href="Panicle">corymb</a> or <a href="raceme">raceme</a>. These individual flowers are long and sit atop stalks (known as <a href="Pedicel%20%28botany%29">pedicels</a>) up to in length, which arise in pairs off the main stalk within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular <a href="perianth">perianth</a>, which partly splits along one side at <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a> to release the thick <a href="Style%20%28flower%29">style</a>. The <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a> is contained within a slanting disc-like structure at the tip of the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The flower parts are smooth and hairless. The pollen is crimson. After flowering, the long woody seedpod develops. Cylindrical in shape, it splits down one side to release the seeds, which are ripe from February to June. They are arranged in two rows, with at least four seeds in each row. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself.

The Dorrigo waratah can be distinguished from other members of the genus "<a href="Alloxylon">Alloxylon</a>" by its pinnate adult leaves. This feature serves to differentiate it as other species in the genus have simple adult leaves. The other species have inflorescences with fewer flowers (50 maximum), and have yellow pollen.

First described as a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> of what was then known as "Embothrium wickhamii" by <a href="Joseph%20Maiden">Joseph Maiden</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Betche">Ernst Betche</a> in 1911 after a collection by J.L.Boorman, the Dorrigo waratah was raised to <a href="species">species</a> status and reclassified as "Oreocallis pinnata" by Dutch botanist <a href="Hermann%20Otto%20Sleumer">Hermann Otto Sleumer</a> in 1954. The Australian members of the genus "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis</a>" were recognised as markedly distinct from the South American species, which saw them allocated to the new <a href="genus">genus</a> "Alloxylon". Hence, "Oreocallis pinnata" was given the <a href="Combinatio%20nova">new combination</a> "Alloxylon pinnatum" in 1991 by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp of the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Sydney">Royal Botanic Gardens</a> in Sydney. The species name refers to the pinnate leaves. Aside from Dorrigo waratah, it has also been called the Dorrigo oak, red silky oak, tree waratah, pink silky oak, red oak, Queensland waratah, and waratah oak. The genus name is derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "allo-", meaning "other" or "strange", and "xylon", meaning "wood". It refers to the genus's unusual cell architecture compared with the related genera "<a href="Waratah">Telopea</a>" and "Oreocallis".

"A. pinnatum" and the other three tree waratah species lie in the subtribe <a href="Embothriinae">Embothriinae</a>, along with the true waratahs ("Telopea"), "Oreocallis" and the Chilean firetree ("<a href="Embothrium%20coccineum">Embothrium coccineum</a>") from South America. Almost all these species have red flowers that are terminal (arising at the ends of branches), and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance most likely predates the splitting of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago. The position, colour and tubular shape of the flowers suggest that they are bird-pollinated, and have been so since the <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> of nectar-feeding birds such as <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>. "<a href="Triporopollenites%20ambiguus">Triporopollenites ambiguus</a>" is an ancient member of the proteaceae known only from pollen deposits, originally described from Eocene deposits in Victoria. The fossil pollen closely resembles that of the Tasmanian waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20truncata">Telopea truncata</a>"), "A. pinnatum" and "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis grandiflora</a>". <a href="Cladistics">Cladistic</a> analysis of <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features within the Embothriinae showed "A. pinnatum" to be the earliest offshoot within the genus and <a href="Sister%20group">sister</a> to the other three species. Along with members of other genera in the Embothriinae, "A. pinnatum" has crimson pollen, while the other three "Alloxylon" species have yellow pollen. Hence it is likely that the ancestral pollen colour was red, and remained so with the emergence of the genus "Alloxylon", yet changed to yellow after the divergence of "A. pinnatum".

The Dorrigo waratah is found in <a href="Temperate%20rainforest%23Australian%20temperate%20rainforests">warm-temperate rainforest</a> from altitudes of along the <a href="McPherson%20Range">McPherson Range</a> in south-east Queensland and the <a href="Dorrigo%20Plateau">Dorrigo Plateau</a> in northern New South Wales, with dominant tree species such as coachwood ("<a href="Ceratopetalum%20apetalum">Ceratopetalum apetalum</a>") and Antarctic beech ("<a href="Lophozonia%20moorei">Lophozonia moorei</a>"). In Queensland it is associated with golden sassafras ("<a href="Doryphora%20sassafras">Doryphora sassafras</a>") and native crabapple ("<a href="Schizomeria%20ovata">Schizomeria ovata</a>"). It commonly grows on southern aspects of hills and slopes.

The Dorrigo waratah is classified as 3RCa under the Rare or Threatened Australian Plant (<a href="ROTAP">ROTAP</a>) criteria for threatened species, and listed as "near threatened" under the Queensland <a href="Nature%20Conservation%20Act%201992">Nature Conservation Act 1992</a>. The flowers are visited by the rare Richmond birdwing butterfly ("<a href="Ornithoptera%20richmondia">Ornithoptera richmondia</a>"), which occurs in the same region. In 2016, the Dorrigo waratah was one of eleven species selected for the Save a Species Walk campaign in April 2016; scientists walked to raise money for collection of seeds to be prepared and stored at the Australian PlantBank at the Australian Botanic Garden, Mount Annan. Protected areas it grows in in New South Wales include <a href="Bellinger%20River%20National%20Park">Bellinger River National Park</a> and <a href="Dorrigo%20National%20Park">Dorrigo National Park</a>.

The bright, prominently displayed flowers and bird-attracting properties of the Dorrigo waratah make it a desirable garden plant. It reaches only about in cultivation, but has proven difficult to grow. The Dorrigo waratah has been successfully cultivated at the <a href="Australian%20National%20Botanic%20Gardens">Australian National Botanic Gardens</a> in Canberra in a sheltered position in part-shade with a thick layer of mulch. It is propagated most easily by seed, which is ripe from February to June and keeps for around twelve months. Seedlings often perish when they reach high, and are difficult to transplant. It has also been grown at <a href="Mount%20Tomah%20Botanic%20Garden">Mount Tomah Botanic Garden</a>, where it was noted to be exacting in its requirements, needing very good drainage as well as a sheltered location to survive. It is slow growing; specimens planted in 1989 have been flowering since 1999. The considerably easier to grow Queensland tree waratah ("<a href="Alloxylon%20flammeum">A. flammeum</a>") has been considered as a stock plant for grafting. The pinkish red timber has been used for making cabinets and furniture. It is soft and light, weighing 500 kg (1100 lb) per cubic metre. The <a href="cut%20flowers">cut flowers</a> have a long vase life.

Ham Wall

Ham Wall is an English <a href="wetland">wetland</a> <a href="national%20nature%20reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Nature Reserve</a> (NNR) situated west of <a href="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> on the <a href="Somerset%20Levels">Somerset Levels</a> and managed by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> (RSPB). Since the last <a href="glacial%20period">Ice Age</a>, decomposing plants in the <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es of the <a href="River%20Brue">Brue valley</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> have accumulated as deep layers of <a href="peat">peat</a> that were commercially exploited on a large scale in the twentieth century. Consumer demand eventually reduced, and in 1994 the landowners, <a href="Fisons">Fisons</a>, gave their old workings to what is now <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England</a>, who passed the management of the Ham Wall section to the RSPB.
The Ham Wall reserve was constructed originally to provide <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a> habitat for the <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">bittern</a>, which at the time was at a very low population level in the UK. The site is divided into several sections with independently controllable water levels, and machinery and cattle are used to maintain the quality of the reed beds. There are important breeding populations of wetland birds including the rare <a href="little%20bittern">little bittern</a> and <a href="great%20egret">great white egret</a>, and the area hosts several other uncommon animals and plants. The RSPB works with other organisations as part of the Avalon Marshes Partnership to coordinate conservation issues across the Somerset Levels. 

The reserve is open year-round, and has nature trails, hides and viewing points. It lies within the Somerset Levels NNR and the Somerset Levels and Moors' <a href="Ramsar%20site">Ramsar</a> and <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a> site. Potential future threats may result from increasing unpredictability in the UK climate, leading to heavy summer rains and extensive flooding. Sea level rise will make the drainage of the Levels more difficult, and current water pumping facilities may become inadequate. 

At the end of the last <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a>, about 10,000 years ago, the river valley that would eventually form the <a href="Somerset%20Levels">Somerset Levels</a> gradually became <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a> as the melting <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s caused sea levels to rise. By around 6,500 to 6,000 years ago the marshes had become <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>s interspersed with <a href="rhyne">rhyne</a>s (ditches) and open water, and parts of the area were in turn colonised by wet woodland. When the plants died in the <a href="Anaerobic%20organism">oxygen-poor</a> environment they decayed to form <a href="peat">peat</a>, and as the layers built up they eventually formed a large raised <a href="bog">bog</a>, which may have reached an extent of in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> times. The formation of the bog was aided by the Somerset Levels' large water catchment area, high rainfall in the <a href="Mendips">Mendips</a> and <a href="Blackdown%20Hills">Blackdown Hills</a> and raised <a href="marine%20clay">marine clay</a> deposits which restricted drainage to the sea; the same impermeable material underlies the peat, which in places is up to thick.

The Somerset Levels have been occupied since the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period, around 6,000 years ago, when people exploited the reed swamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden <a href="trackway">trackway</a>s such as the <a href="Sweet%20Track">Sweet</a> and <a href="Post%20Track">Post Track</a>s, and they were the site of salt extraction during the <a href="Romano-British">Romano-British</a> period. Much of the landscape was owned by the church in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> when substantial areas were drained and the rivers diverted, but the raised bogs remained largely intact. Only the <a href="Inclosure%20Acts">Inclosure Acts</a> of the 18th century, mostly between 1774 and 1797, led to significant draining of the peat bogs, although the <a href="River%20Bure">River Bure</a> still regularly flooded the reclaimed land in winter. Following the 1801 Brue Drainage Act, parts of the Brue were straightened, and new feeder channels constructed. 

The <a href="Glastonbury%20Canal">Glastonbury Canal</a> which runs through the reserve was opened in 1833. It was superseded from 1854 by the <a href="Bristol%20and%20Exeter%20Railway">Bristol and Exeter Railway</a> line that once ran next to it on its way from <a href="Glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> to <a href="Highbridge%2C%20Somerset">Highbridge</a>. The railway line closed in 1966. The railway and the canal both carried peat and people. 

By the twentieth century, large areas of the <a href="Peat%20extraction%20on%20the%20Somerset%20Levels">levels were exploited to meet the demands of horticulture for peat</a>, the owners of the workings, <a href="Fisons">Fisons</a>, reaching an annual production of in the early 1990s. When the demand for peat fell towards the end of the century, Fisons transferred ownership of much of their land to English Nature (now <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England</a>) in 1994, enabling the creation of of wetland nature reserves from the diggings. English Nature handed the management of at Ham Wall to the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> (RSPB), managing the rest of the land itself apart from an extension to the <a href="Somerset%20Wildlife%20Trust">Somerset Wildlife Trust</a>'s existing reserve at <a href="Westhay%20Moor">Westhay Moor</a>.

The reserve name derives from the Ham Wall rhyne which flows through the site. "Rhyne" is a local name for drainage channels between plots of land, pronounced "reens" in the east and "rhine" in the west of the Levels area. "Ham" is an old term for <a href="pasture">pasture</a> or <a href="meadow">meadow</a>, and the Ham Wall may have been a bank to hold water on the flooded fields. Ham Walls lies within the Somerset Levels <a href="National%20Nature%20Reserve">National Nature Reserve</a> and the Somerset Levels and Moors <a href="Ramsar%20site">Ramsar</a> and <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a> site.

The impetus for creating the Ham Wall reserve was the plight of the <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">bittern</a>, with only 11 males present in the UK in the 1997 breeding season. Much of its reed bed habitat was deteriorating, and key coastal sites in eastern England were at risk of salt-water flooding, so an opportunity to create a new inland site was attractive to the RSPB. The peat excavations already had <a href="bunding">bund walls</a> that allowed the water levels on the reserve to be easily managed in sections, and the workings had removed peat down to the underlying marine clay, a depth of in this area.

Water levels were managed using <a href="sluice">sluice</a>s, pipes and wind-pumps to create reed beds with about 20% open water, and the ditches were deepened and widened to restrict reed encroachment and provide a habitat for fish, particularly <a href="common%20rudd">common rudd</a>, introduced to provide food for the bitterns. By the completion of major works in 2013, the reserve contained of reed bed, including of deep water channels and ditches, of wet woodland and of grass, the latter being mainly on the bunds and some higher ground.

Ham Wall, along with <a href="Lakenheath%20Fen%20RSPB%20reserve">Lakenheath Fen</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, has been a key part of a bittern recovery programme initiated in 1994 as part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan">United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan</a>. Both reserves created extensive new reed beds, thereby adding significant additional breeding habitat. Initial funding for the recovery scheme was £60,000 from English Nature in 1994, augmented by two rounds of EU funding in 1996-2000 and 2002-2006.

The reserve is about west of Glastonbury and can be accessed by car from the minor road that runs between the villages of <a href="Meare">Meare</a> on the B3151 and <a href="Ashcott">Ashcott</a> on the <a href="A39%20road">A39</a>. <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route%203">Route 3</a> of the <a href="Sustrans">Sustrans</a> <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a> runs near the reserve. The nearest bus access is in Ashcott, away, and the railway station in <a href="Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a> is distant. Natural England's <a href="Shapwick%20Heath">Shapwick Heath</a> NNR is on the opposite side of the Meare-Ashcott road.

The reserve is open and free to enter at all times, although its car park has a charge for non-members of the RSPB and closes at night. There are toilets and a small visitor centre which sells light snacks and is usually open only at weekends. The main access to the reserve on leaving the car park is the Ham Wall loop; this follows the north bank of the canal, crosses at a bridge and returns via a parallel grass track, in total. A short spur runs to the Avalon hide from the canal footpath, and two further circular walks and in length are accessed from the grass track, a section of <a href="boardwalk">boardwalk</a> also linking the two trails. There are two <a href="bird%20hide">bird hide</a>s and six viewing platforms or screens on the reserve. Dogs on leads are allowed on the Ham Wall loop (which includes public <a href="right%20of%20way">rights of way</a>), but only <a href="assistance%20dog">assistance dog</a>s can be taken elsewhere. The reserve attracts 70,000 visitors annually.

The main management of the reserve involves cutting the reeds in rotation to rejuvenate the reed beds and prevent their drying out. Two machines are used, an <a href="Amphibious%20vehicle">amphibious</a> Truxor tracked reed cutter to harvest wetter areas, and a faster Softrak for islands and where water levels have been lowered. Native breeds of cattle are also used to graze the reed bed margins. The cut reeds are turned into a peat-free compost and sold for domestic use.

The RSPB is one of the members of the <a href="Avalon%20Marshes%20Partnership">Avalon Marshes Partnership</a>, which also includes the Somerset Wildlife Trust, Natural England, the <a href="Hawk%20and%20Owl%20Trust">Hawk and Owl Trust</a>, <a href="South%20West%20Heritage%20Trust">South West Heritage Trust</a>, the <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> and <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> which work together on conservation issues in the area. Between 2012 and 2016 the scheme was supported by a <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> grant of £1,772,500 with additional investment of £920,080 from other sources. The Avalon Marshes Centre, run by Natural England, is near the Ham Wall reserve. The network of reserves and private land managed for conservation in the Avalon marshes means that wetland management can be carried out on a landscape scale. Joint schemes include reed bed management across the area, improved pedestrian and cycle access, and the provision of visitor facilities at Ashcott corner between the Ham Wall and Shapwick Heath reserves.

Following sporadic appearances by males over a number of years, bitterns were first unequivocally proved to have bred at Ham Wall in 2008, and the reserve now typically holds 18–20 breeding males, probably about its maximum capacity, with another 20 males elsewhere in the Avalon Marshes. The reserve has attracted three other <a href="heron">heron</a> species that are attempting to <a href="Colonisation%20%28biology%29">colonise</a> the UK. The formerly rare <a href="Great%20egret">great white egret</a> first bred in 2012 and has nested in small numbers every year since on the reserve and the neighbouring wetlands. The <a href="little%20bittern">little bittern</a> was present from 2009, bred in 2010, and has been present every year since, although breeding by this reclusive bird is difficult to prove in such a large expanse of reed bed. At least six birdsm, including four males, were present in spring 2017. The third coloniser is the <a href="cattle%20egret">cattle egret</a> which had bred elsewhere in Somerset from 2008 to 2010. An influx in 2017 led to six pairs attempting to breed at Ham Wall, four successfully, and 30 birds were present in January 2018.

Other typical wetland species include <a href="grey%20heron">grey heron</a>s, some of which nest in the reed beds instead of the more usual trees, <a href="garganey">garganey</a>s (typically two to three pairs), <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">marsh harriers</a> (three nesting females in 2017), <a href="hobby%20%28bird%29">hobbies</a>, <a href="bearded%20tit">bearded tit</a>s and <a href="Cetti%27s%20warbler">Cetti's</a>, <a href="reed%20warbler">reed</a> and <a href="sedge%20warbler">sedge warbler</a>s. A winter evening roost of <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>s is one of the largest in the UK, and attracts visitors to see hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of these birds assemble before descending into the reed bed.

Rare visitors to the reserve in recent years include a <a href="collared%20pratincole">collared pratincole</a> and a <a href="whiskered%20tern">whiskered tern</a> in 2016, a singing male <a href="pied-billed%20grebe">pied-billed grebe</a> in 2013, a <a href="blue-winged%20teal">blue-winged teal</a> in 2012 and a <a href="squacco%20heron">squacco heron</a> in 2011.

<a href="Eurasian%20otter">Otters</a> breed on the reserve and two artificial <a href="Otter%23Terminology">holts</a> have been placed in the reed beds for their use. <a href="European%20water%20vole">Water voles</a> can also be found in suitable habitat. <a href="Grass%20snake">Grass snake</a>s, three species of <a href="newt">newt</a>s, <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a>s and <a href="common%20frog">common frog</a>s are found throughout the Avalon marshes, and non-native <a href="marsh%20frog">marsh frog</a>s occur at Ham Wall and neighbouring Shapwick Heath. A recent intervention has been the construction of a new <a href="EDF%20Energy">EDF Energy-funded</a> eel pass to make it easier for <a href="European%20eel">European eel</a>s to enter the reserve from the nearby <a href="River%20Huntspill">River Huntspill</a> and South Drain. The young eels may remain on the reserve for up to 20 years before returning to the sea to breed. 

<a href="Invertebrate">Invertebrate</a>s found in the wetland include several nationally uncommon aquatic <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s including the <a href="Segmentina%20nitida">shining ram's-horn snail</a> and the <a href="depressed%20river%20mussel">depressed river mussel</a>. Insects include the <a href="purple%20hairstreak">purple hairstreak</a>, <a href="silver-washed%20fritillary">silver-washed fritillary</a> and <a href="scarlet%20tiger%20moth">scarlet tiger moth</a>, although the <a href="marsh%20fritillary">marsh fritillary</a>, <a href="Hemaris%20tityus">narrow-bordered bee hawk-moth</a> and <a href="Stethophyma%20grossum">large marsh grasshopper</a> have been lost to the area since the mid 1990s, suggesting some conservation issues. 19 species of <a href="odonata">dragonflies and damselflies</a> have been recorded at Ham Wall, including a roost of thousands of <a href="four-spotted%20chaser">four-spotted chaser</a>s. The <a href="lesser%20silver%20water%20beetle">lesser silver water beetle</a> occurs in the wet woodland, and the very rare <a href="leaf%20beetle">leaf beetle</a> "<a href="Oulema%20erichsoni">Oulema erichsoni</a>" was noted in 2015.

Apart from the <a href="phragmites">common reed</a> that dominates the marshes, restricted-range plants found in the Brue valley wetlands include <a href="Wolffia%20arrhiza">rootless duckweed</a>, <a href="Comarum%20palustre">marsh cinquefoil</a>, <a href="Hottonia%20palustris">water violet</a>, <a href="Peucedanum%20palustre">milk parsley</a> and <a href="Drosera%20rotundifolia">round-leaved sundew</a>.

Greater unpredictability in the UK climate may lead to heavy summer rains which would adversely affect ground-nesting birds, invertebrates and other wildlife. Although this inland site is not directly threatened by salt-water incursion in the same way as east coast reserves like <a href="RSPB%20Minsmere">RSPB Minsmere</a> and <a href="Titchwell%20Marsh">Titchwell Marsh</a>, sea level rise will make the drainage of the Somerset Levels more difficult and current water-pumping facilities may become inadequate.

Despite Environment Agency planning, recent significant river flooding events occurred on the Levels in <a href="2012%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%20floods">November 2012</a> and following <a href="Cyclone%20Dirk">Cyclone Dirk</a> in <a href="Winter%20flooding%20of%202013%E2%80%9314%20on%20the%20Somerset%20Levels">winter 2013–2014</a>, the latter leaving of agricultural land under water for over a month.

Water-based sport and recreation elsewhere in the Levels could possibly enable non-native species to invade the wetlands, and the number of visitors to the area can cause congestion on local roads, particularly those coming for the winter evening starling roost.

Roy Phillipps

Roy Cecil Phillipps, <a href="Military%20Cross">MC</a> <a href="Medal%20bar">& Bar</a>, <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">DFC</a> (1 March 1892 – 21 May 1941) was an Australian <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of <a href="Aviation%20in%20World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. He achieved fifteen victories in aerial combat, four of them in a single action on 12 June 1918. A <a href="pastoral%20farming">grazier</a> between the wars, he joined the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1940 and was killed in a plane crash the following year.

Born in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> but raised in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, Phillipps joined the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> as an <a href="infantry">infantry</a>man in April 1915, seeing action at <a href="Gallipoli%20campaign">Gallipoli</a> and on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Wounded twice in 1916, he transferred to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) and was accepted for pilot training in May 1917. As a member of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a> in France, Phillipps flew mainly <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">S.E.5</a> fighters, and was awarded two <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>es and the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> for his actions. He finished the war a <a href="major">major</a>, commanding <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 (Training) Squadron</a> in England. Returning to Australia in 1919, he left the AFC and was managing a rural property when he enlisted in the RAAF soon after the outbreak of World War II. At his death he was ranked <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, commanding <a href="No.%202%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School</a> at <a href="Archerfield%2C%20Queensland">Archerfield, Queensland</a>.

Phillipps was born on 1 March 1892 in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>; sources differ on the exact location, which is variously recorded as rural <a href="Moree%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Moree</a> and metropolitan <a href="North%20Sydney%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">North Sydney</a>. He was the son of William Hargreaves Phillipps, originally of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, England, and his wife Cecil. After his father died, Phillipps' mother took him to live in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, Western Australia. Educated at <a href="Hale%20School">Hale School</a>, he studied to be an accountant and was practising on a pastoral property in the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> when war broke out in 1914.

Phillipps enlisted in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> in April 1915 and was assigned to the <a href="28th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">28th Battalion</a>, an infantry unit raised the same month at Blackboy Camp, Western Australia. He successfully applied for a commission and departed for Egypt aboard HMAT "Ascanius" on 9 June as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>. After training in Egypt, he departed with his unit for <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> aboard the transport "<a href="SS%20Ivernia">Ivernia</a>" on 4 September. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 25 October. The 28th Battalion, which had been sent to Gallipoli late in the campaign as reinforcements, was not heavily engaged on the peninsula, and suffered relatively few casualties before the withdrawal in December 1915.

In March 1916, Phillipps was deployed to France with the 28th Battalion for service on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. He participated in a raid against the forts of <a href="Armenti%C3%A8res">Armentières</a> on the night of 6/7 June, and saw action during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Battle of Pozières</a> in July. On 5 August, he was shot through the thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> on 12 August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to the thigh the following month, near <a href="Gueudecourt">Gueudecourt</a>. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2 March 1917.

Unable to take any further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would normally have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> (AFC) as <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> of <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>. After getting a taste of flying as a passenger, the twenty-five-year-old applied for pilot training, altering his birthdate from 1892 to 1896. The official age limit for pilots in the AFC was thirty, but the preferred age was under twenty-three. Phillipps' application was accepted in May 1917 and, after qualifying for his <a href="aircrew%20brevet">wings</a>, his proficiency was considered such that in August he was attached to <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 32 Squadron</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> to gain operational experience in France. Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a> near <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a>, but he escaped injury; by the time he completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.

Phillipps married Ellen Robinson, daughter of Western Australia's <a href="Attorney-General%20of%20Western%20Australia">Attorney-General</a>, at <a href="St%20Mary%20Abbots">St Mary Abbots</a> in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>, London, on 8 September 1917. Rejoining No. 2 Squadron within the month as a <a href="flight%20commander">flight commander</a>, he was initially engaged mainly in low-level strafing and bombing missions in DH.5s as his unit, attached to the <a href="Third%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Third Army</a>, took part in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>. During the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a>, on 22 November he recorded his first aerial victory when he turned the tables on a German fighter that had attacked him from above, forcing it to land. He was recommended for the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> on 3 December, the award being promulgated in "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>" on 4 February 1918, and the full citation appearing on 5 July:

No. 2 Squadron converted to <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5</a>s in January 1918. The unit generally conducted patrols with flights of six aircraft but found it difficult to lure enemy fighters into combat, so after a lull in fighting early in February it began flying two-plane missions, which yielded better results. The following month, as the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> got under way, Phillipps shot down three German fighters in as many days: a <a href="Fokker%20Dr.I">Fokker Triplane</a> on 22 March, an <a href="Albatros%20Flugzeugwerke">Albatros</a> the next morning, and a two-seater on 24 March; the <a href="Official%20History%20of%20Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201914%E2%80%931918">official history of Australia in the war</a> recorded that the last-mentioned enemy lost its wings to Phillipps' machine-gun fire, and "fell like a stone". With the Allies holding clear superiority over the German fighters, the main danger to the Australians was from ground fire as most combat took place at low level, and "their machines came back full of bullet-holes". On 27 March, Phillipps achieved two more victories, a Triplane that he sent down in flames near <a href="Albert%2C%20Somme">Albert</a> and another German fighter over <a href="M%C3%A9aulte">Méaulte</a>. He was recommended for a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his Military Cross on 31 March, and the award was gazetted on 22 June:

During April 1918, No. 2 Squadron began operating in wide-ranging offensive "circus" patrols made up of large formations of fighters, often drawn from several squadrons. Phillipps destroyed a <a href="Pfalz%20Flugzeugwerke">Pfalz</a> near <a href="Bapaume">Bapaume</a> on 16 May, before achieving his greatest success on 12 June when he shot down four German fighters in a single patrol over <a href="Rib%C3%A9court-la-Tour">Ribécourt</a>. His victims included two Fokker Triplanes, one of which he attacked head-on, an <a href="LVG">LVG</a>, and a <a href="Fokker%20D.VII">Fokker D.VII</a> flown by Fritz Loerzer, commander of <a href="Jagdstaffel%2026">"Jasta" 26</a> and an eleven-victory ace, who was captured. The feat also gave Phillipps a total of eleven victories, making him the equal highest-scoring ace in No. 2 Squadron along with Captain <a href="Henry%20Garnet%20Forrest">Henry Forrest</a>. Phillipps was recommended for the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> on 16 June, and the award was promulgated on 3 August:

On 25 July, Phillipps was leading the escort for a raid on the Lille forts east of Armentières when he spotted a patrol of seven Fokkers. Jettisoning his bombs to lighten his load, he attacked one of the German fighters and shot away its wing; the others retreated. During the Allies' <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, on 12 August, he joined fellow No. 2 Squadron ace <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a> and <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron</a> aces <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a> and <a href="Elwyn%20Roy%20King">Roy King</a> to lead their combined forces in support of the <a href="Fourth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Fourth Army</a>, Phillipps accounting for a Fokker that broke up in mid-air. He was credited with two other victories in August to bring his tally to fifteen, making him No. 2 Squadron's second most successful ace after Captain <a href="Francis%20Smith%20%28aviator%29">Francis Smith</a>, who finished the war with sixteen. Later that month, Phillipps rotated back to England in accordance with <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> policy, which required pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. In October, he was promoted to <a href="major">major</a> and posted to command <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 6 (Training) Squadron</a> at <a href="Minchinhampton">Minchinhampton</a>; the unit was primarily responsible for training new pilots for service with No. 2 Squadron.

Phillipps relinquished command of No. 6 Squadron upon its disbandment in March 1919. He returned to Australia on 16 June aboard the troopship "Kaiser-i-Hind", and was discharged from the Australian Flying Corps on 15 August. That month he was one of several veteran pilots, including Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Oswald%20Watt">Oswald Watt</a> and Major <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bill Anderson</a>, appointed to serve on a committee examining applications for a proposed Australian air service to replace the AFC; the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a>, immediate precursor to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), was duly formed on 1 January 1920 under Anderson's command.

After leaving the military, Phillipps became a <a href="Pastoral%20farming">grazier</a> in New South Wales. He purchased Courallie station at Moree in 1926, and was managing the property when <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">Australia declared war</a> in September 1939. In February 1940, he enlisted in the RAAF as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a>. Raised to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, he was posted as assistant chief ground instructor to <a href="No.%202%20Elementary%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 2 Elementary Flying Training School</a> (No. 2 EFTS) at <a href="Archerfield%2C%20Queensland">Archerfield</a>, Queensland, on 27 March. No. 2 EFTS was one of twelve basic flying schools established by the RAAF as part of Australia's contribution to the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. Phillipps was appointed chief ground instructor on 17 June. Having been promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, he assumed command of No. 2 EFTS on 20 October 1940.

Phillipps died on 21 May 1941, following an accident in a private plane. The aircraft, piloted by its owner, <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> J.W.F. Collins, was reported to have taken off from Archerfield at night without RAAF or <a href="Airservices%20Australia">Civil Aviation Department</a> clearance, and collided with trees. Survived by his wife, son and three daughters, Phillipps was cremated at <a href="Mount%20Thompson%20Crematorium">Mount Thompson Crematorium</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. He is commemorated on the Queensland Cremation Memorial, Brisbane, and on panel 116 of the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra.

Big Butte Creek

Big Butte Creek is a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="Rogue%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Rogue River</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. It <a href="drainage%20basin">drains</a> approximately of <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon">Jackson County</a>. Its two forks, the North Fork and the South Fork, both begin high in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> near <a href="Mount%20McLoughlin">Mount McLoughlin</a>. Flowing predominantly west, they meet near the city of <a href="Butte%20Falls%2C%20Oregon">Butte Falls</a>. The <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a> flows generally northwest until it empties into the Rogue Falls was <a href="Municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.

Big Butte Creek's watershed was originally settled over 8,000 years ago by the <a href="Klamath%20people">Klamath</a>, <a href="Upper%20Umpqua">Upper Umpqua</a>, and <a href="Takelma">Takelma</a> tribes of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>. In the <a href="Rogue%20River%20Wars">Rogue River Wars</a> of the 1850s, most of the Native Americans were either killed or forced onto <a href="Indian%20reservation">Indian reservation</a>s. The first non-<a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was <a href="Municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.

<a href="Big%20Butte%20Springs">Big Butte Springs</a>, located in the watershed, provides clean drinking water to more than 115,000 residents of the <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a>. It emits over of water per day. Water from Big Butte Creek is also diverted for irrigation at several other locations.

The water quality of the Big Butte Creek watershed is generally high, and it supports several species of <a href="trout">trout</a> and <a href="salmon">salmon</a>. The watershed is also home to more than 152 species of birds, 63 species of mammals, 19 species of reptiles, and numerous plants. The Poverty Flats region was designated an <a href="Area%20of%20Critical%20Environmental%20Concern">Area of Critical Environmental Concern</a> by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> in 1995 to protect several rare species of plants.

Big Butte Creek begins in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a> near <a href="Butte%20Falls%2C%20Oregon">Butte Falls</a>. It flows generally northwest over approximately to its confluence with the Rogue River. The two main forks of Big Butte Creek, the North Fork and the South Fork, merge at above sea level, while the creek's mouth is located at an elevation of .

The North Fork's headwaters are located on the slopes of the Rustler Peak. It flows southwest, receiving many small tributaries such as Jackass, Eighty Acre, and Friese creeks. Turning west, it flows just north of Butte Falls before merging with the South Fork.

The South Fork begins at the confluence of two of its tributaries, Twincheria and Rancheria creeks. It flows southwest, receiving Fourbit Creek on the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left</a>. Fourbit Creek begins near Mount McLoughlin, where massive <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">fault</a>s may allow water to seep into it from nearby <a href="Fourmile%20Lake%20%28Oregon%29">Fourmile Lake</a> in the <a href="Klamath%20River">Klamath River</a> watershed. The South Fork turns west and receives Willow Creek on the left. Big Butte Springs are located on Willow Creek, and the Medford Aqueduct, which carries drinking water to cities in the Rogue Valley, parallels the South Fork from there all the way to Butte Falls. The South Fork flows over the Butte Falls—the nearby city's namesake—and merges with the North Fork about downstream.

Big Butte Creek travels northwest, gathering McNeil Creek on the left and Clark Creek on the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right</a>, along with many other minor tributaries. This region contains many Class II and III rapids, as rated on the <a href="International%20Scale%20of%20River%20Difficulty">International Scale of River Difficulty</a>. The stream is crossed by Cobleigh Road at <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> (RM) 9.5 or river kilometer (RK) 15, and Netherlands Road at RM 3 (RK 4.8). About before its mouth, Big Butte Creek cascades over Crowfoot Falls and is crossed by Crowfoot Road. It then flows into the Rogue River from its mouth at the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. Big Butte Creek's mouth is about one mile southwest of William L. Jess Dam, and <a href="Oregon%20Route%2062">Oregon Route 62</a> passes just north of it.

The <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> monitors the flow of Big Butte Creek at three different <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a>s: two on the South Fork, and one on the <a href="main%20stem">main stem</a>. Both South Fork gauges were shut down in 1991, but the gauge located near the mouth of Big Butte Creek continues to operate. The main stem often discharges less water than the South Fork alone in the summer months because of numerous diversions.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately of <a href="southern%20Oregon">southern Oregon</a>. Elevations range from at the creek's mouth to at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of . About 56 percent is <a href="federal%20lands">federally owned</a> by the Bureau of Land Management and the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a>, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of <a href="Medford%2C%20Oregon">Medford</a>.

The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a>. Temperatures range from in the winter to in the summer. <a href="Precipitation">Precipitation</a> averages between annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's <a href="surface%20runoff">surface runoff</a> is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.

The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of <a href="pyroclastic%20rock">pyroclastic rock</a>. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, <a href="earthflow">earthflow</a>s are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. <a href="Basalt">Basalt</a> and <a href="andesite">andesite</a> are the most common rock types in this region.

Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small <a href="Klamath%20River">Klamath River</a> tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the <a href="South%20Fork%20Rogue%20River">South Fork Rogue River</a> to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Some of the most common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek watershed include four species of <a href="fir">fir</a>, two species of <a href="pine">pine</a>, <a href="Calocedrus%20decurrens">incense cedar</a>, and <a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">western hemlock</a>. The <a href="understory">understory</a> contains plants such as <a href="Taxus%20brevifolia">Pacific yew</a>, <a href="Arbutus%20menziesii">Pacific madrone</a>, <a href="Chrysolepis">chinquapin</a>, and <a href="Acer%20circinatum">vine maple</a>. Several <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> have been reported in the Big Butte Creek watershed, such as <a href="Poa%20pratensis">Kentucky bluegrass</a>, <a href="Agrostis%20capillaris">common bent</a>, <a href="Bromus%20tectorum">drooping brome</a>, and <a href="Agrostis%20gigantea">redtop</a>. The spread of these species is most likely due to <a href="overgrazing">overgrazing</a>. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include <a href="Perideridia%20howellii">Howell's yampah</a>, <a href="Mimulus%20pygmaeus">Egg Lake monkeyflower</a>, <a href="Cypripedium%20fasciculatum">clustered lady's slipper</a>, <a href="Asarum">green-flowered ginger</a>, <a href="Collomia">Mount Mazama collomia</a>, and <a href="Microseris%20laciniata">Detling's microseris</a>. <a href="Iliamna%20latibracteata">Mallow</a> and <a href="Plagiobothrys%20glyptocarpus">popcorn flower</a> have also been discovered in <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>s. The Poverty Flats <a href="Area%20of%20Critical%20Environmental%20Concern">Area of Critical Environmental Concern</a> (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including <a href="Limnanthes%20floccosa%23Bellinger%27s%20meadowfoam">Bellinger's meadowfoam</a>, Howell's yampah, and <a href="Woodsia%20scopulina">Rocky Mountain woodsia</a>.

Over 152 species of birds are known or suspected to live in the Big Butte Creek watershed, including the <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a> and the <a href="northern%20spotted%20owl">northern spotted owl</a>, a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a>. <a href="Bald%20eagle">Bald eagle</a>s nest around Willow Lake. <a href="Amphibian">Amphibian</a>s such as the vulnerable <a href="Oregon%20spotted%20frog">Oregon spotted frog</a> and the <a href="near%20threatened">near threatened</a> <a href="Cascades%20frog">Cascades frog</a> inhabit some regions of the watershed. <a href="Black-tailed%20deer">Black-tailed deer</a>, <a href="Roosevelt%20elk">Roosevelt elk</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s, and <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bears</a> are the most common of the 63 species of mammals found in the watershed. <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">Fishers</a> and <a href="American%20marten">American marten</a>s have also been spotted. The <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a> and the vulnerable <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> once lived in the watershed, but are now considered <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a>. Nineteen species of reptiles live in the area. Other sensitive species include the <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>, the <a href="western%20pond%20turtle">western pond turtle</a>, the <a href="sandhill%20crane">sandhill crane</a>, and <a href="Townsend%27s%20big-eared%20bat">Townsend's big-eared bat</a>.

<a href="Rainbow%20trout">Rainbow trout</a>, <a href="Chinook%20salmon">chinook</a> and <a href="coho%20salmon">coho salmon</a>, and <a href="Pacific%20Lamprey">Pacific Lamprey</a> are the most common <a href="anadromous%20fish">anadromous fish</a> that inhabit Big Butte Creek. They travel as far as Butte Falls, sometimes passing over it during high flows. Because of the cold, sterile conditions of the water and the difficulty of jumping over the <a href="Big%20Butte%20Creek%20Falls">Butte Creek waterfall</a>, streams above Butte Falls have very low populations of anadromous fish. Native, resident fish in this area include <a href="coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">coastal cutthroat</a> and rainbow trout. Willow Lake contains <a href="largemouth%20bass">largemouth bass</a> and rainbow, cutthroat, and <a href="Brook%20trout">brook</a> trout. Overall, the number of fish in the Big Butte Creek watershed has declined in recent years, possibly due to the clearing of riparian zones and rising water temperatures.

Humans have lived in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The <a href="Klamath%20people">Klamath</a>, <a href="Upper%20Umpqua">Upper Umpqua</a>, <a href="Takelma">Takelma</a>, and <a href="Latgawa">Latgawa</a> tribes of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> inhabited the watershed until they were driven out in the <a href="Rogue%20River%20Wars">Rogue River Wars</a> of the 1850s. On <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to <a href="Indian%20reservation">Indian reservation</a>s. Non-<a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> <a href="settler">settler</a>s first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, <a href="ranch">ranch</a>ing, and <a href="logging">logging</a> industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby <a href="Little%20Butte%20Creek">Little Butte Creek</a>.

In 1904, a water-powered <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a> was constructed at Butte Falls. The town of Butte Falls was established in 1906, and <a href="municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> in 1911. The Pacific and Eastern Railway was constructed to Butte Falls in 1910. Butte Falls also received <a href="water%20right">water right</a>s to Ginger Springs, providing high quality drinking water for the town.

The Cat Hill Burn destroyed of forest on Rustler Peak in 1910. In 1915, the Eagle Point Irrigation Canal was constructed, diverting approximately of water for <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> in the Little Butte Creek watershed. The canal begins just below Butte Falls. The Butte Falls Fish Hatchery was also constructed in 1915. Originally, the hatchery impounded water from Ginger Creek, however in 1923 a canal was built transferring of water from the South Fork of Big Butte Creek. The Medford Aqueduct, a pipeline, was constructed in 1927. It delivers about of drinking water from Big Butte Springs south to the <a href="Bear%20Creek%20%28Rogue%20River%29">Bear Creek</a> watershed. In 1951, a second pipeline was added, and Willow Dam was constructed, creating Willow Lake. The springs serve over 115,000 customers throughout the <a href="Rogue%20Valley">Rogue Valley</a>.

Loggers felled massive amounts of forest in the 1920s and 1930s. <a href="Reforestation">Reforestation</a> efforts began in the 1940s because natural regeneration could not keep pace with the rate of logging. In 1962, the <a href="Columbus%20Day%20Storm%20of%201962">Columbus Day Storm</a> knocked many more large trees to the ground. Today, <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a> covers only about five percent of the watershed.

In 1995, the Poverty Flats region was designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a>. Located about west of Butte Falls, the ACEC is home to several rare species of plants. It was fenced off in 1996 to protect the area from roaming <a href="cattle">cattle</a>.

The Butte Falls Fish Hatchery was scheduled to be closed by the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> in July 2009 as part of a statewide effort to decrease the department's budget, but on July 3 it was announced that the hatchery would continue to operate with only one employee. However, the hatchery was closed permanently in October 2010.

A portion of the Eagle Point Irrigation Canal failed on October 2, 2011, sending of muddy water down a hillside, across a road, and into lower Big Butte Creek, a vital salmon spawning area. A stream gauge on the Rogue River about downstream reported <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a> levels twenty times higher than before the breach. The canal was repaired by October 28.

The <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) has monitored Big Butte Creek for eight different parameters that affect water quality: temperature, <a href="oxygen%20saturation">oxygen saturation</a>, <a href="pH">pH</a>, <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>s, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, chemical contaminants such as <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and <a href="metal">metal</a>s, <a href="turbidity">turbidity</a>, and <a href="alkalinity">alkalinity</a>. Streams that exceed the standard level are placed on the DEQ 303d list in accordance with the <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a>. About of the streams in the Big Butte Creek watershed were listed on the 2004/2006 DEQ 303d list. The entire main stem exceeded the standard level for temperature, oxygen saturation, and "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>", a type of bacteria. The lower of the North Fork were listed for high temperature, along with many other minor tributaries. The South Fork was not listed, although some of its tributaries were.
Overall, water quality in the Big Butte Creek watershed is generally high, however road construction and logging can cause severe erosion, leading to high levels of <a href="sedimentation">sedimentation</a> and turbidity. The Willow Creek region often experiences high turbidity, but Willow Lake traps the sediment before it can travel downstream. Big Butte Springs provides clean water that requires minimal treatment to meet water quality standards. Water from the springs has very little chemical pollution, low turbidity, and temperatures averaging between .

Popular recreational activities in the Big Butte Creek watershed include hunting, camping, hiking, and <a href="horseback%20riding">horseback riding</a>. Many <a href="tourist">tourist</a>s also come to sight-see. The most heavily used trail in the area is the Blue Canyon Trail, leading to the <a href="Sky%20Lakes%20Wilderness">Sky Lakes Wilderness</a>, and ultimately the larger <a href="Pacific%20Crest%20Trail">Pacific Crest Trail</a>. The city of Butte Falls has organized the Butte Falls Discovery Loop Tour, a half-day-long drive through the <a href="Rogue%20River%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Siskiyou%20National%20Forest">Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest</a>. The loop starts in Butte Falls, and has several stops for hiking and viewing the landscape, including Mount McLoughlin.

Water recreation on Willow Lake includes boating, swimming, fishing, and <a href="waterskiing">waterskiing</a>. Fishing is also popular in other streams, especially Fourbit Creek. <a href="Cross-country%20skiing">Cross-country skiing</a> and <a href="Snowmobile">snowmobiling</a> are popular in the winter.

Nodar Kumaritashvili

Nodar Kumaritashvili (; ; 25 November 198812 February 2010) was a <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgian</a> <a href="luge">one-man luger</a> who suffered a fatal crash during a training run for the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a> competition in <a href="Whistler%2C%20British%20Columbia">Whistler, British Columbia</a>, Canada, on the day of the opening ceremony. He became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympics, and the seventh athlete to <a href="Olympic%20deaths">die in either a Summer or Winter Olympic Games</a>.

Kumaritashvili, who first began to participate in luge when he was 13, came from a family of seasoned lugers: his grandfather had introduced the sport to the <a href="Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Soviet republic of Georgia</a>, and both his father and uncle had competed when they were younger, with his uncle later serving as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation. Kumaritashvili himself began competing in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Luge%20World%20Cup">2008–09 Luge World Cup</a>. He had also been a student at the <a href="Georgian%20Technical%20University">Georgian Technical University</a>, where he earned an economics degree in 2009.

Kumaritashvili was born on 25 November 1988, in <a href="Borjomi">Borjomi</a>, <a href="Georgian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Georgian SSR</a>, present-day Georgia, to David and Dodo Kumaritashvili. He had one sister, Mariam, who was four years younger.

Kumaritashvili's family had a long association with luge. His grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili introduced luge to Georgia after first training for it in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>. Aleko helped build a primitive luge run in <a href="Bakuriani">Bakuriani</a> in 1970; a more finished track, funded by the Soviet authorities, was built in 1973. Kumaritashvili's uncle and coach, Felix Kumaritashvili, served as the head of the Georgian Luge Federation, and his father, David, won a USSR Youth Championship when Georgia was part of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, and was a three-time champion at the <a href="Spartakiad">Spartakiad</a>, once in two-man bobsled and twice in luge.

Kumaritashvili grew up in nearby Bakuriani, which is known for its many ski slopes. He enjoyed several winter sports and started luge when he was 13 years old. While attending the <a href="Georgian%20Technical%20University">Georgian Technical University</a>, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 2009, Kumaritashvili maintained a rigorous training and competition schedule. Though his family endured economic hardship, Kumaritashvili attended as many luge events as he could, often driving for days to reach World Cup events. As a devout member of the <a href="Georgian%20Orthodox%20Church">Georgian Orthodox Church</a>, he prayed at church before every competition.

During his first season of competition, Kumaritashvili finished 55th out of 62 competitors at the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Luge%20World%20Cup">2008–09 Luge World Cup</a>, where he was entered in four races. He finished 28th out of 32 competitors at the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Luge%20World%20Cup">2009–10 Luge World Cup</a> event at <a href="Cesana%20Pariol">Cesana Pariol</a> in January, which was his fifth and last World Cup event. At the time of his death, he was ranked 44th out of 65 competitors in the 2009–10 World Cup season and was regarded as one of the best lugers to come from Georgia.

By 31 December 2009, the cut-off date for luge qualifications for the Olympics, Kumaritashvili was ranked 38th overall. He qualified for the <a href="Luge%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20singles">luge men's singles event</a> at the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a>, his Olympic debut, by racing in five World Cup races over two years.

The venue for the Olympic luge competition, the <a href="Whistler%20Sliding%20Centre">Whistler Sliding Centre</a>, was designed by <a href="Udo%20Gurgel">Udo Gurgel</a> and his firm, Ingenieurburo Gurgel (IBG) of Leipzig, with the final version produced on 23 October 2004. Using the specified track dimensions for a variety of sled entrance and exit trajectories, IBG calculated the speeds and G forces along each curve of the track. The new curve configurations, rather than the speed, were expected to provide the main challenge. The maximum calculated speed for men's luge was .

In February 2005, concerns arose regarding the difficulties posed by Cesana Pariol, the track built for the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in Turin, Italy. Several serious crashes occurred, prompting calls for physical modifications to that track. The <a href="International%20Luge%20Federation">International Luge Federation</a> (FIL) was concerned that similar modifications might be required at the Whistler track and communicated these concerns to the <a href="Vancouver%20Organizing%20Committee">Vancouver Organizing Committee</a> (VANOC) in March 2005. Uncertainty about the track design persisted into 2006 until the scheduled start of track construction, when it was determined that construction would be based on the original design.

After construction, during the track <a href="homologation">homologation</a> (certification) process, the track produced speeds exceeding the design calculations by at least . Following the Olympic test event in February 2009, <a href="Josef%20Fendt">Josef Fendt</a>, president of FIL, sent a letter to IBG expressing surprise that a record speed of had been reached, concluding that the designer's calculations were incorrect, and stating that the high speed "makes me worry."
The letter also said that "overstepping this limit would be an absolute unreasonable demand for the athletes." He asked IBG to respond, in particular with regard to the future Sochi Olympic track. Fendt also informed VANOC that the Whistler track was not supplied as ordered. VANOC, however, concluded that no action was required regarding the Whistler track, since the focus of Fendt's letter to IBG was the new Sochi track.

In April 2009, IBG explained that the differences between the calculated and actual observed speeds were caused by new sled technology that reduced <a href="drag%20coefficient">drag coefficient</a>s and ice <a href="friction%20coefficient">friction coefficient</a>s. Because of the secrecy inherent in sled development, the IBG engineers had difficulty obtaining the latest sled specifications required for their engineering calculations. In the view of the Games organizers, the high speeds and technical challenges could be safely mitigated by imposing additional practice and graduated training requirements on the athletes.

On 12 February 2010, after 25 previous attempts, 15 of them from the men's start, Kumaritashvili was fatally injured in a crash during his final training run, after losing control in the last turn of the course. He was thrown off his luge and over the sidewall of the track, striking an unprotected steel support pole at the end of the run. He was travelling at the moment of impact.

Medics were at Kumaritashvili's side immediately after the crash. Both <a href="Cardio-pulmonary%20resuscitation">cardio-pulmonary</a> and <a href="mouth-to-mouth%20resuscitation">mouth-to-mouth resuscitation</a> were performed. He was <a href="medical%20evacuation">airlifted</a> to a Whistler hospital, where he died of his injuries. It was luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975, when an Italian luger had been killed. Kumaritashvili became the fourth athlete to die during preparations for a Winter Olympics, after British luger <a href="Kazimierz%20Kay-Skrzypeski">Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski</a> and Australian skier <a href="Ross%20Milne">Ross Milne</a> (both <a href="1964%20Winter%20Olympics">1964 Innsbruck</a>), and Swiss speed skier <a href="Nicolas%20Bochatay">Nicolas Bochatay</a> (<a href="1992%20Winter%20Olympics">1992 Albertville</a>). He was also the 16th participating athlete to <a href="Olympic%20deaths">die during or in practice for a Summer or Winter Olympic Games</a>.

After footage of Kumaritashvili's death was televised, there was shock and mourning in Georgia. In response to the accident, the <a href="Georgia%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics">Georgian team</a> announced that it would consider skipping the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony">opening ceremonies</a> or withdrawing from the games entirely, but <a href="Nika%20Rurua">Nika Rurua</a>, the Georgian minister for sports and culture, later announced the team would stay in Vancouver and "dedicate their efforts to their fallen comrade". During the opening ceremony, the seven remaining members of the Georgian Olympic team wore black armbands, bore the Georgian flag with a black ribbon tied to it, and left a space vacant in the procession, as marks of respect. Upon entering <a href="BC%20Place%20Stadium">BC Place Stadium</a>, the Georgian team was greeted with a standing ovation from the assembled crowd. The team left the stadium immediately after the procession.

Later, during the opening ceremonies, a <a href="moment%20of%20silence">moment of silence</a> was held to honour Kumaritashvili's memory, and both the Canadian and <a href="Olympic%20flag">Olympic flag</a>s were lowered to <a href="half-staff">half-staff</a>. Fellow teammate and luger <a href="Levan%20Gureshidze">Levan Gureshidze</a>, who was to compete with Kumaritashvili, withdrew after the crash, telling teammates that he "couldn't go on", and went home to attend the funeral. The lugers who stayed to compete all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of Kumaritashvili.

Early in the morning of 17 February 2010, Kumaritashvili's body arrived in <a href="Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>. It reached his hometown of Bakuriani later that day. Thousands of Georgians attended a funeral feast for him on 19 February, and he was buried on Saturday, 20 February, at the church he had attended. Georgian President <a href="Mikheil%20Saakashvili">Mikheil Saakashvili</a> attended the funeral service dressed in a Georgian Olympic uniform.

In Bakuriani, the street of Kumaritashvili's childhood home was renamed in his honour. <a href="Felix%20Loch">Felix Loch</a> of Germany, who won the gold medal in luge at the Vancouver Olympics, had his medal melted down and refashioned into two disks, giving one, etched with an image of Kumaritashvili and the years of his birth and death, to Kumaritashvili's parents. In spite of several donations of money to the Kumaritashvili family, the tragedy was hard on them; twice in the years afterwards Dodo, who continued to fix a meal for Kumaritashvili every day, tried to kill herself, while David dealt with severe health problems resulting in multiple hospital stays.

The FIL stated that Kumaritashvili's death "was not caused by an unsafe track", but as a preventive measure, the walls at the exit of curve16 were raised, and the ice profile was adjusted. Padding was also added to exposed metal beams near the finish line. Olympic officials claimed the changes were "not for safety reasons but to accommodate the emotional state of the lugers". In addition, the start of the men's luge was moved to the women's starting point, to reduce speed, while the start of the women's luge was also moved farther down the track.

Training runs on the track resumed on 13 February, after the changes to the track were finished. Three lugers, including the departed Gureshidze, did not participate in any training runs on that day.

On 19 April 2010, the FIL published its final report to the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> on Kumaritashvili's death. The report found that the sled used by Kumaritashvili had met all FIL standards. It attributed the accident to "driving errors starting in curve 15/16 which as an accumulation ended in the impact that resulted in him leaving the track and subsequently hitting a post... This is a tragic result that should not have occurred as a result of an initial driving error". As the sled hit the wall at the curve-16 exit, it catapulted off the track, causing Kumaritashvili to lose control of it entirely. This was a type of accident not seen before, and therefore "[w]ith the unknown and unpredictable dynamics of this crash, the calculation and construction of the walls in that section of the track did not serve to prevent the tragedy that happened". However, the report also determined that during the homologation process and later sessions at the Whistler Sliding Centre, the track was faster than originally calculated. Instead of the expected , the highest speed recorded was . The FIL felt that luge athletes were able to cope with this speed, but "this was not a direction the FIL would like to see the sport head [in]". FIL President Fendt wrote to the <a href="Sochi%202014%20Olympic%20and%20Paralympic%20Organizing%20Committee">Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee</a> that the FIL would homologize the proposed Sochi track only if speeds did not exceed . The FIL also said it was "determined" to do what it could to prevent such accidents from occurring again. It would re-examine changes to the sport, sled design, and track technology. FIL Secretary General Svein Romstad summarized: "What happened to Nodar has been an unforeseeable fatal accident".

The British Columbia coroner's office investigated the incident. It was reported to be considering, among other pieces of evidence, written complaints about the safety of the Whistler track by Venezuelan luger <a href="Werner%20Hoeger">Werner Hoeger</a>who crashed on the track on 13 November 2009, suffering a severe <a href="concussion">concussion</a>and information suggesting that the track was constructed in such a narrow and steep location, near the Whistler and <a href="Blackcomb%20Peak">Blackcomb</a> mountains, for commercial reasons. The track designer, Udo Gurgel, said: "The track had to be near Whistler, for use after the Olympics. You don't want to ruin an investment so the track is on terrain that's a little steep." According to <a href="John%20Furlong%20%28Canadian%29">John Furlong</a>, the chief executive of the 2010 Winter Olympics organizing committee, proposals to build the sliding centre on <a href="Grouse%20Mountain">Grouse Mountain</a> near Vancouver were rejected early in the bid phase due to reservations expressed by the international luge, and the bobsled and skeleton, federations.

In a report dated 16 September 2010, the coroner ruled Kumaritashvili's death an accident brought on by an "interaction of factors", including the high speed of the track, its technical difficulty, and the athlete's relative unfamiliarity with the track. He wrote that during Kumaritashvili's training runs, it was reasonable to assume that "Mr.Kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life, and was attempting to go even faster, while simultaneously struggling to learn the intricacies of the track and the dynamics it created". The coroner accepted that luging would always carry an element of risk and that the best practices known at the time had been followed in the construction of the Whistler track. He also called upon the FIL to require athletes to engage in more mandatory training sessions prior to the Olympic Games and other major competitions.

The coroner also commented, "The organizers, regulatory bodies and venue owners must ensure that no effort is spared to anticipate the unforeseeable as far as safety is concerned," and to "err on the side of caution, insisting on more, rather than less."

Responding to the report, Kumaritashvili's father said: "I don't accept the statement about Nodar's lack of experience. He wouldn't have won the right to take part in the Olympics if he lacked experience."

In 2013, Mont Hubbard, a <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Davis">University of California, Davis</a>, mechanical and aerospace professor, issued a report claiming that Kumaritashvili's crash was probably caused by a "fillet", a joint between the lower edge of the curve and a vertical wall. Hubbard suggested that the right runner of Kumaritashvili's sled rose up the fillet, launching him into the air. Terry Gudzowsky, the president of <a href="ISC/IBG%20Group">ISC/IBG Group</a>, a consortium involved in the construction of the Whistler track, dismissed Hubbard's theory as "flawed", stating that the data to replicate the ice surface at the site of the accident in three dimensions do not exist. The <a href="Sliding%20Center%20Sanki">luge track</a> built for use at the <a href="2014%20Winter%20Olympics">2014 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Sochi">Sochi</a>, Russia, was designed with two uphill sections to reduce speeds, and for runs about slower than the Whistler track.

Masako Katsura

, nicknamed "Katsy" and sometimes called the "First Lady of Billiards", was a <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese <a href="carom%20billiards">carom billiards</a> player who was most active in the 1950s. Katsura blazed a trail for women in the sport by competing and placing among the best in the male-dominated world of professional billiards. First learning the game from her brother-in-law and then under the tutelage of Japanese champion <a href="Kinrey%20Matsuyama">Kinrey Matsuyama</a>, Katsura became Japan's only female professional player. In competition in Japan she took second place in the country's national <a href="three-cushion%20billiards">three-cushion billiards</a> championship three times. In <a href="Exhibition%20game">exhibition</a> she was noted for 10,000 points at the game of <a href="Balkline%20and%20straight%20rail">straight rail</a>.

After marrying a U.S. Army non-commissioned officer in 1950, Katsura emigrated with him to the United States in 1951. There she was invited to play in the 1952 U.S.-sponsored World Three-Cushion Championship, ultimately taking seventh place at that competition. Katsura was the first woman ever to be included in any world billiards tournament. Her fame cemented, Katsura went on an exhibition tour of the United States with eight-time world champion <a href="Welker%20Cochran">Welker Cochran</a>, and later with 51-time world champion <a href="Willie%20Hoppe">Willie Hoppe</a>. In 1953 and 1954 she again competed for the world three-cushion crown, taking fifth and fourth places respectively.

Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years. She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with <a href="Harold%20Worst">Harold Worst</a>, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC's</a> "<a href="You%20Asked%20for%20It">You Asked for It</a>", and one on the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> primetime television hit "<a href="What%27s%20My%20Line%3F">What's My Line?</a>". Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.

Little is known about Katsura's childhood in Japan. Katsura had three sisters and a brother. Their father died when Katsura was 12 years old and she went to live with her older sister and her sister's husband, Tomio Kobashi, who owned a billiard parlor. By 13 she was spending time in her brother-in-law's billiard room, and by 14 she was working as a billiard attendant there. Kobashi was a fine player and taught Katsura the fundamentals of various <a href="carom%20billiards">carom billiards</a> games. Katsura also had a billiard table at home, bought by her family after she showed intense interest in the sport. Katsura practiced diligently, and began competing against Japanese men and beating them. At just 15, Katsura won the women's championship <a href="Balkline%20and%20straight%20rail">straight rail</a> tournament of Japan. "Then I turned professional and began touring with a sister all over Japan, China and Formosa", said Katsura in a 1959 interview. Katsura's two younger sisters, Noriko and Tadako, also won the women's straight rail championship in other years.

In 1937, Katsura met <a href="Kinrey%20Matsuyama">Kinrey Matsuyama</a>, who had won Japan's national <a href="Three-cushion%20billiards">three-cushion</a> championship multiple times. Matsuyama was also U.S. national champion in 1934, runner-up three other times and had four second-place finishes in world competition at <a href="Balkline%20and%20straight%20rail%23The%20ascendancy%20of%20balkline">18.2 balkline</a> prior to World War II. Matsuyama was impressed with Katsura and began teaching her top level play. By 1947, Katsura was a long-established billiard star in Japan—the country's only female professional player.

During 1947 Katsura caught the eye of American serviceman Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion <a href="Ralph%20Greenleaf">Ralph Greenleaf</a>), a <a href="master%20sergeant">master sergeant</a> in the U.S. Army's <a href="Quartermaster%20Corps">Quartermaster Corps</a> who had been in the armed services for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her. They were married on November 30, 1950, but never had any children.

At the time of their marriage Katsura already boasted two second-place finishes at Japan's national three-cushion championship; one from the year prior to their wedding. She claimed the runner-up spot for a third time the year of her marriage. About that time she accomplished the lofty feat of scoring 10,000 contiguous points at <a href="straight%20rail">straight rail</a> in an exhibition by the balls around the table 27 times over about  hours. She stopped at 10,000 points only because it was a benchmark round number. In later years she said that her high run in three-cushion billiards (number of points scored consecutively in a single inning) was 19.

In 1951 Greenleaf was transferred to a U.S. post from <a href="Haneda%20Airport">Haneda Air Base</a> in Tokyo. He and Katsura, who spoke little English, set sail for the United States on the USS Breckinridge, debarking in San Francisco at the end of December 1951, just a few months before the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards tournament was scheduled to begin in that city on March 6. Katsura had been conditionally invited to play at the world championship after Cochran, whose billiard parlor was hosting the tournament, had heard of her brilliance from Matsuyama. Cochran was an 8-time world champion having won the world crown at <a href="three-cushion%20billiards">three-cushion billiards</a> in 1933, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1944 and 1945, and at <a href="Balkline%20and%20straight%20rail%23The%20ascendancy%20of%20balkline">18.2 balkline</a>, in 1927 and 1934. Cochran sent his son, W. R. (Dick) Cochran, a naval officer stationed in Japan, to investigate and received back a glowing report that said (possibly to Cochran's annoyance), "this girl is better than you are!" Though the decision was ultimately in the hands of the <a href="Billiard%20Congress%20of%20America">Billiard Congress of America</a> as tournament sponsor, they gave Cochran the option to invite her.

After Katsura arrived in the U.S., she gave a private exhibition for Cochran, who wanted to make sure she was as good as reported before finalizing the invitation. At that meeting she clicked off runs of 300 and 400 at straight rail, made in the words of Cochran "almost unbelievable shots" after switching to balkline, and showed high competence at three-cushion, consistently scoring. Cochran made the invite "final" and stated: "She's the most marvelous thing I ever saw... She's liable to beat anybody, even Willie Hoppe... I could not see any weak spots... She's going to give lots of those players fits." As a warm-up for the competition Katsura gave a number of billiard exhibitions during February 1952.

Katsura's participation in the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards title marked the first time that a woman had competed for any world billiards title. This was only ten years after <a href="Ruth%20McGinness">Ruth McGinness</a> became the first woman to have ever been invited to play in any men's professional billiard championship (the New York State Championship of 1942). The defending champion was the then 64-year-old internationally renowned <a href="Willie%20Hoppe">Willie Hoppe</a>, who would retire later that year with 51 world titles to his name between 1906 and 1952 in three forms of <a href="carom%20billiards">carom billiards</a>, three-cushion, (four sub-disciplines of) <a href="Balkline%20and%20straight%20rail">balkline</a> and <a href="cushion%20caroms">cushion caroms</a>. Before the tournament, speculation had it that when Hoppe met Katsura in the championship in the to 50 points format, he would defeat her with Katsura still needing at least 40. After seeing her play, Hoppe said "she has a fine stroke and can make shots with either hand. I look forward to playing with her." The public was fascinated by the novelty of a woman player. "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine reported that "San Franciscans who did not know a cue from a cucumber crowded in to see her... Katy ... stole the show."

The 10 champions slated to play in the <a href="Round-robin%20tournament">round robin</a> format tournament were Katsura, her mentor, Matsuyama, favorite and defending champion Willie Hoppe, Mexican champion <a href="Joe%20Chamaco">Joe Chamaco</a>, <a href="Herb%20Hardt">Herb Hardt</a> of Chicago, New York's <a href="Art%20Rubin">Art Rubin</a>, Los Angeles' <a href="Joe%20Procita">Joe Procita</a>, <a href="Ray%20Kilgore">Ray Kilgore</a> of San Francisco, <a href="Jay%20Bozeman">Jay Bozeman</a> of <a href="Vallejo%2C%20California">Vallejo</a> and <a href="Binghamton%2C%20New%20York">Binghamton's</a> <a href="Irving%20Crane">Irving Crane</a>. The championship between the invitees was to take place at Cochran's 924 Club, with 45 total games to be played (each player to play every other once) over the 17-day tournament ending on March 22, 1952. The tournament was reported to have "The greatest billiard field since before World War II". First place earned a $2,000 purse (today $), plus thousands in exhibition fees. Following behind to eight places were prizes of $1,000, $700, $500, $350, $300, $250 and $250 respectively.

On the second day of the competition, March 7, 1952, Katsura drew <a href="Irving%20Crane">Irving Crane</a> for her first match. They made quite a contrast as Crane was the tallest player at the tourney, while Katsura was described by reporter Curley Grieve of the "San Francisco Examiner" as "so small and doll-like she looks like a figurine in her flowing, gold-satin gown." Crane's main discipline was <a href="straight%20pool">straight pool</a>, at which he won numerous championships, including six world titles. The match was close, but Crane prevailed 50 to 42 in 57 . On March 10, Katsura defeated Herb Hardt 50 to 42 in 58 innings. Katsura was significantly behind at one point but counted 15 points in five innings to take the lead. On March 11, she lost to Chamaco, 50 to 35, but the following day Katsura upset Procita 50–43 in 63 innings, with runs of six, five and four. "Spectators exclaimed 'brilliant' and 'sensational' at some of her shots."

On March 14, Katsura faced the undefeated Hoppe, losing 50 to 31 in 36 innings. Though Hoppe was a darling of the public, the crowd of more than 500 spectators was clearly rooting for Katsura throughout. The next day she faced her mentor, Matsuyama, considered the contender with the best shot at beating Hoppe. Matsuyama edged out his protégé with a close 50 to 48 finish in 51 innings. By the 21st inning Matsuyama held a 29–21 lead. Katsura battled back, the score 43–42 in her favor by inning 33, but Matsuyama ran three in the 46th inning, and Katsura could not close the gap. Mentor and protégé alike posted high runs of six in the match
On March 18 Katsura trounced Art Rubin 50–28 in 58 innings. but was handed a worse defeat in her next match on March 20, losing to Bozeman 50 to 18 in 52 innings. In her last match on March 21, Katsura pulled off a 50–46 win against Kilgore in 61 innings. This was the biggest upset of the tournament. Kilgore, the "Giant Killer", was the only player other than Matsuyama who was considered to have a fighting chance at dethroning Hoppe. Between this win and her earlier win over Procita, Katsura had beaten the only two players in the tournament that had won their matches against Hoppe. That evening a separate exhibition match between Katsura and Kilgore was featured on <a href="KRON-TV">KRON-TV</a>, with commentary provided by Cochran. The next day the tournament concluded with Hoppe repeating as champion as he had so many times before. Katsura took seventh place, ahead of Procita at eighth place, Chamaco at ninth and Rubin at tenth. Above her were Crane at sixth, Rubin at fifth, Kilgore at fourth, Bozeman at third and Matsuyama as runner-up.

Following the competition, Jay Bozeman, said "We've found it hard to believe that a woman could actually step into the best billiard championship in the world and hold her own. Miss Katsura is one of the finest players I've faced in a world's tournament, while <a href="Welker%20Cochran">Welker Cochran</a>, five-time holder of the Billiards World Crown, predicted: "Given another two or three years of American competition and she will be the world's champion... Masako has opened a new field for women. Her presence has made the game attractive to women for the first time. She has the power of a man and strokes beautifully. Her maneuvers with the cue ball are fantastic. All she needs is a bit more experience and she will be unbeatable."

Soon after the 1952 championship, Cochran announced he was coming out of a seven-year retirement to play an <a href="Exhibition%20game">exhibition</a> tour with Katsura. "Millions of fans want to see this charming first lady of billiards" he said, "now some of them can." The duo previewed their tour with a three-day engagement at the Garden City Parlor in <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose</a> starting on April 18, 1952. Thereafter, they planned stops in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a> (May 2–3); Chicago (May 5–11); Detroit in mid-May; and on to tentative stops in Cleveland, <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>, Boston, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Diego, Los Angeles and <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a>. The format was to be a 100-point straight-rail match, followed by a 50-point three-cushion game played under tournament conditions with trick or "fancy" shots to follow. Katsura stated prior to departing: "I hope my tour will convince women that billiards is not only a man's game. Women can play just as well as men."

Billiards champion <a href="Tex%20Zimmerman">Tex Zimmerman</a> (Cochran's partner in the 924 Club) and well known pool <a href="Hustling">hustler</a> <a href="Danny%20McGoorty">Danny McGoorty</a> had a hand in organizing the tour. In preparation, they played up Katsura's exoticness and her physical attractiveness. Tex Zimmerman's wife sewed tight-fitting kimonos for Katsura, slit up the side, which she wore during her exhibitions with high heels. Katsura was a tiny woman, weighing between 88 and 96 pounds. and standing 5 feet tall—just about the height of a standard <a href="cue%20stick">cue stick</a>. McGoorty later mused: "Masako was cute! She was thirty-nine years old but she looked twenty-nine. She hopped around that table on her high heels, giving the fans a little smile, and everybody loved her."

It was Katsura's playing ability, though, rather than her other charms, that made her a phenomenon. When Cochran returned from his tour with Katsura he told McGoorty, who was a world class player in his own right, "you will have trouble with her." When they finally got a chance to play, the match drew crowds. "They could have sold seats in the toilet!" McGoorty exclaimed. After the match, McGoorty confirmed Cochran's prediction: 

A number of pre-booked stops on the tour suffered from lack of attendance. Cochran was very bitter about it. <a href="Newspaper%20Enterprise%20Association">NEA</a> sports editor, Harry Grayson indicated that the game was in general decline, and said that Cochran "traces the decline of championship and exhibition billiards to manufacturers taking the stars off the payroll during the depression." In a previous exhibition tour by Cochran and Hoppe in 1945, they had sold out in 13 cities. Despite some lackluster stops, upon her return to California, Katsura continued to play exhibition matches with the game's greats. Katsura and Kilgore put on a week-long exhibition in San Francisco in January 1953, where they seesawed back and forth. On January 12, Katsura beat Kilgore in their first match with runs of seven and ten, but lost to him in their second. The total points scored by the two at that time was 349 for Katsura to Kilgore's 379.

Katsura started another exhibition series with Cochran at his club in February 1953 and, tuning up for the 1953 world tournament, to start on March 26, went on a nationwide tour with Willie Hoppe in the latter part of February 1953. The 30-day tour of the northeastern U.S. included Chicago, Boston and other locations. Her husband accompanied her to provide translation. In their multiple-day exhibition match in Chicago, it was reported in the midst that Katsura had unsurprisingly won only one out of four matches against Hoppe, often pegged as the greatest player of all time.

With Hoppe retired as of 1952, there was excitement over who would take the 1953 world three-cushion crown, to be held in Chicago at the Chicago Town Club in the Sheraton Hotel. Eleven competitors were slated to play, many repeats of the prior year, including Chamaco, Katsura, Matsuyama, Bozeman, Kilgore, Procita and Rubin. New to the field were <a href="Harold%20Worst">Harold Worst</a> of <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>, Hollywood's <a href="John%20Fitzpatrick%20%28billiards%20player%29">John Fitzpatrick</a>, <a href="Mel%20Lundberg">Mel Lundberg</a> of Minneapolis and <a href="Ezequiel%20Navarra">Ezequiel Navarra</a> of Argentina. Navarra was considered the favorite by experts, having won championships that year in Cuba, Colombia, Peru and Argentina and having just come off an exhibition tour with Cochran in which Navarra averaged a formidable 1.16, scoring 1,295 three-cushions in 1,120 innings over the length of the tour.

In Katsura's first match she defeated Lundberg 50–44, in 71 innings. Thereafter she: lost to Matsuyama 50 to 37 in 39 innings; lost to Rubin, 50–37, in 52 innings; beat Fitzpatrick 50–38 in 50 innings, undefeated to that point; beat Chamaco 50 to 44, in 56 innings with a high run of eight; upset favorite Navarra 50 to 40 in 43 innings; followed by a loss to Kilgore, 50 to 41, in 42 innings; and a loss to Harold Worst 50 to 42, in 52 innings; but then defeated Bozeman 50–48 in 60 innings in her last match. When the dust had settled, Katsura shared fifth place with Matsuyama, each having won and lost five matches. The winner of the world crown was Kilgore with an eight-win, two-loss record. Navarra and Bozeman tied for second.

After the 1953 championship wrapped up, Katsura and <a href="Kinrey%20Matsuyama">Matsuyama</a> gave an exhibition together in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a> ("advertisement at right"). The format was 100 points at balkline, followed by a race to 40 at three-cushion and then a trick shot exhibition. Katsura crushed her teacher, 100–11 and 100–3 at balkline, but Matsuyama won both the three-cushion matches, 40–34 and 40–39. This was Katsura and Matsuyama's last close interaction. After returning to Japan, Matsuyama suffered a heart attack and died on December 20, 1953. He had had plans to move to Honolulu with his family, become an American citizen, and purchase a billiard parlor. His eldest son, Hideo, 18, was attending a San Francisco high school at the time. He was said to have taught all of Japan's top players, among which Katsura was the star pupil.

Next, Katsura played a five-day, 600 point three-cushion exhibition series with Ray Kilgore in San Francisco, March 12–17, 1953. At the end Kilgore was the winner with a final score of 600 to 547. Kilgore said: "She played really remarkable billiards and I played a little over my head." The next week Katsura faced Kilgore again in another exhibition at Welker Cochran's room, beating him 50–33 in 45 innings.

The 1954 World Three-Cushion tournament was held in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a> with only 8 contestants: Katsura; <a href="Ray%20Miller%20%28billiards%20player%29">Ray Miller</a> of <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Jackson, Michigan</a>; Harold Worst; Argentinian brothers Juan and Ezequiel Navarra; Welker Cochran, who had come out of retirement; Chamaco; and defending champion, Kilgore. As usual, Katsura was the sole female contestant.

In her first round she was victorious over Miller, 60–47 in 76 innings, then beat Chamaco 60–55, but followed with a loss to Ezequiel Navarra 60–28 in 48 innings. Katsura then beat his brother, Juan Navarra, 60–52 in 77 innings in her last match to take fourth place overall. On the last day Harold Worst and Ezequiel Navarra ended in a tie with a playoff to be held initially to 60 points, later raised to a 350 point format, at which Worst ultimately prevailed on October 25, 1954.

Little was seen of Katsura for the next few years. She made 30 exhibition appearances in 1958 but had been in "virtual retirement" for about five years. During this break the second of Katsura's two billiards instruction books came out in Japan: 撞球上達法 (1956) ("Improve Your Billiards"). An earlier primer, 撞球入門 ("Introduction to Billiards"), was published in 1952. In 1959 it was announced that Katsura and Harold Worst would compete in a one week exhibition match to 1,200 points, beginning February 9 at Randolph Recreations in Chicago. Worst and Katsura moved their show to Philadelphia next where they played six matches at three-cushion billiards to 50 points, and thereafter went to exhibit in New York.

On March 1, 1959, Katsura appeared on <a href="CBS">CBS</a>' popular primetime television show, "<a href="What%27s%20My%20Line%3F">What's My Line?</a>" The show was in the format of a <a href="guessing%20game">guessing game</a>, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), or in the case of a famous "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using <a href="Japanese%20writing%20system">Japanese characters</a> on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist <a href="Arlene%20Francis">Arlene Francis</a> was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had never seen her picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC's</a> "<a href="You%20Asked%20For%20It">You Asked For It</a>", going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a <a href="covered%20wagon">covered wagon</a> rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on "You Asked For It" in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.

By 1961 and for a few years prior, there was no longer an organized world three-cushion championship. Accordingly, Harold Worst, the reigning champion since 1954, issued a challenge match to Katsura to defend his title, with the match to take place March 13–18 of that year at the <a href="Amway%20Grand%20Plaza%20Hotel">Pantlind Hotel</a> in Grand Rapids, Michigan, for a purse of $2,000. The preceding year Worst had issued a similar title-defending challenge to <a href="Joe%20Chamaco">Joe Chamaco</a> of Mexico, which also took place in Grand Rapids at the same venue. Worst even took unsuccessful legal action to block an Argentinian three-cushion tournament, billed as a "world title" event, that was scheduled to overlap the dates of his title match with Katsura. Worst defeated Katsura in six out of seven matches, with total three-cushions scored between them, respectively, of 350 and 276. Meanwhile, Chamaco claimed the world crown as well, after winning the tournament in Argentina.

Little was heard from Katsura for many years after the 1961 world championship. McGoorty lamented her retirement, stating various theories that he had heard bandied about in billiard circles, such as that her husband (who died in June 1967) kept her from playing for various reasons. In 1976 Katsura made an impromptu appearance at Palace Billiards in San Francisco. She borrowed a cue from someone present and proceeded to run 100 points at straight rail without problem. Prolific pool and billiard author Robert Byrne wrote that after Katsura finished that 100-point run, "without a miss she smiled and bowed to the applauding crowd, stepping away from the spotlight, and disappeared forever from the American billiard stage." Katsura returned to Japan in or about 1990 to live with her sister, Noriko, where she said she planned to live out her days. Katsura died in 1995. In September 2002 a memorial tournament for Katsura, billed as "Katsura Memorial: The First Ladies Three Cushion Grandprix", was held in Japan and aired on <a href="SKY%20PerfecTV%21">SKY PerfecTV!</a>

Thurisind

Thurisind (<a href="Latin">Latin</a>: "Turisindus", died <a href="circa">c.</a> 560) was king of the <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a>, an <a href="Germanic%20peoples">East Germanic</a> <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> people, from c. 548 to 560. He was the penultimate Gepid king, and succeeded King <a href="Elemund">Elemund</a> by staging a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> and forcing the king's son into exile. Thurisind's kingdom, known as <a href="Gepidia">Gepidia</a>, was located in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a> and had its centre in <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>, a former <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> city on the <a href="Sava">Sava River</a> (now the town of <a href="Sremska%20Mitrovica">Sremska Mitrovica</a>, Serbia).

His reign was marked by multiple wars with the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a>, a Germanic people who had arrived in the former <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> under the leadership of their king, <a href="Audoin">Audoin</a>. Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, which was resentful of the Gepid takeover of Sirmium and anxious to diminish Gepid power in the <a href="Pannonian%20Basin">Pannonian Basin</a>, a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states. The Byzantines' plans to reduce the Gepids' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552. The Byzantine Emperor <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a> forced a peace accord on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could be sustained.

Thurisind lost his eldest son, <a href="Turismod">Turismod</a>, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Asfeld">Battle of Asfeld</a>, during which the prince was killed by <a href="Alboin">Alboin</a>, son of Audoin. In about 560, Thurisind died and was succeeded by his remaining son <a href="Cunimund">Cunimund</a>, who was killed by Alboin in 567. Cunimund's death marked the end of the Gepid Kingdom and the beginning of the conquest of their territories by the Lombards' allies, the <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a>, a nomadic people migrating from the <a href="Eurasian%20Steppe">Eurasian Steppe</a>.

Of the four early <a href="medieval">medieval</a> sources relevant to Thurisind that survive, the only one providing independent evidence of the king, accounts of <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a>'s wars, and a detailed account of the relations between <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a> and <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> and their kings is "De Bellis" (550s), the most important work of <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a>. Considered the greatest historian of the 6th century, Procopius was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> writer born in <a href="Caesarea%20Maritima">Caesarea</a> in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> in 527. The Lombard–Gepid wars are well described in Procopius' work, as the conflict played an important part in the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> plans to <a href="Gothic%20War%20%28535%E2%80%93554%29">invade Italy</a> by a land route.

Less relevant is the other 6th-century source, <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>' "<a href="Romana%20%28Jordanes%29">Romana</a>". Of <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> ancestry, Jordanes served as a <a href="notarius">notarius</a> for a Byzantine <a href="magister%20militum">Master of the Soldiers</a> before entering into the ranks of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> <a href="clergy">clergy</a> and writing his two surviving books, the "Romana" and the "<a href="Getica">Getica</a>". The latter is a summary of Gothic history, while the lesser known "Romana" is an abridged account of Roman history written in 551 or 552. According to <a href="James%20J.%20O%27Donnell">James O'Donnell</a>, the two works share a pessimistic view of human life in which all secular accomplishments are insignificant compared to religious goals. Jordanes does not explicitly mention Thurisind in the "Romana", but speaks of the third Lombard–Gepid War, in which Thurisind participated, in the last passages of the work.

<a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a> was the most important Italian writer of the 8th century. Born in the 720s or 730s, he came from a noble Lombard family from <a href="Friuli">Friuli</a>. He entered the clergy early, and eventually became a <a href="monk">monk</a> of the <a href="monastery">monastery</a> of <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a>. His most famous work is the "<a href="Historia%20Langobardorum">Historia Langobardorum</a>", a history of the Lombard nation. Written after 787, it is a continuation of his previous major historical work, the "<a href="Historia%20Romana">Historia Romana</a>", which was based on the "Breviarium" of <a href="Eutropius%20%28historian%29">Eutropius</a>, with six books added describing historical events up to Justinian's empire. Both of these works mention Thurisind and the third Lombard–Gepid War, which represent the only overlap between the "Historia Langobardorum" and the "Historia Romana". Both books also mention the duel between the kings' sons, an event which is absent in Procopius' writing and is thought to have originated through <a href="oral%20tradition">oral tradition</a>. Similarly, the meeting between Thurisind and Audoin's son at the former's court derives from an oral source.

The Gepids were a major Germanic people in what is now eastern <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>, western <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, and northern <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. Although the details of his early life are not known, Thurisind is believed to have risen to power in about 548. After the death of Elemund, the previous king, he seized the throne in a coup d'état and forced Elemund's son Ostrogotha into exile. Ostrogotha and his followers found refuge among the Gepids' neighbours and enemies, the Lombards, another Germanic people who had just settled in the western part of the <a href="Pannonian%20Basin">Pannonian Basin</a>. The Gepids had inhabited parts of the basin since the 3rd century. They reached prominence in the 5th century when, under King <a href="Ardaric">Ardaric</a>, they played a key role in destroying the <a href="Hunnic%20Empire">Hunnic Empire</a>. Ardaric and his people benefited more than anybody else from this victory, gaining the former Roman province of <a href="Dacia">Dacia</a>.

In 504 the Gepids' power was significantly reduced by the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a>, who cut short their expansion into the Danubian plains. The Gepids restricted themselves to the eastern part of the Pannonian Basin; this was to form the core of Thurisind's dominions, just as it had under the previous Gepid kings. By the early 6th century, the Gepid nobility converted to <a href="Arianism">Arian</a> <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, while most of the Gepids remained <a href="Paganism">pagans</a>.

According to the scholar István Boná, Thurisind's rise to power is a typical example of the conflicts among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and made it difficult to maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made <a href="Turismod">Turismod</a>, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>, an important position that made Turismod the king's <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the first in <a href="Order%20of%20succession">line of succession</a>). After Turismod died, his younger brother <a href="Cunimund">Cunimund</a> became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.

On becoming king in 548, Thurisind immediately found himself in a difficult situation. Sometime during 546–548, the Byzantine Empire had conspired to convince the Lombards under Audoin to move into <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> (modern Hungary), a former Roman province bordering the Danube river. Justinian hoped this would keep open the land route from the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> to <a href="Italy">Italy</a> while containing the Gepids, who he considered a serious menace to Byzantine interests on the Balkan frontier. The <a href="Gothic%20War%20%28535%E2%80%93554%29">Gothic War</a> between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantines had been raging on the Italian peninsula since 535; Justinian wanted to be able to rush troops to Italy if they were needed.

According to the contemporary <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> in the "De Bello Gothico" (the section of the "De Bellis" regarding the Gothic War), Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, which may have been voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of <a href="Calluc">Calluc</a>, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the loss to the Gepids of <a href="Dacia%20ripensis">Dacia ripensis</a> (Serbia) and <a href="Singidunum">Singidunum</a> (<a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>). Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an enemy to set them against in the Lombards.

The build-up towards a war involving Lombards, Gepids, and Byzantines started possibly in 548 or 549, with Audoin and Thurisind each sending an embassy to Justinian's court at <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, in attempts to obtain military support from Justinian or at least, in the case of Thurisind, to get a pledge of neutrality. To sway Justinian, Thurisind's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium's enemies. However, the emperor sided with the Lombards; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids. From Justinian's perspective, this war was of major importance in the larger context of the Gothic War, because possession of Pannonia was strategically necessary to keep open land communications between Italy and the Balkans.

Historians debate as to when the conflict started. Proposed dates for the first war are either 547 or 549. At the same time as the two peoples took the field, a 10,000-strong <a href="Byzantine%20army">Byzantine horse army</a> under the command of <a href="John%20%28nephew%20of%20Vitalian%29">John</a>, the magister militum of <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Illyricum">Illyricum</a>, marched against the Gepids. Before John's arrival, Thurisind offered a truce to Audoin that was accepted. As a result, when the Byzantines arrived, the war had already ended, but not before they had clashed with the Gepids' <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a>an allies. To seal the truce, Audoin demanded that Thurisind should give up <a href="Ildigis">Ildigis</a>, a pretender to the Lombard crown who lived as a guest at his court. Thurisind refused, but he did force Ildigis to leave the Gepids and search for another refuge.

In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched against each other but, according to Procopius, both armies panicked and no battle took place. As a result, a new war was avoided and Thurisind accepted Audoin's request for a two-year truce. According to István Boná, the panic may be linked to a natural phenomenon: a <a href="lunar%20eclipse">lunar eclipse</a> took place on June 25/26, 549.

Confronted by an openly hostile Byzantine Empire, and faced with the eventuality that the war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce's expiration, Thurisind searched for new allies as a way to pressure Justinian. He found assistance from the <a href="Kutrigurs">Kutrigurs</a>, who he ferried across the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> into the Byzantine Illyricum in 550 or 551, before the truce expired and probably before the Gepids were ready to precipitate a new conflict. In retrospect, it may be they arrived too late instead of too early, if the agreement had been made with the Second Lombard–Gepid War in mind.

Faced with the Kutrigur invasion, Justinian <a href="Byzantine%20diplomacy">activated his alliance</a> against the invaders, mobilizing the neighbouring <a href="Utigurs">Utigurs</a>, who in turn asked for help from the allied <a href="Crimean%20Goths">Crimean Tetraxites</a>. The latter invaded the Kutrigur homeland, taking advantage of the fact that many warriors were employed at that moment in the Balkans. Informed of the attack, the Kutrigurs were forced to leave the Balkans to defend their homeland on the north-western shore of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>.

Thurisind protected and promoted another enemy of Byzantium, the <a href="Sclaveni">Sclaveni</a>. As with the Kutrigurs, Thurisind used his control of the Danube to ferry <a href="Early%20Slavs">Slavic</a> raiders to and from Byzantine territory, and obtained payment from them in the process.

Justinian's plans to send expeditionary forces against the Ostrogoths in Italy were repeatedly hampered by Thurisind's initiatives. For example, <a href="Narses">Narses</a>' army left Constantinople in April 551 for <a href="Salona">Salona</a>, with hopes of finally defeating the Goths, but found itself blocked at <a href="Plovdiv">Philippopolis</a> (Plovdiv) by the Kutrigurs.

This brought Justinian to search for an accord with Thurisind to stop the trans-Danubian raids, and the latter was more than happy to accept. Thurisind's envoys asked for an alliance like the one bonding Byzantines and Lombards. In addition to strengthening the alliance, they demanded, and got, 12 <a href="Byzantine%20Senate">senators</a> to swear to uphold the treaty. After this, in 551, 400 Gepids were sent to fight in Narses' army, which was sent to Italy—a modest army compared to the 5,500 Lombards sent by Audoin and the thousands of Heruli.

When the truce expired in 552, Thurisind and Audoin again took to the field, and this time the clash was unavoidable. Audoin had reached an agreement with Justinian by which the Byzantines promised to send him military support in exchange for the 5,500 Lombards sent to help the Byzantine general Narses in the Emperor's war in Italy.

The two-year truce was now close to expiry and the Lombards asked the Byzantines to respect the alliance which had been established between them. The Emperor found an excuse to break the new alliance with the Gepids by claiming they had again ferried Slav raiders. He put together an army with renowned commanders in its ranks such as <a href="Germanus%20%28cousin%20of%20Justinian%20I%29">Germanus</a>' sons <a href="Justin%20%28consul%20540%29">Justin</a> and <a href="Justinian%20%28general%29">Justinian</a>, <a href="Aratius">Aratius</a>, the Herulian <a href="Suartuas">Suartuas</a>, and <a href="Amalafrid">Amalafrid</a>, brother-in-law of Audoin. A revolt that erupted in <a href="Ulpiana">Ulpiana</a> diverted the bulk of the army; only a force under Amalafrid reached the battlefield.

Scholars debate when the third Lombard–Gepid War started; it is agreed that it took place two years after the second war. The possible dates are either 551 or 552. The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' Italian campaign, the third Lombard–Gepid War must have already ended by then; against this scholars such as <a href="Walter%20Pohl">Walter Pohl</a> protest that this is in contradiction with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids, despite his massive support to Narses.

When the treaty expired, Audoin attacked the Gepids and Thurisind was crushed in the <a href="battle%20of%20Asfeld">decisive battle of the Asfeld</a> held west of Sirmium. The battle was mentioned by Jordanes in the "Romana" as one of the most bloody ever fought in the region, with no fewer than 60,000 warriors killed. The king's son Turismod also died, killed by Audoin's son <a href="Alboin">Alboin</a> in a duel that according to Paul the Deacon decided both the battle and the war. After the battle, the Gepids were never again able to play a formative role in the shaping of events.

The Gepids' defeat caused a geopolitical shift in the Pannonian Basin, as it ended the danger represented by the Gepids to the Empire. The Gepids' utter defeat could have meant the end of their kingdom and its conquest by the Lombards, but Justinian, wanting to maintain an equilibrium in the region, imposed an "eternal peace" that saved the Gepids; it was observed for ten years, surviving both Thurisind and Audoin. It may be on this occasion, and not before the war, that Lombards and Gepids sent troops to Narses as part of the peace treaty imposed by the Byzantines. In this interpretation, the small number of Gepid warriors sent could be explained with the heavy losses taken in the war and the resentment felt towards Justinian. The Emperor also imposed some territorial concessions on Thurisind, obligating him to return Dacia ripensis and the territory of Singidunum.

To reach a complete peace Thurisind had first to deal with Ildigis who had found hospitality at Thurisind's court. Audoin demanded yet again to have him turned in, and Justinian joined in the request. Thurisind, despite his reluctance to resume the war with both Audoin and Justinian, did not want to openly breach the rules of hospitality and thus tried to evade the request by demanding in his turn to have Ostrogotha given to him; in the end, to avoid both openly giving in and at the same time renewing the war, both kings murdered their respective guests but kept secret their involvement in the act.

Thurisind features prominently in a tale told by Paul the Deacon set in 552, just after the death of the king's son Turismod and the end of the war. The story, generally thought to track its origins to an heroic poem dedicated to Alboin, revolves around the characters of Alboin and Thurisind: in accordance with a custom of the Lombards, to obtain the right to sit at his father's table, Alboin must ask for hospitality from a foreign king and have the latter arm him. To submit himself to this initiation, Alboin went with 40 companions to Thurisind's court.

Thurisind, in observance of the laws of hospitality, received Alboin and his companions and organized a banquet in their honour, offering Alboin the place where his dead son habitually sat. Following a mockery by Turismod's brother Cunimund and Alboin's rejoinder, a clash was avoided by Thurisind's intervention, who restored the peace and sent Alboin away with Turismod's arms. According to István Boná, who believes in the veracity of the story, the event may have taken place as described by Paul, but it also could reflect a secret peace condition imposed by Audoin on Thurisind under which the Gepid king had to arm his son's killer.

Thurisind died around 560 and was succeeded by his son <a href="Cunimund">Cunimund</a>, last king of the Gepids; under him Thurisind's people were annihilated in 567 by a joint coalition of the Lombards and the <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a>, a Turkic nomad people that in 558 had migrated to Central Europe. Cunimund was killed on the battlefield by the new Lombard King Alboin, and his daughter <a href="Rosamund%20%28Gepid%29">Rosamund</a> was taken captive.

1867 Manhattan, Kansas earthquake

The 1867 Manhattan earthquake struck <a href="Riley%20County%2C%20Kansas">Riley County, Kansas</a>, in the United States on April 24, 1867 at 20:22 UTC, or about . The strongest earthquake to originate in the state, it measured 5.1 on a <a href="Seismic%20magnitude%20scales">seismic scale</a> that is based on an <a href="isoseismal%20map">isoseismal map</a> or the event's felt area. The earthquake's <a href="epicenter">epicenter</a> was near the <a href="Manhattan%2C%20Kansas">town of Manhattan</a>.

The earthquake had a maximum perceived intensity of VII ("Very strong") on the <a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">Mercalli intensity scale</a>. It caused minor damage, reports of which were confined to Kansas, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>, and <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, according to the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a>. Felt over an area of , the earthquake reached the states of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, and possibly <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, though the latter reports have been questioned.

Manhattan is near the <a href="Nemaha%20Ridge">Nemaha Ridge</a>, a long <a href="anticline">anticline</a> structure that is bounded by several faults. The nearby in particular poses a threat to the city. Kansas is not known for earthquake activity, but an earthquake could occur at any time. A 2016 hazard map from the United States Geological Survey estimated a 1% or lower risk for a major earthquake in Kansas for the following year, though scientists from the agency think an <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> of magnitude 7.0 remains possible.

The earthquake's epicenter was near <a href="Manhattan%2C%20Kansas">Manhattan</a>, Kansas, a town just off the confluence of the <a href="Kansas%20River">Kansas River</a> and the . Manhattan lies near the Nemaha Ridge, an <a href="anticline">anticline</a> and 300‑million-year-old <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> granite range bounded by faults, which likely produced the earthquake. It hosts the , which, in addition to serving as the range's easternmost boundary, has produced a large portion of the state's earthquakes. A <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29%23Dip-slip%20faults">normal</a>, or dip-slip fault, it is responsible for at least several small tremors smaller than magnitude 2.7 each year. The fault cuts through <a href="Permian">Permian</a> rock. Despite being previously thought to be a simple, Precambrian structure, according to the <a href="Geological%20Society%20of%20America">Geological Society of America</a>, it may be a complex fault.

The Nemaha Range lies roughly east of the <a href="Midcontinent%20Rift%20System">Midcontinent rift</a>, which forms a layer of basaltic rock about 1.1 billion years old. This rift extends northward to Lake Superior and the surrounding area and southward to Kansas, then terminates abruptly. Also present in the state is the Central Kansas Uplift, the faults of which produced several small earthquakes during the late 1980s. According to <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> geophysicist Don Steeples, earthquakes at the Humboldt Zone have decreased, and activity at the Uplift was increasing as of the 1980s.

Felt over an area of , with other sources listing the felt area as or , the 1867 earthquake followed the Midcontinent seismic trend: unlike coastal earthquakes in the United States, events in the central and east-central sectors of the country are spread out over extensive areas. This occurs as a result of the region's stiff soil, and because earthquakes in Kansas tend to occur at a shallow depth. The 1867 Manhattan earthquake remains the largest earthquake to originate in the state, though at least 25 have taken place since, including another powerful earthquake north of Manhattan in <a href="Pottawatomie%20County%2C%20Kansas">Pottawatomie County</a>. In 2016, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake with an epicenter in Oklahoma shook the Manhattan area. According to a report in the "<a href="Bulletin%20of%20the%20Seismological%20Society%20of%20America">Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America</a>", the frequency of moderately strong earthquakes within the state is between 40 and 45 years. One study found that between December 1977 and June 1989, more than 100 earthquakes were recognized by a seismograph network. All were between 4.0 and 0.8 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter magnitude scale</a>.

Originating at 20:22 UTC, or around 2:30 local time, the earthquake was assigned a maximum <a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">Mercalli intensity scale</a> of VII, considered "very strong". Minor damage occurred throughout the geographical region, including 22 <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Kansas">counties in Kansas</a>, and injuries were reported as well. The earthquake fractured walls, downed chimneys, and otherwise damaged structures, even loosening stones. Within the epicentral area near Manhattan, clocks stopped, people felt <a href="Electrical%20injury">electrical shocks</a> and inhabitants were frightened. The following day, an <a href="aftershock">aftershock</a> occurred between 3 and 4 a.m. Damage within Manhattan and a number of other communities may have been exacerbated by their location within <a href="Alluvial%20fan">alluvial valleys</a>.

At a farm south of the city of <a href="Wamego%2C%20Kansas">Wamego</a>, the earthquake caused <a href="Soil%20liquefaction">liquefaction</a> of the ground. To the north of Wamego, in the city of <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kansas">Louisville</a>, the earthquake knocked over horses. In both Louisville and the city of <a href="Leavenworth%2C%20Kansas">Leavenworth</a>, chimneys fell; in <a href="Paola%2C%20Kansas">Paola</a>, the earthquake destroyed one wall of a large <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> newspaper office building. Waves were observed on the Kansas River, reaching in height. The city of <a href="Atchison%2C%20Kansas">Atchison</a> felt two shocks, which felled lamps and bottles at a drug store, rocked buildings, and disrupted water flow in rivers and <a href="stream">creeks</a>. Though no buildings in the city sustained damage, people fled into the streets.

In <a href="Emporia%2C%20Kansas">Emporia</a>, the earthquake was accompanied by a low rumbling sound, windows rattled, and small boxes were thrown off of shelves as people fled buildings. The city's brick and stone houses sustained more damage than framed homes. The city of <a href="Fort%20Scott%2C%20Kansas">Fort Scott</a> only experienced trembling, whereas <a href="Iola%2C%20Kansas">Iola</a> had houses and tableware shake. In <a href="Holton%2C%20Kansas">Holton</a>, items were knocked off shelves, and buildings shook. Residents of <a href="Irving%2C%20Kansas">Irving</a> also heard rumbling prior to the earthquake, experiencing severe tremors that lasted 30 seconds, while buildings in <a href="Junction%20City%2C%20Kansas">Junction City</a> shook violently, moving several inches. In <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Kansas">Kansas City</a>, tables moved, walls cracked, water spilled from glasses, plaster cracked, and the shaking caused general panic.

The city of <a href="Lawrence%2C%20Kansas">Lawrence</a> felt three earthquakes within 30 seconds, with violent shaking of doors and windows, broken plaster, a rumbling noise, stones knocked off a local church, rattling of silverware and glassware, and the overturning of a stove in one home. Similarly, in the city of Leavenworth, three shocks were felt over 30 seconds. In Leavenworth, a man was knocked off a hayload, a rumbling noise was heard, and clocks stopped. Moreover, saws leaning against walls were moved , plaster at one home cracked for the entire length of the house's ceiling, and one woman experienced an electrical shock from spring water. In the city of <a href="Lecompton%2C%20Kansas">Lecompton</a>, one of the buildings at <a href="Lane%20University">Lane University</a> shook, and a <a href="High%20school%20%28North%20America%29">high school</a> in the city of <a href="Marysville%2C%20Kansas">Marysville</a> also shook violently.

Within <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Kansas">Montgomery County</a>, people in moving vehicles did not feel the earthquake.

In Paola, people standing were nearly knocked over during the earthquake. A train on the <a href="Pacific%20Railroad">Pacific Railroad</a> in <a href="Solomon%2C%20Kansas">Solomon</a> shook violently, and was stopped and evacuated out of fear that its boiler would explode. In <a href="Topeka%2C%20Kansas">Topeka</a>, the <a href="capital%20city">capital city</a> of Kansas, the ceiling of a <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> church was bent, and nearly all of the windows in one schoolhouse were destroyed. Two shocks were felt in the city of <a href="White%20Cloud%2C%20Kansas">White Cloud</a>, and sleeping people were awakened in .

Reports from the states of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> and <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, including descriptions of fallen plaster in <a href="Dubuque%2C%20Iowa">Dubuque</a>, shaking of buildings and people in <a href="rocking%20chair">rocking chair</a>s in <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines</a>, and fallen and cracked plaster in <a href="Chillicothe%2C%20Missouri">Chillicothe</a>, compliment additional reports of fallen plaster and <a href="roof%20shingle">roof shingle</a>s, damaged wells, and cracked walls. Other events reported in Dubuque included three shocks, which caused vibration of <a href="gas%20burner">gas burner</a>s; general panic among residents; rattling of windows; shaking of chairs, cases holding newspapers, and windows; and holes in brick walls. In the city of <a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Missouri">St. Joseph</a> in Missouri, the windows broke, women fainted, and a rumbling noise could be heard. Within the city, a new school building's brick walls cracked several feet above the ground as people fled into the streets. In <a href="Warrensburg%2C%20Missouri">Warrensburg, Missouri</a>, the walls of a church shook, but there was no damage. The earthquake also extended into the states of <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, according to the , and a questionable report came from Carthage in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> that a segment of the ground, in area, sunk by , forming a perpendicular wall deep on each of its sides.

A series of articles published by the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" describes the extent of the damage throughout the state of Kansas. The article "At Kansas City" details that the earthquake jolted homes with a sudden burst, giving off a resonating roar like thunder. The "Tribune" observed in its article "At Leavenworth, Kansas" that the earthquake was completely unexpected, describing the event as "[...] sudden in its coming and departure." It confirmed that earthquakes were not common in earlier times and stated that "all were more or less startled, and, indeed, frightened."

Although Kansas is not seismically active, a strong earthquake could pose significant threats to the state. If an earthquake were to occur, it would likely be along the Nemaha Ridge, which is still active. The Humboldt Fault Zone, just off the Ridge, lies just east of the near Manhattan. An earthquake there would likely destroy the dam, releasing of water per second and flooding the nearby area, which would threaten roughly 13,000 people and 5,900 homes. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> concluded that a moderate earthquake "between 5.7 and 6.6 would cause sand underneath the dam to liquefy into quicksand, causing the dam to spread out and the top to drop up to three feet." A large earthquake would spawn gaps, forcing water to leak and eventually cause the dam to collapse. Earthquakes that could pose a threat to the dam occur on a cycle of roughly 1,800 years. To counter this threat, the Corps of Engineers has galvanized an effort to strengthen the dam. Replacing the sand (which could shift during an earthquake) with more than 350 walls, the group has equipped the dam with sensors, which are connected to alarms that would alert nearby citizens to the earthquake.

More than 500 earthquakes have been measured in the state since 2013, contributing to the reactivation of ancient fault lines. In 2016, the United States Geological Survey made hazard maps for the state, determining a 1% or lower risk of a major earthquake within the next year. Because <a href="Sedgwick%20County%2C%20Kansas">Sedgwick</a> and <a href="Wichita%20County%2C%20Kansas">Wichita</a> counties could both potentially experience shaking from earthquakes that could not be withstood according to existing building codes, officials in the area proposed changing building codes to meet perceived hazards. Scientists at the United States Geological Survey think an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 remains possible, possibly originating from the Nemaha Ridge where the Manhattan quake was produced.
