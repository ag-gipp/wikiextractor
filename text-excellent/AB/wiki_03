Pigeon photography

Pigeon photography is an <a href="aerial%20photography">aerial photography</a> technique invented in 1907 by the German <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a> <a href="Julius%20Neubronner">Julius Neubronner</a>, who also used <a href="pigeon%20post">pigeons</a> to deliver medications. A <a href="homing%20pigeon">homing pigeon</a> was fitted with an aluminium breast <a href="Parrot%20harness">harness</a> to which a lightweight time-delayed <a href="Subminiature%20photography">miniature camera</a> could be attached. Neubronner's German patent application was initially rejected, but was granted in December 1908 after he produced authenticated photographs taken by his pigeons. He publicized the technique at the 1909 Dresden International Photographic Exhibition, and sold some images as postcards at the Frankfurt International Aviation Exhibition and at the 1910 and 1911 <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a>s.

Initially, the military potential of pigeon photography for <a href="aerial%20reconnaissance">aerial reconnaissance</a> appeared attractive. Battlefield tests in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> provided encouraging results, but the ancillary technology of mobile <a href="dovecote">dovecote</a>s for messenger pigeons had the greatest impact. Owing to the rapid perfection of aviation during the war, military interest in pigeon photography faded and Neubronner abandoned his experiments. The idea was briefly resurrected in the 1930s by a Swiss <a href="clockmaker">clockmaker</a>, and reportedly also by the German and French militaries. Although <a href="war%20pigeon">war pigeon</a>s were deployed extensively during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it is unclear to what extent, if any, birds were involved in aerial reconnaissance. The United States <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) later developed a battery-powered camera designed for espionage pigeon photography; details of its use remain <a href="Classified%20information">classified</a>.

The construction of sufficiently small and light cameras with a timer mechanism, and the training and handling of the birds to carry the necessary loads, presented major challenges, as did the limited control over the pigeons' position, orientation and speed when the photographs were being taken. In 2004, the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) used miniature television cameras attached to <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s and <a href="Northern%20Goshawk">goshawk</a>s to obtain live footage, and today some researchers, enthusiasts and artists similarly deploy <a href="crittercam">crittercam</a>s with various species of animals.

The first <a href="aerial%20photography">aerial photographs</a> were taken in 1858 by the balloonist <a href="Nadar%20%28photographer%29">Nadar</a>; in 1860 <a href="James%20Wallace%20Black">James Wallace Black</a> took the oldest surviving aerial photographs, also from a balloon. As photographic techniques made further progress, at the end of the 19th century some pioneers placed cameras in unmanned flying objects. In the 1880s, <a href="Arthur%20Batut">Arthur Batut</a> experimented with <a href="kite%20aerial%20photography">kite aerial photography</a>. Many others followed him, and high-quality photographs of <a href="Boston">Boston</a> taken with this method by <a href="William%20Abner%20Eddy">William Abner Eddy</a> in 1896 became famous. Amedee Denisse equipped a rocket with a camera and a parachute in 1888, and <a href="Alfred%20Nobel">Alfred Nobel</a> also used rocket photography in 1897.

<a href="Homing%20pigeon">Homing pigeon</a>s were used extensively in the 19th and early 20th centuries, both for civil <a href="pigeon%20post">pigeon post</a> and as <a href="war%20pigeon">war pigeon</a>s. In the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> of 1870, the famous <a href="Pigeon%20post%23Pigeon%20post%20of%20Paris">pigeon post of Paris</a> carried up to 50,000 <a href="microform">microfilmed</a> telegrams per pigeon flight from <a href="Tours">Tours</a> into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Imperial Russia</a>n Technical Society at <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, the chief of the Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed <a href="collodion">collodion</a> film negatives to the ground by pigeon post.

In 1903 <a href="Julius%20Neubronner">Julius Neubronner</a>, an <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a> in the German town of <a href="Kronberg%20im%20Taunus">Kronberg</a> near <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, resumed a practice begun by his father half a century earlier and received prescriptions from a sanatorium in nearby <a href="K%C3%B6nigstein%20im%20Taunus">Falkenstein</a> via pigeon post. (The pigeon post was discontinued after three years when the sanatorium was closed.) He delivered urgent medications up to by the same method, and positioned some of his pigeons with his wholesaler in Frankfurt to profit from faster deliveries himself. When one of his pigeons lost its orientation in fog and mysteriously arrived, well-fed, four weeks late, Neubronner was inspired with the playful idea of equipping his pigeons with automatic cameras to trace their paths. This thought led him to merge his two hobbies into a new "double sport" combining <a href="carrier%20pigeon">carrier pigeon</a> fancying with amateur photography. (Neubronner later learned that his pigeon had been in the custody of a restaurant chef in <a href="Wiesbaden">Wiesbaden</a>.)

After successfully testing a <a href="subminiature%20photography">Ticka watch camera</a> on a train and whilst riding a sled, Neubronner began the development of a light miniature camera that could be fitted to a pigeon's breast by means of a harness and an aluminum <a href="cuirass">cuirass</a>. Using wooden camera models which weighed , the pigeons were carefully trained for their load. To take an aerial photograph, Neubronner carried a pigeon to a location up to about from its home, where it was equipped with a camera and released. The bird, keen to be relieved of its burden, would typically fly home on a direct route, at a height of . A pneumatic system in the camera controlled the time delay before a photograph was taken. To accommodate the burdened pigeon, the <a href="dovecote">dovecote</a> had a spacious, elastic landing board and a large entry hole.

According to Neubronner, there were a dozen different models of his camera. In 1907 he had sufficient success to apply for a patent. Initially his invention "Method of and Means for Taking Photographs of Landscapes from Above" was rejected by the German patent office as impossible, but after presentation of authenticated photographs the patent was granted in December 1908. (The rejection was based on a misconception about the carrying capacity of <a href="Domestic%20Pigeon">domestic pigeons</a>.) The technology became widely known through Neubronner's participation in the 1909 International Photographic Exhibition in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> and the 1909 International Aviation Exhibition in Frankfurt. Spectators in Dresden could watch the arrival of the pigeons, and the aerial photographs they brought back were turned into postcards. Neubronner's photographs won prizes in Dresden as well as at the 1910 and 1911 <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a>s.

A photograph of <a href="Schlosshotel%20Kronberg">Schlosshotel Kronberg</a> (then called "Schloss Friedrichshof" after its owner <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Kaiserin Friedrich</a>) became famous due to its accidental inclusion of the photographer's wing tips. In a breach of copyright it was shown in German cinemas as part of the weekly <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a> in 1929.

In a short book published in 1909 Neubronner described five camera models:
In a 1920 pamphlet, Neubronner described his last model as weighing slightly more than and being capable of taking 12 exposures.
In 2007, a researcher remarked that only little technical information is available about lenses, shutters and the speed of the photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from <a href="ADOX">ADOX</a>. For this camera he estimated a <a href="film%20speed">film speed</a> of ISO 25/15° – 40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60 s – 1/100 s. The film was cut to the format 30 mm × 60 mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.

In 1920 Neubronner found that ten years of hard work and considerable expenses had been rewarded only with his inclusion in encyclopedias and the satisfaction that an ancillary technology, the mobile dovecote (described below), had proved its worth in the war. Neubronner's panoramic camera is displayed at the <a href="German%20Museum%20of%20Technology">German Museum of Technology</a> in Berlin and the <a href="Deutsches%20Museum">Deutsches Museum</a> in Munich.

Neubronner's invention was at least partially motivated by the prospect of military applications. At the time photographic aerial reconnaissance was possible but cumbersome, as it involved <a href="Balloon%20%28aircraft%29">balloons</a>, <a href="kite">kite</a>s or <a href="rocket">rocket</a>s. The <a href="Wright%20brothers">Wright brothers</a>' successful flight in 1903 presented new possibilities, and <a href="surveillance%20aircraft">surveillance aircraft</a> were introduced and perfected during the First World War. But pigeon-based photography, despite its practical difficulties, promised to deliver complementary, detailed photographs taken from a lower height.

The <a href="Prussian%20Minister%20of%20War">Prussian War Ministry</a> was interested, but some initial skepticism could only be overcome through a series of successful demonstrations. The pigeons proved relatively indifferent to explosions, but during battle a dovecote may need to be moved, and pigeons can take some time to orient to their new position. The problem of making carrier pigeons accept a displaced dovecote with only a minimum of retraining had been tackled with some success by the Italian army around 1880; the French artillery captain Reynaud solved it by raising the pigeons in an itinerant dovecote. There is no indication that Neubronner was aware of this work, but he knew there must be a solution as he had heard of an itinerant fairground worker who was also a <a href="pigeon%20keeping">pigeon fancier</a> with a dovecote in his <a href="travel%20trailer">trailer</a>. At the 1909 exhibitions in Dresden and Frankfurt he presented a small carriage that combined a <a href="darkroom">darkroom</a> with a mobile dovecote in flashy colors. In months of laborious work he trained young pigeons to return to the dovecote even after it was displaced.

In 1912 Neubronner completed his task (set in 1909) of photographing the waterworks at <a href="Tegel">Tegel</a> using only his mobile dovecote. Almost 10 years of negotiations were scheduled to end in August 1914 with a practical test at a maneuver in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, followed by the state's acquisition of the invention. These plans were thwarted by the outbreak of the war. Neubronner had to provide all his pigeons and equipment to the military, which tested them in the battlefield with satisfactory results, but did not employ the technique more widely.

Instead, under the novel conditions of <a href="attrition%20warfare">attrition warfare</a>, <a href="War%20pigeon%23World%20War%20I">war pigeons</a> in their traditional role as <a href="pigeon%20post">pigeon post</a> saw a renaissance. Neubronner's mobile dovecote found its way to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Battle of Verdun</a>, where it proved so advantageous that similar facilities were used on a larger scale in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>. After the war, the War Ministry responded to Neubronner's inquiry to the effect that the use of pigeons in aerial photography had no military value and further experiments were not justified.

The <a href="International%20Spy%20Museum">International Spy Museum</a> in <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> has a small room dedicated to carrier pigeons and pigeon photography in the First World War.

Despite the War Ministry's position immediately after the First World War, in 1932 it was reported that the German army was training pigeons for photography, and that the German pigeon cameras were capable of 200 exposures per flight. In the same year, the French claimed that they had developed film cameras for pigeons as well as a method for having the birds released behind enemy lines by <a href="dogs%20in%20warfare">trained dogs</a>.

Although <a href="war%20pigeon">war pigeon</a>s and mobile dovecotes were used extensively during the Second World War, it is unclear to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According to a report in 1942, the <a href="Red%20army">Soviet army</a> discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs trained to carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American <a href="Signal%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Signal Corps</a> was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.

It is certain, however, that during the Second World War pigeon photography was introduced into German nurseries in toy form. From around 1935 the toy figures produced under the brand "Elastolin", some of which show motifs from before 1918 with updated uniforms, began to include a signal corps soldier with a pigeon transport dog. The figurine represents a soldier in the act of releasing a pigeon that carries an oversized pigeon camera.

Thanks to research conducted by the "Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique" at <a href="Vevey">Vevey</a>, much more is known about the pigeon cameras developed at about the same time by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in <a href="Schmiedrued">Walde</a>. He was assigned to the <a href="Military%20of%20Switzerland">Swiss Army</a>'s carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to <a href="16%20mm%20film">16 mm film</a>, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by <a href="clockwork">clockwork</a>.

Michel's plan to sell his camera to the Swiss Army failed, as he was unable to find a manufacturer to produce it in quantity; only about 100 of his cameras were constructed. After the outbreak of the Second World War Michel patented a shell and harness for the transport of items such as film rolls by carrier pigeon. Between 2002 and 2007 three of his cameras were auctioned by <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> in London.

The "Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique" at <a href="Vevey">Vevey</a> holds around 1,000 photographs taken for test purposes during the development of Michel's camera. Most of the photos were taken with 16 mm <a href="orthopanchromatic%20film">orthopanchromatic</a> <a href="Agfa-Gevaert">Agfa</a> film with a speed of ISO 8/10°. The exposed format was 10 mm × 34 mm. The quality was sufficient for a tenfold magnification. In the catalog of the 2007 exhibition "Des pigeons photographes?" they are classified as test photos on the ground or from a window, human perspectives from the ground or from elevated points, aeroplane-based aerial photographs, aerial photographs of relatively high altitude that were probably taken by pigeons released from a plane, and only a small number of typical pigeon photographs.

The United States <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) developed a battery-powered pigeon camera now on display in the <a href="CIA%20Museum">CIA Museum</a>'s virtual tour. According to the website, the details of the camera's use are still classified. News reports suggest that the camera was used in the 1970s, that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it was a failure.
In 1978 the Swiss magazine "<a href="L%27Illustr%C3%A9">L'Illustré</a>" printed an aerial photograph of a street in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, taken by a pigeon of Febo de Vries-Baumann equipped with a camera with a hydraulic mechanism.
In 2002–2003 the performance artist and pigeon fancier Amos Latteier experimented with pigeon photography using <a href="Advanced%20Photo%20System">Advanced Photo System</a> (APS) and digital cameras and turned the results into "PowerPointillist" lecture performances in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>.
In a 2008 film adaptation of <a href="Sleeping%20Beauty">Sleeping Beauty</a> by the German director <a href="Arend%20Agthe">Arend Agthe</a>, the prince invents pigeon photography and discovers Sleeping Beauty on a photo taken by a pigeon.

In the 1980s a small number of high-quality replica Doppel-Sport cameras were made by Rolf Oberländer. One was acquired in 1999 by the Swiss Camera Museum in Vevey. 

Modern technology allows extension of the principle to video cameras. In the 2004 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> program "Animal Camera", <a href="Steve%20Leonard">Steve Leonard</a> presented spectacular films taken by miniature television cameras attached to <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s and <a href="Northern%20Goshawk">goshawks</a>, transmitted to a nearby receiver by <a href="microwave">microwave</a>s. The cameras have a weight of . Miniature <a href="digital%20audio%20player">digital audio player</a>s with built-in video cameras can also be attached to pigeons. In 2009 researchers made news when a peer-reviewed article discussed the insights they gained by attaching cameras to <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es. The lipstick-sized cameras took a photo every 30 seconds. Cameras have also been attached to other animals, such as cats and dogs.

Melanie Barnett

Melanie Barnett-Davis is a fictional character, portrayed by actress <a href="Tia%20Mowry">Tia Mowry</a>, who appears in the American sitcom <a href="The%20Game%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"The Game"</a>, which aired on <a href="the%20CW%20Television%20Network">the CW Television Network</a> and <a href="BET">BET</a> from 2006 to 2015. Introduced in a <a href="backdoor%20pilot">backdoor pilot</a> on the sitcom <a href="Girlfriends%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"Girlfriends"</a> as the cousin of <a href="Joan%20Clayton">Joan Clayton</a> (<a href="Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross">Tracee Ellis Ross</a>), Melanie chooses to support her boyfriend <a href="Derwin%20Davis">Derwin Davis</a>' (<a href="Pooch%20Hall">Pooch Hall</a>) career with the San Diego Sabres, a fictional <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) team, rather than attend <a href="Medical%20school%20in%20the%20United%20States">medical school</a> at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>. The series focuses primarily on Melanie and Derwin's complicated relationship, with her fears of his <a href="infidelity">infidelity</a> at the center of many of the episodes' storylines. Mowry left the series in 2012 upon learning that her role would be reduced as a result of co-star Pooch Hall's decision to leave "The Game" to appear in the <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> series "<a href="Ray%20Donovan">Ray Donovan</a>". Both actors reprised their roles in the series' finale, in which Melanie gives birth to twins.

Melanie was created by producer <a href="Mara%20Brock%20Akil">Mara Brock Akil</a>. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry would be the best choice, given her wholesome image from starring as <a href="Tia%20Landry">Tia Landry</a> on the sitcom <a href="Sister%2C%20Sister%20%28TV%20series%29">"Sister, Sister"</a>, but hired the actress based on her strong work ethic and her desire to be part of the series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor <a href="Cory%20Hardrict">Cory Hardrict</a>. She cited "The Game" as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.

Reaction to Melanie was primarily negative; <a href="Television%20criticism">critics</a> expressed disapproval of her decision to support her boyfriend instead of enrolling in medical school. Media commentators also panned the character's representation as a mother, such as her inability to properly care for her stepson. On the other hand, fans responded positively to Melanie and felt drawn to her relationship with Derwin. Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics, who agreed that the role displayed her maturity as an actress. She received nominations for two <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Awards">NAACP Image Awards</a> and a <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Awards">Teen Choice Award</a> for the role.

<a href="The%20Game%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"The Game"</a>, which aired on <a href="The%20CW%20Television%20Network">The CW Television Network</a> and <a href="BET">BET</a>, explores the lives of a group of women romantically involved with <a href="American%20football">professional football</a> players. Introduced as the cousin of <a href="Joan%20Clayton">Joan Clayton</a> (<a href="Tracee%20Ellis%20Ross">Tracee Ellis Ross</a>) in a <a href="backdoor%20pilot">backdoor pilot</a> on <a href="Girlfriends%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">"Girlfriends"</a>, Melanie Barnett aspires to be a doctor and is admitted to the medical school at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>. Against Joan's objections, Melanie decides against attending Johns Hopkins in favor of moving to <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> to support her boyfriend <a href="Derwin%20Davis">Derwin Davis</a>' career with the San Diego Sabers, a fictional <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) team. Melanie enrolls at a local college and becomes a close friend of <a href="Latasha%20%26quot%3BTasha%26quot%3B%20Mack">Tasha Mack</a>, a divorced mother and manager of <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Malik%20Wright">Malik Wright</a>, and <a href="Kelly%20Pitts">Kelly Pitts</a>, the <a href="trophy%20wife">trophy wife</a> of the team's captain, <a href="Jason%20Pitts">Jason Pitts</a>. She struggles to be accepted by the wives and girlfriends of the San Diego Sabers, who have formed a group dubbed "The Saber Sunbeams". Storylines frequently address her fears that Derwin will cheat on her. She turns to Tasha and Kelly for help in handling the stress of being in a relationship with a professional football player; Tasha and Kelly's advice includes the idea of using an <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a> to check for fluids on hotel bed sheets. At the end of the show's third season, Derwin proposes marriage to Melanie on live television, during the halftime of a Sabres game. Even though she has concerns, she accepts.

The couple end their engagement after Melanie discovers that Derwin had sex with a singer. She considers returning to medical school rather than continue "life as a football girlfriend". Following their break-up, Melanie has sex with several men, and Derwin impregnates another woman. Melanie struggles to balance her career with her personal life. Even though Melanie and Derwin have relationships with other people, they still have feelings for each other. Melanie eventually reconciles with Derwin, and the couple marry. She has a strained relationship with her stepson, as she views him as a reminder of Derwin's past infidelity. As a result, Derwin considers her to be an unfit parent and allows her only limited contact with the child. During this time, Melanie reveals to Derwin that she had an abortion, suffering from complications that greatly reduced her chances of conceiving children naturally. She made the decision as she felt that having a child by another man would permanently ruin her relationship with Derwin. At the end of the show's fifth season, Melanie and Derwin move to Baltimore after he is traded to play for a team based in the city, and she finally enrolls at Johns Hopkins University. In her return to "The Game" in the series' finale, Melanie nears the end of a <a href="high-risk%20pregnancy">high-risk pregnancy</a> and gives birth to twins.

Producers <a href="Mara%20Brock%20Akil">Mara Brock Akil</a> and <a href="Kelsey%20Grammer">Kelsey Grammer</a> developed "The Game" as a <a href="Spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> of the sitcom "Girlfriends". Brock Akil originally conceived the show and the characters of Melanie and Derwin to give viewers access to the world of professional football, a sport that she and her husband appreciate. From the series' inception, she intended to include <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a>s relating to race and celebrity. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>"' Virginia Heffernan wrote that one of the show's objectives was "to relieve ideological tensions instead of creating or ignoring them", citing its multi-ethnic female cast of characters as one of the means of achieving this goal. Melanie, and the rest of main cast of "The Game", were first introduced in the "Girlfriends" episode "The Game". She later made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> alongside Derwin in "Girlfriends" Season7 finale "It's Been Determined" as guests at Joan's engagement party.

<a href="Cynthia%20Addai-Robinson">Cynthia Addai-Robinson</a> was originally cast to play Melanie, but was replaced by <a href="Tia%20Mowry">Tia Mowry</a> prior to development of the backdoor pilot. The CW Television Network did not provide a reason for the casting change. Critics frequently billed Mowry as "The Game" <a href="Leading%20actor">lead actress</a>, and Brock Akil referred to Melanie and Derwin as "the heart" of the series.

Mowry's twin sister <a href="Tamera%20Mowry">Tamera Mowry</a> accompanied her to her audition. Tamera had tried out for the role previously; she said that it was common for them to read for the same part, but emphasized that "[they're] very different actors". When she saw the two women together, Brock Akil initially debated whether they would be appropriate for the show's tone. She was concerned about the sisters' wholesome image gained from their years as child actors on the sitcom <a href="Sister%2C%20Sister%20%28TV%20series%29">"Sister, Sister"</a>, explaining, "I had a certain image of them. I didn't know if they wanted to go where I wanted the character to go."

On hearing of the twins' interest in the show, Brock Akil asked them if their management was aware of her writing style. When questioned by Brock Akil, Tia responded: "I'm a woman, Mara. I can do this." Though Tia was chosen for the part, Tamera later appeared as a <a href="guest%20appearance">guest star</a> during the show's fifth season. Brock Akil said that Tia won the role over Tamera because she had a more "serious personality" and "made all the necessary adjustments to get this part". The producer explained that she appreciated Tia's work ethic and her strong desire to be a part of the series; she described Tia's audition as "fighting everybody's preconceived notions of her" by playing the more mature Melanie.

Prior to hearing about "The Game", Mowry had changed her appearance in order to be perceived as more mature and to emphasize the differences between herself and her twin sister. During this process, she lost and straightened her hair for auditions. To prepare for the role, she frequently consulted her cousin, retired NFL <a href="Fullback%20%28American%20football%29">fullback</a> <a href="Jameel%20Cook">Jameel Cook</a>, and other professional athletes. Mowry felt that playing the role of Melanie would enable her to be perceived as more mature following her appearances as <a href="Tia%20Landry">Tia Landry</a> on "Sister, Sister". When discussing her reasons for auditioning, she said that she wanted to take on a more difficult role. She also described "The Game" as an opportunity to showcase her individuality. Mowry identified Melanie as the closest match to her personality in comparison to her previous roles. She cited her character's relationship with Derwin as reminiscent of her own romance and subsequent marriage to actor <a href="Cory%20Hardrict">Cory Hardrict</a>.

Describing Melanie as a "vixen", Mowry believes that the character's imperfections allowed her to grow as an actor. She felt the show was evidence, alongside "<a href="Sex%20and%20the%20City">Sex and the City</a>" and "<a href="Desperate%20Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a>", that women had more leading roles on television, and said this "allows women to be women and to show their different emotions and what we deal with in lifeperiod". Melanie's intellect, one of her defining characteristics, earned her the nickname "Med School". "<a href="VIBE%20Vixen">VIBE Vixen</a>"'s Jennifer Hickman referred to Melanie as "bookwormy", and Virginia Heffernan characterized her as "wholesome and a good student" in the pilot. Heffernan called the character a "kind of <a href="The%20Cosby%20Show">"Cosby Show"</a> figure" due to her initial reluctance to join the Sabre Sunbeams.

After "The Game" aired for three seasons on the CW, the network canceled the series, having decided to stop developing sitcoms. Picked up by BET, the show aired for five more seasons. Mowry and Hall left "The Game" in 2012 after Hall accepted a lead role in the <a href="crime%20drama">crime drama</a> television series "<a href="Ray%20Donovan">Ray Donovan</a>". Mowry left the show when Melanie's role was slated to become "less important" in comparison to previous seasons. Announcing her departure on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, she emphasized that it was a mutual decision with the network. Brock Akil said she provided closure to Melanie and Derwin's story arc through their exit, explaining: "They're together, and we were able to put a period on their story."

Following Melanie and Derwin's exit, two characters, <a href="draft%20pick">draft pick</a> Bryce "The Blueprint" Westbrook and <a href="Child%20actor">child star</a> Keira Whitaker, portrayed by <a href="Jay%20Ellis">Jay Ellis</a> and <a href="Lauren%20London">Lauren London</a>, respectively, were introduced on the series. Media outlets viewed Keira and London as replacing Melanie and Mowry, but Ellis and London objected to comparisons made between Melanie and Derwin and Bryce and Lauren, believing that the two pairs were separate characters. Following Mowry's exit, actress <a href="Keke%20Palmer">Keke Palmer</a> was offered a lead role in the series but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with the development of her <a href="Daytime%20television">daytime</a> <a href="talk%20show">talk show</a> "<a href="Just%20Keke">Just Keke</a>." Brock Akil described the changes made to "The Game" as a "true resurrection", with <a href="Wendy%20Raquel%20Robinson">Wendy Raquel Robinson</a> (Tasha Mack) saying that future episodes would be "completely different, crisper and edgier and sexier".

For the series finale, Mowry and Hall reprised their roles as Melanie and Derwin even though Mowry had written on her <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page that she would not reappear on the show. Hall announced their return during the <a href="2015%20BET%20Awards">2015 BET Awards</a>, where the show's cast had attended to say "their final goodbyes". Discussing the direction intended for Melanie and Derwin's final appearance, Brock Akil said: "To bring these characters back to shore is such a blessing. They get an ending. They get closure." She added that their storyline would appeal to the show's fans, explaining: "I feel creatively we've been able to answer those who have been loyal to us. It's truly a tip of the hat to the fans who will get to see if Melanie and Derwin get their happily-ever-after."

Melanie Barnett has been negatively received by <a href="Television%20criticism">television critics</a>. Melanie McFarland of <a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">"The Seattle Post-Intelligencer"</a> panned the character along with the show's main premise ("A woman on a professional track kicks it all aside to chase a football player"), feeling that they were contradictory to the message of the parent show "Girlfriends". Echoing McFarland's assessment, "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">The San Francisco Chronicle</a>"'s Tim Goodman found Melanie's decision to be "a bleak little life lesson". When discussing the transition to BET, Britney Wilson of <a href="Clutch%20%28magazine%29">"Clutch"</a> was critical of the deterioration of female friendships on the show, citing "the disintegration of the female identity" as signs of "The Game" declining quality.

The character's representation as a mother also received criticism. Wilson viewed negatively Melanie's decision to have an abortion in an attempt to reconcile with Derwin, and criticized the show's depiction of an abortion causing Melanie to become barren as based on "a link that is not medically solid". In her 2015 book "Representations of Black Women in the Media: The Damnation of Black Womanhood", <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20Northridge">California State University</a> associate professor Marquita Marie Gammage felt that the character was perpetuating negative images of black motherhood on television. Gammage criticized the series for showing Melanie becoming a wife "at the expanse of her career and possibility of bear[ing] her own children" and portraying her as unable to care for her stepson. She contrasted Melanie to white characters on television, writing that "white women seem to achieve it all and control their realities on their own terms".

Mowry received positive feedback from fans, who "were fairly obsessed with Melanie and Derwin’s journey early on". Fans reacted positively to the characters' relationship, and dubbed the couple the <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> "Merwin", which BET adopted and used to promote Mowry and Hall's appearances in the series finale. Jaime Lee of <a href="Soap%20Opera%20Network">Soap Opera Network</a> wrote that, in relating to their struggles, viewers connected with the fictional couple. A writer from "<a href="HuffPost">HuffPost</a>" cited the pairing as a "big part of the winning formula for the series", and Mowry attributed the positive fan response to her chemistry with Hall. She said the following about the character's reception in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>":

Mowry's performance received positive feedback from critics. While discussing her career in his 2010 book "Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television", author Bob McCann wrote that Mowry demonstrated maturity through her more dramatic role in the series. Though critical of the overall show, the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" Maureen Ryan was pleased with Mowry's charismatic performance. Melody K. Hoffman of <a href="Jet%20%28magazine%29">"Jet"</a> wrote that, through her performance in the show, Mowry had demonstrated her love for acting and her capacity to portray a woman. In a negative review, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Robert Bianco was uncertain of Mowry's capabilities as a comedic actress, saying that she frequently relied on child acting techniques that were inappropriate for an adult character.

Mowry received two nominations for <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Actress%20in%20a%20Comedy%20Series">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series</a> at the 39th and 43rd <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Awards">NAACP Image Awards</a>. She was also nominated for the <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Award%20for%20Choice%20TV%20Actress%20Comedy">Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress Comedy</a> in the <a href="2007%20Teen%20Choice%20Awards">2007 Teen Choice Awards</a>.

Makinti Napanangka

Makinti Napanangka ( 1930 – 9 January 2011) was a <a href="Pintupi%20language">Pintupi</a>-speaking <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australian</a> artist from Australia's <a href="Western%20Desert%20cultural%20bloc">Western Desert</a> region. She was referred to posthumously as Kumentje. The term Kumentje was used instead of her personal name as it is customary among many indigenous communities not to refer to the deceased by their original given name for some time after their death. She lived in the communities of <a href="Haasts%20Bluff">Haasts Bluff</a>, <a href="Papunya">Papunya</a>, and later at <a href="Kintore%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Kintore</a>, about north-east of the <a href="Lake%20Macdonald%2C%20Queensland">Lake MacDonald</a> region where she was born, on the border of the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> and <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>.

Makinti <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20kinship%23Pintupi">Napanangka</a> began painting <a href="Contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">Contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a> at Kintore in the mid-1990s, encouraged by a community art project. Interest in her work developed quickly, and she is now represented in most significant Australian public art galleries, including the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>. A finalist in the 2003 <a href="Clemenger%20Contemporary%20Art%20Award">Clemenger Contemporary Art Award</a>, Makinti won the <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a> in 2008. Her work was shown in the major indigenous art exhibition "Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius", at the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Art Gallery of New South Wales</a>.

Working in <a href="acrylic%20paint">synthetic polymer</a> on <a href="linen">linen</a> or <a href="canvas">canvas</a>, Makinti's paintings primarily take as their subjects a rockhole site, Lupul, and an indigenous story (or "<a href="Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">dreaming</a>") about two sisters, known as "Kungka Kutjarra". She was a member of the <a href="Papunya%20Tula">Papunya Tula</a> Artists Cooperative, but her work has been described as more spontaneous than that of her fellow Papunya Tula artists.

Makinti Napanangka's year of birth is uncertain, but several sources indicate she was born around 1930, although other sources indicate she may have been born as early as 1922 or as late as 1932 at a location described by some sources as Lupul rockhole but by one major reference work as Mangarri. All sources agree that she comes from the area of Karrkurritinytja or Lake MacDonald, which straddles the border between Western Australia and the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>, south-west of <a href="Kintore%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Kintore</a>, and about west of <a href="Alice%20Springs%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Alice Springs</a>.

Makinti was a member of the <a href="Pintupi">Pintupi</a> group of indigenous people, who are associated with the communities of Papunya, Kintore, and <a href="Kiwirrkurra%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kiwirrkura</a>. "Napanangka" is a <a href="skin%20name">skin name</a>, one of eight used to denote the subgroups in the <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20kinship%23Pintupi">Pintupi kinship system</a>, not a surname in the sense used by Europeans. Thus her personal name was "Makinti". The uncertainty around Makinti's date and place of birth arises from the fact that Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth by comparison with other events, especially for people born before contact with European Australians. They may also cite the place of birth as being where the mother first <a href="quickening">felt the foetus move</a>, rather than where the birth took place.

Makinti's first contact with white people was seeing them riding camels, when she was living at Lupul. She was one of a large group of people who walked into Haasts Bluff in the early 1940s, together with her husband Nyukuti Tjupurrula (brother of artist Nosepeg Tjupurrula), and their son Ginger Tjakamarra, born around 1940. At Haasts Bluff they had a second child, Narrabri Narrapayi, in 1949. The population moved to Papunya in the late 1950s, where Makinti had another child, Jacqueline Daaru, in 1958. She had a daughter, Winnie Bernadette, in 1961 in Alice Springs. The family moved to Kintore when it was established in the early 1980s, and by 1996 Kumentje was painting there for the <a href="Papunya%20Tula">Papunya Tula</a> Artists Cooperative. Her children Ginger, Narrabri, and Jacqueline also became artists, all of them painting for Papunya Tula Artists.

Physically tiny yet robust and strong, Kumentje was described as "a charmer and an irascible character", with an infectious smile. She died in Alice Springs in January 2011.

Artists of the Papunya Tula movement were painting at Haasts Bluff in the late 1970s, but the deaths of some of the main painters in the early 1980s led to a period of decline. In 1992, the Ikuntji Women's Centre was opened at Haasts Bluff and a new painting movement quickly developed, supported by founding art coordinator Marina Strocchi, who assisted in artists' development at both Haasts Bluff and Kintore. It was through this initiative that Kumentje began painting in 1994 for the "Minyma Tjukurrpa" (Kintore/Haasts Bluff Project) and by 1997 her work was being acquired by major collecting institutions. She was one of the "Kintore ladies" who joined earlier generations of the famous Papunya Tula artists, and was referred to as "number one" by her fellow artists, of whom she was considered a leader. She painted with the Papunya Tula Artists Cooperative, in which she was a shareholder, from 1996.

The only break in her career was in 1999, when she underwent a <a href="cataract">cataract</a> operation, an event that journalist <a href="Nicolas%20Rothwell">Nicolas Rothwell</a> suggested was associated with a distinct shift in her work, including the increasing use of thick lines. Johnson said the operation resulted in "a collection of light-flooded canvases"; Art Gallery of New South Wales curator Hetti Perkins said that, after her recovery, "her work showed renewed vigour".

Makinti's works were selected to hang in five consecutive <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a> (NATSIAA) exhibitions, beginning in 1997. In 2000, she held her first solo exhibition, and was one of the artists whose works were included in the major exhibition "Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius" at the Art Gallery of New South Wales. The following year, she was a finalist at the NATSIAA. 2003 saw her named by <a href="Australian%20Art%20Collector">Australian Art Collector magazine</a> as one of the country's 50 most collectible artists, an assessment repeated by that magazine in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Also in 2003, she was among the finalists for the Clemenger Contemporary Art Award. By 2006, her works were commanding "the upper end of the price spectrum", though the resale values of those of her works not sold through Papunya Tula artists were considered precarious, owing to such works being of variable quality.

In August 2008, Makinti won the $40,000 NATSIAA, but her age and circumstances prevented her from accepting it in person. In October 2008, she was one of several prominent artists whose works featured in a charity auction securing funds for the <a href="Charles%20Darwin%20University">Menzies School of Health Research</a> in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. Her painting sold for A$18,500, a significant contribution to the quarter of a million dollars raised. In 2009, she was again a finalist in the NATSIAA, with an untitled painting and was also a finalist in the Togart Contemporary Art Award the same year. In 2011 she was a finalist in the 36th Alice Art Prize and in 2011 she was posthumously awarded the <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Member of the Order of Australia</a>, for "service to the arts as a contemporary Indigenous artist, to women painters of the Western Desert Art movement, and to the community of the Northern Territory".

Most of Australia's public collections hold one or more works by Makinti, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Queensland Art Gallery, Brisbane and the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory. She participated in some major group exhibitions, such as "Papunya Tula: Genesis and Genius" at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and "Colour Power" at the National Gallery of Victoria, as well as having had a small number of solo exhibitions at private galleries, including the gallery of influential art dealer <a href="Gabrielle%20Pizzi">Gabrielle Pizzi</a>. The <a href="National%20Portrait%20Gallery%20%28Australia%29">National Portrait Gallery</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> has in its collection a photographic portrait of Kumentje, by Malaysian-born Australian artist Hari Ho. Her work was selected for inclusion in the 2012 <a href="Sydney%20Biennale">Sydney Biennale</a>.

Makinti's works, including her Clemenger Award and NATSIAA paintings, are created with <a href="acrylic%20paint">synthetic polymer</a> on <a href="linen">linen</a> or <a href="canvas">canvas</a>.

Many paintings by artists of the Western Desert relate to water, while the story (or "<a href="Dreaming%20%28spirituality%29">dreaming</a>") most frequently portrayed by Western Desert women is "Kungka Kutjarra", or Two Women, concerning the travel of two sisters. Makinti's works reflect those themes, and are particularly associated with a rockhole site, Lupul, and with "Kungka Kutjarra". Her untitled painting in the "Genesis and Genius" exhibition was based on "Kungka Kutjarra", while the painting that won the 2008 Telstra award related to Lupul. The <a href="iconography">iconography</a> of her paintings includes the use of lines representing paths and ceremonial hair-string skirts, and circles representing water-holes.

According to Art Gallery of New South Wales indigenous art curator and NATSIAA judge Hetti Perkins, Makinti and her work are "very dynamic and charismatic". Although a member of the Papunya Tula Artists, Makinti's work has been described as taking "a more spontaneous approach in illustrating the traditional iconography than that done by previous artists painting at Papunya". Her style evolved over time, beginning with gestural brush strokes in ordered compositions, and developing into more closely interwoven representations of the hair-string skirts and designs reflecting those used in body painting. Throughout this evolution, her colour palette has consistently included a subtle range of yellows and pinks, through to oranges and whites.

Judith Ryan, senior curator at the National Gallery of Victoria, described Makinti's entry in the 2003 Clemenger Contemporary Art Award as:concerned with touching and sensing with fingers, rather than purely visual. The repetition of colour chords and textured striations, which closely echo each other, has a rhapsodic effect akin to many bodies in dance and reveals the inner or spiritual power, the essence, of Makinti Napanangka's country and cultural identity. The energetic lines invoke body paint for women’s business, and more particularly represent spun hair-string, which is used to make belts worn by women during ceremonies associated with the rockhole site of Lupulnga, a <a href="Magpie-lark">Peewee</a> Dreaming place.

Reviewing the same exhibition, Robert Nelson described Makinti's work as "sensual and chromatically effusive painting". The work of the "Kintore ladies" has created "some of the most richly textured surfaces in the history of the (Papunya Tula) company"; Makinti's painting for "Genesis and Genius" was hailed as "a painterly celebration of colour and form".

MissingNo.

, also known as MISSINGNO. or MissingNO, short for "Missing Number", is an unofficial <a href="List%20of%20Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon species</a> found in the video games <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Red%20and%20Blue">"Pokémon Red" and "Blue"</a>. Due to the programming of certain in-game events, players can encounter MissingNo. via a <a href="glitch">glitch</a>.

Encountering MissingNo. causes graphical errors and the mass replication of the sixth item in the player's item menu; the latter effect resulted in the glitch's coverage by <a href="strategy%20guide">strategy guide</a>s and game magazines. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> has noted MissingNo.'s appearance in "Pokémon Red" and "Blue" as one of the most famous video game glitches. Fans of the series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as part of the games' <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>, and sociologists have studied its impact on players.

Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the "Pokémon" series began in Japan in 1996. The player assumes the role of a <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Trainer">Pokémon Trainer</a> whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon. Players use the creatures' special abilities to combat other Pokémon, and certain abilities also grant new ways to navigate the game's world, such as instantaneous travel between two areas.

Nintendo of America first documented the events that cause MissingNo. to appear in the May 1999 issue of "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>", with a warning that "any contact with it (even if you don't catch it) could easily erase your game file or disrupt your graphics". The glitch is the result of a succession of events: first, players watch an in-game tutorial for Pokémon capture. The player then uses a Pokémon with the Fly move to reach the game's Cinnabar Island location, and then uses a Pokémon with the Surf move to travel up and down the eastern shore of the island until a MissingNo appears.

Encountering a MissingNo. Pokémon is the result of a sequence of unintended events. The first is the game's random battle encounter system; each area assigns <a href="Value%20%28computer%20science%29">values</a> to Pokémon in a <a href="data%20buffer">data buffer</a>, which the game accesses for the player's encounters with wild Pokémon. However, the locations Cinnabar Island and the Seafoam Islands do not assign data to this buffer—the information from the previously visited area is used instead. The second factor is the in-game tutorial, which temporarily stores the player's name in the data buffer. This causes the game to access the <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> values of the player's name for Pokémon encounters at Cinnabar and Seafoam Islands, triggering a battle with a nonexistent Pokémon.

As with any wild Pokémon, players may flee from, fight, or capture MissingNo. After an encounter with MissingNo., the quantity of the sixth item in the player's item menu is usually increased by a large amount and the game's Hall of Fame Pokémon gallery becomes permanently glitched. Temporary graphical glitches may also occur, which can be removed by viewing the statistics page for another non-glitched Pokémon or resetting the <a href="Video%20game%20console">console</a>. A captured MissingNo. is a fully functional Pokémon, and appears in the game's <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Pok%C3%A9mon%23Pok%C3%A9dex">Pokémon index</a> as number 000. All MissingNo. possess consistent abilities, types, statistics, and sounds. The Pokémon commonly appears as a scrambled "d"-shape, but certain encounter values cause it to appear as one of three <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> not used by other Pokémon.

While it only appeared in the first few games of the series, MissingNo has had a significant impact. Calling it a "programming quirk", Nintendo warned against encountering it, claiming players could possibly have to restart the game from the beginning to remove the graphical glitches. Despite Nintendo's warning, information on how to encounter MissingNo was printed in several magazines and player's guides due to its perceived positive effect. Certain players attempted to sell tips on capturing MissingNo for up to $200. Despite it not being an intentional part of the game, in 2009, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> included MissingNo in its list of the top video game <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter eggs</a>, citing its usefulness in replicating the game's rarer items. IGN stated in a related article, "It really says something about Pokémon fans that they took what is a potentially game-ruining glitch and used it as a shortcut to level up their Pokémon," and later called it an "unforgettable" glitch that helped push the original games to "gaming super stardom".

Players' reactions to MissingNo have been the subject of <a href="sociology">sociological</a> studies. Sociologist <a href="William%20Sims%20Bainbridge">William Sims Bainbridge</a> stated that Game Freak created "one of the most popular glitches ever in game history", and cited its creative usage by players. In the book "Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon", professor of education Julian Sefton-Green noticed that in his study of his son's reaction to MissingNo's usage as a <a href="Cheating%20in%20video%20games">cheat</a>, the child's outlook towards the game was altered drastically, and added that the presence of such elements as a result broke the illusion of the game as an enclosed world and reminded him that "at heart, it is a computer program". The book "Playing with Videogames" contains an in-depth study of MissingNo, which details players' curiosity when encountering the Pokémon. It describes their tendency to compare notes on its appearance, and to give assessment and critique to each other's findings. The book states that, in their attempts to interpret MissingNo as part of the series' narrative through <a href="fan%20art">fan art</a> and <a href="fan%20fiction">fiction</a>, Pokémon communities celebrated the game's imperfections and tried to imprint themselves on its <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>. The author described these circumstances as unique to MissingNo, and called its popularity an unusual case.

Kalidas (film)

Kalidas () is a 1931 Indian <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil-language</a> <a href="biographical%20film">biographical film</a> directed by <a href="H.%20M.%20Reddy">H. M. Reddy</a> and produced by <a href="Ardeshir%20Irani">Ardeshir Irani</a>. It is notable for being the first Tamil language <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>, and the first sound film to be made in <a href="South%20India">South India</a>. It was based on the life of the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> poet <a href="K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa">Kālidāsa</a>; it featured P. G. Venkatesan in the title role and <a href="T.%20P.%20Rajalakshmi">T. P. Rajalakshmi</a> as the female lead, with <a href="L.%20V.%20Prasad">L. V. Prasad</a>, Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila, and M. S. Santhanalakshmi in supporting roles.

"Kalidas", principally in Tamil, contained additional dialogue in <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>. While Rajalakshmi spoke Tamil, Venkatesan spoke only Telugu due to his lack of fluency in Tamil, and Prasad spoke only Hindi. Despite its <a href="Hindu%20mythology">mythological</a> theme, the film featured songs from much later time periods, such as the compositions of <a href="carnatic%20music">carnatic music</a>ian <a href="Tyagaraja">Tyagaraja</a>, publicity songs of the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>, and songs about <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> and the <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence movement</a>. The sound was recorded using German-made technology. "Kalidas" was shot in <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a> on the sets of India's first sound film "<a href="Alam%20Ara">Alam Ara</a>" (1931) and was completed in eight days.

"Kalidas" was released with high expectations on 31 October 1931, coinciding with <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a> day. It was the only Tamil film to be produced and released that year. Despite numerous technical flaws, it received critical acclaim, with praise for Rajalakshmi's singing performance, and it became a major commercial success. The success of "Kalidas" spawned other films based upon Kālidāsa, including "<a href="Mahakavi%20Kalidasa">Mahakavi Kalidasa</a>" (1955), "<a href="Mahakavi%20Kalidasu">Mahakavi Kalidasu</a>" (1960) and "<a href="Mahakavi%20Kalidas%20%281966%20film%29">Mahakavi Kalidas</a>" (1966).

In addition to its commercial success, "Kalidas" was a major breakthrough for Rajalakshmi's career, and made her a <a href="Bankable%20star">bankable singing star</a>. Because no print, gramophone record, or songbook of the film is known to survive, it is a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>.
Vidhyadhari is the daughter of Vijayavarman, the king of Thejavathi. His minister wants the princess to marry his son but she refuses. Annoyed, the minister sets out to find another potential husband for Vidhyadhari. In the forest, the minister finds an illiterate <a href="Cowman%20%28profession%29">cowman</a> sitting on a tree and cutting into the branch on which he is sitting. The minister persuades the cowman to come to the palace and has Vidhyadhari marry him. When Vidhyadhari realises she has been cheated, and is married to a farmhand, she prays to the goddess <a href="Kali">Kali</a> for a remedy. Kali appears before her, names her husband "Kalidas" and endows him with phenomenal literary talents.

Other supporting roles were played by: Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila and, M. S. Santhanalakshmi.

"Kalidas" is the first <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a> to be produced in <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian cinema</a>, and the first in <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil</a>. It was based on the life of the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> poet and playwright <a href="K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa">Kālidāsa</a>. The film was produced by <a href="Ardeshir%20Irani">Ardeshir Irani</a>, who directed India's first sound film "<a href="Alam%20Ara">Alam Ara</a>", and was directed by his former assistant, <a href="H.%20M.%20Reddy">H. M. Reddy</a>, for the studio Imperial Movietone. P. G. Venkatesan was chosen to play the title role. <a href="L.%20V.%20Prasad">L. V. Prasad</a>—who later founded <a href="Prasad%20Studios">Prasad Studios</a>—appeared in a comic role as a temple priest. Theatre artiste <a href="T.%20P.%20Rajalakshmi">T. P. Rajalakshmi</a> was chosen to play the female protagonist; according to film historian <a href="Randor%20Guy">Randor Guy</a>, she was the "automatic choice to play the heroine." Before this, Rajalakshmi had acted in many <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s, and "Kalidas" was her first sound film. Supporting roles were played by Thevaram Rajambal, T. Susheela Devi, J. Sushila, and M. S. Santhanalakshmi. The sound was recorded by German technicians using German-made equipment. "Kalidas" was shot in Bombay (now <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>) on the sets of "Alam Ara"; it was completed in eight days, using either or of film, as sources differ. Film historian <a href="Film%20News%20Anandan">Film News Anandan</a> stated that "Kalidas" "was produced in a hurry, and was technically flawed."

While "Kalidas" primary language was Tamil, the film's actors spoke a variety of languages, including Tamil (Rajalakshmi), <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> (Venkatesan) and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> (Prasad). Because Venkatesan's first language was Telugu, and he could not correctly pronounce Tamil words, his dialogue was in Telugu. According to Guy, Irani was initially unsure if the German sound recording equipment would record the Tamil language; to assuage his doubts, he had some actors speak and sing in Tamil, Venkatesan in Telugu, and, because the equipment had already recorded Hindi before, he had other actors speak Hindi; the equipment recorded each language clearly. Owing to the use of multiple languages, sources including Film News Anandan, <a href="Birgit%20Meyer">Birgit Meyer</a>, and Guy have refused to call "Kalidas" the first Tamil sound film; Guy instead called it India's first multilingual film. In the 2010 book "Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology", Sowmya Dechamma states that Telugu dialogues were included in the film, apparently to "increase its market potential in the two important language markets of southern India."

"Kalidas" featured fifty songs composed and written by <a href="Madhurakavi%20Bhaskara%20Das">Bhaskara Das</a>. Film historian <a href="S.%20Theodore%20Baskaran">S. Theodore Baskaran</a> mentions in his 1996 book, "The Eye of the Serpent: An Introduction to Tamil Cinema", that all of the songs were in Tamil. Birgit Meyer contradicted Baskaran in her 2009 book "Aesthetic Formations", stating that the film had Telugu songs, a view that was supported by Sowmya Dechamma in "Cinemas of South India: Culture, Resistance, Ideology".

Although the film was based on <a href="Hindu%20mythology">mythology</a>, it featured compositions from <a href="Anachronism">much later time periods</a>, such as those by the <a href="carnatic%20music">carnatic music</a>ian <a href="Tyagaraja">Tyagaraja</a>, and <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a> publicity songs. Film News Anandan stated Reddy was "probably pleased to add on anything artistic that came his way. Relevance was hardly an issue." The 2008 book "Tamil Cinema: The Cultural Politics of India's Other Film Industry" by Selvaraj Velayutham and "Aesthetic Formations" by Birgit Meyer stipulate that the nationalistic songs featured in the film had nothing to do with the main plot, while Randor Guy states during that period, "Historical accuracy wasn't as important as the music. It wasn't uncommon for the deities to sing modern poems or nationalist songs." Baskaran noted that this marked the "beginning of cinema being used as an instrument of political propaganda."

The patriotic song "Gandhiyin Kai Rattiname" ("The <a href="Spinning%20wheel%23Charkha">Charkha</a> that <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">[Mahatma] Gandhi</a> handles"), also known as "Raattinamam ... Gandhi Kai Bhanamaam ...", was sung by T. P. Rajalakshmi, and was unrelated to the story of Kalidas; the song extolled the charkha (spinning wheel), a Gandhian symbol of nationalism. Rajalakshmi also performed two of Tyagaraja's compositions, "Enta Nerchina" and "Suraragadhara", the latter of which was based on the "<a href="Dheerasankarabharanam">Shankarabharanam</a>" raga, for the film. Another song which Rajalakshmi performed, "Manmada Baanamadaa", became immensely popular, and was described by Guy as "the emotional outburst of love by the heroine". Another song, "Indhiyargal Nammavarkkul Eno Veen Sandai", spoke about the <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence movement</a> and the need for unity among Indians. Guy described "Manmada Baanamadaa" as the "first hit song of Tamil Cinema". No songbook of the film is known to survive.

An advertisement announcing the release of "Kalidas" was published on 30 October 1931 in "The Hindu", where it was proclaimed that the film was the "first talkie to be screened in the city with Tamil and Telugu songs". "Kalidas" was first released theatrically at the Madras (now <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>) based theatre Kinema Central (now known as the Murugan Theatre) on 31 October 1931, during the festive occasion of <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a> and coincided with the <a href="Salt%20March">Civil Disobedience Movement</a>.

When the film reels were taken to Madras, thousands of people gathered at the city's <a href="Chennai%20Central%20railway%20station">central railway station</a> and followed the reel box along <a href="Wall%20Tax%20Road%2C%20Chennai">Wall Tax Road</a> to Kinema Central, throwing rose petals, breaking open coconuts, and burning incense. The posters of the film read, "Tamil Telugu pesi paadu padam" (). An earlier attempt at producing a Tamil sound film, a four-reel short (identified by S. Theodore Baskaran as "Korathi Dance and Songs"), was screened alongside "Kalidas" as a side attraction. It starred Rajalakshmi, and the gypsy dancer Jhansi Bai. In a 2015 interview with "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>", Rajalakshmi's daughter Kamala stated that during the film's release, "people in Madras used to stand outside theatres for a distance of about 4-5km to witness [Rajalakshmi] acting in her first "pesum padam". She was welcomed with a roar here. Her name was announced from speakers installed on roads and <a href="Auto%20rickshaw">autorickshaws</a>, as a talkie was something new for the people."

"Kalidas" was commercially successful, grossing over 75,000 (about US$25,252 in 1931) and easily covering its budget of 8,000 (about US$2,693 in 1931) according to a 2013 estimate by "<a href="The%20Hindu%20%28Tamil%29">The Hindu Tamil</a>". Film producer and writer <a href="G.%20Dhananjayan">G. Dhananjayan</a> said the film succeeded because it was a "novelty for the audience to witness an audio visual with dialogues and songs of their language".

In his 1997 book "Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema", Randor Guy described "Kalidas" as a "crude experiment" that had poor <a href="lip%20sync">lip sync</a>; when characters opened their mouths there was no sound, and when dialogue or song was heard, artistes remained silent. He said the public did not care about technical niceties and flocked to see the film. Film critic and journalist <a href="Kalki%20Krishnamurthy">Kalki Krishnamurthy</a>, in his review of the film for "<a href="Ananda%20Vikatan">Ananda Vikatan</a>", noted that he was awestruck by the costumes used. He praised Rajalakshmi's performance and her dancing but criticised her singing, saying that she had to go see a doctor to get her vocal chords fixed. The Tamil newspaper "<a href="Swadesamitran">Swadesamitran</a>" printed a favourable review for "Kalidas" on 29 October 1931, two days prior to its theatrical release, where the reviewer, in contrast to Krishnamurthy's comments, appreciated Rajalakshmi's singing.

The arrival of sound in South Indian cinema, with the release of "Kalidas", triggered a migration of theatre artists into cinema. "Kalidas" was the only Tamil film to be produced and released in 1931. No print or gramophone record of the film is known to survive, making it a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>. "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" stated in 2014 that the film had "turned to dust" long before the <a href="National%20Film%20Archive%20of%20India">National Film Archive of India</a> was established in 1964. The only remaining artefacts include a few stills, advertisements, and an image of the cover of the songbook. As of December 2002, Film News Anandan had preserved several photographs related to the film.

"Kalidas" was a major breakthrough in Rajalakshmi's career, and made her a "<a href="Bankable%20star">bankable singing star</a>". Other films based on the life of Kālidāsa include the <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> film "<a href="Mahakavi%20Kalidasa">Mahakavi Kalidasa</a>" (1955), which won the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Kannada">National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Kannada</a>, the Hindi film "Kavi Kalidas" (1959), the Telugu film "<a href="Mahakavi%20Kalidasu">Mahakavi Kalidasu</a>" (1960), the Tamil film "<a href="Mahakavi%20Kalidas%20%281966%20film%29">Mahakavi Kalidas</a>" (1966), and the Kannada film "<a href="Kaviratna%20Kalidasa">Kaviratna Kalidasa</a>" (1983).

Action of 1 January 1800

The Action of 1 January 1800 was a naval battle of the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a> that took place off the coast of present-day <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, near the island of <a href="Gon%C3%A2ve%20Island">Gonâve</a> in the <a href="Bight%20%28geography%29">Bight</a> of <a href="Gulf%20of%20Gon%C3%A2ve">Léogâne</a>. The battle was fought between an American <a href="convoy">convoy</a> of four merchant vessels escorted by the United States naval <a href="schooner">schooner</a> , and a <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> of armed <a href="barge">barge</a>s manned by Haitians known as <a href="wikt%3Apicaroon">picaroon</a>s.

A French-aligned Haitian general, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Rigaud">André Rigaud</a>, had instructed his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once "Experiment" and her convoy of <a href="Cargo%20ship">merchant ships</a> neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing two of the American merchant ships before withdrawing. "Experiment" managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. On the American side, only the captain of the schooner "Mary" was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power by the forces of <a href="Toussaint%20L%27Ouverture">Toussaint L'Ouverture</a>, leader of the 1791 <a href="Haitian%20Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a>, did the picaroon attacks cease.

With the dawn of the <a href="Haitian%20Revolution">Haitian Revolution</a> in 1791, a successful slave rebellion on the French colony, then known as <a href="Saint-Domingue">Saint-Domingue</a>, allowed the local population to gain control over the government. Despite their success in removing the French colonial authorities, the various political factions that had seized control of the colony were fractious, and fighting soon broke out among them. By 1800, the <a href="War%20of%20Knives">War of Knives</a> between the pro-French <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Rigaud">André Rigaud</a> and the pro-<a href="autonomy">autonomy</a> <a href="Toussaint%20L%27Ouverture">Toussaint L'Ouverture</a> was in full swing and Saint-Domingue was divided in two. Rigaud controlled part of the southern portion of Saint-Domingue while L'Ouverture controlled the rest of the French colony. In need of supplies and <a href="materiel">materiel</a>, Rigaud's forces attacked any non-French ship that passed them.

Concurrently with the War of Knives, the United States and France were engaged in a bout of limited naval warfare in the Caribbean as part of the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>. In late December 1799 the American armed <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Experiment" was escorting under convoy the <a href="brig">brig</a> "Daniel and Mary" and the schooners "Sea Flower", "Mary", and "Washington" to prevent their capture by French <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s. On 1 January 1800, the convoy was caught in a dead calm off the north side of the present-day Haitian island of <a href="Gon%C3%A2ve%20Island">Gonâve</a>, in the Bight of Leogane. Seeing the convoy becalmed, Rigaud sent eleven armed barges out to attack and seize the American vessels.

The crews of the American merchant vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, "Experiment", was a much more powerful vessel. Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton "Experiment" was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven barges crewed by 40 to 50 men each in the smaller ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels. These barges were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel. The Haitian craft were each equipped with a mix of <a href="swivel%20gun">swivel gun</a>s and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms. In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more barges and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 barges and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did not know this during the attack. Individually the Haitian barges presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking "en masse" they could easily overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.

"Experiment" kept her gunports closed and passed herself off as a merchantman, while the Haitians sailed closer to the convoy with the intent of boarding and capturing all five vessels. Once the Haitians were in <a href="musket">musket</a> range of the American vessels they opened fire on them, and "Experiment" returned the fire. <a href="Grapeshot">Grapeshot</a> from the Americans wreaked havoc among the Haitian barges and they were forced to withdraw. They stood off the American convoy for thirty minutes before <a href="Beaching%20%28nautical%29">beaching</a> at the nearby island of Gonâve to land their wounded and gather reinforcements. With three more barges and fresh crews, the picaroons set off to assault the American convoy once more. They divided themselves into three squadrons of four barges each and set course to attack "Experiment". The lead and centermost divisions attacked the sides of the American warship while the rear division assaulted the stern. During the lull in fighting "Experiment" had readied herself for the picaroons' next assault by positioning <a href="musketeer">musketeer</a>s in defensive positions, loading her main guns, and raising <a href="Boarding%20%28attack%29">boarding</a> nets. Thus, when the Haitians attacked the American warship again she was well prepared to repulse any attempt at boarding her.

For three hours, "Experiment" battled the barges, sinking two and killing a great many of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and attacked the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from "Experiment" by sailing behind the schooner "Mary", which was between the two barges and the warship. The Haitians boarded "Mary" and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the <a href="Hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a>. The second barge attempted to take "Daniel and Mary" but was sunk by fire from "Experiment". Once the Haitians had boarded "Mary", "Experiment" opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.

The entire flotilla of Haitians once more retired to Gonâve and replaced their wounded crewmembers with fresh ones. Seeing that "Daniel and Mary" and "Washington" had drifted away from the convoy, the Haitians set out to attack them. The two civilian vessels, having drifted too far from the protection of "Experiment" guns, were abandoned by their crews and passengers who fled to the American warship. The Haitians boarded and plundered these two vessels, carrying them further away from "Experiment". "Experiment" managed to get close enough to the barges to attack them with her cannon but could not pursue them, as two barges had broken away from the main flotilla and were positioned to take "Mary" and "Sea Flower" if "Experiment" left them. Eventually the remnants of the convoy managed to make it to <a href="L%C3%A9og%C3%A2ne">Léogâne</a>, where they were looked after by the American consul.

USS "Experiment" had succeeded in protecting two of the convoy, but the other two ships were taken by the picaroons. On the American side, only the captain of the schooner "Mary" had been killed. The Americans also suffered two wounded: one civilian, and "Experiment" second in command <a href="David%20Porter%20%28naval%20officer%29">David Porter</a>, who had been shot in the arm during the action. In exchange the Haitians had lost two of their barges and a great many casualties. Rigaud's picaroons attacked another American convoy later in the year and continued to harass American shipping until Rigaud was ousted from Saint-Domingue at the end of the <a href="War%20of%20Knives">War of Knives</a>. After fleeing to <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, he left for France on the schooner "Diane", but was captured and taken to <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a> when "Experiment" intercepted her on 1 October 1800.

The action would prove controversial in the United States as several officers' reports suggested that Lieutenant Maley, commander of "Experiment", had shown cowardice during the engagement. Lieutenant Porter stated that Maley had tried to insist on surrendering to the picaroons immediately upon their arrival. It was alleged that Maley thought the situation was hopeless due to the sheer number of pro-French Haitians who were attacking the convoy, and he had attempted to <a href="Striking%20the%20colors">strike the colors</a>.

The officers' reports also commended Porter, stating that he had saved "Experiment" and her convoy by acting on his own initiative to ignore Maley's defeatism, urging the crew to fight. Other American officials, such as the American consul at Leonge who was aboard the Experiment during the action, disagreed with Porter's accusations and instead lauded Maley for his bravery. Threats of <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> were made against Maley, but no formal charges regarding the incident were ever brought. On 16 July 1800 he was replaced as commander of "Experiment" by <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%281778%E2%80%931869%29">Charles Stewart</a>. The incident haunted his career until his retirement.

Hermann Detzner

Hermann Philipp Detzner (16 October 1882 – 1 December 1970) was a German engineer and surveyor, who served as an officer in the German colonial security force ("<a href="Schutztruppe">Schutztruppe</a>") in "<a href="Kamerun">Kamerun</a>" (Cameroon) and <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">German New Guinea</a>. He gained fame for evading capture after Australian troops invaded German New Guinea at the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

In early 1914, the German government sent Detzner to explore and chart central <a href="Kaiser-Wilhelmsland">Kaiser-Wilhelmsland</a>, the imperial protectorate on the island of New Guinea. When World War I broke out in Europe, he was far from civilisation and without radio contact. He refused to surrender to <a href="Australian%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Expeditionary%20Force">Australian troops</a> when they occupied German New Guinea, concealing himself in the jungle with a band of approximately 20 soldiers. For four years, Detzner and his troops provocatively marched through the bush, singing "<a href="Die%20Wacht%20am%20Rhein">Watch on the Rhine</a>" and flying the German Imperial flag. He led at least one expedition from the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula">Huon Peninsula</a> to the north coast, and a second by a mountain route, to attempt an escape to the neutral <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Dutch colony</a> to the west. He explored areas of the New Guinea's hinterland formerly unseen by Europeans.

After finding out that the war had ended, Detzner surrendered in full dress uniform, flying the Imperial flag, to Australian forces in January 1919. He received a hero's welcome when he returned to Germany. He wrote a book about his adventures — "Four Years Among the Cannibals in the Interior of German New Guinea under the Imperial Flag, from 1914 until the Armistice" — that sold well in Great Britain and Germany, entered three printings, and was translated into French, English, Finnish and Swedish. He received a position in the Imperial Colonial Archives, and appeared frequently on the <a href="lecture%20circuit">lecture circuit</a> throughout the 1920s. In the late 1920s, scientific portions of his book were discredited. In 1932, he admitted that he had mixed fact and fiction and, after that time, eschewed public life.

Detzner was the son of a dentist, Johann Philipp Detzner (12 July 1846 – 1907) and his wife, Wilhelmine Katharina Faber, in <a href="Speyer">Speyer</a>, in the <a href="Bavarian%20Palatinate">Bavarian Palatinate</a>, a cultural, economic, and historical city on the <a href="Rhine%20River">Rhine River</a>. His father received his degree from <a href="Heidelberg%20University">Heidelberg University</a> and was licensed to practise by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a> in 1867; Detzner's father pioneered innovations in dental <a href="prosthetic">prosthetic</a>s. His large family included nine children. Hermann Detzner was trained as a topographer, surveyor, and an engineer, and received his promotion to "<a href="Fahnrich">Fahnrich</a>" in the 6 Infantry Regiment (Prussian), 2nd Pioneer Battalion, in February 1902. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, military authorities transferred his commission to the 1st Bavarian Pioneer Battalion.

Hermann Detzner participated in a joint British-German scientific and surveying expedition to <a href="Kamerun">Kamerun</a> in 1908 and 1909 and again in 1912–1913. He and one Captain Nugent, <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, identified and marked the frontiers of Kamerun and explored the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger</a> valley. Detzner later published a paper on the marking of the boundary.

Navigators charted the coastline of the northern and eastern portions of New Guinea in the early 17th century and, later in the century, British Admiralty navigators named the visible mountain ranges. Most German surveying efforts had focused on coastal regions and river basins, where Germans had established plantations, leaving the hinterland unexplored. In late 1913, the Imperial Colonial office appointed Detzner to lead an expedition to survey the border between the British protectorate, called <a href="Papua%20Region">Papua</a>, and the German territory, called <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">Kaiser-Wilhelmsland</a>, and to survey and map unexplored inland regions.

Detzner's mission was also to be the first serious attempt to explore the hinterland and to evaluate and describe its resources. The boundary between Papua and Kaiser Wilhelmsland had been broadly established by a joint British-German expedition in 1909, but the terrain had not been mapped and the German colonial administration maintained that the boundary was imprecise. From the German perspective, an accurately defined boundary was essential to monitor and control the activities of Papuan gold prospectors near the border with German territory . Detzner had had experience in joint operations in Kamerun in 1907–08 and could be expected to understand the challenges faced by the previous commission; he had a reputation as a methodical and precise engineer. Although small, he was tough and wiry, extremely focused and determined, and seemed like the right man for the job.

In January 1914, Detzner travelled to <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> on <a href="New%20Pomerania">New Pomerania</a> (now <a href="New%20Britain">New Britain</a>). In February, he began his expedition into <a href="Kaiser-Wilhelmsland">Kaiser-Wilhelmsland</a>. His survey immediately revealed inaccuracies in the 1909 joint survey; by March, Detzner had concluded that the border corridor was already showing a discrepancy of more than from the <a href="8th%20parallel%20south">8°0'S parallel</a>. The discrepancy increased the further west he travelled, revealing a widening wedge in the boundary as it was agreed upon, and as it was marked. The discrepancy favoured German interests.

He had progressed well inland when, on 4 August 1914, Britain declared war on Germany. As World War I spread to the Pacific, <a href="Australian%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Expeditionary%20Force">Australian troops</a> invaded German New Guinea, taking the German barracks in Herbertshöhe (<a href="Kokopo">Kokopo</a>) and forcing the defending German colonial troops to capitulate on 21 September after their <a href="Battle%20of%20Bita%20Paka">defeat at Bita Paka</a>. At the beginning of October, he was still unaware of the state of war that now existed between his country and the <a href="Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a>.

The several months following the outbreak of war found Detzner on border survey work with his sergeant, Konradt, 25 police and 45 carriers, two servants and an interpreter in the high country between Mt Chapman, the Ono River, and Mt Lawson, that is to say along the territorial boundary between Australian-governed Papua and <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">German New Guinea</a>. Eventually he sighted people he named "Rockpapua" or "skirted Papuans' - these were Kamea people perhaps in the area south of Tekadu in the southernmost part of Morobe Province or the northern part of Gulf Province. On 11 November 1914, one of the carriers, left with several others to rest at a temporary camp, arrived bearing a note from Frederick Chisholm, an Australian Patrol Officer, informing him of the state of war between Germany and Great Britain and asking him to surrender at Nepa on the Lakekamu River, five days walk away.

Rather than comply, Detzner led his party on a forced march north to the Markham Valley. His route is uncertain, but his description of a valley with steep grassy ravines entering from east and west may place the latter part of his journey in the Langimar Valley, through which flows a tributary of the Watut River. A clash with local people that he describes has been identified as having occurred at Rangama among with Middle Watut people. Once on the Watut itself, the party built rafts and floated downstream to the Markham.

His final destination was <a href="Sattelberg">Sattelberg</a> on the Huon peninsula. His second in command, Sergeant Konradt, who suffered from frequent bouts of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and a German officer, were captured by the Australians by spring 1915. Eventually, Detzner found his way to the vicinity of a Lutheran mission at the Sattelberg, at a foggy, cool area at , above Finschhafen. The Sattelberg mission was one of the Neuendettelsau Mission Society enterprises established by the <a href="Old%20Lutherans">Old Lutheran</a> missionary, <a href="Johann%20Flierl">Johann Flierl</a>, in 1885. This station, and additional mission stations in Heldbach, Simbang, <a href="Tami%20Islands">Tami Islands</a>, and Simbu, were an important evangelical presence in the <a href="Morobe%20Province">Morobe Province</a>. The missionaries had signed oaths of neutrality for the Australians, who allowed them to remain at their Stations and continue their work.

Once Detzner reached the vicinity of the Sattelberg Mission, nearby villagers in the Borrum valley housed him and his remaining men, which had dwindled to about 20 soldiers, plus four European officers and, on his behalf, the villagers sought assistance from the Sattelberg director, <a href="Christian%20Keyser">Christian Keyser</a>, and another missionary, Otto Thiele. They reluctantly agreed to keep Detzner's presence a secret. Among the villagers, Detzner established a base camp from which he could depart at short notice. The valley was relatively secure for him, and inaccessible for the Australians, but if they ventured too close to his base, Detzner and his men would retreat into the mountainous <a href="Saruwaged%20Range">Saruwaged</a>, or, if necessary, further into the <a href="Finisterre%20Range">Finisterre</a> mountains. These were rugged and remote locations, accessible to Detzner, who had the help of native guides, but which the Australians, who usually travelled in larger patrols, could not penetrate.

Detzner and his band stayed near the Sattelberg Mission for the remainder of the war. After the war, however, Detzner would claim he had roamed throughout the eastern jungles of the island, eluding Australian patrols and making little effort to hide. He said he flew the Imperial German flag (sewn from dyed loincloths) in villages throughout the bush, and marched his command through the jungle, loudly singing such patriotic German songs as "<a href="Die%20Wacht%20am%20Rhein">Watch on the Rhine</a>" ("Die Wacht am Rhein") and popular sentimental ballads like "<a href="The%20Linden%20Tree">The Linden Tree</a>" ("Der Lindenbaum").

Detzner could have made attempts to reach <a href="West%20New%20Guinea">West New Guinea</a>, which was then neutral <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Dutch New Guinea</a>, but his claims to have been the first outsider to enter the Papua New Guinea highlands can be discounted. In 1915, and again in 1917, Detzner and some of his men tried to escape along the coast in two canoes. In 1917, they reached the vicinity of Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, which today is <a href="Madang">Madang</a>. There lay anchored the Australian ship, <a href="HMAS%20Una">HMAS "Una"</a>, which earlier had been the German imperial yacht, the , designated for use by the German governor of the colony. The ship blocked any further travel, and ended any notions they had of a water escape to Dutch New Guinea. On this escape attempt, Detzner also learned the Australians had orders to shoot him on sight. He made one further attempt to escape overland to Dutch New Guinea, but had to be carried back suffering from an internal hemorrhage. He spent the remainder of the time investigating the island's inhabitants and its flora and fauna, particularly in the <a href="Huon%20peninsula">Huon peninsula</a> and <a href="Huon%20gulf">Huon gulf</a>.
In late November 1918, Detzner received the news of the end of the war from a worker at the Sattelberg Mission Station. He wrote a letter to the Australian commander in <a href="Morobe%20Province">Morobe</a> in which he offered his capitulation. On 5 January 1919, he surrendered at the <a href="Finschhafen%20District">Finschhafen District</a> headquarters, marching with his remaining German troops in a column, and wearing his carefully preserved full-dress uniform. He was brought to <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, the Australian headquarters, and on 8 February 1919, was transferred to Sydney aboard the "Melusia"; after a brief internment in the prisoner of war camp at <a href="Holsworthy%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Holsworthy</a>, he was repatriated to Germany.

On his arrival home, Detzner received a hero's welcome. The press likened him to the successful commander of <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a>, "Major General" <a href="Paul%20Emil%20von%20Lettow-Vorbeck">Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck</a>, who tied down British forces in Africa for the duration of the war. Detzner had been promoted to the rank of captain during the war; upon his return, he was promoted to major. In that year, he wrote "Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, nach dem Stande der Forschung im Jahre 1919", (Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, According to the State of Research in the Year 1919), which was widely read in scientific circles. The claim that the Geographical Society of Berlin honored him with the Nachtigal medal, named after the German explorer <a href="Gustav%20Nachtigal">Gustav Nachtigal</a>, in 1919 is false; this misinformation may have been planted by Detzner himself. Nevertheless, the Geographic Society of Hamburg did award him their gold medal in 1921, the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a> granted him an honorary degree, and the military awarded him the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> (1st Class). He received a position in the colonial administration's archive in Berlin.

To satisfy the public curiosity about his adventures, Detzner wrote "Four Years among the Cannibals, from 1914 to the Armistice, under the German Flag, in the Unexplored Interior of New Guinea". The book brought him fame in Germany and Britain, and he became a sought-after speaker on the lecture circuit. In the 1920s, in addition to several articles and two maps of New Guinea, Detzner published a memoir of his adventures in the Niger valley—"In the land of the Dju-Dju: travel experiences in the eastern watershed of the Niger"—in 1923, but it did not achieve the popularity of his previous work. 

Detzner's book was wildly popular among the general population for its incredible tales of stubborn patriotism and its narratives describing the exotic locales of the lost imperial colonies. His descriptions touched a chord in the German imagination: one of their own had explored the colony, walked its paths, seen its mountains and valleys, and met its people. His vivid descriptions brought to life the images Germans had seen on postcards (such as the one to left), newspapers, and in school books. Furthermore, he had defended Germany's "place in the sun" when others had failed to do so. His book was translated into English, Finnish, Swedish and eventually French. (See <a href="Hermann%20Detzner%23Detzner%27s%20works">below</a>.)

In a speech at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner claimed that the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian domination and resisted a military recruitment that amounted to slavery, that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, transmitted from a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source, who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914–1915, received little attention.

In the scientific world, several of his descriptive passages generated excitement and curiosity. In early 1914, he had been surveying a portion of the international boundary in the Upper <a href="Waria%20River">Waria River</a> between the German and British protectorates. By late September, he had passed into a different portion of the highlands, where the clay-slate mountains changed into limestone highlands. In this geologic transition, he said, he also found a change in the ethnographic character of the population, whom he described as a "new" people. They were stocky, powerfully built, and long–limbed; they wore their hair in knots on the centre of their heads, which were otherwise shaven, and painted yellow and black lines across their chests. They also wore grass skirts, so he called them "the skirted ones". They used bows and arrows, slings and stone axes. As he pushed west to Mount Joseph, Detzner claimed, he had found the southern hills of the central watershed cut by numerous rivers flowing north to south. He had surmised that there were no insurmountable obstacles between him and the <a href="Sepik">Sepik</a> river. In 1917, he had travelled through the Ramu valley into the Bismarck range, northwest of the <a href="Kratke%20Mountains">Kratke Mountains</a>, and had continued on that route for . He also described the presence of an <a href="Unserdeutsch%20language">indigenous variation of German</a>, called "Unserdeutsch" (our German), in several New Guinean dialects. 

In 1919, after an account of Detzner's speech in Berlin to the Geographical Society was published in Australia, an angry Australian wrote anonymously to the editor of "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Australia%29">The Argus</a>", a Melbourne newspaper, and described what he claimed were Detzner's lies. "There was no mystery about the disappearance of Captain Detzner and his party", he claimed. The writer attributed Detzner's success at staying ahead of the Australians to the perfidy of the German missionaries, who had agreed to remain neutral and in return for such agreement were allowed to continue their mission work. Detzner was a "civilian" [emphasis in the original] surveyor, the writer claimed, not a soldier and he survived on mission station rations supplied by public subscription from the German plantation owners. Furthermore, this writer asserted, Detzner's movements were so well known to the district officer at Morobe that he was prevented from escaping; they could have shot him several times, but did not. The writer dismissed Detzner's claims about Australian recruitment of the natives as "in keeping with his dozens of other lying statements in all cases endeavoring to belittle Englishmen or British officers, in every case pure fabrications and typical scurrilous Hun lies".

While such criticism of Detzner's adventures might have been dismissed as post-bellum bellicosity, in 1929, Detzner's assertions came under more serious assault. Two of the German missionaries in the <a href="Finschhafen%20District">Finschhafen District</a>, <a href="Christian%20Keyser">Christian Keyser</a> (also spelled Kayser or Keysser) and Otto Thiele, claimed Detzner had not spent the war roaming the jungle, one step ahead of the Australians, but had been under the Mission's protection the entire time. Keyser's additional accusations were particularly specific: Detzner had appropriated his own scientific observations. Keyser's claims carried some weight. He had published a dictionary of the Kâte language, and was a reliable expert on New Guinean dialects, and the <a href="German-based%20creole%20languages">German-based creole languages</a> that had arisen in New Guinea; he was also a "bona fide" explorer and adventurer, having lived from 1899 to 1920 among the mountain peoples of the island. In 1913, Keyser climbed the <a href="Saruwaged%20Range">Saruwaged Massif</a>; over the course of his 21 years in New Guinea, he had identified hundreds of new plant and animal species, and had maintained a regular correspondence with the German Geographical Society in Berlin. <a href="Ernst%20Mayr">Ernst Mayr</a>, a rising star in ornithology, had heard about Detzner from Australians on a research trip to New Guinea. In Germany, during a meeting with Keyser, they discussed Detzner's claims, and Mayr lost no time in broadcasting the discrepancy to his scientific contacts in Europe and the United States.

More problematically, Detzner had no documentation of his findings. As he explained in his many speeches, although he had kept notebooks with drawings of plants, animals, maps, and people, and journals recounting his day–to–day experiences, some of his notebooks and journals had been destroyed by the Australians as they over–ran his hiding places; others, which he had buried to keep them from being destroyed, had rotted beyond repair in the jungle humidity. He implied that what remained of his notes had been confiscated when he surrendered. Detzner's narrative also was rife with contradictions and omissions: Detzner named few villages or streams and stated that the valleys he discovered were thinly populated, whereas they actually contained large populations, at least by New Guinea standards. He also stated that the highest point in the range was , a miscalculation, which, for a mapmaker and a surveyor, needed to be explained.

Detzner made attempts to explain away specific ambiguities, contradictions, and errors. In 1915, he said, he lost his surveying instruments while eluding an Australian patrol, which explained why many of his assertions were vague and inconclusive, and his calculations inaccurate. This was true, the Australians did find a box of Detzner's equipment in the location where the missionary Johann Flierl's oldest son, Wilhelm, had kept (or stored) his small canoe. Although Wilhelm denied helping Detzner and his men, the Australians arrested him. The event coincided with one of Detzner's narrow escapes from Australian patrols in 1915 and was inadvertently corroborated in 1919 by the angry letter to "The Argus's" editor. Some of Detzner's assertions could be sustained through observable physical evidence: he had reportedly wasted to a mere while roaming in the bush, which should not have happened, some supporters claimed, if he had indeed been under the protection of Keyser and Thiele. On the other hand, this weight loss could also have been due to his debilitating illness in 1917.

Despite his explanations, the missionaries Thiele and Keyser, whose own autobiography appeared in 1929, and the widely respected Mayr, who by this time had become the leader of the <a href="Whitney%20South%20Seas%20Expedition">Whitney South Seas Expedition</a>s, continued to challenge the bulk of Detzner's scientific "discoveries". Detzner's position became increasingly untenable. In 1932, he admitted that he had mixed fact and fiction in his book, explaining that he had never intended it to be taken as "science", but rather at its face-value, as the story of his adventurous years in the jungles of New Guinea. The following year, Detzner resigned from the prestigious Geographical Society of Berlin.
I wish to state that my book, "Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen", contains a number of misrepresentations regarding my journeys in New Guinea. The book in question is a scientific report in part only; it is primarily a fictional account of my experiences in New Guinea and owes its origin to the unusual circumstances prevailing in Germany at the time of my return. Some of the journeys I had actually undertaken are not described at all; on the other hand it contains passages that do not correspond with the facts.
After this, he withdrew entirely from public life, although he retained his position in the colonial archive. He lived in Schmargendorf, Berlin, on "Auguste-Viktoria-Straße", and later became the director of the Carl-Pfeffer Verlag, a publishing house in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>. He died there in 1970, at the age of 88.

The ambiguous wording of Detzner's resignation from the Geographical Society of Berlin—the use of such phrases as "contains misrepresentations", "scientific report in part only", "primarily fictional", "unusual circumstances in Germany", and so on—misled later scholars, many of whom remained unaware of the controversy surrounding his book. Consequently, his work continued to inform the geographical, linguistic, and anthropological investigations of New Guinean culture and geography well into the 1950s and 1960s, much to the dismay of Ernst Mayr, who had been instrumental in discrediting Detzner in the 1920s.

Since the mid–1970s, references to "Four Years Among the Cannibals" have continued to appear in studies on New Guinea. In the 1990s, Detzner's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays, who placed Detzner's work in its contemporary context: "Four Years Among the Cannibals", he wrote, "paved the way for me [to become an ethnographer] by creating romanticized images that served as a backdrop for more serious readings". Since then, geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions: "Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his wonderful story? The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him as one of the great figures in New Guinea history." Detzner had remained at large for four years, as a fugitive in enemy-held territory: surely, Linke concluded, this was an exceptional feat. No doubt the Australians could have made a more broadly organized attempt to capture him, and probably would have succeeded, but they did not make the effort; they preferred instead the more convenient "shoot-at-sight" method. "It is impossible", Linke wrote, "not to admire his [Detzner's] sheer "elan", his courage and tenacity." In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, reprinted, and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.

Leopold Report

The Leopold Report, officially known as Wildlife Management in the National Parks, is a 1963 paper composed of a series of <a href="ecosystem%20management">ecosystem management</a> recommendations that were presented by the Special Advisory Board on Wildlife Management to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a>. Named for its chairman and principal author, zoologist and conservationist <a href="A.%20Starker%20Leopold">A. Starker Leopold</a>, the report proved influential for future preservation mandates.

After several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the <a href="elk">elk</a> population in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, Udall appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future <a href="wildlife%20management">wildlife management</a> of the national parks. The committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended different management of Yellowstone's elk population. In addressing the goals, policies, and methods of managing wildlife in the parks, the report suggested that in addition to protection, wildlife populations should be managed and regulated to prevent habitat degradation. Touching upon predator control, <a href="fire%20ecology">fire ecology</a>, and other issues, the report suggested that the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> (NPS) hire scientists to manage the parks using current scientific research.

The Leopold Report became the first concrete plan to manage park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. It was reprinted in several national publications, and many of its recommendations were incorporated into the official policies of the NPS. Although the report is notable for proposing that park management have a fundamental goal of reflecting "the primitive scene ... a reasonable illusion of primitive America", some have criticized it for its idealism and limited scope.

<a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> was established by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> on March 1, 1872, as the first <a href="List%20of%20National%20Parks%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. national park</a>, and quickly became a popular tourist destination. At first, national parks were overseen by a variety of agencies and lacked bureaucratic support. In 1916, more than four decades after Yellowstone's founding, President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> signed a bill creating the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> (NPS), giving it the power "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." The NPS was tasked with both preservation and tourism, two divergent goals that would prove divisive during the resurgence of the <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a> in the 1940s and 1950s.

NPS managers became interested in attracting more tourists to Yellowstone during the 1910s and 1920s. Species such as elk and <a href="antelope">antelope</a> were considered a major attraction for park visitors, and an attempt was made to increase their numbers through winter feeding and predator control. The effort was successful, and the number of elk expanded significantly, but to the detriment of other wildlife such as <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>. Despite sporadic reductions of elk by hunters, the animals still posed a problem to the northern range ecosystems, mainly because of overgrazing. In the winter of 1961, park rangers responded to this dilemma by shooting and killing approximately 4,300 elk. This aggressive reduction by the Park Service caused a massive public outcry; network television and newspaper coverage of the culling resulted in public opposition and <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20hearing">congressional hearings</a>. The International Association of Game and Fish Commissioners protested the "slaughtering of elk by hired killers" rather than by sportsmen, and schoolchildren from across the country were inspired to write letters of condemnation. Facing public backlash, the NPS announced it would stop killing elk.

The controversy surrounding the reduction of elk in Yellowstone shed a negative light upon the NPS and their management of wildlife populations within the country's national parks. In response to what was deemed a "crisis in public relations", Secretary of the Interior <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a> assembled the Special Advisory Board on Wildlife Management in 1962 to conduct thorough studies to be conducted on its science and resource management. The purpose of the board was to collect scientific data and investigate the necessity of wildlife population control. Chairing the board was <a href="A.%20Starker%20Leopold">A. Starker Leopold</a>, the eldest son of noted conservationist <a href="Aldo%20Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a>. A respected zoologist, professor of ecology, and Assistant to the Chancellor at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>, Leopold was joined on the board by other prominent scientists and conservationists: Professor Stanley A. Cain of the Department of Conservation at the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a>; Ira N. Gabrielson, formerly of the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (FWS) and President of the Wildlife Management Institute; Thomas L. Kimball, executive director of the <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a>; and Clarence Cottam, former assistant director of the FWS and director of the Welder Wildlife Foundation.

The formation of the Advisory Board was historically important, as this was the first time an outside group was asked to evaluate wildlife programs within the NPS. The report was officially named "Wildlife Management in the National Parks" when it was first presented on March 4, 1963, but it became informally known as the "Leopold Report".
At the same time, a separate Advisory Board was formed by the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a> (NAS) to produce "A Report by the Advisory Committee to the National Park Service on Research". The NAS Report, more commonly known as the Robbins Report, was named after its primary author, biologist William J. Robbins. The Robbins Report was released on August 1, 1963, five months after the Leopold Report.

The report began by arguing that not only was it necessary to control the elk population in Yellowstone National Park, but direct reduction of elk was presented as the most suitable option. According to scientific findings, reduction programs at other national parks had not been implemented on a large enough scale; as a result, the Advisory Board recommended future reductions of animals should "be larger and in many cases repeated annually". The report also supported the concept of <a href="carrying%20capacity">carrying capacity</a>, and the idea that the elk population could be actively managed to restore its natural balance.

Although the Advisory Board recommendations focused on wildlife and habitat management, they also touched upon the recreation of primitive, uncontrolled conditions. Revisiting <a href="fire%20ecology">fire ecology</a> and the importance of fire, which had long been suppressed in national parks and other federal lands, the report recommended the use of <a href="Controlled%20burn">prescribed fire</a> as a cheap and natural tool for shaping the park environment.

<a href="Predator%20control">Predator control</a> was also reviewed, and deemed unnatural and unpopular. <a href="Hunting">Recreational hunting</a> was strongly opposed, but the report allowed for select members of the public to assist in the "sole purpose of animal removal". The main goal of the NPS, the report explained, was to preserve national parks primarily for the "aesthetic, spiritual, scientific and educational values they offered to the public".

The report strayed from arguments based on scientific data and veered into <a href="environmental%20philosophy">environmental philosophy</a>, concluding that national parks should serve a <a href="Historic%20preservation">historical purpose</a>. One of the most popular passages in the report is from the section "The Goal of Park Management in the United States"; here, the report alludes to recreating an unaltered landscape, a sentiment touching upon a national park ideal: "As a primary goal, we would recommend that the <a href="Biotic%20component">biotic</a> associations within each park be maintained, or where necessary recreated, as nearly as possible in the condition that prevailed when the area was first visited by the white man. A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America." It continues:

Restoring the primitive scene is not done easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches are not to be heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use of the parks is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.

Most importantly, the Leopold Report emphasized the need for scientific research and ecological management expertise in the national parks. Acknowledging the harm caused to nature by humans, the Advisory Board asked for the implementation of "a set of ecologic skills unknown in this country today". A call to arms was raised for exploring new methods of active protection and restoration of plant and animal life in the national parks: "Americans have shown a great capacity for degrading and fragmenting native biotas. So far we have not exercised much imagination or ingenuity in rebuilding damaged biotas. It will not be done by passive protection alone."

The report was first presented on March 4, 1963, and originally published in the "Transactions of the Twenty-Eighth North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference". <a href="Conrad%20L.%20Wirth">Conrad L. Wirth</a>, director of the NPS from 1951 to 1964, stated that the report reworded the Service's 1916 mandate into "modern language", using a scientific perspective to redefine the basic purpose of national parks. Secretary Udall supported the report and instructed the NPS to incorporate the findings into the agency's operations. In a memorandum dated May 2, 1963, he reiterated the purpose of the national park in the scope of the Leopold Report: "... a primary goal of park management is to maintain the biotic associations within each park as nearly as possible in that relationship which existed at a predetermined time period. The goal then is to create or maintain the mood of wild America."

The Advisory Board was reconstituted in part as a permanent Natural Sciences Advisory Board to the NPS. In 1964, Wirth's successor, <a href="George%20B.%20Hartzog%20Jr.">George B. Hartzog Jr.</a>, established the Division of Natural Science Studies, naming biologist George Sprugel Jr. the Service's chief scientist. The memorable idea of a "vignette of primitive America" drew popular attention from readers and the report received widespread publicity and praise amongst conservationists. It was reprinted in several national publications and was also noted in the "Sierra Club Bulletin". Leopold often said that had he known the report would be widely read and dissected, he probably would have written it more carefully.

The Leopold Report was the first concrete plan for managing park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. With an infusion of scientists and resource programs, it set into motion a series of ecologically positive legislative actions in the 1960s and into the 1970s. While direct management of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park continues to spark debate amongst scientists, the report nonetheless successfully influenced multiple areas of park management. Prior to the report's publication, California's <a href="Sequoia%20National%20Park">Sequoia National Park</a> was beset by a thick underbrush, which the report directly referred to as a "dog-hair thicket ... a direct function of overprotection from natural ground fires". This underbrush would have been naturally eradicated by lightning storms, but because of policies that supported <a href="History%20of%20wildfire%20suppression%20in%20the%20United%20States">wildfire suppression</a>, the growth threatened the park's Giant Sequoia trees. As a direct result of the report's advice regarding the usefulness of controlled burning, in 1964 the park began performing trial controlled burns, which led to a 1968 policy championing the continuation of burns for the betterment of the park's forest ecosystems. Fire ecologist Bruce Kilgore credited the Leopold Report as being a true catalyst for change, stating that it was the "document of greatest significance to National Park Service [fire] policy".
Although the Robbins Report did not receive the same recognition as the Leopold Report, it reached similar conclusions. However, unlike the Leopold Report, the Robbins Report criticized the NPS for its lack of scientific research and made recommendations for sweeping changes in the structure of the NPS, with a proposal for a strong focus on a science-based approach. In 1972, the far more detailed Cain Report was released; amounting to 207 pages in comparison to the Leopold Report's scant 28, its committee was chaired by Stanley A. Cain, who also worked on the Leopold Report. Although this report made similar recommendations to the one primarily written by Leopold, it stated that little had been done to advance the previous report's findings, especially in terms of predator control. As a result of the Cain Report's recommendations, President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> signed Executive Order 11643, which restricted the usage of poisons such as <a href="strychnine">strychnine</a> and <a href="sodium%20cyanide">sodium cyanide</a> for predator control.

The report's visionary goal for preservation has been both lauded and criticized. Author of the book "Searching for Yellowstone: Ecology and Wonder in the Last Wilderness", Paul Schullery, wrote of the report: "Scholars return to it for new interpretations and even inspiration regularly, speakers invoke it on all occasions, and it is trotted out to prove almost every perspective in debates about modern park management." On the other hand, Alston Chase, a vocal critic of the National Park Service, disapproved of the limited scope of the Leopold Report, arguing that it had "inadvertently replaced science with nostalgia, subverting the goal it had set out to support". The report's insistence to return parks to the condition that "prevailed when the area was first visited by the white man" has also been criticized for ignoring the Native Americans' historical presence in the area. Historian and author Philip Burnham in particular stated in his 2000 book, "Indian Country, God's Country: Native Americans and the National Parks", that although Leopold "et al." were more progressive than their predecessors, they "still dismissed native people as passive onlookers".

Akutan Zero

The Akutan Zero, also known as Koga's Zero and the Aleutian Zero, was a type 0 model 21 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> Japanese <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> that <a href="Emergency%20landing">crash-landed</a> on <a href="Akutan%20Island">Akutan Island</a>, <a href="Territory%20of%20Alaska">Alaska Territory</a>, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It was found intact by the Americans in July 1942 and became the first flyable Zero acquired by the United States during the war. It was repaired and flown by American test pilots. As a result of information gained from these tests, American tacticians were able to devise ways to defeat the Zero, which was the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>'s primary fighter plane throughout the war.

The Akutan Zero has been described as "a prize almost beyond value to the United States", and "probably one of the greatest prizes of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>". Japanese historian <a href="Masatake%20Okumiya">Masatake Okumiya</a> stated that the acquisition of the Akutan Zero "was no less serious" than the Japanese defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>, and that it "did much to hasten <a href="Japan">Japan</a>'s final defeat". On the other hand, John Lundstrom is among those who challenge "the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane".

The Akutan Zero was destroyed in a training accident in 1945. Parts of it are preserved in several museums in the United States.

The <a href="Second%20Sino-Japanese%20War">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> began in 1937. Attacks by Chinese fighter planes on Japanese bombers led the Japanese to develop the concept of <a href="escort%20fighter">fighter escorts</a>. The limited range of the <a href="Mitsubishi%20A5M">Mitsubishi A5M</a> "Claude" fighter used to escort the bombers caused the Japanese Navy Air staff to commission the Mitsubishi A6M Zero as a long-range land- and carrier-based fighter.

The Zero, which first flew in 1939, was exceedingly agile and lightweight, with maneuverability and range superior to any other fighter in the world at that time. The Zero was superior to any Allied fighter it encountered for the first two years of the war. To achieve this, however, Japanese engineers had traded off durability. The Zero was very lightly built; it had no armor and no <a href="self-sealing%20fuel%20tank">self-sealing fuel tank</a>s. According to American author <a href="Jim%20Rearden">Jim Rearden</a>, "The Zero was probably the easiest fighter of any in World War II to bring down when hit ... The Japanese ... were not prepared to or weren't capable of building more advanced fighters in the numbers needed to cope with increasing numbers and quality of American fighters". The Zero was the primary Japanese Navy fighter throughout the war. During the war, the Japanese manufactured roughly 10,500 Zeros.

In 1940 <a href="Claire%20Lee%20Chennault">Claire Lee Chennault</a>, leader of the <a href="Flying%20Tigers">Flying Tigers</a>, wrote a report on the Zero's performance. However, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">United States Department of War</a> analysts rejected it as "arrant nonsense" and concluded the performance attributed to the Zero was an aerodynamic impossibility. According to American <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> <a href="William%20N.%20Leonard">William N. Leonard</a>, "In these early encounters and on our own we were learning the folly of dogfighting with the Zero".

Nine Zeros were shot down during the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. From these wrecks, the Allies learned that the Zero lacked armor and self-sealing fuel tanks, but little else about its capabilities. The Zero's flight performance characteristics—crucial to devising tactics and machinery to combat it—remained a mystery.

Prior to recovery of the Akutan Zero, technical information from three other downed Zeros was available to the Allies. One Zero (serial number 5349), piloted by <a href="Hajime%20Toyoshima">Hajime Toyoshima</a>, crashed on <a href="Melville%20Island%20%28Australia%29">Melville Island</a> in Australia following the <a href="bombing%20of%20Darwin">bombing of Darwin</a>. The Zero was heavily damaged, and Toyoshima became Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the Pacific war. Another Zero, piloted by Yoshimitsu Maeda, crashed near <a href="Cape%20Rodney">Cape Rodney</a>, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. The team sent to recover the plane erred when they chopped off the wings, severing the <a href="Spar%20%28aeronautics%29">wing spars</a> and rendering the hulk unflyable. The third came from China, where <a href="Gerhard%20Neumann">Gerhard Neumann</a> was able to reconstruct a working Zero. He used a partly intact Zero (serial number 3372) that had landed in Chinese territory, repaired with salvaged pieces from other downed Zeros. However, bad conditions and the long delivery time from China prevented Neumann's Zero from reaching the United States for testing until after the recovery of the Akutan Zero.

In June 1942, as part of the Japanese <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Midway operation</a>, the Japanese <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">attacked the Aleutian islands</a>, off the south coast of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>. A Japanese task force led by Admiral <a href="Kakuji%20Kakuta">Kakuji Kakuta</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Dutch%20Harbor">bombed Dutch Harbor</a> on <a href="Unalaska%20Island">Unalaska Island</a> twice, once on June 3 and again the following day.

Tadayoshi Koga, a 19-year-old flight <a href="Petty%20officer%2C%20first%20class">petty officer first class</a>, was launched from the Japanese aircraft carrier <a href="Japanese%20aircraft%20carrier%20Ry%C5%ABj%C5%8D">"Ryūjō"</a> as part of the June 4 raid. Koga was part of a three-plane section; his <a href="Wingman">wingmen</a> were Chief Petty Officer Makoto Endo and Petty Officer Tsuguo Shikada. Koga and his comrades attacked Dutch Harbor, shooting down an American <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">PBY-5A Catalina flying boat</a> piloted by Bud Mitchell and <a href="strafing">strafing</a> its survivors in the water. In the process, Koga's plane (serial number 4593) was damaged by small arms fire.

Tsuguo Shikada, one of Koga's wingmen, published an account in 1984 in which he claimed the damage to Koga's plane occurred while his section was making an attack against two American Catalinas anchored in the bay. This account omits any mention of shooting down Mitchell's PBY. Both American and Japanese records contradict his claims; there were no PBYs in the bay that day. However, his claims do match American records from the attack against Dutch Harbor the previous day (June 3). Rearden noted, "It seems likely that in the near half-century after the event Shikada's memory confused the raids of June 3 and June 4 ... It also seems likely that in his interview, Shikada employed <a href="Lacunar%20amnesia">selective memory</a> in not mentioning shooting down Mitchell's PBY and then machine-gunning the crew on the water".

It is not known who fired the shot that brought down Koga's plane, though numerous individuals have claimed credit. Photographic evidence strongly suggests it was hit by ground fire. Members of the <a href="206th%20Field%20Artillery%20Regiment">206th Coast Artillery Regiment</a>, which had both 3-inch anti-aircraft guns and .50 caliber machine guns in position defending Dutch Harbor, claimed credit, in addition to claims made by United States Navy ships that were present. Physical inspection of the plane revealed it was hit with <a href="small%20arms">small arms</a> fire — <a href="12%20mm%20caliber">.50 caliber</a> bullet holes and smaller, from both above and below.

The fatal shot severed the return oil line, and Koga's plane immediately began trailing oil. Koga reduced speed to keep the engine from seizing for as long as possible.

The plane's landing gear mired in the water and mud, causing the plane to flip upside down and skid to a stop. Although the aircraft survived the landing nearly intact, Petty Officer Koga died instantly on impact, probably from a <a href="Cervical%20fracture">broken neck</a> or a blunt-force blow to his head. Koga's wingmen, circling above, had orders to destroy any Zeros that crash-landed in enemy territory, but as they did not know if Koga was still alive, they could not bring themselves to strafe his plane. They decided to leave without firing on it. The Japanese submarine stationed off Akutan Island to pick up pilots searched for Koga in vain before being driven off by the destroyer <a href="USS%20Williamson%20%28DD-244%29">USS "Williamson"</a>.

The crash site, which was out of sight of standard flight lanes and not visible by ship, remained undetected and undisturbed for over a month. On July 10, 1942, an American PBY Catalina piloted by Lieutenant William "Bill" Thies spotted the wreckage. Thies's Catalina had been patrolling by <a href="dead%20reckoning">dead reckoning</a> and had become lost. On spotting the <a href="Shumagin%20Islands">Shumagin Islands</a>, he reoriented his plane and began to return to Dutch Harbor by the most direct course—over Akutan Island. Machinist Mate Albert Knack, who was the plane captain (note: the term "plane captain" in US Navy usage refers to an aircraft's assigned maintenance crew chief, not the pilot-in-command), spotted Koga's wreck. Thies's plane circled the crash site for several minutes, noted its position on the map, and returned to Dutch Harbor to report it. Thies persuaded his commanding officer, <a href="Paul%20Foley%20%28admiral%29">Paul Foley</a>, to let him return with a salvage team. The next day (July 11), the team flew out to inspect the wreck. Navy photographer's mate Arthur W. Bauman took pictures as they worked.

Thies's team extracted Koga's body from the plane by having Knack (the smallest crew member) crawl up inside the plane and cut his safety harness with a knife. They searched it for anything with intelligence value, and buried Koga in a shallow grave near the crash site. Thies returned with his team to Dutch Harbor, where he reported the plane as salvageable. The next day (July 12), a salvage team under Lieutenant Robert Kirmse was dispatched to Akutan. This team gave Koga a <a href="Christian%20burial">Christian burial</a> in a nearby knoll and set about recovering the plane, but the lack of heavy equipment (which they had been unable to unload after the delivery ship lost two anchors) meant their efforts failed. On July 15, a third recovery team was dispatched. This time, with proper heavy equipment, the team was able to free the Zero from the mud and hauled it overland to a nearby <a href="barge">barge</a>, without further damaging it. The Zero was taken to Dutch Harbor, turned right-side up, and cleaned.

The Akutan Zero was loaded into the and transported to Seattle, arriving on August 1. From there, it was transported by barge to <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20North%20Island">Naval Air Station North Island</a> near San Diego where repairs were carefully carried out. These repairs "consisted mostly of straightening the vertical stabilizer, rudder, wing tips, flaps, and canopy. The sheared-off landing struts needed more extensive work. The three-blade Sumitomo <a href="Propeller%20%28aeronautics%29">propeller</a> was dressed and re-used." The Zero's red "<a href="Flag%20of%20Japan">Hinomaru</a>" <a href="roundel">roundel</a> was repainted with the American blue circle-white star insignia. The whole time, the plane was kept under 24-hour <a href="military%20police">military police</a> guard in order to deter would-be souvenir hunters from damaging the plane. The Zero was fit to fly again on September 20.

Data from the captured Zero had been transmitted to the U.S. Navy's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Aeronautics">Bureau of Aeronautics</a> (BuAer) and <a href="Grumman">Grumman Aircraft</a>. After careful study, <a href="Leroy%20Grumman">Roy Grumman</a> decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except in range, without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new <a href="Grumman%20F6F%20Hellcat">F6F Hellcat</a> would compensate for the extra weight with additional power.

On September 20, 1942, two months after the Zero's capture, <a href="Lieutenant%20commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> Eddie R. Sanders took the Akutan Zero up for its first test flight. He made 24 test flights between September 20 and October 15. According to Sanders' report:

These flights covered performance tests such as we do on planes undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics ... immediately apparent was the fact that the <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s froze up at speeds above 200 <a href="Knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a> so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type <a href="carburetor">carburetor</a>. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.
In early 1943, the Zero was transferred from Naval Air Station North Island to <a href="Naval%20Support%20Facility%20Anacostia">Anacostia Naval Air Station</a>. The Navy wished to make use of the expertise of the <a href="National%20Advisory%20Committee%20for%20Aeronautics">NACA</a> <a href="Langley%20Research%20Center">Langley Research Center</a> in flight instrumentation, and it was flown to Langley on March 5, 1943 for the installation of the instrumentation. While there, it underwent aerodynamic tests in the <a href="Full-Scale%20Wind%20Tunnel">Full-Scale Wind Tunnel</a> under conditions of strict secrecy. This work included wake surveys to determine the drag of aircraft components; tunnel scale measurements of lift, drag, control effectiveness; and
sideslip tests.

After its return to the Navy, it was flight tested by <a href="Frederick%20M.%20Trapnell">Frederick M. Trapnell</a>, the Anacostia Naval Air Station director of flight testing. He flew the Akutan Zero in performance while Sanders simultaneously flew American planes performing identical maneuvers, simulating aerial combat. Following these, USN test pilot Lieutenant Melvin C. "Boogey" Hoffman conducted more dogfighting tests between himself flying the Akutan Zero and recently commissioned USN pilots flying newer Navy aircraft.

Later in 1943, the aircraft was displayed at Washington National Airport as a war prize. In 1944, it was recalled to North Island for use as a training plane for rookie pilots being sent to the Pacific. A model 52 Zero, captured during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guam%20%281944%29">liberation of Guam</a>, was later used as well.

Data and conclusions from these tests were published in "Informational Intelligence Summary 59", "Technical Aviation Intelligence Brief #3", "Tactical and Technical Trends #5" (published prior to the first test flight), and "Informational Intelligence Summary 85". These results tend to somewhat understate the Zero's capabilities.

Data from the captured aircraft were submitted to the BuAer and Grumman for study in 1942. The U.S. <a href="aircraft%20carrier">carrier</a>-borne fighter plane that succeeded the <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman F4F Wildcat</a>, the F6F, was tested in its first experimental mode as the XF6F-1 prototype with an under-powered <a href="Wright%20R-2600%20Twin%20Cyclone">Wright R-2600</a> "Twin Cyclone" 14-cylinder, two-row radial engine on 26 June 1942. Shortly before the XF6F-1's first flight, and based on combat accounts of encounters between the F4F Wildcat and A6M Zero, on 26 April 1942, BuAer directed Grumman to install the more powerful 18-cylinder <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20R-2800%20Double%20Wasp">Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp</a> radial engine — already powering Chance Vought's Corsair design since its beginnings in 1940 — in the second XF6F-1 prototype. Grumman complied by redesigning and strengthening the F6F airframe to incorporate the 2,000 hp (1,500 kW) R-2800-10 engine, driving a three-bladed <a href="Hamilton%20Standard">Hamilton Standard</a> propeller. With this combination Grumman estimated the XF6F-3's performance would increase by 25% over that of the XF6F-1. This first Double Wasp-equipped Hellcat airframe, bearing BuAer serial number 02982, first flew on 30 July 1942. The F6F-3 subtype had been designed with specific "Wildcat vs Zero" input from <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> veteran F4F pilots such as <a href="James%20H.%20Flatley">Jim Flatley</a> and <a href="John%20Thach">Jimmy Thach</a>, respectively, among several others, obtained during a meeting with Grumman Vice President <a href="Jake%20Swirbul">Jake Swirbul</a> at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> on 23 June 1942, with the first production F6F-3 making its first flight just over three months later, on October 3, 1942. While the captured Zero's tests did not drastically influence the Hellcat's design, they did give knowledge of the Zero's handling characteristics, including its limitations in rolling right and diving. That information, together with the improved capabilities of the Hellcat, were credited with helping American pilots "tip the balance in the Pacific". American aces <a href="Kenneth%20A.%20Walsh">Kenneth A. Walsh</a> and R. Robert Porter, among others, credited tactics derived from this knowledge with saving their lives. <a href="James%20Sargent%20Russell">James Sargent Russell</a>, who commanded the PBY Catalina squadron that discovered the Zero and later rose to the rank of <a href="admiral">admiral</a>, noted that Koga's Zero was "of tremendous historical significance." <a href="William%20N.%20Leonard">William N. Leonard</a> concurred, describing it thus: "The captured Zero was a treasure. To my knowledge, no other captured machine has ever unlocked so many secrets at a time when the need was so great."

Some historians dispute the degree to which the Akutan Zero influenced the outcome of the air war in the Pacific. For example, the <a href="Thach%20Weave">Thach Weave</a>, a tactic created by John Thach and used with great success by American airmen against the Zero, was devised by Thach prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, based on intelligence reports on the Zero's performance in China.

The capture and flight tests of Koga's Zero is usually described as a tremendous coup for the Allies as it revealed the secrets of that mysterious aircraft and led directly to its downfall. According to this viewpoint, only then did Allied pilots learn how to deal with their nimble opponents. The Japanese could not agree more ... Yet those naval pilots who fought the Zero at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Midway</a>, and <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal</a> without the benefit of test reports would beg to differ with the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane. To them the Zero did not long remain a mystery plane. Word quickly circulated among the combat pilots as to its particular attributes. Indeed on 6 October while testing the Zero, Akutan Zero test pilot Frederick M. Trapnell made a highly revealing statement: 'The general impression of the airplane is exactly as originally created by intelligence—including the performance'.

However, nine wrecked <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a>s were recovered from <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> shortly after the attack in December 1941, and United States <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Intelligence">Office of Naval Intelligence</a>, along with BuAer had them studied, and then shipped to the Experimental Engineering Department at <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a> in 1942. It was noted that the "experimental" Grumman XF6F-1s then under-going testing in June 1942 and the Zero had "wings integrated with the fuselage," a design feature not normally practiced in American aircraft production at that time.

The Akutan Zero was destroyed during a training accident in February 1945. While the Zero was taxiing for a take-off, a <a href="Curtiss%20SB2C%20Helldiver">Curtiss SB2C Helldiver</a> lost control and rammed into it. The Helldiver's propeller sliced the Zero into pieces. From the wreckage, William N. Leonard salvaged several gauges, which he donated to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Navy">National Museum of the United States Navy</a>. The Alaska Heritage Museum and the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian</a> <a href="National%20Air%20and%20Space%20Museum">National Air and Space Museum</a> also have small pieces of the Zero.
American author Jim Rearden led a search on Akutan in 1988 in an attempt to repatriate Koga's body. He located Koga's grave, but found it empty. Rearden and Japanese businessman Minoru Kawamoto conducted a records search. They found that Koga's body had been <a href="Burial%23Exhumation">exhumed</a> by an American <a href="Mortuary%20Affairs">Graves Registration Service</a> team in 1947, and re-buried on <a href="Adak%20Island">Adak Island</a>, further down the Aleutian chain. The team, unaware of Koga's identity, marked his body as unidentified. The Adak cemetery was excavated in 1953, and 236 bodies were returned to Japan. The body buried next to Koga (Shigeyoshi Shindo) was one of 13 identified; the remaining 223 unidentified remains were re-interred in <a href="Chidorigafuchi%20National%20Cemetery">Chidorigafuchi National Cemetery</a> in Japan. It is probable that Koga was one of them. Rearden later wrote the definitive account of the Akutan Zero.

Famous Fantastic Mysteries

Famous Fantastic Mysteries was an American <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="fantasy%20literature">fantasy</a> <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published from 1939 to 1953. The editor was <a href="Mary%20Gnaedinger">Mary Gnaedinger</a>. It was launched by the <a href="Frank%20Munsey">Munsey Company</a> as a way to reprint the many science fiction and fantasy stories which had appeared over the preceding decades in Munsey magazines such as "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>". From its first issue, dated September/October 1939, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" was an immediate success. Less than a year later, a companion magazine, "<a href="Fantastic%20Novels">Fantastic Novels</a>", was launched.

Frequently reprinted authors included <a href="George%20Allan%20England">George Allan England</a>, <a href="A.%20Merritt">A. Merritt</a>, and <a href="Austin%20Hall%20%28writer%29">Austin Hall</a>; the artwork was also a major reason for the success of the magazine, with artists such as <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20Sterne%20Stevens">Lawrence Stevens</a> contributing some of their best work. In late 1942, <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a> acquired the title from Munsey, and "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" stopped reprinting short stories from the earlier magazines. It continued to reprint longer works, including titles by <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, and <a href="H.%20Rider%20Haggard">H. Rider Haggard</a>. Original short fiction also began to appear, including <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "Guardian Angel", which would later form the first section of his novel "<a href="Childhood%27s%20End">Childhood's End</a>". In 1951, the publishers experimented briefly with a large <a href="Digest%20size">digest format</a>, but returned quickly to the original pulp layout. The magazine ceased publication in 1953, almost at the end of the pulp era.

By the early decades of the 20th century, science fiction (sf) stories were frequently seen in popular magazines. The <a href="Frank%20A.%20Munsey%20Company">Munsey Company</a>, a major <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> publisher, printed a great deal of science fiction in these years, but it was not until 1926 that "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", the first pulp magazine specializing in science fiction appeared. Munsey continued to print sf in "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>" during the 1930s, including stories such as <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s "The War of the Purple Gas" and <a href="Arthur%20Leo%20Zagat">Arthur Leo Zagat</a>'s "Tomorrow", though they owned no magazines that specialized in science fiction. By the end of the 1930s science fiction was a growing market, with several new sf magazines launched in 1939. That year Munsey took advantage of science fiction's growing popularity by launching "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" as a vehicle for reprinting the most popular fantasy and sf stories from the Munsey magazines.

The first issue was dated September/October 1939, and was edited by Mary Gnaedinger. The magazine immediately became successful and went to a monthly schedule starting in November 1939. Demand for reprints of old favorites was so strong that Munsey decided to launch an additional magazine, "<a href="Fantastic%20Novels">Fantastic Novels</a>", in July 1940. The two magazines were placed on alternating bimonthly schedules, but when "Fantastic Novels" ceased publication in early 1941 "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" remained bimonthly until June 1942. Munsey sold "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" to <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, a major pulp publisher, at the end of 1942; it appears to have been a sudden decision, since the editorial in the December 1942 issue discusses a planned February issue that never materialized, and mentions forthcoming reprints that did not appear. The first issue from Popular appeared in March 1943, and only two more issues appeared that year; the September 1943 issue marked the beginning of a regular quarterly schedule. It returned to a bimonthly schedule in 1946 which it maintained with only slight deviations until the end of its run.

In 1949, <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines: the pulp era was drawing to a close. Popular Publications was the biggest pulp publisher, which helped their titles last a little longer, but "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" finally ceased publication in 1953, only a couple of years before the last of the pulps ceased publication.

Munsey's plan for the magazines was laid out in a note that appeared in the first four issues: "This magazine is the answer to thousands of requests we have received over a period of years, demanding a second look at famous fantasies which, since their original publication, have become accepted classics. Our choice has been dictated by "your" requests and our firm belief that these are the aces of imaginative fiction." The first issue included Ray Cummings' "The Girl in the Golden Atom" and A. Merritt's "The Moon Pool", both popular stories by well-known authors. Merritt's sequel, "The Conquest of the Moon Pool", began serialization in the next issue, with illustrations by <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a>. Finlay did many illustrations for "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" over its lifetime, and became one of its most popular artists. <a href="Frank%20R.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a> began illustrating for the magazine with the third issue; he was not as capable an artist as Finlay but was very popular with the readers. The first five covers were simply tables of contents, but with the sixth issue, dated March 1940, pictorial covers began, with Finlay the artist for that first cover. Three early covers in 1940 were painted by Paul, but thereafter almost every cover was painted by either Finlay, <a href="Lawrence%20Stevens%20%28artist%29">Lawrence Stevens</a>, or his son, <a href="Peter%20Stevens%20%28artist%29">Peter Stevens</a>, including every single issue from February 1941 through April 1950. The high quality of the artwork helped make the magazine one of the most popular of its day, and sf historian Thomas Clareson has suggested that it was Finlay's work in "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" and "Fantastic Novels" that made his reputation.

The decision to launch "Fantastic Novels" was taken partly because there were a great many book-length works that readers wanted to see reprinted. Gnaedinger commented that "Everyone seems to have realized that although [the] set-up of five to seven stories with two serials running, was highly satisfactory, that the long list of novels would have to be speeded up somehow". When "Fantastic Novels" was launched, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" was partway through serialization of "The Blind Spot", by <a href="Austin%20Hall%20%28writer%29">Austin Hall</a> and <a href="Homer%20Eon%20Flint">Homer Eon Flint</a>, with the third episode appearing in the May/June 1940 issue. Rather than complete the serialization, Gnaedinger decided to print the novel in its entirety in the first issue of "Fantastic Novels", ensuring that readers of "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" would also acquire the new magazine. After "Fantastic Novels" ceased publication in 1941, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" changed its policy, and began publishing a complete novel in every issue, rather than several stories and one or two serials running concurrently. Usually there were also short stories, but occasionally a particularly long novel would appear alone in the issue: this happened, for example, with the February 1942 issue, which contained <a href="Francis%20Stevens">Francis Stevens</a>' "The Citadel of Fear", and no other fiction.

When Munsey sold "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" to Popular, the editorial policy changed again, to exclude reprints of short fiction that had previously appeared in magazine form. Book length fiction continued to be reprinted, as did some shorter works that had appeared only in books, such as <a href="William%20Hope%20Hodgson">William Hope Hodgson</a>'s "The Derelict", and <a href="Robert%20W.%20Chambers">Robert W. Chambers</a>' "The Mask", both of which appeared in the December 1943 issue. The reprinted novels included <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Was%20Thursday">The Man Who Was Thursday</a>", <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' "<a href="The%20Island%20of%20Dr.%20Moreau">The Island of Dr. Moreau</a>", <a href="H.%20Rider%20Haggard">H. Rider Haggard</a>'s "The Ancient Allan", and works by <a href="Algernon%20Blackwood">Algernon Blackwood</a>, <a href="Lord%20Dunsany">Lord Dunsany</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20Machen">Arthur Machen</a>. Some of the reprinted material was abridged, but despite this, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" did an important service to its readers by making works available that had been long out of print, and which in some cases had only been previously published in the U.K., making their appearance in the magazine the first chance many subscribers have had to read them.

Some original material also appeared after Popular acquired the magazine. Contributors who published original stories in "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" included <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a>, <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, and <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C. L. Moore</a>. <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s story "Guardian Angel" appeared in the April 1950 issue; it was later turned into the first section of his novel "<a href="Childhood%27s%20End">Childhood's End</a>".

Mary Gnaedinger was the editor of "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" for all 81 issues. The magazine was launched as a bimonthly in September 1939, and was converted to monthly from the second issue, in November 1939. The May 1940 issue was followed by August 1940, which began a bimonthly sequence that lasted until June 1942, which began another monthly sequence that ran through the end of 1942. The next issue, March 1943, was followed by a September issue that inaugurated a quarterly sequence that ran until December 1945, which began another bimonthly run. This lasted until the final issue in June 1953 with only two irregularities: October 1950 was followed by January 1951, and July 1951 was followed by October 1951. "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" was published by the Munsey Corporation until the end of 1942, and by Popular Publications, thereafter. The magazine was initially 128 pages long. This was cut to 112 pages with the October 1940 issue, and then returned to 128 pages for the June 1941 issue. From June 1942 to March 1944 the page count was 144; it was cut to 132 in June 1944 and again to 112 in January 1951, where it remained until the end of the run. The price was 15 cents throughout, except for the period from October 1940 to April 1941 during which it was 10 cents. "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" began as a pulp, and remained in that format throughout its run except for a brief experiment in 1951 in which it was reduced to large digest size.

A Canadian reprint edition, with identical contents and dates, began in February 1948, from All Fiction Field, Inc.; in October 1951 the publisher became Popular Publications, Toronto, but this was just a name change rather than a change of ownership. The final Canadian issue was dated August 1952; these issues were half an inch longer than the U.S. versions. In addition, the Canadian edition of "<a href="Super%20Science%20Stories">Super Science Stories</a>", which had initially reprinted from its U.S. namesake and from the U.S. edition of "<a href="Astonishing%20Stories">Astonishing Stories</a>", began to reprint almost entirely from "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" beginning with the August 1944 Canadian issue. As a nod to the change in source material, the title of the Canadian edition was changed to "Super Science and Fantastic Stories" starting with the December 1944 issue. A Mexican magazine, "Los Cuentos Fantasticos", which published 44 issues between 1948 and 1953, reprinted stories from both "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" and "Astounding Science Fiction", mostly (though not entirely) without obtaining permission first.

An anthology, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries: 30 Great Tales of Fantasy and Horror from the Classic Pulp Magazines Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Fantastic Novels", appeared in 1991, edited by Stefan R. Dziemianowicz, Robert E. Weinberg and <a href="Martin%20H.%20Greenberg">Martin H. Greenberg</a>, and drawing almost all of its contents from "Famous Fantastic Mysteries".

Nikita Zotov

Count Nikita Moiseevich Zotov () (1644 – December 1717) was a childhood tutor and lifelong friend of Russian <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a> <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter the Great</a>. Historians disagree on the quality of Zotov's tutoring. <a href="Robert%20K.%20Massie">Robert K. Massie</a>, for example, praises his efforts, but <a href="Lindsey%20Hughes">Lindsey Hughes</a> criticizes the education that he gave to the future tsar.

Not much is known about Zotov's life aside from his connection to Peter. Zotov left Moscow for a diplomatic mission to <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> in 1680 and returned to Moscow before 1683. He became part of the "Jolly Company", a group of several dozen of Peter's friends that eventually became <a href="The%20All-Joking%2C%20All-Drunken%20Synod%20of%20Fools%20and%20Jesters">The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters</a>. Zotov was mockingly appointed "Prince-Pope" of the Synod, and regularly led them in games and celebrations. He accompanied Peter on many important occasions, such as the <a href="Azov%20campaigns">Azov campaigns</a> and the torture of the <a href="Streltsy">Streltsy</a> after their <a href="Streltsy%20Uprising">uprising</a>. Zotov held a number of state posts, including from 1701 a leading position in the Tsar's personal secretariat. Three years before his death, Zotov married a woman 50 years his junior. He died in December 1717 of unknown causes.

<a href="Alexis%20of%20Russia">Alexis I</a>, <a href="Tsar%23Russia">Tsar of Russia</a>, married twice in his lifetime, first to <a href="Maria%20Miloslavskaya">Maria Miloslavskaya</a> and then to <a href="Natalia%20Naryshkina">Natalia Naryshkina</a> after Maria's death. Peter I was born to Natalia Naryshkina on 30 May 1672. After the death of Tsar Alexis on 8 February 1676, Peter's <a href="half-brother">half-brother</a> and <a href="Godparent">godfather</a> <a href="Feodor%20III%20of%20Russia">Feodor</a>, the "semi-invalid eldest surviving son of <a href="Maria%20Miloslavskaya">Maria Miloslavskaya</a>", became the Tsar of Russia. <a href="Ivan%20Miloslavsky">Ivan Miloslavsky</a>, Feodor's uncle, returned to Moscow from virtual exile as Governor of <a href="Astrakhan">Astrakhan</a> to become Chief Minister. His family had not been in power for some time as a result of Tsar Alexis' remarriage. As a result, Ivan Miloslavsky hated the Naryshkin family, which included Peter, Natalia Naryshkina, and Natalia's foster father, <a href="Artamon%20Matveyev">Artamon Matveyev</a>. When a new ruling family took over, the previous ruling family was usually banished to a ceremonial position somewhere far from Moscow. Instead, Ivan Miloslavsky tried to arrest the Naryshkins, but Feodor would only permit him to exile Artamon Matveyev. Feodor was fond of his half-brother Peter and Peter's mother, and both were allowed to remain in the <a href="Kremlin">Kremlin</a> in private apartments.

Most 17th-century <a href="Moscow">Muscovites</a> received little education, and there were low levels of literacy even among the nobility, education for whom typically consisted of a little reading, writing, and a small amount of history and geography. Religious scholars were usually the exception to this rule and were often also taught grammar, mathematics, and foreign languages. Two of Tsar Alexis' children—Feodor, and his sister <a href="Tsarevna%20Sophia%20Alekseyevna%20of%20Russia">Tsarevna Sophia</a>—received a thorough education from the religious scholars of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>, and could speak <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>.

At the age of three, in 1674 or 1675, Peter received a <a href="Alphabet%20book">primer</a> from Tsar Alexis to help him learn the alphabet; two years later, Tsar Feodor suggested to Peter's mother that he begin his studies. Estimates of the exact year when Peter's tutoring began range widely; numerous authors refer to a starting date as early as 1677, and as late as 1683, though multiple references specifically identify 12 March 1677 as the beginning of Peter's tutoring. Nikita Zotov, a former church clerk, or "Duma secretary" from the tax-collection department of the governmental bureaucracy, was chosen to teach Peter to read and write.

Zotov was not a religious scholar, but he knew the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> well—an important qualification for <a href="Natalia%20Naryshkina">Tsaritsa Natalia</a>. Although he did not expect it, he was well rewarded before he had even started his work, receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa, as well as <a href="Patriarch%20Joachim%20of%20Moscow">Patriarch Joachim</a>, gifts including a set of apartments, two new sets of clothing, and 100 <a href="ruble">ruble</a>s. He was also raised to the rank of a <a href="Russian%20nobility">minor nobleman</a>. Zotov was deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the Tsaritsa's request, and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter. Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends, and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former's death.

Peter's first lesson began the morning after Zotov was appointed. After the books were sprinkled with <a href="holy%20water">holy water</a>, Zotov began his instruction; first in the alphabet, and then the Prayer Book. He taught the Bible, from which Peter learned long passages that he could still recite from memory forty years later. Zotov also taught his student to sing, and in his later years Peter often spontaneously accompanied choirs at church services. Although initially tasked only to teach reading and writing, Zotov found Peter to be intellectually curious, and interested in all that he could impart. Peter asked for lessons on Russian history, battles, and heroes. At Zotov's request, the Tsaritsa ordered engravings of "foreign cities and palaces, sailing ships, weapons and historical events" to be brought from the Ordnance Office. Zotov placed them in the study room, along with a somewhat accurate <a href="globe">globe</a> for the time, to divert Peter when he became bored with his studies. Other informal "makeshift" tutors (foreign and domestic) and servants, were brought in for rowdy outdoor games with live ammunition. They were also to instruct Peter in other subjects such as royal and military history, <a href="blacksmithing">blacksmithing</a>, carpentry, <a href="Woodworking%20joints">joinery</a>, printing, and, unusually for Russian nobility at the time, sailing and shipbuilding.

Zotov became one of Peter's first friends, and the two remained close throughout Zotov's life. <a href="Lindsey%20Hughes">Lindsey Hughes</a>, a 20th-century historian, has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar ought to know. Her contemporary, <a href="Robert%20K.%20Massie">Robert K. Massie</a>, has argued that the education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar, as his half-brother, <a href="Ivan%20V%20of%20Russia">Ivan V</a>, was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered "the best education for a mind like Peter's", as it "stimulated [Peter's] curiosity" and allowed him to become "in large part, a self-taught man". Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source of worry to others in government, many of whom—including even the powerful <a href="Aleksandr%20Danilovich%20Menshikov">Menshikov</a>—feared his influence.

In 1680, Zotov embarked on a three-year diplomatic mission to the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>; sources disagree on whether this was before or after he tutored Peter. When Peter left the <a href="Kremlin">Kremlin</a> to spend his childhood at <a href="Preobrazhenskoye%20District">Preobrazhenskoye</a>, two years after Zotov's departure, his memories of the tutors who had taught his siblings, Feodor and Sophia, were so negative that he cut himself off from traditional academic subjects for a time. He later resumed his studies under <a href="Afanassyi%20Nesterov">Afanassyi Nesterov</a> and Zotov after the latter's return from the Crimea. Although Peter sought to learn of nature and military matters rather than literature or theology, he nevertheless learned a great deal of the latter from his tutors. Zotov (and later his sons) later worked with Peter to translate books about <a href="fortification">fortification</a> from a Western European language into Russian. Peter did not learn, or forgot, a great deal about mathematics, a subject that he had to learn properly in his late teens for use in <a href="siege">siege warfare</a> and <a href="fortification">fortification</a>. In later years, Peter regretted his lack of a fuller education, and sought to give his daughters <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Anna%20Petrovna%20of%20Russia">Anne</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Russia">Elizabeth</a> educations equivalent of any European princess.
In 1692, Peter, who by then was Tsar of Russia, organized himself and several dozen of his friends into <a href="The%20All-Joking%2C%20All-Drunken%20Synod%20of%20Fools%20and%20Jesters">The All-Joking, All-Drunken Synod of Fools and Jesters</a>, a "<a href="synod">synod</a>" that parodied religion. Although he had a reputation for sobriety and fasting, Zotov was appointed the "Prince-Pope" of the Synod because of that very fact. He was sometimes even referred to as Patriarch <a href="Dionysus">Bacchus</a>. Peter forced him to participate in the parties even when Zotov claimed sickness and exhaustion.

However, Zotov soon grew to be a key participant in the mocking celebrations. After first drinking to everyone's health, he "blessed" the group with the <a href="Sign%20of%20the%20Cross">Sign of the Cross</a>, using two long Dutch pipes. On holidays, the games were played on the streets of Moscow, and at <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, the Jolly Company rode around the city singing on <a href="sleigh">sleigh</a>s, with Zotov at their head, on a sleigh pulled by twelve bald men. Zotov wore a highly unusual costume—his outfit was adorned with playing cards; he wore a tin hat; and he sat upon a barrel. During the first week of <a href="Lent">Lent</a>, a procession of "penitents" followed Zotov through the city on donkeys, oxen, and sleighs pulled by goats, pigs, and bears.

In 1695 and 1696, Peter the Great mounted <a href="Azov%20campaigns">two campaigns against the Turkish garrison of Azov</a>. Though the campaign in 1695 was ultimately unsuccessful, the 1696 one succeeded. The Russians surrounded the city with both men and ships and breached the wall, causing the <a href="Pasha">Pasha</a> of <a href="Azov">Azov</a> to "surrender under honorable conditions". The people of Moscow were amazed by the news of the surrender; not since the reign of Peter's father Alexis had a Russian army been victorious. Peter delayed his return home to allow <a href="Andrew%20Vinius">Andrew Vinius</a>, another member of the All-Joking Company, time to set up a <a href="victory%20parade">victory parade</a> through the capital. The army returned home on 10 October, but instead of a traditional Orthodox reception, the army marched through an <a href="arch">arch</a> seemingly supported by <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> and <a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars</a>. Contrary to the custom for a tsar, Peter did not ride at the head of the procession, but instead allowed it to be led by 18 horsemen leading carriages carrying Zotov and the war hero <a href="Fyodor%20Alexeyevich%20Golovin">Fedor Golovin</a>.

While on a <a href="Grand%20Embassy%20of%20Peter%20I">tour of Europe</a> in 1698, Peter learned that the <a href="Streltsy">Streltsy</a> had <a href="Streltsy%20Uprising">rebelled</a>, and immediately rushed home from Vienna. After defeating the rebellious regiments, Peter angrily ordered the torture of those who had incited the Streltsy to rebel. For almost a month and a half, men from Peter's Jolly Company, including <a href="Fyodor%20Romodanovsky">Fyodor Romodanovsky</a>, Boris Golitsyn, and Zotov, led the torture in secret.

In 1701, Zotov was made the head of the Tsar's newly created <a href="Privy%20council">Privy Council</a>, a committee akin to the defunct <a href="Duma">Duma</a>. In 1710, Peter made Zotov a <a href="count">count</a>, and a year later when Peter set up the <a href="Governing%20Senate">Governing Senate</a>, he appointed Zotov to oversee the Senate.

Nikita Zotov was twice married, and had three sons from his first marriage. One was <a href="Vasily%20Zotov">Vasily Zotov</a> (d. 1729), who was educated outside of Russia and became the Revisor-General of "Ukazes" (Inspector General of Decrees) in November 1715. As Inspector General, it was Vasily's job to preside over the Senate, enforce its decrees, and report absent senators to Peter. Vasily had little political power however, and so was unable to fulfill his role in opposition to the wishes of some of the most powerful men in the Russian empire. The second son was <a href="Ivan%20Zotov">Ivan Zotov</a> (1687–1723), who lived and studied in France, where he worked as a translator. The third son, <a href="Konon%20Zotov">Konon Zotov</a> (1690–30 December 1742), studied in England, and served in various positions in the Russian Navy and in the Russian judicial system.

According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he intended to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a <a href="monastery">monastery</a>. However, the "<a href="Brockhaus%20and%20Efron%20Encyclopedic%20Dictionary">Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary</a>" and <a href="Sergey%20Solovyov%20%28historian%29">Sergey Solovyov</a> say that Zotov came up with the idea to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.

The wedding was described by <a href="Friedrich%20Christian%20Weber">Friedrich Christian Weber</a>, the ambassador of <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, as "solemnized by the court in masks". Guests were instructed to pre-register in groups of three with their costumes so as not to look too similar to other guests. Witnesses described the event, which took place on 27 and 28 January 1715, and which had been prepared for three months, as a "world turned upside-down". The Jolly Company dressed in ridiculous regalia, and many people behaved exactly opposite to the norm; "invitations to the guests were delivered by stammerers, the bridesmen were cripples, the runners were fat men with gout, the priest was allegedly one hundred years old" (and blind). Hughes notes that the event may have been a "variation on the Western "<a href="charivari">charivari</a>" or shaming ceremonies", through which the Tsar could demonstrate how much power he had over his subjects' lives. During the wedding, the Drunken Synod routinely sang <a href="Carol%20%28music%29">carols</a> in the streets of Moscow and demanded money, which became a New Year tax for the wealthy.

Nikita Zotov died in December 1717 of unknown causes. Peter wasted no time in moving on, at least publicly; he replaced Zotov as "Prince-Pope" with <a href="Peter%20Buturlin">Peter Buturlin</a> by "electing" him on 28 December 1717, and appointing him on 10 January 1718. Peter even ordered that Zotov's widow be married to Buturlin in the fall of 1721. There was a disagreement between Konon Zotov and his stepmother over the division of Nikita Zotov's estate; Konon tried to declare Nikita's second marriage illegitimate, to avoid having to give any money to his stepmother's family.

Marjorie Cameron

Marjorie Cameron Parsons Kimmel (April 23, 1922 – June 24, 1995), who professionally used the <a href="mononym">mononym</a> Cameron, was an American artist, poet, actress, and <a href="occultist">occultist</a>. A follower of <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a>, the <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a> established by the English occultist <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, she was married to rocket pioneer and fellow Thelemite <a href="John%20Whiteside%20Parsons">Jack Parsons</a>.

Born in <a href="Belle%20Plaine%2C%20Iowa">Belle Plaine, Iowa</a>, Cameron volunteered for services in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, after which she settled in <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>. There she met Parsons, who believed her to be the "elemental" woman that he had invoked in the early stages of a series of <a href="sex%20magic">sex magic</a> rituals called the <a href="Babalon%20Working">Babalon Working</a>. They entered into a relationship and were married in 1946. Their relationship was often strained, although Parsons sparked her involvement in Thelema and occultism. After Parsons' death in an explosion at their home in 1952, Cameron came to suspect that her husband had been assassinated and began rituals to communicate with his spirit. Moving to <a href="Beaumont%2C%20California">Beaumont</a>, she established a multi-racial occult group called The Children, which dedicated itself to sex magical rituals with the intent of producing mixed-race "moon children" who would be devoted to the god <a href="Horus">Horus</a>. The group soon dissolved, largely because many of its members became concerned by Cameron's increasingly <a href="apocalypse">apocalyptic</a> predictions.

Returning to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Cameron befriended the socialite <a href="Samson%20De%20Brier">Samson De Brier</a> and established herself within the city's avant-garde artistic community. Among her friends were the filmmakers <a href="Curtis%20Harrington">Curtis Harrington</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Anger">Kenneth Anger</a>. She appeared in two of Harrington's films, "The Wormwood Star" and "<a href="Night%20Tide">Night Tide</a>", as well as in Anger's film "<a href="Inauguration%20of%20the%20Pleasure%20Dome">Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome</a>". In later years, she made appearances in art-house films created by <a href="John%20Chamberlain%20%28sculptor%29">John Chamberlain</a> and <a href="Chick%20Strand">Chick Strand</a>. Rarely remaining in one place for long, during the 1950s and 1960s she lived in <a href="Joshua%20Tree%2C%20California">Joshua Tree</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, and <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe</a>. In 1955, she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel. Although intermittent health problems prevented her from working, her art and poetry resulted in several exhibitions. From the late 1970s until her death from <a href="cancer">cancer</a> in 1995, Cameron lived in a bungalow in <a href="West%20Hollywood">West Hollywood</a>, where she raised her daughter and grandchildren, pursued her interests in esotericism, and produced artwork and poetry.

Cameron's recognition as an artist increased after her death, when her paintings made appearances in exhibitions across the U.S. As a result of increased attention on Parsons, Cameron's life also gained greater coverage in the early 2000s. In 2006, the Cameron–Parsons Foundation was created to preserve and promote her work, and in 2011 a biography of Cameron written by Spencer Kansa was published.

Cameron was born in <a href="Belle%20Plaine%2C%20Iowa">Belle Plaine, Iowa</a>, on April 23, 1922. Her father, railway worker Hill Leslie Cameron, was the adopted child of a Scots-Irish family; her mother, Carrie Cameron ("née" Ridenour), was of Dutch ancestry. She was their first child, and was followed by three siblings: James (b. 1923), Mary (b. 1927), and Robert (b. 1929). They lived on the wealthier north side of town, although life was nevertheless hard due to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Cameron attended Whittier Elementary School and Belle Plaine High School, where she did well at art, English, and drama but failed algebra, Latin, and civics lessons. She also participated in athletics, glee club, and chorus. Relating that one of her childhood friends had committed suicide and that she too had contemplated it, she characterized herself as a rebellious child, claiming that "I became the town pariah ... Nobody would let their kid near me". She had sexual relationships with various men; after Cameron became pregnant, her mother performed an illegal home <a href="abortion">abortion</a>. In 1940, the Cameron family relocated to <a href="Davenport%2C%20Iowa">Davenport</a> so Hill could work at the <a href="Rock%20Island%20Arsenal">Rock Island Arsenal</a> munitions factory. Cameron completed her final year of high school education at <a href="Davenport%20Central%20High%20School">Davenport High School</a>. Leaving school, she worked as a display artist in a local department store.

Following the United States' entry into the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Cameron signed up for the <a href="Women%20Accepted%20for%20Volunteer%20Emergency%20Service">Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service</a>, a part of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, in February 1943. Initially sent to a training camp at <a href="Iowa%20State%20Teachers%20College">Iowa State Teachers College</a> in <a href="Cedar%20Falls%2C%20Iowa">Cedar Falls</a>, she was subsequently posted to <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a>, where she served as a cartographer for the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. In the course of these duties, she met U.K. Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> in May 1943. She was reassigned to the Naval Photographic Unit in <a href="Anacostia">Anacostia</a>, where she worked as a <a href="Wardrobe%20supervisor">wardrobe mistress</a> for propaganda documentaries, and during this period met various <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> stars. When her brother James returned to the U.S. injured from service overseas, she went <a href="AWOL">AWOL</a> and returned to Iowa to see him, as a result of which she was <a href="Court-martial">court–martialed</a> and confined to barracks for the rest of the war. For reasons unknown to her, she received an honorable discharge from the military in 1945. To join her family, she traveled to <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>, where her father and brothers had found work at the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> (JPL).

In Pasadena, Cameron ran into a former colleague, who invited her to visit the large <a href="American%20Craftsman">American Craftsman</a>-style house where he was currently lodging, 1003 Orange Grove Avenue, also known as "The Parsonage". The house was so-called because its lease was owned by <a href="John%20Whiteside%20Parsons">Jack Parsons</a>, a rocket scientist who had been a founding member of the JPL and who was also a devout follower of <a href="Thelema">Thelema</a>, a <a href="new%20religious%20movement">new religious movement</a> founded by English occultist <a href="Aleister%20Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> in 1904. Parsons was the head of the Agape Lodge, a branch of the Thelemite <a href="Ordo%20Templi%20Orientis">Ordo Templi Orientis</a> (OTO). Unbeknownst to Cameron, Parsons had just finished a series of rituals using <a href="Enochian%20magic">Enochian magic</a> with his friend and lodger <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a>, all with the intent of attracting an "elemental" woman to be his lover. Upon encountering Cameron with her distinctive red hair and blue eyes, Parsons considered her to be the individual whom he had invoked. After they met at The Parsonage on January 18, 1946, they were instantly attracted to each other and spent the next two weeks in Parsons' bedroom together. Although Cameron was unaware of it, Parsons saw this as a form of <a href="sex%20magic">sex magic</a> that constituted part of the <a href="Babalon%20Working">Babalon Working</a>, a rite to invoke the birth of Thelemite goddess <a href="Babalon">Babalon</a> onto Earth in human form.

During a brief visit to New York City to see a friend, Cameron discovered that she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. Parsons meanwhile had founded a company with Hubbard and Hubbard's girlfriend <a href="Sara%20Northrup">Sara Northrup</a>, Allied Enterprises, into which he invested his life savings. It became apparent that Hubbard was a confidence trickster, who tried to flee with Parsons' money, resulting in the end of their friendship. Returning to Pasadena, Cameron consoled Parsons, painting a picture of Northrup with her legs severed below the knee. Parsons decided to sell The Parsonage, which was then demolished for redevelopment, and the couple moved to <a href="Manhattan%20Beach%2C%20California">Manhattan Beach</a>. On October 19, 1946, he and Cameron married at the <a href="San%20Juan%20Capistrano%2C%20California">San Juan Capistrano</a> courthouse in <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County</a>, in a service witnessed by his best friend Edward Forman. Having an aversion to all religion, Cameron initially took no interest in Parsons' Thelemite beliefs and occult practices, although he maintained that she had an important destiny, giving her the magical name of "Candida", often shortened to "Candy", which became her nickname.

In the winter of 1947, Cameron travelled from New York to Paris aboard the "SS America" with the intention of studying art at the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20de%20la%20Grande%20Chaumi%C3%A8re">Académie de la Grande Chaumière</a>, which she hoped would admit her with a letter of recommendation from Pasadena's <a href="Art%20Center%20College%20of%20Design">Art Center School</a>. She also wanted to visit England and meet with Crowley and explain to him Parsons' Babalon Working. Cameron learned upon her arrival in Paris that Crowley had died and that she had not been admitted to the college. She found post-war Paris "extreme and bleak", befriended <a href="Juliette%20Gr%C3%A9co">Juliette Gréco</a>, and spent three weeks in Switzerland before returning home. When Cameron developed <a href="catalepsy">catalepsy</a>, Parsons suggested that she read <a href="Sylvan%20Muldoon">Sylvan Muldoon</a>'s books on <a href="astral%20projection">astral projection</a> and encouraged her to read <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a>'s "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>", <a href="Heinrich%20Zimmer">Heinrich Zimmer</a>'s "The King and the Corpse", and <a href="Joseph%20Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hero%20with%20a%20Thousand%20Faces">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</a>". Although she still did not accept Thelema, she became increasingly interested in the occult, and in particular the use of the <a href="tarot">tarot</a>.

Parsons' and Cameron's relationship was deteriorating and they contemplated divorce. While Cameron visited the artistic commune at <a href="San%20Miguel%20de%20Allende">San Miguel de Allende</a> in Mexico and befriended the artist <a href="Renate%20Druks">Renate Druks</a>, Parsons moved into a house in <a href="Redondo%20Beach%2C%20California">Redondo Beach</a> and was involved in a brief relationship with an Irishwoman named Gladis Gohan before Cameron returned. By March 1951, Parsons and Cameron had moved to the coach house at 1071 South Orange Grove, while he began work at the Bermite Powder Company, constructing explosives for the film industry. They started holding parties once more that were attended largely by <a href="Bohemianism">bohemians</a> and members of the <a href="beat%20generation">beat generation</a>, and Cameron attended the jazz clubs of Central Avenue with her friend, the sculptor <a href="Julie%20Macdonald">Julie Macdonald</a>. Cameron produced illustrations for fashion magazines and sold some of her paintings, including some purchased by a friend, the artist <a href="Jirayr%20Zorthian">Jirayr Zorthian</a>. Parsons and Cameron had decided to travel to Mexico for a few months. On the day before they planned to leave—June 17, 1952—he received a rush order of explosives for a film set, and began work on the order at his house. In the midst of this project, an explosion destroyed the building, fatally wounding Parsons. He was rushed to hospital, but was declared dead. Cameron did not want to see his body and retreated to San Miguel, asking her friend George Frey to oversee the cremation.

While in Mexico, Cameron began performing blood rituals in the hope of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an <a href="unidentified%20flying%20object">unidentified flying object</a> had been seen over Washington D.C.'s <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">Capitol Building</a> she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe that the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or <a href="anti-Zionism">anti-zionists</a>, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.

Her mental stability was deteriorating, and she became convinced that a nuclear test on <a href="Eniwetok%20Atoll">Eniwetok Atoll</a> would result in the destruction of the California coast. There is inconclusive evidence that she was institutionalized in a psychiatric ward during this period, before having a brief affair with African-American jazz player <a href="Leroy%20Booth">Leroy Booth</a>, a relationship that would have been illegal at the time. At some point in this period, she stayed with the Thelemite <a href="Wilfred%20Talbot%20Smith">Wilfred Talbot Smith</a> and his wife, although he thought that she had "bats in the belfry" and ignored what he described as her "Mad Mental Meanderings".

In December 1952 Cameron moved to a derelict ranch in <a href="Beaumont%2C%20California">Beaumont</a>. With the aid of Druks and Paul Mathison, she gathered a loose clique of magical practitioners around herself which she called "The Children". Intentionally comprising members from various races, she oversaw a range of sex magic rituals with the intent of creating a breed of mixed-race "moonchildren" who would be devoted to <a href="Horus">Horus</a>. She became pregnant as a result of these rites, and termed her forthcoming child "the Wormwood Star", although the pregnancy ended in <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. Over time, many of Cameron's associates within The Children distanced themselves from her, in particular because of her increasingly apocalyptic pronouncements; she claimed that Mexico was about to conquer the U.S., that a <a href="race%20war">race war</a> was about to break out in the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a>, and that a comet would hit the Earth, and that a <a href="flying%20saucer">flying saucer</a> would rescue her and her followers and take them to <a href="Mars">Mars</a>. During her magical rituals she used a range of drugs, including <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a>, <a href="peyote">peyote</a>, and <a href="magic%20mushrooms">magic mushrooms</a>, and in June 1953 she visited Los Angeles to attend a <a href="Gerald%20Heard">Gerald Heard</a> lecture on the mind-expanding uses of hallucinogens. Perhaps because of her drug use, Cameron was suffering from auditory hallucinations, frequent bouts of depression, and dramatic mood swings. During this period, she corresponded with the Thelemite <a href="Jane%20Wolfe">Jane Wolfe</a>, although other Thelemites and Crowley associates such as <a href="Karl%20Germer">Karl Germer</a> and <a href="Gerald%20Yorke">Gerald Yorke</a> deemed her insane.

After using the Chinese <a href="divination">divination</a> text the "<a href="I%20Ching">I Ching</a>", Cameron returned to Los Angeles, moving in with Booth until the duo were arrested for illegal drug possession. Released on bail, she moved into Druks' Malibu home, and through her joined the avant-garde artistic circle surrounding the socialite <a href="Samson%20De%20Brier">Samson De Brier</a>. It was through this circle that Cameron met the Thelemite film maker <a href="Kenneth%20Anger">Kenneth Anger</a>, and after a party titled "Come As Your Madness" which was organised by Mathison and Druks, he decided to produce a film featuring Cameron and others in the group. The resulting film was "<a href="Inauguration%20of%20the%20Pleasure%20Dome">Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome</a>". After seeing the film, the English Thelemite <a href="Kenneth%20Grant">Kenneth Grant</a> wrote to Cameron hoping that she might move to England and join his London-based group, the New Isis Lodge; Cameron never responded.

Through common friends Cameron met Sheridan "Sherry" Kimmel, and the two entered a relationship. A veteran of the Second World War from <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, Kimmel suffered from <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>, often causing him severe mood swings. He developed an interest in occultism and became intensely jealous of Parsons' continuing influence over Cameron, destroying Parsons' notes on the Babalon Working that she had kept. Cameron again became pregnant, although was unsure who the father was; she gave birth to a daughter, Crystal Eve Kimmel, on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> 1955. She allowed her daughter to behave how she pleased, believing that that was the best way for to learn. With her friend, the film-maker <a href="Curtis%20Harrington">Curtis Harrington</a>, Cameron then produced a short film, "The Wormwood Star", which was filmed at the home of multi-millionaire art collector <a href="Edward%20James">Edward James</a>; the film features images of Cameron's paintings, and recitations of her poems.

In autumn 1956 Cameron's first exhibition was held, at <a href="Walter%20Hopp">Walter Hopp</a>'s studio in <a href="Brentwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Brentwood</a>; several paintings were destroyed when the gallery caught fire. Around this time, Cameron was introduced to the actor <a href="Dean%20Stockwell">Dean Stockwell</a> at a public recital of her poetry; he then introduced her to his friend and fellow actor <a href="Dennis%20Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a>. She was also an associate of the artist <a href="Wallace%20Berman">Wallace Berman</a>, who used a photograph of her on the front of the first volume of his art journal, "Semina". The volume also included Cameron's drawing, "Peyote Vision". This artwork was featured in Berman's 1957 exhibition at Los Angeles' Feris Gallery, which was raided and shut down by the police. Investigating officers claimed that "Peyote Vision", which featured two copulating figures, was pornographic and indecent, thus legitimising their actions.

In late 1957, Cameron moved to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> with her friends Norman Rose and David Metzer. There she mingled within the same bohemian social circles as many of the beat generation of artists and writers, and was a regular at avant-garde poetry readings. She began a relationship with the artist <a href="Burt%20Shonberg">Burt Shonberg</a>, and with him moved into a ranch outside of <a href="Joshua%20Tree%2C%20California">Joshua Tree</a>. Together they began exploring the subject of <a href="Ufology">Ufology</a>, and became friends with the ufologist <a href="George%20Van%20Tassel">George Van Tassel</a>. After Kimmel was released from a psychiatric ward, Cameron re-established her relationship with him, and in 1959 they were married in a civil ceremony at Santa Monica City Hall; their relationship was strained and they separated soon after.

In 1960, Cameron appeared alongside Hopper in Harrington's first full-length film, "<a href="Night%20Tide">Night Tide</a>". The film was a critical success and—despite not receiving a wide distribution—became a <a href="cult%20film">cult classic</a>. She was invited to appear in Harrington's next film, "<a href="Games%20%28film%29">Games</a>", although ultimately never did so. After Cameron moved to <a href="Venice%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Venice, Los Angeles</a>, a local arts shop exhibited her work in August 1961. On his return to the U.S. from Europe, Anger moved in with Cameron for a time, before the duo moved into a flat on Silverlake Boulevard in early 1964; Anger remained there before departing for New York City. According to Anger biographer Bill Landis, Cameron had become "a rather formidable maternal figure" in Anger's life. In October 1964, the Cinema Theatre in Los Angeles held an event known as The Transcendental Art of Cameron, which displayed her art and poetry and screened some of her films; Anger arrived and disrupted the event by objecting to the screening of "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" without his permission. He then launched a poster campaign, "The Cameron File", against his former friend, labelling her "Typhoid Mary of the Occult World". The pair later reconciled, Cameron visiting Anger in San Francisco, where he introduced her to <a href="Anton%20LaVey">Anton LaVey</a>, the founder of the <a href="Church%20of%20Satan">Church of Satan</a>. LaVey was delighted to meet her, having been a fan of "Night Tide".

In the latter part of the 1960s, Cameron and her daughter moved to the <a href="pueblos">pueblos</a> of <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>, where she developed a friendship with the sculptor <a href="John%20Chamberlain%20%28sculptor%29">John Chamberlain</a> and appeared in his art movie, "Thumb Suck", which was never released. It was also while in New Mexico that she suffered a <a href="collapsed%20lung">collapsed lung</a> and required hospitalization. Her health was poor, as she suffered from chronic bronchitis and <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a> (both of which were exacerbated by her chain smoking), while hand tremors prevented her from being able to paint for four years.
Returning to California, by 1969 she was living in the Pioneertown sector of Joshua Tree. From there she and her daughter moved to a small bungalow on North Genesee Avenue in the <a href="West%20Hollywood">West Hollywood</a> area of Los Angeles, which at the time had become impoverished and associated with crime, <a href="sex%20shop">sex stores</a>, and <a href="adult%20movie%20theatre">adult movie theatre</a>s; she remained there for the rest of her life.

By the mid-1980s, Cameron was focusing to a greater extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go <a href="Joyride%20%28crime%29">joyriding</a> in her jeep. Neighbors recall her playing a <a href="Celtic%20harp">Celtic harp</a> in her garden and slowly walking her dog around the block while smoking a joint of marijuana. At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home. Cameron became a regular practitioner of <a href="Tai%20chi">Tai chi</a>, took part in group sessions in <a href="Bronson%20Park">Bronson Park</a> under the tutelage of <a href="Marshall%20Ho%27o">Marshall Ho'o</a>, and earned a teaching certificate in the subject. She became very interested in <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Arg%C3%BCelles">José Argüelles</a>' "<a href="The%20Mayan%20Factor">The Mayan Factor</a>" and <a href="Charles%20Mus%C3%A8s">Charles Musès</a>' "<a href="The%20Lion%20Path">The Lion Path</a>", and undertook the <a href="Neoshamanism">Neo-shamanic</a> practices endorsed in the latter. She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist <a href="Marija%20Gimbutas">Marija Gimbutas</a> about a prehistoric <a href="matriarchy">matriarchal</a> society devoted to a goddess. Cameron was very interested in <a href="A.%20S.%20Raleigh">A. S. Raleigh</a>'s "<a href="Woman%20and%20Superwoman">Woman and Superwoman</a>", taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public radio for broadcast. Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.

As well as entertaining old friends who came to visit her in her home, Cameron also met with younger occultists, such as the Thelemite <a href="William%20Breeze">William Breeze</a> and the <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a>ian <a href="Genesis%20P-Orridge">Genesis P-Orridge</a>. Cameron aided Breeze in co-editing a collection of Parsons' occult and <a href="libertarianism">libertarian</a> writings, which were published as "Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword" in 1989. Cameron was acquainted with the experimental film-maker <a href="Chick%20Strand">Chick Strand</a> and appeared in the latter's 1979 project "Loose Ends", during which she narrated the story of an <a href="exorcism">exorcism</a>. In 1989, an exhibition of her work titled "The Pearl of Reprisal" was held at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Municipal%20Art%20Gallery">Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery</a>. It included a selection of her paintings and a screening of "Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome" and "The Wormwood Star", while Cameron attended to provide a candle-lit reading of her poetry. In the mid-1990s, Cameron was diagnosed with a <a href="brain%20tumor">brain tumor</a> and underwent <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> treatment, which she supplemented with <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative medicine</a>s. The tumor was <a href="cancer">cancer</a>ous and metastasized to her lungs. She died at the age of 73 in the <a href="VA%20Medical%20Center">VA Medical Center</a> on July 24, 1995, and underwent the Thelemic last rites, carried out by a high priestess of the Ordo Templi Orientis. Her body was <a href="cremation">cremated</a> and its ashes were scattered in the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. A memorial event was held at Venice's <a href="Beyond%20Baroque%20Literary%20Arts%20Center">Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center</a> in August.

Cameron preferred to be known by her surname as a mononym. According to historian of Thelema Martin P. Starr, Cameron's "very dominating personality could not brook rivals of any kind". The fashion writer <a href="Tim%20Blanks">Tim Blanks</a> noted that Cameron was "a charismatic woman" active in the mid-twentieth century "macho art world", and that it was not surprising how "alluring and dangerous" she must have seemed to Hopper and Stockwell.

Stockwell described Cameron as "a very, very intense personality, but very fascinating". Considering her to be "an out and out witch", Hopper described her as having an "infectious personality" through her presence; she was someone "that you knew [was] different and [she] had a magnetic quality that you wanted to be closer to".
The photographer <a href="Charles%20Brittin">Charles Brittin</a>, who knew Cameron on Los Angeles' artistic circuit, called her "a sweet person with a great personality, not the way some of her friends wanted to picture her to be". Her friend Shirley Berman described her as having "many different crowds of friends, and I think she was a different personality with each crowd ... She wasn't an even personality at all, but she was always a very gracious person."

The digital media theorist <a href="Peter%20Lunenfeld">Peter Lunenfeld</a> described Cameron as "one of those people for whom art was life and life was art", and thus an understanding of her life is needed to appreciate her work. Cameron's occult beliefs strongly affected her artworks. According to Priscilla Frank, writing for "<a href="The%20Huffington%20Post">The Huffington Post</a>", Cameron's artwork merges "Crowley's occult with the surrealism and symbolism of French poets, yielding dark yet whimsical depictions buzzing with otherworldly power". The art curator <a href="Philippe%20Vergne">Philippe Vergne</a> described her work as being on "the edge of surrealism and psychedelia", embodying "an aspect of modernity that deeply doubts and defies cartesian logic at a moment in history when these values have shown their own limitations".

Lunenfeld compared Cameron's black and white pen-and-ink drawings to those of the English artist <a href="Aubrey%20Beardsley">Aubrey Beardsley</a>, noting that she was capable of a "ferocious, paradoxical line work—simultaneously precise and seductively unrestrained—that functions as both figurative depiction and unabashed emotional talisman". He believed that both "passion and craft" could be seen in her draughtsmanship, but that it also displayed "a guilelessness that is hard to relate to in our post post-ironic moment". He also discussed her lost multi-coloured watercolour paintings that were featured in Harrington's "The Wormwood Star", suggesting that they were akin to a <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a> for an unrealised film by the director <a href="Alejandro%20Jodorowsky">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a>.

Cameron's biographer Spencer Kansa was of the opinion that Cameron exhibited parallels with the Australian artist and occultist <a href="Rosaleen%20Norton">Rosaleen Norton</a>, both in terms of her physical appearance and the similarities between their artistic styles. Harrington also saw similarities in the work of Cameron and the artists <a href="Leonora%20Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a> and <a href="Leonor%20Fini">Leonor Fini</a>. On the website of the Cameron–Parsons Foundation, Michael Duncan expressed the view that Cameron's work rivals that of "fellow surrealists" like Carrington, Fini, <a href="Remedios%20Varo">Remedios Varo</a>, and <a href="Ithell%20Colquhoun">Ithell Colquhoun</a>, while also appearing "fascinatingly prescient" of the works by later artists <a href="Kiki%20Smith">Kiki Smith</a>, <a href="Amy%20Cutler">Amy Cutler</a>, <a href="Karen%20Kilimmck">Karen Kilimmck</a>, and <a href="Hernan%20Bas">Hernan Bas</a>.
In later years, Cameron would often be erroneously labelled a <a href="Beat%20Generation">Beat artist</a> because she inhabited many of the same social circles as prominent Beat poets and writers. Rejecting this label, Kansa instead described Cameron as "a pre-Beat bohemian, whose heart lay in Romanticism".

Cameron's reputation as an artist grew after her death. In 2006, her friend Scott Hobbs established the Cameron–Parsons Foundation to serve as an archive storing and promoting her work. In 1995, her painting "Peyote Vision" was included as part of an exhibition on "Beat Culture and the New American" held at the <a href="Whitney%20Museum%20of%20American%20Art">Whitney Museum of American Art</a> in New York City. Some of her artworks were then exhibited alongside those of Crowley and other Thelemites for the 2001 exhibition "Reflections of a New Aeon", held at the Eleven Seven Gallery in California's <a href="Long%20Beach">Long Beach</a>. In 2007 a retrospective of Cameron's work was held at the Nicole Klagsbrun Gallery in New York City's Chelsea district, while that same year some of her works appeared in the traveling exhibition "Semina Culture", which was devoted to all of the artists who contributed to Wallace Berman's journal. In 2008, her painting "Dark Angel" was featured in the "Traces du Sacré" exhibit at the <a href="Centre%20Georges%20Pompidou">Centre Georges Pompidou</a> in Paris. In 2014, another retrospective, titled "Cameron: Songs for the Witch Woman", was held at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles</a>. That year, the U.K.-based publisher Fulgur Esoterica released a book featuring images of Cameron's artworks and Parsons' poems. In 2015, a retrospective of her work titled "Cameron: Cinderella of the Wastelands" was held at the <a href="Deitch%20Projects">Deitch Projects</a> in Soho, New York City, which included an evening in which friends of Cameron's assembled to publicly discuss her legacy. Cameron's aesthetic also influenced the fashion world, designers <a href="Pamela%20Skaist-Levy">Pamela Skaist-Levy</a> and <a href="Gela%20Nash-Taylor">Gela Nash-Taylor</a> acknowledging Cameron as a partial inspiration for their Skaist-Taylor label.

Cameron's life was brought to wider attention through the publication of two biographies about Parsons: John Carter's "Sex and Rockets" and George Pendle's "Strange Angel". A dramatization of Parsons' life was depicted in the play "Moonchild", performed at <a href="The%20Access%20Theatre">The Access Theatre</a> on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in 2004. Cameron was portrayed by Heather Tom. In 2011, "Wormwood Star", a biography of Cameron authored by the Briton Spencer Kansa, was published, though it was not authorized by the Cameron–Parsons Foundation. Kansa had spent almost three years in the U.S. researching the book, interviewing many of those who knew Cameron, including several who died shortly after. Kansa stated that most of those whom he interviewed "were immensely generous with their time and recollections" but that "one of Cameron's kookier friends" had begun making claims that Kansa was not a biographer but was really an agent of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>. Writing in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Review%20of%20Books">Los Angeles Review of Books</a>", Steffie Nelson noted that Kansa did "his due diligence tracking down Cameron's childhood acquaintances and friends" but at the same time was critical of the lack of sources or footnotes.

Astraeus hygrometricus

Astraeus hygrometricus, commonly known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Diplocystaceae">Diplocystaceae</a>. Young specimens resemble a <a href="puffball">puffball</a> when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic <a href="Earthstar%20fungus">earthstar</a> shape that is a result of the outer layer of <a href="fruit%20body">fruit body</a> tissue splitting open in a star-like manner. The false earthstar is an <a href="mycorrhizal">ectomycorrhizal</a> species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. "A. hygrometricus" was previously thought to have a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, though it is now thought to be restricted to Southern Europe, and "Astraeus" are common in temperate and tropical regions. Its <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s refer to the fact that it is <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The <a href="gleba">gleba</a> is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the <a href="spore">spore</a>s mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 <a href="micrometer">micrometer</a>s in diameter.

Despite a similar overall appearance, "A. hygrometricus" is not related to the true earthstars of genus "<a href="Geastrum">Geastrum</a>", although historically, they have been <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomically</a> confused. The species was first described by <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1801 as "Geastrum hygrometricus". In 1885, <a href="Andrew%20P.%20Morgan">Andrew P. Morgan</a> proposed that differences in microscopic characteristics warranted the creation of a new genus "<a href="Astraeus%20%28genus%29">Astraeus</a>" distinct from "Geastrum"; this opinion was not universally accepted by later authorities. Several Asian populations formerly thought to be "A. hygrometricus" were renamed in the 2000s once <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analyses revealed they were unique "Astraeus" species, including "<a href="Astraeus%20asiaticus">A. asiaticus</a>" and "<a href="Astraeus%20odoratus">A. odoratus</a>". Similarly, in 2013, North American populations were divided into "<a href="Astraeus%20pteridis">A. pteridis</a>", <a href="Astraeus%20morganii">"A. morganii"</a>, and <a href="Astraeus%20smithii">"A. smithii"</a> on the basis of molecular phylogentics. This research suggests that the type specimen of "Astraeus hygrometricus" originates in a population restricted to Europe between Southern France and Turkey, with <a href="Astraeus%20telleriae">A. telleriae</a> found nearby in Spain and Greece. Research has revealed the presence of several <a href="biological%20activity">bioactive</a> chemical compounds in "Astraeus" fruit bodies. North American field guides typically rate "A. hygrometricus" as inedible.

Because this species resembles the earthstar fungi of "Geastrum", it was placed in that genus by early authors, starting with <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1801 (as "Geaster", an alternate spelling of "Geastrum"). According to the American botanist <a href="Andrew%20P.%20Morgan">Andrew P. Morgan</a>, however, the species differed from those of "Geastrum" in not having open chambers in the young <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, having larger and branched capillitium threads, not having a true <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, and having larger spores. Accordingly, Morgan set Persoon's "Geaster hygrometricum" as the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of his new genus "Astraeus" in 1889. Despite Morgan's publication, some authorities in the following decades continued to classify the species in "Geastrum". The New-Zealand based mycologist <a href="Gordon%20Herriot%20Cunningham">Gordon Herriot Cunningham</a> explicitly transferred the species back to the genus "Geastrum" in 1944, explaining: The treatment of this species by certain taxonomists well illustrates the pitfalls that lie in wait for those who worship at the shrine of ontogenic classification ... The only feature of those outlined in which the species differs from others of "Geastrum" is the somewhat primitive hymenium. In the developing plant the glebal cavities are separated by tramal plates so tenuous as to be overlooked by the uncritical worker. Each cavity is filled with basidia somewhat irregularly arranged in clusters (like those of "<a href="Scleroderma">Scleroderma</a>") and not in the definite palisade of the species which have been studied. This difference disappears as maturity is reached, when plants resemble closely the fructification of any other member of the genus. The taxonomist is then unable to indicate any point of difference by which ""Astraeus"" may be separated from "Geastrum", which indicates that the name should be discarded. Cunningham's treatment was not followed by later authorities, who largely considered "Astraeus" a distinct genus. According to the <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> authority <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a>, <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonyms</a> of "Astraeus hygrometricus" include "Lycoperdon stellatus" Scop. (1772); "Geastrum fibrillosum" Schwein. (1822); "Geastrum stellatum" (Scop.) Wettst. (1885); and "Astraeus stellatus" E.Fisch. (1900).

"Astraeus hygrometricus" has been given a number of <a href="common%20name">colloquial names</a> that allude to its hygroscopic behavior, including the "hygrometer earthstar", the "hygroscopic earthstar", the "barometer earthstar", and the "water-measure earthstar". The resemblance to "Geastrum" species (also known as true earthstars) accounts for the common name "false earthstar". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific name</a> is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> words ὑγρός ("hygros") "wet" and μέτρον ("metron") "measure". The <a href="German%20Mycological%20Society">German Mycological Society</a> selected the species as their "Mushroom of the Year" in 2005.

Studies in the 2000s showed that several species from Asian collection sites labelled under the <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "hygrometricus" were actually considerably variable in a number of <a href="macroscopic%20scale">macroscopic</a> and <a href="microscopic%20scale">microscopic</a> characteristics. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> studies of the <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s of the <a href="internal%20transcribed%20spacer">ITS</a> region of the <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> from a number of "Astraeus" specimens from around the world have helped to clarify <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> relationships within the genus. Based on these results, two Asian ""hygrometricus"" populations have been described as new species: "<a href="Astraeus%20asiaticus">A. asiaticus</a>" and "<a href="Astraeus%20odoratus">A. odoratus</a>" (synonymous with Petcharat's "A. thailandicus" described in 2003). Preliminary DNA analyses suggests that the European "A. hygrometricus" described by Persoon is a different species than the North American version described by Morgan, and that the European population may be divided into two distinct <a href="phylotype">phylotype</a>s, from France ("A. hygrometricus") and from the Mediterranean ("<a href="Astraeus%20telleriae">A. telleriae</a>"). A follow-up analysis from 2013 named two new North American species: "<a href="Astraeus%20morganii">A. morganii</a>" from the Southern US and Mexico and "<a href="Astraeus%20smithii">A. smithii</a>" from the Central and Northern United States, and grouped western US specimens in "<a href="Astraeus%20pteridis">A. pteridis</a>". A 2010 study identified a Japanese species, previously identified as "A. hygrometricus", as genetically distinct; it has yet to be officially named.

A form of the species found in Korea and Japan, "A. hygrometricus" var. "koreanus", was named by V.J. Stanĕk in 1958; it was later (1976) published as a distinct species—"A. koreanus"—by <a href="Hanns%20Kreisel">Hanns Kreisel</a>. As pointed out by Fangfuk and colleagues, clarification of the proper name for this taxon must await analysis of "A. hygrometricus" var. "koreanus" specimens from the <a href="type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> in North Korea.

Young specimens of "A. hygrometricus" have roughly spherical <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">fruit bodies</a> that typically start their development partially embedded in the <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the <a href="peridium">exoperidium</a>, breaks open in a star-shaped (<a href="wikt%3Astellate">stellate</a>) pattern to form 4–20 irregular "rays". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin papery endoperidium. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue; the innermost, fibrous layer is <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>, and curls or uncurls the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of optimum moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll.

The fruit body is in diameter from tip to tip when expanded. The exoperidium is thick, and the rays are typically <a href="wikt%3Aareolate">areolate</a> (divided into small areas by cracks and crevices) on the upper surface, and are dark grey to black. The spore case is <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a> (lacking a <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a>), light gray to tan color and broad with a felt-like or scurfy (coated with loose scaly crust) surface; the top of the spore case is opened by an irregular slit, tear or pore. The interior of the spore case, the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, is white and solid when young, and divided into oval <a href="locule">locule</a>s—a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from "Geastrum". The gleba becomes brown and powdery as the specimen matures. Small dark hairlike threads (<a href="rhizomorph">rhizomorph</a>s) extend from the base of the fruit body into the substrate. The rhizomorphs are fragile, and often break off after maturity.

The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are spherical or nearly so, reddish-brown, thick-walled and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7–11 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>; the warts are about 1 µm long. The spores are non-<a href="amyloid">amyloid</a>, and will not stain with iodine from <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>. The use of <a href="scanning%20electron%20microscopy">scanning electron microscopy</a> has shown that the spines are 0.90–1.45 µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The <a href="capillitia">capillitia</a> (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5 µm in diameter, and <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent). The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a>. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24 µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the peridium, and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5 µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e that are 4–6 μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8 μm diameter and branched; the <a href="collenchyma">collenchyma</a>-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4 μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6 μm in diameter.

North American sources describe "A. hygrometricus" as being of either unknown edibility, or too tough to be edible. 
However, they are regularly consumed in Asia, including Nepal and South <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a>, where "local people consume them as delicious food". They are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of India.

A study of a closely related southeast Asian "Astraeus" species concluded that the fungus contained an abundance of <a href="volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatile</a> eight-carbon compounds (including <a href="1-octanol">1-octanol</a>, <a href="1-octen-3-ol">1-octen-3-ol</a>, and <a href="1-octen-3-one">1-octen-3-one</a>) that imparted a "mushroom-like, earthy, and pungent odor that was evident as an oily and moss-like smell upon opening the caps". The study's authors further noted that the fruit bodies after cooking have a "roasted, maillard, herbal, and oily flavor". Volatile compounds detected after cooking the mushroom samples included <a href="furfural">furfural</a>, <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a>, <a href="cyclohexenone">cyclohexenone</a>, and <a href="furan">furan</a>yl compounds. The regional differences in opinions on edibility are from sources published before it was known that North American and Asian versions of "A. hygrometricus" were not always the same; in some cases Asian specimens have been identified as new species, such as "A. asiaticus" and "A. odoratus".

Although "A. hygrometricus" bears a superficial resemblance to members of the "true earthstars" "Geastrum", it may be readily differentiated from most by the hygroscopic nature of its rays. Hygroscopic earthstars include "<a href="Geastrum%20arenarium">G. arenarium</a>", "<a href="Geastrum%20corollinum">G. corollinum</a>", "<a href="Geastrum%20floriforme">G. floriforme</a>", "<a href="Geastrum%20recolligens">G. recolligens</a>", and "<a href="Geastrum%20kotlabae">G. kotlabae</a>". Unlike "Geastrum", the young fruit bodies of "A. hygrometricus" do not have a columella (sterile tissue in the gleba, at the base of the spore sac). "Geastrum" tends to have its spore sac opening surrounded by a <a href="peristome">peristome</a> or a disc, in contrast with the single lacerate slit of "A. hygrometricus". There are also several microscopic differences: in "A. hygrometricus", the <a href="basidia">basidia</a> are not arranged in parallel columns, the spores are larger, and the threads of the capillitia are branched and continuous with the <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a> of the peridium. Despite these differences, older specimens can be difficult to distinguish from "Geastrum" in the field. One species of "Geastrum", "<a href="Geastrum%20mammosum">G. mammosum</a>", does have thick and brittle rays that are moderately hygroscopic, and could be confused with "A. hygrometricus"; however, its spores are smaller than "A. hygrometricus", typically about 4 µm in diameter.

"<a href="Astraeus%20pteridis">Astraeus pteridis</a>" is larger, or more when expanded, and often has a more pronounced areolate pattern on the inner surface of the rays. It is found in North America and the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>. "<a href="Astraeus%20asiaticus">A. asiaticus</a>" and "<a href="Astraeus%20odoratus">A. odoratus</a>" are two similar species known from throughout Asia and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, respectively. "A. odoratus" is distinguished from "A. hygrometricus" by a smooth outer mycelial layer with few adhering soil particles, 3–9 broad rays, and a fresh odor similar to moist soil. The spore ornamentation of "A. odoratus" is also distinct from "A. hygrometricus", with longer and narrower spines that often joined together. "A. asiaticus" has an outer peridial surface covered with small granules, and a gleba that is purplish-chestnut in color, compared to the smooth peridial surface and brownish gleba of "A. hygrometricus". The upper limit of the spore size of "A. asiaticus" is larger than that of its more common relative, ranging from 8.75–15.2 μm. "<a href="Astraeus%20koreanus">A. koreanus</a>" (sometimes named as the variety "A. hygrometricus" var. "koreanus"; see Taxonomy) differs from the more common form in its smaller size, paler fruit body, and greater number of rays; microscopically, it has smaller spores (between 6.8 and 9 μm in diameter), and the spines on the spores differ in length and morphology. It is known from Korea and Japan.

"Astraeus hygrometricus" is an <a href="mycorrhizal">ectomycorrhizal</a> fungus and grows in association with a broad range of tree species. The <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> association between tree roots and the <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> of the fungus helps the trees extract nutrients (particularly <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>) from the earth; in exchange, the fungus receives <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s from <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. In North America, associations with <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="pine">pine</a> are usual, while in India, it has been noted to grow commonly with <a href="chir%20pine">chir pine</a> ("Pinus roxburghii") and <a href="Shorea%20robusta">sal</a> ("Shorea robusta"). The false earthstar is found on the ground in open fields, often scattered or in groups, especially in nutrient-poor, sandy or <a href="loam">loam</a>y soils. It has also been reported to grow on rocks, preferring acid <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrates</a> like <a href="slate">slate</a> and <a href="granite">granite</a>, while avoiding substrates rich in <a href="lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>. In Nepal, fruit bodies have been collected at elevations of . Fruit bodies typically appear in autumn, although the dry fruit bodies are persistent and may last up to several years. "<a href="Gelatinipulvinella%20astraeicola">Gelatinipulvinella astraeicola</a>" is a <a href="Leotiaceae">leotiaceous</a> fungus with minute, gelatinous, pulvinate (cushion-shaped) <a href="apothecia">apothecia</a>, known to grow only on the inner surface of the rays of dead "Astraeus" species, including "A. hygrometricus".

The genus has a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a> except for <a href="climate%20of%20the%20Arctic">arctic</a>, <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine</a> and cold <a href="temperate">temperate</a> regions; it is common in <a href="temperate">temperate</a> and <a href="tropical">tropical</a> regions of the world. It has been collected in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America.

Mushroom <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s from a number of species have attracted research interest for their <a href="immunomodulatory">immunomodulatory</a> and <a href="antitumor">antitumor</a> properties. Extracts from "A. hygrometricus" containing the polysaccharide named AE2 were found to inhibit the growth of several <a href="cell%20culture">tumor cell lines</a> in laboratory tests, and stimulated the growth of <a href="splenocyte">splenocyte</a>s, <a href="thymocyte">thymocyte</a>s, and <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> cells from mice.

Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347

The Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347, sometimes referred to as the Second Palaiologan Civil War, was a conflict that broke out in the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> after the death of <a href="Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos">Andronikos III Palaiologos</a> over the guardianship of his nine-year-old son and heir, <a href="John%20V%20Palaiologos">John V Palaiologos</a>. It pitted on the one hand Andronikos III's chief minister, <a href="John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos">John VI Kantakouzenos</a>, and on the other a regency headed by the Empress-Dowager <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a>, the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch of Constantinople</a> <a href="John%20XIV%20Kalekas">John XIV Kalekas</a>, and the "<a href="megas%20doux">megas doux</a>" <a href="Alexios%20Apokaukos">Alexios Apokaukos</a>. The war polarized Byzantine society along class lines, with the aristocracy backing Kantakouzenos and the lower and middle classes supporting the regency. To a lesser extent, the conflict acquired religious overtones; Byzantium was embroiled in the <a href="Hesychast%20controversy">Hesychast controversy</a>, and adherence to the <a href="mysticism">mystical</a> doctrine of <a href="Hesychasm">Hesychasm</a> was often equated with support for Kantakouzenos.

As the chief aide and closest friend of Emperor Andronikos III, Kantakouzenos became regent for the underage John V upon Andronikos's death in June 1341. While Kantakouzenos was absent from <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in September the same year, a "<a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>" led by Alexios Apokaukos and the Patriarch John XIV secured the support of Empress Anna and established a new regency. In response, Kantakouzenos' army and supporters proclaimed him co-emperor in October, cementing the rift between himself and the new regency. The split immediately escalated into armed conflict.

During the first years of the war, forces of the regency prevailed. In the wake of several anti-aristocratic uprisings, most notably that of the <a href="Zealots%20of%20Thessalonica">Zealots</a> in <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>, a majority of the cities in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a> came under regency control. With assistance from <a href="Stefan%20Du%C5%A1an">Stefan Dušan</a> of <a href="Serbia%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Serbia</a> and <a href="Umur%20Beg">Umur Beg</a> of <a href="Ayd%C4%B1nids">Aydin</a>, Kantakouzenos successfully reversed these gains. By 1345, despite Dušan's defection to the opposition and the withdrawal of Umur, Kantakouzenos retained the upper hand through the assistance of <a href="Orhan">Orhan</a>, ruler of the <a href="Ottoman%20emirate">Ottoman emirate</a>. The June 1345 murder of "megas doux" Apokaukos, the regency's chief administrator, dealt the regency a severe blow. Formally crowned as emperor in <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> in 1346, Kantakouzenos entered Constantinople on 3 February 1347. By agreement, he was to rule for ten years as the senior emperor and regent for John V, until the boy came of age and ruled alongside him. Despite this apparent victory, subsequent <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201352%E2%80%9357">resumption of the civil war</a> forced John VI Kantakouzenos to abdicate and retire to become a monk in 1354.

The consequences of the prolonged conflict proved disastrous for the Empire, which had regained a measure of stability under Andronikos III. Seven years of warfare, the presence of marauding armies, social turmoil, and the advent of the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> devastated Byzantium and reduced it to a <a href="rump%20state">rump state</a>. The conflict also allowed Dušan to conquer <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a> and most of Macedonia, where he established the <a href="Serbian%20Empire">Serbian Empire</a>. The <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarian Empire</a> also acquired territory north of the <a href="Maritsa">Evros river</a>.

In 1341, the Byzantine Empire was in a state of turmoil, and despite the restoration of the Empire's capital to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and the recovery of a measure of its former power by <a href="Michael%20VIII%20Palaiologos">Michael VIII Palaiologos</a> (<a href="reign">r.</a> 1259–1282), the policies implemented during his reign had exhausted the state's resources, and the Empire's strength waned under his successor, <a href="Andronikos%20II%20Palaiologos">Andronikos II Palaiologos</a> (r. 1282–1328). During Andronikos II's long reign, the remaining Byzantine possessions in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> slowly fell to the advancing <a href="Anatolian%20Turkish%20beyliks">Turks</a>, most notably the newly established <a href="Ottoman%20emirate">Ottoman emirate</a>. This caused a flood of refugees into Byzantium's European provinces, while at the same time the <a href="Catalan%20Company">Catalan Company</a> wrought havoc in the imperial domains. Taxes also rose dramatically to finance tributes to the Empire's enemies. A combination of these failures and personal ambition moved the Emperor's grandson and heir, the young <a href="Andronikos%20III%20Palaiologos">Andronikos III Palaiologos</a>, to revolt. Supported by a group of young aristocrats led by <a href="John%20VI%20Kantakouzenos">John Kantakouzenos</a> and <a href="Syrgiannes%20Palaiologos">Syrgiannes Palaiologos</a>, Andronikos III deposed his grandfather after a <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201321%E2%80%9328">series of conflicts</a> during the 1320s. Although successful in removing the old Emperor from power, the war did not augur well for the future, as the Empire's neighbours—the <a href="Medieval%20Serbia">Serbs</a>, <a href="Second%20Bulgarian%20Empire">Bulgarians</a>, Turks, <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Venice">Venetians</a>—took advantage of Byzantine infighting to gain territory or expand their influence within the Empire.

The only son of a former governor of the Byzantine holdings in the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>, John Kantakouzenos was related to the Palaiologoi through his mother. He inherited vast estates in <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> and <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, and became a childhood friend and the closest and most trusted advisor of Andronikos III. During Andronikos III's reign (1328–1341), John Kantakouzenos acted as his chief minister, holding the office of "<a href="megas%20domestikos">megas domestikos</a>", commander-in-chief of the <a href="Palaiologan%20Byzantine%20army">Byzantine army</a>. The relationship between the two remained close, and in 1330, when the heirless Andronikos III (John V was born in 1332) fell ill he insisted that Kantakouzenos be proclaimed Emperor or regent after his death. Their ties were further strengthened in the spring of 1341, when the latter's eldest son, <a href="Matthew%20Kantakouzenos">Matthew Kantakouzenos</a>, wed <a href="Irene%20Palaiologina%20%28Byzantine%20empress%29">Irene Palaiologina</a>, a cousin of the Emperor.

Unlike Andronikos II, who had disbanded the Byzantine army and navy, and who favoured monks and intellectuals, Andronikos III was an energetic ruler who personally led his forces in military campaigns. In 1329, his first campaign against the Ottomans resulted in a disastrous defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pelekanos">Battle of Pelekanos</a>, after which the Byzantine position in <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a> rapidly collapsed. Subsequent sorties into the Balkans were nevertheless successful in shoring up Andronikos' tottering realm. Thessaly and the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Despotate of Epirus</a>, two territories separated from the Empire after the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>, were restored to imperial rule, almost without bloodshed in 1328 and 1337 respectively. Andronikos III also rebuilt a modest fleet, which allowed him to recover the rich and strategically placed island of <a href="Chios">Chios</a> from the Genoese <a href="Zaccaria">Zaccaria</a> family in 1329 as well as to claim the allegiance of <a href="Andreolo%20Cattaneo">Andreolo Cattaneo</a>, the Genoese governor of <a href="Phocaea">Phocaea</a> on the Anatolian mainland. In 1335, however, Andreolo's son <a href="Domenico%20Cattaneo">Domenico</a> captured the island of <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a> with Genoese assistance. The Emperor led a fleet to recover it and Phocaea, and requested the aid of the Turkish emirs of <a href="Sarukhanids">Saruhan</a> and <a href="Aydinids">Aydin</a>. Saruhan sent troops and supplies, but Aydin's ruler <a href="Umur%20Beg">Umur Beg</a> came to meet the Emperor in person. It was during this encounter that Kantakouzenos and Umur established a long-lasting close friendship and alliance.

A war with Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less successful for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were captured by the Serbs, led by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes and the threat of a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungarian</a> invasion forced the Serbian ruler, <a href="Stefan%20Du%C5%A1an">Stefan Dušan</a>, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important for the future of Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, and with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to <a href="Prilep">Prilep</a>.

Although the loss of Asia Minor proved irreversible, successes in Epirus and Thessaly led to a consolidation of the Empire in the Greek-speaking lands of the southern Balkans. Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos planned further campaigns to recover the <a href="Latinokratia">Latin principalities</a> of southern Greece, a project of major long-term importance, for, as the historian <a href="Donald%20Nicol">Donald Nicol</a> writes, "if the whole peninsula of Greece could be united under Byzantine government then the Empire would once again be a homogeneous structure, able to stand up to the Serbians, the Italians and its other enemies. It would be small, but it would be a compact and manageable economic and administrative unit running from <a href="Cape%20Matapan">Cape Matapan</a> to <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> and Constantinople".

Following a short illness, on the night of 14–15 June 1341 the emperor Andronikos III died at the relatively early age of 45, possibly due to chronic <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. His nine-year-old son John (John V) was the obvious successor, but he had not been officially proclaimed or crowned as co-emperor. This left a legal vacuum, and raised the question of who would lead the Empire's government.

According to Byzantine custom, the empress-dowager automatically headed any regency. Nevertheless, despite the lack of any formal appointment, Kantakouzenos placed Andronikos III's sons and the Empress-dowager <a href="Anna%20of%20Savoy">Anna of Savoy</a> under armed guard in the palace, and in a meeting of the <a href="Byzantine%20Senate">Byzantine Senate</a> claimed for himself the regency and governance of the state by virtue of his close association with the deceased Emperor. He also demanded that John V marry forthwith his own daughter <a href="Helena%20Kantakouzene">Helena Kantakouzene</a>. This claim was disputed by Patriarch <a href="John%20XIV%20of%20Constantinople">John XIV of Constantinople</a>, who presented a document from Andronikos dating from 1334, assigning to him the care of the imperial family in the case of his death. Only after a demonstration of the capital's troops on 20 June did Kantakouzenos secure recognition as regent and control of the reins of government, as well as maintaining control over the army as its "megas domestikos".

Nevertheless, opposition to Kantakouzenos began to coalesce around three figures: the Patriarch, a forceful man determined to have a voice in the governance of the Empire, the Empress-regent, who feared that Kantakouzenos would dispossess her son, and last but not least <a href="Alexios%20Apokaukos">Alexios Apokaukos</a>, the ambitious "<a href="megas%20doux">megas doux</a>" (commander-in-chief of the <a href="Byzantine%20navy">navy</a>) and head of the bureaucracy. A "<a href="novus%20homo">new man</a>" promoted to high office as the <a href="prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9">protégé</a> of Andronikos III and possibly the richest man in the Empire by 1341, Apokaukos was distrusted by the hereditary aristocracy. The only surviving narrative accounts of the period, Kantakouzenos's memoirs and the history of <a href="Nikephoros%20Gregoras">Nikephoros Gregoras</a>, with their pro-aristocracy bias, paint a very negative picture of the man. According to Kantakouzenos, Apokaukos' adherence to the Patriarch's camp resulted from his ambition: Apokaukos sought further advancement by trying to convince Kantakouzenos to declare himself Emperor. When the latter refused, Apokaukos secretly switched his allegiance.

In Donald Nicol's opinion, had Kantakouzenos remained at Constantinople, his authority might have remained secure. As the "megas domestikos" and regent however, he had the duty of dealing with the Empire's various enemies, who sought to take advantage of Andronikos' death. Dušan had invaded Macedonia, the <a href="Sarukhan%2C%20Bey%20of%20Magnesia">Emir of Saruhan</a> raided the coasts of Thrace, and Tsar <a href="Ivan%20Alexander%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria</a> threatened war. In July Kantakouzenos left the capital at the head of the army, leaving control of the government to Apokaukos, whom he still believed loyal to him. Kantakouzenos' campaign proved successful. He persuaded Dušan to withdraw and repulsed the Turkish raiders, while Ivan Alexander, threatened by a fleet from the Emirate of Aydin, renewed his peace treaty with Byzantium. To crown this success, Kantakouzenos received an embassy of the Latin barons of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Achaea">Principality of Achaea</a> in the Morea. They expressed readiness to surrender the country in exchange for a guarantee of their property and rights. It was a unique opportunity, as Kantakouzenos himself recognized in his memoirs, since if successful, the Catalan-controlled <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a> was bound to follow, consolidating Byzantine control over Greece.

At this point Kantakouzenos received grave news from Constantinople. In late August Apokaukos attempted a coup and tried to kidnap John V. Having failed, he fled to his fortified house at <a href="Epibates">Epibatai</a>, where he was blockaded by troops. Kantakouzenos returned to Constantinople in early September, where he stayed for a few weeks consulting with the Empress. On his way back to Thrace to prepare for a campaign into the Morea, he went to Epibatai, where he pardoned Apokaukos and restored him to his former offices.

Kantakouzenos' second departure proved a great error. Back in the capital, his enemies moved in his absence. Apokaukos gathered a group of high-ranking aristocrats around him, including men such as the "<a href="megas%20droungarios%20tes%20vigles">megas droungarios</a>" <a href="John%20Gabalas%20%2814th%20century%29">John Gabalas</a> or <a href="George%20Choumnos">George Choumnos</a>, whom he tied to himself by marriage alliances. The Patriarch, backed by Apokaukos' group and the authority of the Empress, dismissed Kantakouzenos from his offices and declared him a public enemy. Kalekas himself was proclaimed regent and Apokaukos named <a href="Eparch%20of%20Constantinople">Eparch of Constantinople</a>. Kantakouzenos' relatives and supporters were imprisoned or forced to flee the city, and their properties confiscated. Although Kantakouzenos' wife and children were safe in his headquarters at Demotika (<a href="Didymoteicho">Didymoteicho</a>), the regency placed his mother, Theodora, under house arrest. The privations she suffered during her imprisonment were to cause her eventual death.
As the first groups of his partisans fleeing the capital arrived at Demotika, Kantakouzenos, by his own account, tried to negotiate with the new regency, but his approach was rebuffed. Finally forced to take decisive action, on 26 October 1341, the army (2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, according to Gregoras) and his supporters, largely drawn from the land-holding aristocracy, proclaimed Kantakouzenos Emperor. Although he still presented himself officially as a junior colleague to John V, and claimed to be only acting in the boy's name, having staked his claim on the throne, he had effectively started a civil war. Kantakouzenos still hoped that negotiation might resolve the situation, but all his envoys were imprisoned and he and his supporters excommunicated by Patriarch John XIV. On 19 November 1341, the regency responded to Kantakouzenos' proclamation as Emperor with the formal coronation of John V.

Reaction to Kantakouzenos' proclamation caused a rift in Byzantine society, with the rich and powerful land-holding magnates (traditionally called the "<a href="dynatoi">dynatoi</a>", the "powerful ones") who dominated the countryside quickly rallying to support him, while the ordinary population, often living in abject conditions and suffering under oppressive taxation, supported the Empress-dowager and the Patriarch. Apokaukos was especially quick to capitalize upon this division and foment popular dislike for the aristocracy, by widely publicizing the immense wealth confiscated from Kantakouzenos' and his supporters' houses and estates. In the words of Donald Nicol, "it was against him [Kantakouzenos] and everything that he stood for as a millionaire and landowning aristocrat that the people rose up. 'Kantakouzenism' became their war cry, the slogan of their discontent".

Thus the battle lines of the civil war were drawn up between urban and rural factions. The cities, dominated by the middle-class civil bureaucracy and merchant class (the "people of the market"), favoured a more mercantile economy and close relations with the <a href="Italian%20maritime%20republics">Italian maritime republics</a>, while the countryside remained under the control of the conservative <a href="landed%20nobility">landed aristocracy</a>, which derived its wealth from its estates and traditionally shunned commercial and entrepreneurial activities as unworthy of its status. The lower social strata tended to support the respective dominant faction, the middle classes in the cities and the landholding magnates in the countryside.

Polarization of this nature was not new in the Byzantine Empire. Evidence of competition between the landed aristocracy and the city-based middle classes in the political, economic and social spheres has been attested since the 11th century, but the scale of the conflict that erupted in 1341 was unprecedented. This class conflict was mirrored in the breakaway Byzantine <a href="Empire%20of%20Trebizond">Empire of Trebizond</a> as well, where a pro-imperial and pro-Constantinopolitan urban faction confronted the provincial landholding aristocracy between 1340 and 1349 (cf. <a href="Trapezuntine%20Civil%20War">Trapezuntine Civil War</a>). The more conservative and anti-Western tendencies of the aristocrats, and their links to the staunchly <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> and anti-<a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> monasteries, also explain their increased attachment to the <a href="mysticism">mystical</a> <a href="Hesychasm">Hesychasm</a> movement advocated by <a href="Gregory%20Palamas">Gregory Palamas</a>, whose views were mostly opposed in the cities. Although several significant exceptions leave the issue open to question among modern scholars, in the contemporary popular mind (and in traditional historiography), the supporters of "<a href="Palamism">Palamism</a>" and of "Kantakouzenism" were usually equated. Kantakouzenos' eventual victory also meant the victory of Hesychasm, <a href="Fifth%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">confirmed in a synod</a> in Constantinople in 1351. Hesychasm eventually became a hallmark of the Orthodox church tradition, although it was rejected by the Catholics as a heresy.

The first manifestation of this social division appeared in <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> where, on 27 October, the populace expelled the city's aristocrats, securing it for the regency. This event was repeated over the next weeks in town after town throughout Thrace and Macedonia, as the people declared their support for the regency and against the despised forces of "Kantakouzenism". In this hostile atmosphere, many of Kantakouzenos' soldiers abandoned him and returned to Constantinople. In Demotika alone the popular uprising was quelled, and the town remained Kantakouzenos' main stronghold in Thrace throughout the war.

When heavy snowfall rendered campaigning impossible during the following winter, Kantakouzenos instead sent envoys, including an embassy of monks from <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a> to Constantinople. However, they too were dismissed by the Patriarch. By then, almost all of the Byzantine provinces and their governors had declared themselves for the regency. Only <a href="Theodore%20Synadenos">Theodore Synadenos</a>, an old associate of Kantakouzenos who was the governor of the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, indicated his support. Synadenos had kept his allegiance to Kantakouzenos secret from the city's populace, and intended to surrender Thessalonica in collusion with the local aristocracy. Furthermore, <a href="Hrelja">Hrelja</a>, the Serbian magnate and virtually independent ruler of <a href="Strumica">Strumica</a> and the <a href="Strymon%20River">Strymon River</a> valley, seemed to lean towards Kantakouzenos. Consequently, as soon as the weather improved, on 2 March 1342, Kantakouzenos left his wife <a href="Irene%20Asanina">Irene Asanina</a>, his brother-in-law <a href="Manuel%20Asen">Manuel Asen</a> and his daughters to hold Demotika and marched west with his army toward Thessalonica. On the way, he first attacked <a href="Peritheorion">Peritheorion</a> but was repelled and continued westward. Kantakouzenos was however able to take fortress <a href="Melnik%2C%20Bulgaria">Melnik</a>, where he met with Hrelja to forge an alliance. Their two armies marched toward Thessalonica, but arrived too late to take control. As they approached the city, they were met by Synadenos and other aristocrats, who had fled after an uprising led by a radical popular party, the <a href="Zealots%20of%20Thessalonica">Zealots</a>. Soon afterwards a fleet of 70 ships led by Apokaukos reinforced the city. Synadenos, whose family had remained behind in Thessalonica, defected to the regency. Apokaukos' son <a href="John%20Apokaukos%20%28died%201345%29">John</a> was appointed governor of Thessalonica, although effective power rested with the Zealots, who for the next seven years led an autonomous regime unparalleled in Byzantine history.
At the same time, the regency's army campaigned in Thrace, formally taking possession of towns secured by popular revolt. With Thessalonica barred against him, his supply lines to Thrace cut, and desertions having reduced his army to 2,000 men, of whom half belonged to Hrelja, Kantakouzenos was forced to withdraw north to Serbia, where he hoped to secure the aid of Stefan Dušan. Soon after, Hrelja also deserted Kantakouzenos and joined the regency, hoping to gain control of Melnik for himself. In July 1342, Kantakouzenos met Dušan near <a href="Pristina">Pristina</a>. The Serbian ruler appeared initially reluctant to form an alliance. Nevertheless, under pressure from his nobles, especially the powerful <a href="Jovan%20Oliver">Jovan Oliver</a>, he could not afford to miss this unique opportunity to expand south. Desperately in need of Serbian aid, Kantakouzenos apparently agreed that the Serbs could keep any town they took, despite his own later account to the contrary. According to Nikephoros Gregoras, the Serbs claimed all of Macedonia west of Christopolis (<a href="Kavala">Kavala</a>), except for Thessalonica and its environs. The only concession Kantakouzenos secured was that an exception be made for those towns that surrendered to him in person. To seal the pact, Kantakouzenos' younger son, <a href="Manuel%20Kantakouzenos">Manuel</a>, was to be wed to the daughter of Jovan Oliver, although after Dušan later broke the alliance, the marriage did not take place. Hrelja too acceded to the pact, in exchange for the surrender of Melnik by Kantakouzenos' garrison. After Hrelja's death later that year, Melnik was seized by Dušan.

In late summer 1342, Kantakouzenos, accompanied by several Serbian magnates, marched into Macedonia at the head of a Greek and Serbian force, intending to break through to his wife, who still held out at Demotika. His advance was stopped almost immediately before <a href="Serres">Serres</a> when the city refused to surrender, and the subsequent siege had to be abandoned after an epidemic killed most of his men, forcing him to retreat into Serbia with a rump force of barely 500 soldiers. Dušan led a more successful parallel campaign, capturing Vodena (<a href="Edessa%2C%20Greece">Edessa</a>). Serbian forces captured <a href="Florina">Florina</a> and <a href="Kastoria">Kastoria</a> shortly afterwards, thereby extending their hold over <a href="western%20Macedonia">western Macedonia</a>. The Serbs also expanded their control over <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, so that by the summer of 1343, with the exception of <a href="Capetian%20House%20of%20Anjou">Angevin</a>-controlled <a href="Dyrrhachium">Dyrrhachium</a>, all of the region appears to have fallen under Serbian rule. Morale among Kantakouzenos' followers fell dramatically. Rumours circulated in Constantinople that a dejected Kantakouzenos planned to retire to Mount Athos as a monk, and riots broke out in the city in which several rich men were killed and their houses looted by the populace.

In late fall, Empress Anna twice sent embassies to Dušan trying to convince him to surrender Kantakouzenos, but the Serbian ruler, seeking to extract more profit from their alliance, refused. Kantakouzenos' fortunes began to improve when a delegation of the nobles of Thessaly reached him and offered to accept his authority. Kantakouzenos appointed his relative <a href="John%20Angelos%20%28sebastokrator%29">John Angelos</a> as the province's governor. Although in effect a semi-independent ruler, Angelos was both loyal and effective. He soon brought Epirus — which he had governed in Andronikos III's name in 1340 — into the Kantakouzenist camp, and even made gains in Thessaly at the expense of the Catalans of Athens. Another effort by Kantakouzenos to break from Serbia into Macedonia failed before Serres. In the meantime, Kantakouzenos' wife Irene called upon the aid of the Bulgarians to help relieve the blockade of Demotika by the regency's army. Ivan Alexander dispatched troops, but although they clashed with the regency's forces, they made no effort in assisting the city, instead pillaging the countryside.

At this point, Kantakouzenos' position was greatly strengthened by the intervention of his old friend, <a href="Umur%20Bey">Umur Bey</a>, who in late 1342 or early 1343 sailed up the <a href="Evros%20river">Evros river</a> with a fleet of 300 ships and 29,000 (according to Kantakouzenos) or 15,000 (according to Turkish sources) men-in-arms and relieved Demotika both from the siege by the regency's forces and from the depredations of the Bulgarians. After pillaging Thrace for a few months, Umur was forced to retreat to Asia at the onset of winter, to which the Turks were unaccustomed. This turn of events displeased Dušan, for Kantakouzenos now had an independent power base and was less reliant on the Serbian ruler's goodwill. The final rift between Kantakouzenos and Dušan occurred in April 1343, when Kantakouzenos persuaded the town of <a href="Veria">Berroia</a>, besieged by the Serbs, to surrender to him instead of Dušan. This was followed by the surrender of several other forts in the area to Kantakouzenos, including <a href="Servia%2C%20Greece">Servia</a> and <a href="Platamon">Platamon</a>. These moves strengthened Kantakouzenos' position and independence from Dušan, thereby thwarting the latter's plans for expansion. Realizing that he had little to gain by continuing to support Kantakouzenos, Dušan opened negotiations with the regency and concluded a formal alliance with them in the summer of 1343.

Meanwhile, Kantakouzenos and his army camped outside Thessalonica, hoping to take the city through the aid of his supporters within the walls. Apokaukos arrived at the head of the Byzantine fleet to aid the Zealots, pinning Kantakouzenos down in Macedonia between Thessalonica and Dušan's possessions. Once again Umur of Aydin came to Kantakouzenos' assistance with a fleet carrying some 6,000 men, whereupon Apokaukos and his ships fled from the superior Turkish navy. Nevertheless, a reinforced Thessalonica was able to hold out against a siege by Kantakouzenos and Umur. Although he had failed to take Thessalonica, the presence of his Turkish allies allowed Kantakouzenos to turn his attention towards Thrace. In late 1343 he left his son Manuel as governor of Berroia and western Macedonia and marched towards Demotika, relieving the city and seeing his wife for the first time in almost two years. On his way to Demotika, Kantakouzenos had seized a number of fortresses in Thrace, although another siege of Peritheorion failed. He followed up with a successful campaign that took <a href="Komotini">Komotini</a> and other fortresses in the <a href="Rhodope%20Mountains">Rhodope</a> area. Over the next couple of years, the towns and forts of Thrace came over to Kantakouzenos' camp one by one, but at great cost, as his mainly Turkish troops repeatedly plundered the countryside. The shifting tide of the war did not go unnoticed in the opposing camp. In late 1344, several prominent personalities defected to Kantakouzenos, including <a href="John%20Vatatzes%20%28megas%20stratopedarches%29">John Vatatzes</a>, a general and relative by marriage to both the Patriarch and Apokaukos, the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a> Lazaros, and, most importantly, Manuel Apokaukos, son of the "megas doux" and governor of Adrianople.
At the same time, the regency's alliance with Dušan was paying dividends for the Serbian ruler alone, as he had free rein to plunder and occupy all of Macedonia and Epirus. By the end of 1345, only Thessalonica, held by the Zealots, Serres and the surrounding region, which remained loyal to the regency, along with Berroia, which still held out under Manuel Kantakouzenos, remained outside Serbian control.

These developments placed the regency in considerable difficulties. In spite of Apokaukos' adroit management of the state's finances, the devastation caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress Anna was forced to pawn the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to a scarcity of food in Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>, promising the submission of herself, John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.

In 1344, the regency concluded a further alliance with Bulgaria, which required the surrender of Philippopolis (<a href="Plovdiv">Plovdiv</a>) and nine other towns in northern Thrace along the river Evros. Nevertheless, after their occupation, Ivan Alexander refrained from direct action against Kantakouzenos' forces operating in southern and eastern Thrace. At the same time, <a href="Momchil">Momchil</a>, a former <a href="brigand">brigand</a> whom Kantakouzenos had entrusted with control over the region of Merope in the Rhodope mountains, switched over to the regency. In early 1344, Kantakouzenos was deprived of Umur and the bulk of his army, who had sailed home to repel a <a href="Smyrniote%20crusades">Latin attack</a> on his main harbour, <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>. On their way, the Turkish force was attacked by the Serbs under <a href="Gregory%20Preljub">Gregory Preljub</a>, but prevailed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stephaniana">Battle of Stephaniana</a>. Nevertheless, Kantakouzenos was able to ward off joint attacks by Dušan and Apokaukos until Umur returned to his aid the next spring at the head of an army of 20,000 men.

Kantakouzenos and Umur raided Bulgaria, and then turned against Momchil. The latter had exploited the power vacuum in the Rhodope, an effective <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> between the Serbs, Bulgarians and Byzantines, to set himself up as a quasi-independent prince, supported by a substantial force of around 5,000 men. On 7 July 1345, the two armies <a href="Battle%20of%20Peritheorion">clashed</a> at Peritheorion. Momchil's army was crushed, and he himself fell in the field. Soon afterwards, Dušan arrived before Serres and laid siege to the city. Rejecting demands by Kantakouzenos to withdraw, a clash appeared inevitable until the murder of Alexios Apokaukos in Constantinople forced Kantakouzenos to direct his attention there.

In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> friars to the regency to make an offer of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite this show of confidence, the regency's position remained insecure. The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of <a href="proscription">proscription</a>s. He also ordered the construction of a new prison to house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an inspection of the prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.
When Kantakouzenos heard the news he marched towards Constantinople, urged by his supporters, who expected that the death of Apokaukos would result in the collapse of the regency. Kantakouzenos was more sceptical, and indeed the Patriarch and Empress Anna quickly brought the situation under control. At the same time, Kantakouzenos suffered a series of reverses. These began when John Apokaukos, the nominal governor of Thessalonica, openly announced his allegiance to Kantakouzenos and his plans to surrender the city. He was immediately thwarted by the Zealots who rose up again and killed Apokaukos and the other Kantakouzenist sympathizers in the city. Then John Vatatzes, who had defected to Kantakouzenos the year before, once more switched sides. He attempted to take some of Kantakouzenos' Turkish allies and a few Thracian cities with him, but was murdered soon afterwards. Finally, Kantakouzenos lost the support of his most crucial ally, Umur of Aydin, who left with his army to confront the crusaders in Smyrna. Kantakouzenos replaced him by allying himself with the Emir of Saruhan and, more importantly, <a href="Orhan%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Orhan</a> of the rising Ottoman emirate in Bithynia.

In September 1345, after a long siege, Serres fell to Dušan. The Serbian ruler, who by now controlled about half of the pre-1341 Byzantine realm, was spurred by this success to lay his own claim on the Byzantine throne. Consequently, on <a href="Easter%20Sunday">Easter Sunday</a>, 16 April 1346, he was crowned "Emperor of the Serbs and the Romans" in <a href="Skopje">Skopje</a>, thereby founding the <a href="Serbian%20Empire">Serbian Empire</a>. This development prompted Kantakouzenos, who had only been acclaimed Emperor in 1341, to have himself formally crowned in a ceremony held at Adrianople on 21 May, presided over by the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Lazaros. Lazaros then convened a synod of bishops to excommunicate the Patriarch of Constantinople, John Kalekas. Not long afterwards, Kantakouzenos' ties with his new ally Orhan were cemented through the marriage of his daughter <a href="Theodora%20Kantakouzene%20%28wife%20of%20Orhan%29">Theodora Kantakouzene</a> to the Ottoman emir at an elaborate ceremony in <a href="Selymbria">Selymbria</a>.

For the regency, the situation had become desperate. Empress Anna's requests for aid from foreign powers proved unsuccessful, as both Orhan and the <a href="beylik%20of%20Karasi">beylik of Karasi</a> rebuffed her overtures for assistance. Only <a href="Balik%20%28ruler%29">Balik</a>, the ruler of <a href="Despotate%20of%20Dobruja">Dobruja</a>, sent an elite force of 1,000 men under his brothers <a href="Theodore%20of%20Dobruja">Theodore</a> and <a href="Dobrotitsa">Dobrotitsa</a>, but they were routed by a Kantakouzenist army under "<a href="protostrator">protostrator</a>" <a href="George%20Phakrases">George Phakrases</a>. The emirate of Saruhan offered a more substantial force of 6,000 men in the summer of 1346, but instead of fighting, they plundered Thrace and then defected to join Kantakouzenos' army. Revenue remained scarce for the regency, the Genoese once again seized the imperial possessions of Chios and Phocaea, and on 19 May 1346, a part of the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> cathedral collapsed, a terrible omen in the eyes of the capital's inhabitants.

By the summer of 1346, Kantakouzenos stood on the verge of victory. He left Thrace under the control of his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost a year for the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he explains that he did not want to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.

As the months passed, and the privations in Constantinople increased, the pro-Kantakouzenos faction in the capital grew as the Empress refused even to consider negotiations. Twice agents were sent to assassinate Kantakouzenos, but they failed. The Empress eventually fell out with Patriarch John Kalekas, who was deposed in a synod on 2 February 1347. On the same night, supporters of Kantakouzenos opened the disused <a href="Golden%20Gate%20%28Constantinople%29">Golden Gate</a>, and Kantakouzenos entered the city with 1,000 men. Meeting no resistance, his troops surrounded the <a href="Palace%20of%20Blachernae">Palace of Blachernae</a>, the imperial residence, the next morning, but the Empress refused to surrender for several days, still fearful of the fate that awaited her. Kantakouzenos' men grew impatient and stormed part of the palace complex, and John V persuaded his mother to accept a settlement.

On 8 February 1347, the war formally ended with an agreement making Kantakouzenos senior emperor for ten years, after which he and John V would reign as equals. Kantakouzenos also promised to pardon anyone who had fought against him. To seal the pact, John V married Kantakouzenos' daughter Helena, and in May, Kantakouzenos was crowned again in the <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Mary%20of%20Blachernae%20%28Istanbul%29">Church of St. Mary of Blachernae</a>. In the end, as Donald Nicol commented, the long conflict had been meaningless, with terms that "could have been agreed five years before and saved the Empire so much bitterness, hatred and destruction."

Despite the moderation and clemency shown by Kantakouzenos in this settlement, it did not gain universal acceptance. Supporters of the <a href="Palaiologos">Palaiologoi</a> still distrusted him, while his own partisans would have preferred to depose the Palaiologoi outright and install the <a href="Kantakouzenos">Kantakouzenoi</a> as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, and had to be placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous <a href="appanage">appanage</a> covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a <a href="march%20%28territorial%20entity%29">march</a> against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated <a href="exclave">exclave</a> surrounded by the Serbs, refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a "de facto" independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.

After 1347, John VI Kantakouzenos tried to revive the Empire, but met with limited success. Aided by the depopulation brought by about by the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a>, Dušan and his general Preljub took Kantakouzenos' Macedonian strongholds as well as Epirus and Thessaly in 1347–1348, thereby completing their conquest of the remaining Byzantine lands in mainland Greece. An attempt to break Byzantium's dependence for food and maritime commerce on the Genoese merchants of <a href="Galata">Galata</a> led to a <a href="Byzantine%E2%80%93Genoese%20War%20%281348%E2%80%9349%29">Byzantine–Genoese war</a>, which ended in 1352 with a compromise peace. In 1350, Kantakouzenos took advantage of Dušan's preoccupation with a war against <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bosnia">Bosnia</a> to recover Thessalonica from the Zealots as well as Berroia, Vodena and other Macedonian cities from the Serbs, but the Serbian emperor quickly reversed the Byzantine gains, leaving only Thessalonica in Byzantine hands.

Steadily deteriorating relations between Matthew Kantakouzenos, who now ruled eastern Thrace, and John V Palaiologos, who had taken over Matthew's former domain in western Thrace, led to yet another internal conflict. <a href="Byzantine%20civil%20war%20of%201352%E2%80%9357">Open warfare</a> broke out in 1352, when John V, supported by Venetian and Turkish troops, launched an attack on Matthew Kantakouzenos. John Kantakouzenos came to his son's aid with 10,000 Ottoman troops who retook the cities of Thrace, liberally plundering them in the process. In October 1352, at Demotika, the Ottoman force <a href="Battle%20of%20Demotika">met and defeated</a> 4,000 Serbs provided to John V by Stefan Dušan. This was the Ottomans' first victory in Europe and an ominous portent. Two years later their capture of <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> marked the beginning of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans, which culminated a century later in the <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">Fall of Constantinople</a>. Meanwhile, John V fled to the island of <a href="Tenedos">Tenedos</a>, from where he made an unsuccessful attempt to seize Constantinople in March 1353. John VI Kantakouzenos responded by having Matthew crowned as co-emperor, but John V Palaiologos, enlisting Genoese support and relying on the declining popularity of Kantakouzenos, succeeded in entering the capital in November 1354. John VI abdicated and retired to a monastery. Matthew held out in Thrace until 1357, when he too abdicated, leaving John V Palaiologos as the sole master of a <a href="rump%20state">rump state</a>.

The civil war proved a critical turning point in the history of the Byzantine Empire. In the words of the <a href="Byzantine%20studies">Byzantinist</a> <a href="Angeliki%20Laiou">Angeliki Laiou</a>, "after the end of the second civil war, Byzantium was an empire in name only", while according to Eva de Vries-Van der Velden, it marks "the point of rupture between the 'decline' and 'the fall' of the Byzantine Empire".

The Byzantines' division and reliance on foreign troops, especially the Serbs and Turks, encouraged the latter's expansionism. Stefan Dušan in particular proved adept in exploiting the civil war to expand his state at Byzantium's expense. Aside from huge territorial losses, the prolonged conflict exhausted the Byzantine state's resources, as it brought "anarchy to the cities and devastation to the countryside" (Alice-Mary Talbot). Thrace, the largest contiguous territory remaining in the Empire, suffered such destruction that, along with Constantinople, it became dependent on grain imported from Bulgaria and the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a>. Trade had stopped, and the treasury contained, in the words of Gregoras, "nothing but the atoms of <a href="Epicurus">Epicurus</a>". Kantakouzenos had exhausted his own personal fortune, and Empress Anne had left the Empire heavily indebted to the Venetians. The war also led to the collapse of the centralized imperial administration in the provinces, causing control of the Thracian countryside to shift to a <a href="Manorialism">manorial</a> system run by the local magnates. Despite their considerable wealth, the magnates, through exemptions or outright evasion, managed to avoid paying taxes to the imperial government. In addition, the arrival in 1347 of the Black Death and its recurrent outbreaks further reduced the Empire's tax and recruitment base, curtailing its ability to reverse the Serbian territorial gains.

Along with the renewal of the civil war in 1352, these factors destroyed any chance of even a modest recovery similar to that experienced under Andronikos III. Thereafter, Byzantium remained under the menacing threat of stronger neighbours, unable to pursue an independent foreign policy, handicapped by a shortage of resources and riven by internal strife. Nevertheless, through a combination of fortuitous external circumstances and adroit diplomacy, it survived for another century, until finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1453. Only the Byzantine exclave in the Morea remained prosperous, having been spared the ravages of the civil war because of its relative isolation. The appointment of Manuel Kantakouzenos as its "<a href="despotes">despotes</a>" in 1349 heralded the creation of the semi-independent <a href="Despotate%20of%20the%20Morea">Despotate of the Morea</a>, which experienced the last economic and cultural flowering of the Byzantine world before it too fell to the Ottomans in 1460.

Subway (Homicide: Life on the Street)

"Subway" (sometimes referred to as "The Accident") is the seventh episode of of the American police television drama "", and the 84th episode overall. It first aired on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> in the United States on December 5, 1997. In the episode, John Lange (<a href="Vincent%20D%27Onofrio">Vincent D'Onofrio</a>) becomes pinned between a <a href="Baltimore%20Metro%20Subway">Baltimore Metro Subway</a> train and the station platform. The Baltimore homicide department is informed that Lange will be dead within an hour and <a href="Frank%20Pembleton">Pembleton</a> tries to solve the case while comforting Lange in his final minutes.

"Subway" featured guest star Bruce MacVittie as a man suspected of pushing Lange into the path of the train. The episode was written by <a href="James%20Yoshimura">James Yoshimura</a>, who co-produced with <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a>. It was directed by <a href="Gary%20Fleder">Gary Fleder</a> and was the only episode of "Homicide: Life on the Street" helmed by the feature film director. Yoshimura based "Subway" on an episode of the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> hidden-camera documentary show "<a href="Taxicab%20Confessions">Taxicab Confessions</a>", in which a <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> detective described a real-life instance of a man trapped between a subway train and platform.

"Subway" was filmed on location in a <a href="Maryland%20Transit%20Administration">Baltimore Metropolitan Transit Authority</a> (MTA) station. Fleder included cinematic elements that were uncommon in the traditionally naturalistic show. This led to conflicts between Fleder and director of photography <a href="Alex%20Zakrzewski">Alex Zakrzewski</a>. "Subway" received overwhelmingly positive reviews but ranked number three in its time-slot during its original broadcast, capturing 10.3 million viewers but falling behind <a href="American%20Broadcast%20Company">ABC</a>'s "<a href="20/20%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">20/20</a>" and <a href="CBS">CBS</a>'s "<a href="Nash%20Bridges">Nash Bridges</a>".

The episode won a <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a> for excellence in television broadcasting and was nominated for two <a href="50th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Emmy Award</a>s, one for Yoshimura's script and one for D'Onofrio's guest performance. "Subway" was the subject of a two-hour <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> television documentary, "Anatomy of a "Homicide: Life on the Street"", which originally aired on the network on November 4, 1998. Screenwriter <a href="Vince%20Gilligan">Vince Gilligan</a> said "Subway" directly influenced <a href="Drive%20%28The%20X-Files%29">an episode</a> of "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" that he wrote, which in turn helped inspire the casting of <a href="Bryan%20Cranston">Bryan Cranston</a> in "<a href="Breaking%20Bad">Breaking Bad</a>".

During an altercation on a crowded subway platform, John Lange (<a href="Vincent%20D%27Onofrio">Vincent D'Onofrio</a>) falls against a moving train and is pinned at waist level between a subway car and the edge of the platform. Detectives <a href="Frank%20Pembleton">Pembleton</a> (<a href="Andre%20Braugher">Andre Braugher</a>) and <a href="Tim%20Bayliss">Bayliss</a> (<a href="Kyle%20Secor">Kyle Secor</a>) arrive to investigate and are told the man's <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a> is severed. Although Lange is not feeling much pain, emergency personnel tell the detectives he has less than an hour to live and will die as soon as he is moved. Bayliss questions Larry Biedron (<a href="Bruce%20MacVittie">Bruce MacVittie</a>), who was involved with the altercation that led to Lange's fall. Biedron says he was bumped from behind with Lange, but witnesses give conflicting reports: Some say that Biedron pushed Lange, some that Lange pushed Biedron, and others say that it was an accident. Pembleton tries to talk to Lange, who becomes uncooperative and angry when told he will die.

Lange says that his girlfriend, Sarah Flannigan (Laura MacDonald), is jogging near the <a href="Inner%20Harbor">harbor</a>, so Pembleton sends detectives <a href="Meldrick%20Lewis">Lewis</a> (<a href="Clark%20Johnson">Clark Johnson</a>) and Falsone (<a href="Jon%20Seda">Jon Seda</a>) to look for her. Lewis and Falsone talk about the nature of death while questioning random joggers; their search effort proves fruitless. Lange tries to convince <a href="Emergency%20medical%20technician">EMT</a> Joy Tolson (Wendee Pratt) to give him painkillers, but she refuses because it will reduce their chances of saving his life, even while she insists he cannot be saved. Pembleton keeps Lange company, despite his initial annoyance at Lange's bullying and mean-spirited attitude. The emergency personnel plan to use <a href="airbag">airbag</a>s to push the subway train away from the platform, then pull Lange free and rush him to the hospital.

Pembleton and Lange grow closer; Lange experiences more pain as time passes, and switches among remorse, anger, and casual small talk during their conversations. Later, Pembleton holds Lange's hand to comfort him and confides about his <a href="Frank%20Pembleton%23The%20stroke">recent stroke</a>. Bayliss grows suspicious when Biedron says that he cannot recall his last place of work or when he moved to Baltimore. Biedron eventually admits that he had been criminally charged and placed into a psychiatric ward for pushing a man in front of a <a href="Chicago%20%26quot%3BL%26quot%3B">Chicago subway</a> train for no reason. Biedron is arrested, and Bayliss confirms to Pembleton that Lange was pushed; Pembleton decides not to tell Lange because he does not think that it will comfort him, but Lange figures it out for himself by observing their conversation. Lange experiences greater pain and starts to lose consciousness. After saying "I'm OK" to Pembleton, Lange falls unconscious and the EMTs push the train with the airbags. Lange dies immediately after he is removed. A shocked and disoriented Pembleton leaves the subway and, after staring at Biedron in the back of a police squad car, walks to his vehicle while recalling a line about how sugar maple leaves behave when it rains (a line that Lange said as he was dying). He then drives away with Bayliss. The episode ends with Flannigan jogging past the subway station.

<a href="James%20Yoshimura">James Yoshimura</a>, one of the "" writers and supervising producers, first conceived the story for "Subway" after watching an episode of the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> series "<a href="Taxicab%20Confessions">Taxicab Confessions</a>", which features hidden-camera footage of taxi passengers discussing their lives with the drivers. In the episode he saw, a <a href="New%20York%20Police%20Department">New York Police Department</a> detective discussed an experience in which a man was pushed and trapped between a subway train and station platform. Although the man was initially still alive, the homicide department was called in to investigate because emergency officials said they knew that he would eventually die. The detective said that the incident was the most upsetting thing he ever saw. He likened the twisting of the body to that of a plastic bag being spun around quickly and turning like a corkscrew, and said that when the train was removed and the body was twisted back, "All your guts fall down and in less than a minute, you're dead."

Yoshimura first pitched the show to the "Homicide: Life on the Street" production team in May 1997 at the <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> production center of executive producer <a href="Barry%20Levinson">Barry Levinson</a>. The episode was discussed and well-received during a round-table discussion involving Levinson, executive producer <a href="Tom%20Fontana">Tom Fontana</a>, producer <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a>, supervising producer Julie Martin, and consulting producer Gail Mutrux. During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve the homicide case quickly and get the trains moving again, an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script. Levinson suggested ending the episode with the detectives walking back to the surface, then feeling the hum and vibration of the train starting back up under their feet. This suggestion, however, did not appear in the final episode.

Distressed from a long stretch of poor ratings, <a href="NBC">NBC</a> executives placed pressure on "Homicide: Life on the Street" producers to improve its viewership and become more popular than its higher-rated time-slot competitor, "<a href="Nash%20Bridges">Nash Bridges</a>". Yoshimura and the other producers, however, decided to continue pushing the envelope with "Subway" because they felt the series needed to maintain its quality and survive. "Subway" had to be <a href="greenlight">greenlight</a>ed by NBC before a script could be written, and Yoshimura anticipated backlash about the episode. He said, "Every episode, we have trouble with NBC, so this is no different. We've fought that battle, we've had five years of that, so it doesn't matter to us." However, the executives were surprisingly enthusiastic about the premise. <a href="Warren%20Littlefield">Warren Littlefield</a>, then-president of NBC Entertainment, said his first reaction was "the classic response of a network programmer: 'Oh my God, this is scary, but that he quickly came around to the idea and greenlighted the project.

In writing the script for "Subway", Yoshimura wanted the Pembleton character to be confronted with his own mortality, a theme that had continued from the previous season in which the character suffered a stroke. Although Pembleton does not typically discuss his own feelings, Yoshimura wanted him to be placed in a situation in which he not only discussed death, but is also led by the unique circumstance of Lange's subway incident to confide his stroke experience to an almost complete stranger. From the beginning of the writing process, Yoshimura specifically wanted the Lange character to be mean and unpleasant, rather than the nice and innocent victim more typically portrayed in such television episodes: "Tragedy can happen to jerky people too and I think it'd be much more interesting to see how that kind of character's circumstances transcends the typical cliched TV kind of victim."

Yoshimura wanted Braugher to treat D'Onofrio like he was "bad luck" and try to keep his distance at first, but gradually come to view him as a person and form a close bond with him by the end of the episode. A <a href="New%20York%20City%20Fire%20Department">New York City firefighter</a>, Tim Brown, was a consultant for most of the technical information in the episode. In addition to helping Yoshimura with the dialogue from medical staff characters, Brown advised Yoshimura on the method of using air bags to push the subway train forward and remove Lange's body. Yoshimura included conflicting reports from witnesses about how the incident took place, which the writer described as a ""<a href="Rashomon%20%28film%29">Rashomon</a>" thing", in reference to the 1950 Japanese film in which several characters offer differing descriptions of the same murder. "Subway" continued a sixth season trend in which the detectives became more personally involved with the victims, and thus becoming more emotionally drained at their deaths. For example, in the episode "Birthday", which aired a month earlier, Falsone interviewed a victim who eventually died at the conclusion of the episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.

Yoshimura included a <a href="subplot">B story</a> of Lewis and Falsone looking for Lange's girlfriend to provide <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a> and so that the entire episode would not be confined to the subway platform location. Yoshimura wanted the two detectives to also discuss the nature of mortality and death, but deliberately included black humor in their dialogue and made sure the characters did not act "teary-eyed [or] philosophical", because he believed it would be clichéd and an inaccurate depiction of how real detectives would behave. Some viewers were offended or startled by the flippant nature of the discussions about death between the two characters. Lange's girlfriend jogged behind Lewis and Falsone during a scene in which the two detectives were distracted in a discussion; Yoshimura deliberately included this in the episode to create a moment of irony. The line by Falsone to a jogger, "Are you sure you're not Sarah?", and Lewis' mocking reaction to the question, were both <a href="Ad%20libitum">ad-libbed</a> by the actors.

Executive producers <a href="Barry%20Levinson">Barry Levinson</a> and <a href="Tom%20Fontana">Tom Fontana</a> reviewed the script after it was finished and made minor suggestions for changes. In the original script, Yoshimura made Pembleton more confrontational with the firefighters and emergency personnel, but this aspect of the script was changed when Fontana suggested it was too distracting. NBC executives indicated they would have preferred Lewis and Falsone find Lange's girlfriend and bring her back to the subway station before Lange died, but Yoshimura described that scenario as a "typical TV ending" and was vehemently opposed to any such change. Fontana also defended the original ending because he said Pembleton ends up filling the role that Lange's girlfriend would have filled.

On August 18, 1997, four days before shooting on the episode began, NBC censors provided 17 pages of notes to Yoshimura requiring changes regarding violence and language. A typical "Homicide: Life on the Street" episode usually results in only three or four pages. Yoshimura made several modifications with the help of his writing assistant <a href="Joy%20Lusco">Joy Lusco</a>, a future writer on Simon's HBO series "<a href="The%20Wire">The Wire</a>". The changes included removing several instances of the words "ass" and "bitch" from the script. Lange's line, "Why am I even saying the son of a bitch's name?" was changed to "Why am I even saying the twerp's name?", and his line, "Go find another train and throw your miserable stupid ass in front of it" was changed to "throw yourself in front of it".

Consulting producer Gail Mutrux recommended feature film director <a href="Gary%20Fleder">Gary Fleder</a> to direct "Subway" because she believed he would provide visually engaging direction without distracting from the story in the script. Other "Homicide: Life on the Street" producers were not familiar with Fleder. When Mutrux told them the name of one of his previous films, "<a href="Things%20to%20Do%20in%20Denver%20When%20You%27re%20Dead">Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead</a>", Yoshimura became concerned Fleder was "one of these indie kind of guys [who is] going to come in and try to reinvent our show", a problem he had experienced with other directors in the past. After watching "Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead", however, Yoshimura believed Fleder would be perfect to direct "Subway" because he felt that Fleder could provide strong visuals to a story that took place in one location, and prevent the script from becoming too static and boring. Upon being offered the job, Fleder thought that it would be a challenge due to most of the action being confined to a single set, but accepted the director position based on the strength of Yoshimura's script:, "The script was terrific. And for me, the big issue from day one was, 'How do I not screw it up?'" Yoshimura said that feature directors often struggle with "Homicide: Life on the Street" because they are used to working at a slower and more deliberate pace than the typical eight-day filming period of a single episode. Additionally, Yoshimura said, they have little time to adjust to the regular cast and crew, which he described as a "closed community [who are] used to shooting or working a certain way on this show, and then have their rhythms and their patterns and their habits".
Casting director Brett Goldstein contacted Vincent D'Onofrio's agent about playing the part of John Lange, but the agent said D'Onofrio would never work in television and refused to even suggest the part to the actor. Goldstein remained convinced the actor was right for the role, and mailed the script directly to D'Onofrio; the actor liked the script and agreed to play the part. The agent later contacted Goldstein a second time, and they got into a dispute over how much money D'Onofrio would be paid. Yoshimura said that D'Onofrio was not the kind of actor he originally envisioned for the part, although he later praised his performance. D'Onofrio said he was attracted to the part based on the strength of the script and the reputation of "Homicide: Life on the Street", although he had never seen the show himself. Fleder, D'Onofrio and Andre Braugher had only between two and three hours to read the script, discuss the characters and rehearse the material. Braugher said his first reaction to the episode premise was that it was a "horrifying idea" because he thought it would be sensational and end with a clichéd moral, which Braugher said "frankly, nauseated me, the idea of that". But Braugher said that he was extremely satisfied with Yoshimura's final script.

Bruce MacVittie auditioned for the role of Larry Biedron by mailing a tape of himself performing to the show's producers. Yoshimura had previously seen MacVittie perform on the New York City stage and thought that he was a "wonderful, wonderful actor". After watching his rehearsal tape, Yoshimura settled on MacVittie for the part based not only on his acting, but also on his short physical stature. Yoshimura said, "I'm watching this tape and I'm thinking, 'Yeah, this little guy! Who would suspect this little guy to have these murderous kinds of tendencies. Laura MacDonald was also cast as Lange's girlfriend Sarah Flannigan based on an audition tape she sent to the show. Wendee Pratt was cast as emergency medical technician Joy Tolson, who works to help Lange throughout the episode but does not get along with him. Yoshimura said that he particularly enjoyed Pratt's performance "because she's not playing at all sympathetic. This guy's a pain in her ass." <a href="Shari%20Elliker">Shari Elliker</a>, a <a href="WBAL%20%28AM%29">WBAL (AM)</a> disc jockey from the Baltimore area, made a cameo appearance as a witness in the subway.

NBC sought permission to film "Subway" in an MTA station, but the authority was initially hesitant to allow filming for a script that portrayed their train as the source of a fatal accident. Since it was too late to build a set, co-executive producer <a href="Jim%20Finnerty">Jim Finnerty</a> told Yoshimura to wait before writing the script because of the strong possibility that the episode could never be filmed. When Yoshimura insisted on continuing anyway, Finnerty angrily stormed out of the meeting. However, Finnerty was eventually able to convince the authority to allow filming in one of their stations. Yoshimura also sought 300 extras to play firefighters, emergency medical personnel, transit workers and commuters. Finnerty authorized the use of more extras than an episode usually received, but refused to pay for 300 extras, forcing Yoshimura to make minor modifications to the script.

Seven days of pre-production began on August 15, 1997. On the first day, Fleder met with Yoshimura and Fontana to discuss the script and the director's vision for the episode. Fleder suggested modifying the prologue, and <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ed the introduction which was included in the episode. The new prologue involved commuters coming down to the train station while a street band performed, leading up to the subway accident before the opening credits rolled. The song featured in this prologue, "Killing Time", was written by Lisa Matthews, the lead singer of the Baltimore-area band Love Riot. Matthews also had a brief cameo on "Subway" as one of the witnesses to Lange's fall. On August 16, the show creators scouted out the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital%20%28Metro%20Subway%20station%29">Johns Hopkins Hospital Metro Subway Station</a>, where the episode was to be filmed. At the request of the authority, the subway was renamed the fictional Inner Harbor station during filming. Fleder himself had only one hour to scout the location with his technical crew. Art director <a href="Vincent%20Peranio">Vincent Peranio</a> created a dummy wall to place in the empty space between two subway cars, making it appear that the two trains were one big car. Inside the dummy wall was a space in which the actor could stand and appear cut. Stunt coordinator G.A. Aguilar also choreographed the accident that day, and Peranio simulated the accident itself by tying a dummy into the hole in the dummy wall. Peranio originally wanted a stuntman to fall against the moving train, spin and fall into the padded hole in the dummy wall, but the transit authority refused to allow it.

The episode was filmed in seven days, starting on August 26, 1997. The MTA gave permission for filming to take place in one of their subways, but only allowed shooting to take place between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. when the trains were not running. The restrictive hours, short preparation time, confining shooting space and excessive heat due to lack of ventilation created additional stresses to the crew of more than 100 people during the filming of the episode. The tight schedule and lack of rehearsal time was difficult on the actors, but D'Onofrio said that it added "a certain velocity and energy" to the shoot, which made the dialogue from the actors feel less rehearsed and more spontaneous. Yoshimura served as the on-set consulting editor during filming along with fellow producer <a href="David%20Simon">David Simon</a>, who wrote the book "", from which the series was adapted. The cast and crew shot between seven and nine pages of the script each of the seven production days. Fleder said he was impressed by this pace because he usually shoots between one and two pages per day during his movies, and he said that the actors on "Homicide: Life on the Street" were better prepared and more cooperative than his usual film actors.

Fleder dedicated a great deal of focus to establishing the correct chemistry between Braugher and D'Onofrio. Fleder said, "The energy between them had to be [strong] because they're carrying the episode. The audience is centered on them and if either of them falters, the whole episode kind of falls apart." The first day of shooting had to take place outside the subway station, so all outside scenes were shot first. As a result, the final scenes of the film were shot on the first day. Among those scenes were Pembleton leaving the subway in a daze following Lange's death; Yoshimura deeply regretted that this was one of the first scenes shot because he felt that the performance would have been more moving if Braugher had some previous dramatic interaction with D'Onofrio.

The stunt simulating Lange's fall into the subway train was filmed on August 27, the second production day, and Yoshimura said that it was the most challenging part of the shoot. D'Onofrio and MacVittie had to arrive at the platform just as the subway train was approaching, and their scene had to be reshot several times because the train did not pass the actors on time. The crew also filmed shots of a dummy dressed as Lange being dragged by the train inside the dummy wall, but most of those scenes were not used in the final cut. The remaining five filming days focused primarily on the scenes between Braugher and D'Onofrio, which Yoshimura and Fleder felt were the most crucial element of the episode. During the filming of the climactic scene with Pembleton and Lange which ends with Lange's death, several members of the crew reacted emotionally, something Yoshimura said is extremely rare because the crew members typically look at their work as a job and do not become emotionally invested in the story that they are filming.

While shooting the first subway scenes, D'Onofrio's performance was over-the-top and bombastic. Yoshimura asked him to act a little calmer during the earlier scenes and save the energy for the later scenes, because "if he did go up right away, there was nowhere else for him to go after that". D'Onofrio agreed and modified his performance accordingly. Fleder also clashed with MacVittie over his portrayal of the Biedron character. Fleder felt that the character appeared too crazy in earlier scenes, and that the actor was <a href="Telegraphing%20%28entertainment%29">telegraphing</a> the twist in which MacVittie would turn out to be a murderer. MacVittie approached Yoshimura about the criticism, but Yoshimura agreed with Fleder's interpretation. After MacVittie toned down the character's behavior, Fleder said that he was extremely pleased with the end result.

Many of the firefighters appearing as extras in "Subway" were Baltimore firefighters. Yoshimura said that the firefighters who appeared to be running in the episode were actors, while the real firefighters walked slowly because, based on their real-life experience, they knew that there would be no need to rush in a situation involving a fatality. Although power on the railings were turned off during shooting, the crew and producers were not aware that some residual electricity continues to run through the cars even after the tracks have been shut down. At one point during the shooting, D'Onofrio felt a charge of that electricity run through him and said, "I'm really feeling something strange here." The crew initially believed D'Onofrio to be ad-libbing a line of dialogue in character, but eventually realized he was being electrified. When the MTA explained about the residual electricity, the crew installed rubber insulation so that D'Onofrio would not touch the metal of the train and experience any electricity. Fleder was impressed that D'Onofrio continued with the shoot, and said, "Most actors I worked with would've left the set at that point."

"Subway" was shot by <a href="Alex%20Zakrzewski">Alex Zakrzewski</a>, the series' regular director of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, and by the end is sitting next to him and holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although "Homicide: Life on the Street" typically employs a number of back-and-forth <a href="whip%20pan">whip pan</a>-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider <a href="long%20shot">long shot</a>s to create a sense of setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.

Fleder also asked for stylistic touches on the episode which were inconsistent with the show's typical emphasis on documentary-style realism. For example, he arranged for red <a href="scrim%20%28lighting%29">scrim lighting</a> to reflect on the subway car to add an artistic visual touch, even though there was nothing in particular in the subway station that reflected such a light. Upon hearing of the technique, Yoshimura was initially concerned, saying "Oh, he's getting artsy fartsy with me." Just before Lange's death, Fleder included a close-up with Braugher looking directly into the camera, breaking the <a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a> in a way typically forbidden on the show. During an outdoor dialogue scene between Johnson and Seda while the characters were driving in a car, Fleder filmed it by placing the camera outside the car's front windshield and panning back and forth between the two actors. Unbeknownst to Fleder, all car shots on "Homicide: Life on the Street" are only allowed to be filmed from inside the car to keep the scene more realistic. As a result of Fleder's car scene, a memo was circulated to the cast and crew reminding them of this policy and threatening to fire anybody who allowed a scene to be shot through the windshield again.

The episode was edited by series regular Jay Rabinowitz in a <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> NBC facility, with consultation at various times by Fleder, Yoshimura and Tom Fontana. Rabinowitz edited the episode for several days alone, then worked with Fleder for four days, making hundreds of edits to the episode. Yoshimura worked with the editor next and was disappointed with the first cut of the episode that he saw, claiming that it needed to be "a lot more frenetic and chaotics at the end, and not so artsy". Yoshimura also told Rabinowitz that the final cut of the episode should place strong emphasis on Braugher because he felt that the story is experienced "through his eyes". During the editing process, Yoshimura originally removed a scene featuring a silhouette of Pembleton riding the escalator out of the subway station after Lange died. Yoshimura felt that the shot was too sentimental, but Levinson personally had it placed back in the episode after Fleder claimed to have "begged" for it to be included. When Fontana first watched the episode, he felt that the prologue was too confusing because it was difficult to tell what happened during the accident scene. It was edited so that rather focusing on medium shots of D'Onofrio and MacVittie, it included a wider shot to establish the presence of a subway train before the accident so viewers would not be so confused.

Audio tracks were mixed with recorded sounds from real subway cars, as well as PA system announcements, to make the episode sound more authentic. In the original episode, Pembleton grabbed Biedron by the collar of his shirt while Biedron sat in the back of a squad car during one of the final scenes. The scene was modified so that Pembleton only looked at Biedron, because Yoshimura felt that the scene was just as effective without him grabbing Biedron. During the last scene of the episode, in which Lange's girlfriend jogs by the subway station and ignores the emergency vehicles, Rabinowitz was originally instructed to include a musical score. He tried many different types of music, including rock music, Irish music, classical music, jazz, and piano riffs. When none of the music worked, Fontana suggested including no music at all, and it was agreed the silence was the most effective solution. Fontana said that after watching the episode repeatedly during the editing process, he liked the final product but doubted he would watch it again for a long time because it was "too emotionally draining".

"Subway" was originally scheduled to air during the 1997 November <a href="sweeps">sweeps</a> season, but lower-than-expected ratings for the three-part sixth season premiere, "", prompted NBC to move its broadcast date to December 5 and heavily promote it. The strategy also gave the press more time to preview it and generate reviews. Warren Littlefield said, "The feeling was let's get out of the insanity of the sweeps and say, 'This is a little different'—hopefully we'll bring more people to this episode." During this time, the episode was renamed "The Accident" in some advertising materials.

When all the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> markets were accounted for, "Subway" was listed as having been seen by 10.3 million households. It was the third-highest ranked show in its time-slot, behind <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>'s "<a href="20/20%20%28US%20television%20series%29">20/20</a>", which was seen by 17.7 million households, and <a href="CBS">CBS</a>'s "<a href="Nash%20Bridges">Nash Bridges</a>", which was seen by 11.9 million. NBC executives had hoped that the extensive promotion and press coverage of "Subway" would help it outperform "Nash Bridges" and so lift "Homicide: Life on the Street" above its usual third place in the rankings. When it did not, "Subway" was considered a commercial failure, and helped fuel already existing discussions within NBC on whether to cancel the show.

Reviews were overwhelmingly positive for "Subway". It was identified by "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" as one of the ten best episodes of the series, with "Sun" writer Chris Kaltenbach declaring, "Dramas don't come any better than this." Kinney Littlefield of "<a href="The%20Orange%20County%20Register">The Orange County Register</a>" said it was "perhaps the best "Homicide" episode ever" and praised D'Onofrio's performance. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" gave the episode its highest rating of four stars. Tom Shales of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called it, "a tour de force for D'Onofrio and Braugher". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" writer Bruce Fretts said, "This is as gripping an hour of television as you're ever likely to see." Television and literary critic <a href="John%20Leonard%20%28critic%29">John Leonard</a> said that "Subway" was "an artistic experience that is as genuine and accomplished and crafted as you will get anywhere". David P. Kalat, author of "Homicide: Life on the Street: The Unofficial Companion", said of the episode, "Writer James Yoshimura proves that he has not lost his touch, with yet another truly grueling screenplay."

"Subway" won a 1998 <a href="Peabody%20Award">Peabody Award</a> for excellence in television broadcasting. The episode also received two <a href="50th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">Emmy Award</a> nominations for the 1997-98 season. James Yoshimura was nominated for an Emmy for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20-%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series</a> for the episode's script, and Vincent D'Onofrio received a nomination for <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Guest%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series</a>. It lost both nominations; "<a href="NYPD%20Blue">NYPD Blue</a>" won the best writing Emmy for the <a href="NYPD%20Blue%20%28Season%205%29">fifth season</a> episode "Lost Israel", and <a href="John%20Larroquette">John Larroquette</a> won the guest actor award for his appearance in "Betrayal", a second season episode of "<a href="The%20Practice">The Practice</a>". However, Jay Rabinowitz and Wayne Hyde won an <a href="Monitor%20Group">International Monitor Award</a> for best editing in a film-oriented television series.

In 2009, "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" ranked "Subway" #25 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.

Vincent D'Onofrio's character in "Subway" partially inspired the creation of the antagonist played by <a href="Bryan%20Cranston">Bryan Cranston</a> in "<a href="Drive%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Drive</a>", a <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> episode of "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", which first aired on November 15, 1998. In the episode, Cranston's character is unpleasant and anti-semitic, but he is dying throughout the episode, and screenwriter <a href="Vince%20Gilligan">Vince Gilligan</a> intended for the audience to sympathize with him despite his unlikeable qualities. Gilligan said that this was influenced by "Subway", which he called an "amazing episode". He said of D'Onofio's character: "The brilliant thing they did in this episode, the thing that stuck with me, was this guy's an asshole, the guy really is unpleasant, and yet at the end (you) still feel his humanity." The casting of Cranston in this role directly led Gilligan to eventually cast him as the lead in his television series "<a href="Breaking%20Bad">Breaking Bad</a>".

<a href="WGBH-TV">WGBH-TV</a>, a Boston-based <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">Public Broadcasting Service</a> station, produced a 75-minute television documentary about the episode "Subway" called "Anatomy of a "Homicide: Life on the Street"". The documentary was written, produced and directed by filmmaker Theodore Bogosian, and was originally broadcast on November 4, 1998, at 9 p.m. on PBS. The film focused predominantly on James Yoshimura, beginning with his conception of the script and ending with his reaction to the episode's television broadcast and the ratings numbers. The documentary included a brief featurette about "Homicide: Life on the Street" and its history of both critical acclaim and low ratings. It also focused on the balance between art and business, with Yoshimura and the other producers trying to produce an intelligent, high-quality episode while also capturing high ratings.

The documentary crew put <a href="wireless%20microphone">wireless microphone</a>s on several of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of "Subway". Many people involved with the show found the process extremely disruptive. In particular, Fleder said that he hates to be photographed and found the camera crew distracting and stressful. Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, you have to be really, really focused, and for me the thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus."

<a href="Rob%20Owen%20%28journalist%29">Rob Owen</a>, television editor of the "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>", said that the documentary provided an interesting, entertaining and detailed look behind the scenes of the show. Owen said that this was "rare, because TV doesn't usually reveal details about itself. It's nice to see PBS pulling back the curtain on its competition, and I wish it happened more often." Manuel Mendoza of "<a href="The%20Dallas%20Morning%20News">The Dallas Morning News</a>" praised it, calling it "a documentary as rare to public TV as "Homicide" is to commercial television", but said that it "falls short of being definitive" because it cannot address all elements of the series due to its brief running time. Several commentators praised the humorous scene in the documentary in which Yoshimura goes line-by-line through his script and replaces curse words based on orders from NBC censors.

Samlesbury witches

The Samlesbury witches were three women from the <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> village of <a href="Samlesbury">Samlesbury</a> – Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley – accused by a 14-year-old girl, Grace Sowerbutts, of practising <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. Their trial at <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a> <a href="Assize%20Court">Assizes</a> in England on 19 August 1612 was one in a series of <a href="witch%20trial">witch trial</a>s held there over two days, among the most famous in English history. The trials were unusual for England at that time in two respects: Thomas Potts, the <a href="Court%20clerk">clerk to the court</a>, published the proceedings in his "<a href="The%20Wonderfull%20Discoverie%20of%20Witches%20in%20the%20Countie%20of%20Lancaster">The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster</a>"; and the number of the accused found guilty and hanged was unusually high, ten at Lancaster and another at <a href="York">York</a>. All three of the Samlesbury women were acquitted however.

The charges against the women included <a href="child%20murder">child murder</a> and <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a>. In contrast, the others tried at the same assizes, who included the <a href="Pendle%20witches">Pendle witches</a>, were accused of "<a href="Maleficium%20%28sorcery%29">maleficium</a>" – causing harm by witchcraft. The case against the three women collapsed "spectacularly" when the chief prosecution witness, Grace Sowerbutts, was exposed by the trial judge to be "the perjuring tool of a Catholic priest".

Many historians, notably <a href="Hugh%20Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a>, have suggested that the witch trials of the 16th and 17th centuries were a consequence of the religious struggles of the period, with both the Catholic and Protestant Churches determined to stamp out what they regarded as <a href="heresy">heresy</a>. The trial of the Samlesbury witches is perhaps one clear example of that trend; it has been described as "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", and even as a show-trial, to demonstrate that Lancashire, considered at that time to be a wild and lawless region, was being purged not only of witches but also of "popish plotters" (i.e. <a href="recusancy">recusant</a> Catholics).

<a href="James%20I%20of%20England">King James I</a>, who came to the <a href="Throne%20of%20England">English throne</a> from <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 1603, had a keen interest in witchcraft. By the early 1590s, he was convinced that Scottish witches were plotting against him. His 1597 book, "<a href="Daemonologie">Daemonologie</a>", instructed his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. In 1604, the year following James's accession to the English throne, a new witchcraft law was enacted, "An Act against Conjuration, Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked spirits", imposing the death penalty for causing harm by the use of magic or the exhumation of corpses for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.

The accused witches lived in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, an English county which, at the end of the 16th century, was regarded by the authorities as a wild and lawless region, "fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people". Since the death of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Queen Mary</a> and the accession to the throne of her half-sister <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth</a> in 1558, <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> priests had been forced into hiding, but in remote areas like Lancashire they continued to celebrate <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> in secret. In early 1612, the year of the trials, each <a href="justice%20of%20the%20peace">justice of the peace</a> (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of the <a href="recusant">recusant</a>s in their area – those who refused to attend the services of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, a criminal offence at that time.

The 16th-century <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, during which the Church of England broke away from the authority of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of <a href="Samlesbury%20Hall">Samlesbury Hall</a>. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, but the rest of the family remained staunchly Catholic.

One of the accused witches, Jane Southworth, was the widow of the disinherited son, John. Relations between John and his father do not seem to have been amicable; according to a statement made by John Singleton, in which he referred to Sir John as his "old Master", Sir John refused even to pass his son's house if he could avoid it, and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband. Jane Southworth (née Sherburne) and John were married in about 1598, and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall. Jane had been widowed only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612, and had seven children.

On 21 March 1612, Alizon Device, who lived just outside the Lancashire village of <a href="Fence%2C%20Lancashire">Fence</a>, near <a href="Pendle%20Hill">Pendle Hill</a>, encountered John Law, a pedlar from <a href="Halifax%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Halifax</a>. She asked him for some pins, which he refused to give to her, and a few minutes later Law suffered a stroke, for which he blamed Alizon. Along with her mother Elizabeth and her brother James, Alizon was summoned to appear before local magistrate Roger Nowell on 30 March 1612. Based on the evidence and confessions he obtained, Nowell committed Alizon and ten others to Lancaster Gaol to be tried at the next assizes for "<a href="Maleficium%20%28sorcery%29">maleficium</a>", causing harm by witchcraft.

Other Lancashire magistrates learned of Nowell's discovery of witchcraft in the county, and on 15 April 1612 JP Robert Holden began investigations in his own area of Samlesbury. As a result, eight individuals were committed to Lancaster Assizes, three of whom – Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley – were accused of practising witchcraft on Grace Sowerbutts, Jennet's granddaughter and Ellen's niece.

The trial was held on 19 August 1612 before Sir Edward Bromley, a judge seeking promotion to a <a href="Circuit%20court">circuit</a> nearer <a href="London">London</a>, and who may therefore have been keen to impress King James, the head of the judiciary. Before the trial began, Bromley ordered the release of five of the eight defendants from Samlesbury, with a warning about their future conduct. The remainder – Jane Southworth, Jennet Bierley, and Ellen Bierley – were accused of using "diverse devillish and wicked Arts, called Witchcrafts, Inchauntments, Charmes, and Sorceries, in and upon one Grace Sowerbutts", to which they pleaded not guilty. Fourteen-year-old Grace was the chief prosecution witness.

Grace was the first to give evidence. In her statement she claimed that both her grandmother and aunt, Jennet and Ellen Bierley, were able to transform themselves into dogs and that they had "haunted and vexed her" for years. She further alleged that they had transported her to the top of a hayrick by her hair, and on another occasion had tried to persuade her to drown herself. According to Grace, her relatives had taken her to the house of Thomas Walshman and his wife, from whom they had stolen a baby to suck its blood. Grace claimed that the child died the following night, and that after its burial at <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Leonard%20the%20Less%2C%20Samlesbury">Samlesbury Church</a> Ellen and Jennet dug up the body and took it home, where they cooked and ate some of it and used the rest to make an ointment that enabled them to change themselves into other shapes.

Grace also alleged that her grandmother and aunt, with Jane Southworth, attended <a href="Witches%27%20Sabbath">sabbat</a>s held every Thursday and Sunday night at Red Bank, on the north shore of the <a href="River%20Ribble">River Ribble</a>. At those secret meetings they met with "foure black things, going upright, and yet not like men in the face", with whom they ate, danced, and had sex.

Thomas Walshman, the father of the baby allegedly killed and eaten by the accused, was the next to give evidence. He confirmed that his child had died of unknown causes at about one year old. He added that Grace Sowerbutts was discovered lying as if dead in his father's barn on about 15 April, and did not recover until the following day. Two other witnesses, John Singleton and William Alker, confirmed that Sir John Southworth, Jane Southworth's father-in-law, had been reluctant to pass the house where his son lived, as he believed Jane to be an "evil woman, and a Witch".

Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes, records that after hearing the evidence many of those in court were persuaded of the accused's guilt. On being asked by the judge what answer they could make to the charges laid against them, Potts reports that they "humbly fell upon their knees with weeping teares", and "desired him [Bromley] for Gods cause to examine Grace Sowerbutts". Immediately "the countenance of this Grace Sowerbutts changed"; the witnesses "began to quarrel and accuse one another", and eventually admitted that Grace had been coached in her story by a Catholic priest they called Thompson. Bromley then committed the girl to be examined by two JPs, William Leigh and Edward Chisnal. Under questioning Grace readily admitted that her story was untrue, and said she had been told what to say by Jane Southworth's uncle, Christopher Southworth aka Thompson, a <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit</a> priest who was in hiding in the Samlesbury area; Southworth was the chaplain at Samlesbury Hall, and Jane Southworth's uncle by marriage. Leigh and Chisnal questioned the three accused women in an attempt to discover why Southworth might have fabricated evidence against them, but none could offer any reason other than that each of them "goeth to the [Anglican] Church".

After the statements had been read out in court Bromley ordered the jury to find the defendants not guilty, stating that:

Potts concludes his account of the trial with the words: "Thus were these poore Innocent creatures, by the great care and paines of this honourable Judge, delivered from the danger of this Conspiracie; this bloudie practise of the Priest laid open".

Almost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was instructed to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be "truly reported" and "fit and worthie to be published". Although written as an apparently verbatim account, the book is not a report of what was actually said at the trial, but instead a reflection on what happened. Nevertheless, Potts "seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports".

In his introduction to the trial, Potts writes; "Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury." Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but he had yet to deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence "by special order and commandment", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his "masterful exposure" of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning his attention back to the remainder of the Pendle witches.

Potts declares that "this Countie of Lancashire ... now may lawfully bee said to abound asmuch in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries, Jesuites, and Papists", and describes the three accused women as having once been "obstinate Papists, and now came to Church". The judges would certainly have been keen to be regarded by King James, the head of the judiciary, as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft, the "two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire". Samlesbury Hall, the family home of the Southworths, was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests, and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612. It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to "smoke out its Jesuit chaplain", Christopher Southworth.

The English experience of witchcraft was somewhat different from the European one, with only one really mass witchhunt, that of <a href="Matthew%20Hopkins">Matthew Hopkins</a> in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> during 1645. That one incident accounted for more than 20 per cent of the number of witches it is estimated were executed in England between the early 15th and mid-18th century, fewer than 500. The English legal system also differed significantly from the inquisitorial model used in Europe, requiring members of the public to accuse their neighbours of some crime, and for the case to be decided by a jury of their peers. English witch trials of the period "revolved around popular beliefs, according to which the crime of witchcraft was one of ... evil-doing", for which tangible evidence had to be provided.
Potts devotes several pages to a fairly detailed criticism of the evidence presented in Grace Sowerbutts' statement, giving an insight into the discrepancies that existed during the early 17th century between the Protestant establishment's view of witchcraft and the beliefs of the common people, who may have been influenced by the more continental views of Catholic priests such as Christopher Southworth. Unlike their European counterparts, the English Protestant elite believed that witches kept <a href="Familiar%20spirit">familiars</a>, or companion animals, and so it was not considered credible that the Samlesbury witches had none. Grace's story of the sabbat, too, was unfamiliar to the English at that time, although belief in such secret gatherings of witches was widespread in Europe. Most demonologists of the period, including King James, held that only God could perform miracles, and that he had not given the power to go against the laws of nature to those in league with the Devil. Hence Potts dismisses Sowerbutts' claim that Jennet Bierley transformed herself into a black dog with the comment "I would know by what means any Priest can maintaine this point of Evidence". He equally lightly dismisses Grace's account of the sabbat she claimed to have attended, where she met with "foure black things ... not like men in the face", with the comment that "The Seminarie [priest] mistakes the face for the feete: For Chattox [one of the Pendle witches] and all her fellow witches agree, the Devill is cloven-footed: but Fancie [Chattox's familiar] had a very good face, and was a proper man."

It is perhaps unlikely that the accused women would have failed to draw the examining magistrate's attention to their suspicions concerning Grace Sowerbutts' motivations when first examined, only to do so at the very end of their trial when asked by the judge if they had anything to say in their defence. The trial of the Samlesbury witches in 1612 may have been "largely a piece of anti-Catholic propaganda", or even a "show-trial", the purpose of which was to demonstrate that Lancashire was being purged not only of witches, but also of "popish plotters".

Bromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by King James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618 he was given responsibility for "collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years". Jane Southworth's eldest son, Thomas, eventually inherited his grandfather's estate of Samlesbury Hall.

Western Australian emergency of March 1944

During March 1944, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies of World War II</a> rapidly reinforced the military units located in the state of <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> to defend against the possibility that Japanese warships would attack the cities of <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a> and <a href="Perth">Perth</a>. This redeployment began on 8 March after concerns were raised about the purpose of Japanese warship movements near the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a>, and ended on 20 March, after it was concluded that an attack was unlikely.

In February 1944, the Allies became alarmed that the movement of the main Japanese fleet to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> could be a precursor to raids in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, including against Western Australia. The emergency began when Allied code breakers detected the movement of a powerful force of Japanese warships in the Netherlands East Indies in early March. After a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> submarine made <a href="radar">radar</a> contact with two Japanese warships near one of the entrances to the Indian Ocean on 6 March, the Allied military authorities and Australian Government judged that a fleet may have been heading towards the Perth area. In reality, these warships were undertaking a patrol while awaiting a small raiding force to return from attacking ships in the central Indian Ocean.

In response to the perceived threat, the Allied military units stationed in Western Australia were placed on alert, and reinforcements were dispatched. These included six <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> flying <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadrons</a>. Other Allied air units were held at <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> to respond to raids on that town or reinforce Western Australia if the Japanese fleet was sighted. An air raid warning was sounded in Fremantle and Perth on 10 March, but this proved to be a false alarm. Intensive patrols by the Allied militaries did not detect any Japanese warships off Western Australia, and most units were stood down on 12 March. On the 20th of the month it was concluded that the threat of attack had passed, and the air reinforcements that had been sent to Western Australia returned to their bases.

<a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a>, <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>, was an important port throughout World War II. From the start of the war, it was the assembly point for <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s of Allied ships travelling between Australia, the Middle East and Europe. Soon after the outbreak of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, the city became a key operating and maintenance location for <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> submarines. The <a href="Fremantle%20submarine%20base">Fremantle submarine base</a> was established in March 1942, and eventually became the US Navy's second-largest submarine base after <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Navy">Royal Netherlands Navy</a> submarines were also stationed at Fremantle from 1942, and the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> began transferring submarines there in mid-1944. Allied submarines operating from Fremantle played a key role in the <a href="Allied%20submarines%20in%20the%20Pacific%20War">offensive against Japanese shipping</a>; over the course of the war, 154 submarines made 341 combat patrols from the port.

The Australian Government and local civilians regarded the geographically isolated Perth–Fremantle area as being vulnerable to attack. These fears <a href="Western%20Australian%20emergency%20of%20March%201942">peaked in March 1942</a> following the rapid Japanese advance through South East Asia during December 1941 and the early months of 1942. No Japanese attack on the region eventuated, though several small towns in the north of Western Australia were bombed. Concerns over Fremantle's security continued; in March 1943 Australian Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> noted as part of a message to British Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and US President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> that the port was vulnerable to bombardment by Japanese warships or aircraft flying from aircraft carriers.

Elements of the Australian and United States militaries were assigned to the defence of the Perth–Fremantle area. Each of the Australian military's three services maintained a separate headquarters in Western Australia, their efforts coordinated by Combined Defence Headquarters. In the event of attack, the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army's</a> <a href="III%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">III Corps</a> would assume overall control. By early 1944, the forces assigned to the region's defence had been reduced from their peak strength. Nevertheless, several <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> and <a href="Coastal%20defence%20and%20fortification">coastal defence</a> batteries were located in and near Perth and Fremantle to protect the cities from attack. These units were primarily manned by <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a> (VDC) part-time personnel, who would be called up if a threat developed. Three <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) flying squadrons were also stationed around Perth; <a href="No.%2085%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 85 Squadron</a> provided air defence with <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a> <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, <a href="No.%2014%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 14 Squadron</a> patrolled off the Western Australian coast using <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Bristol Beaufort</a> light bombers and <a href="No.%2025%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 25 Squadron</a> operated <a href="Vultee%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeance</a> dive bombers. The US Navy's <a href="Patrol%20Wing%23Fleet%20Air%20Wing%20TEN%281st%29">Patrol Wing 10</a> augmented the Australian forces and conducted long-range patrols over the Indian Ocean from Perth with <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Consolidated PBY Catalina</a> flying boats.

In February 1944, the <a href="Combined%20Fleet">Combined Fleet</a>, the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy's</a> main striking force, withdrew from its base at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> in the Central <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> to <a href="Palau">Palau</a> and Singapore. The appearance of a powerful naval force at Singapore alarmed the Allies, as it was feared that these ships would conduct raids into the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia. In response, the Allies strengthened the British <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> in the central Indian Ocean by transferring two British <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> as well as several US Navy warships from the Pacific. The number of air units in <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a> and the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> region was also increased. Reinforcements for the 16 US Navy submarines based at Fremantle were also dispatched, but most of these boats did not arrive until after mid-March. The submarines were tasked with attacking the Japanese fleet in South East Asian waters.

General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur's</a> General Headquarters, which was responsible for the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, assessed in February that the Combined Fleet could potentially attack the <a href="Fremantle%20Harbour">port of Fremantle</a>. It was thought that the purpose of any such raid would be to divert Allied forces from the offensives they were about to launch in the Pacific. MacArthur did not move any additional forces to Western Australia at this time, but developed plans to reinforce the area if necessary. It was believed that land-based aircraft would be sufficient to counter any attacks on Fremantle and, on 28 February, General Headquarters directed Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, the commander of the Allied Air Forces, to prepare to:
On 4 March, Curtin sent a <a href="Diplomatic%20cable">cable</a> to Churchill seeking the British Government's assessment of the likelihood of Japanese raids into the Indian Ocean, and the capacity of the Allied forces in the region to defeat any such attacks. Curtin's cable crossed a message Churchill had sent the previous day, which stated that while Japanese forces could conduct raids against Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean, "it is not thought that serious danger, either to India or to Western Australia, is likely to develop". Churchill's cable also noted that the Japanese would likely seek to preserve their remaining major warships for use in the later stages of the war.

Although the Australian Government was reassured by Britain's assessment of the situation, the Allied military units stationed in Western Australia made preparations to resist a possible attack. The RAAF's <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area Command</a> improved the readiness of its forces near Perth and <a href="Exmouth%20Gulf">Exmouth Gulf</a> in the north-west of the state. It also stockpiled bombs at <a href="Cunderdin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Cunderdin</a>, north-east of Perth, to be used by any heavy bombers sent as reinforcements. The readiness of the Army garrison units in the Perth–Fremantle area was also increased. The <a href="Fremantle%20Fortress">Fremantle Fortress</a> command, which was responsible for defending the port against naval bombardment or air attack, was placed on alert and ordered to station more heavy anti-aircraft guns near the city's docks. On 4 March, VDC units were directed to be able to man their assigned anti-aircraft and coastal-defence positions within 6 hours, rather than the normal warning time of 24 hours.

Despite the Allied concerns, the Japanese did not intend to send the main body of the Combined Fleet into the Indian Ocean. The ships had been withdrawn from the Central Pacific to avoid a major United States offensive that was expected to be launched against the area. Singapore had been selected as the Fleet's new base as it was close to sources of fuel and had suitable facilities to enable the ships to undertake training and maintenance before counter-attacking the Allies in the Pacific. However, it was decided to send a small force of cruisers into the Indian Ocean to conduct the first raid by Japanese surface ships on the area since early 1942.
In late February 1944, Vice-Admiral <a href="Shiro%20Takasu">Shiro Takasu</a>—the Commander in Chief of Japan's <a href="Southwest%20Area%20Fleet">Southwest Area Fleet</a>—ordered the heavy cruisers , , and to <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20raid%20%281944%29">raid Allied shipping</a> on the main route between <a href="Aden">Aden</a> and Fremantle. The three ships departed the Combined Fleet's anchorage in the <a href="Lingga%20Islands">Lingga Islands</a> near Singapore on 27 February. The light cruisers and and three destroyers (which were designated a "Security and Supply Formation") escorted the raiding force through the <a href="Sunda%20Strait">Sunda Strait</a> on 1 March. These five ships were to remain at sea for the duration of the raid, and then escort the heavy cruisers back through the Sunda Strait. The Allies were not aware of the raiding force or its departure, but Allied code breakers subsequently detected the sailing from Singapore on 4 March of a force comprising two battleships, an aircraft carrier and multiple destroyers, and determined that the ships were headed east towards <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>. Rear-Admiral <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Christie">Ralph W. Christie</a>, the commander of the Allied submarines based at Fremantle, believed that this force could attack the Perth–Fremantle area. In response, he ordered the submarine under the command of Lieutenant Commander <a href="Chester%20Nimitz%20Jr.">Chester Nimitz Jr.</a> to patrol the <a href="Lombok%20Strait">Lombok Strait</a> and report the movement of any Japanese ships into the Indian Ocean.

On 6 March, "Haddo" briefly made radar contact with, but did not sight, what Nimitz believed may have been at least two large Japanese warships near the Lombok Strait. Nimitz was unsure whether to report this inconclusive contact, but decided to do so to prevent Fremantle from being subjected to a surprise attack; he later wrote that "'Remember <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>' was the message that kept sticking in my mind". The Japanese ships detected by "Haddo" were "Kinu" and "Ōi" heading towards the Sunda Strait.

Nimitz's report caused significant concerns. On 8 March, the Australian <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee%20%28Australia%29">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> advised the Australian Government that there was a possibility that the Japanese task force had entered the Indian Ocean with the goal of attacking the Perth–Fremantle area during the full moon period around 9 March. Accordingly, actions were initiated to improve the area's defences. Also on 8 March, the commander of the Eastern Fleet, Admiral <a href="James%20Somerville">James Somerville</a>, directed all Allied ships travelling in the Indian Ocean between 80 and 100° east to divert to the south or west.

Based on the radar contact on 6 March, <a href="lunar%20phase">the phase of the Moon</a> and assumptions of the Japanese force's speed and likely flying-off positions if it included any aircraft carriers, the Allied militaries judged that any attack on the Perth–Fremantle area was most likely to occur during the early hours of 11 March. It was also possible that such an attack could be conducted any time between the night of 9/10 March and the morning of 14 March.

Allied actions to improve the Perth–Fremantle area's defences began on 8 March. All of the region's defences were manned, air patrols off the coast of Western Australia were increased and the five seaworthy US Navy submarines at the Fremantle submarine base were ordered put to sea and patrol along the expected route of the Japanese force. Two Dutch submarines based at Fremantle took up stations near <a href="Rottnest%20Island">Rottnest Island</a>, just off the coast of Fremantle. The submariners who were on leave at the start of the emergency were recalled to duty by messages broadcast over public radio stations. The port of Fremantle was closed to shipping, and the merchant ships there at the time were dispersed to the nearby <a href="Gage%20Roads">Gage Roads</a> and <a href="Cockburn%20Sound">Cockburn Sound</a>. The two US Navy submarine tenders based at Fremantle sailed to <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a> on the south coast of Western Australia. Several US Navy submarines conducting patrols in the Indian Ocean and Netherlands East Indies were also directed to take up stations that would allow them to intercept Japanese ships bound for Fremantle, or attack such a force while it was returning to base.

At a conference held at the Allied Air Headquarters in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> on 8 March, Kenney ordered Air Vice-Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">William Bostock</a>, the head of <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, to take personal command of the air defence of Western Australia and to dispatch several RAAF squadrons there as reinforcements. Kenney also directed the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a>' heavy bomber-equipped <a href="380th%20Expeditionary%20Operations%20Group">380th Bombardment Group</a> to return from New Guinea to <a href="Fenton%20Airfield">Fenton Airfield</a> near Darwin, and be ready to move to Cunderdin or Geraldton if a threat to the Fremantle area developed.

Later on 8 March, Bostock ordered a major redeployment of RAAF units to Western Australia and the Northern Territory in response to the perceived threat. The <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>-equipped <a href="No.%20452%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 452</a> and <a href="No.%20457%20Squadron%20RAAF">457 Squadrons</a> were directed to move from Darwin to Perth. <a href="No.%2018%20%28Netherlands%20East%20Indies%29%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 18 (Netherlands East Indies)</a> and <a href="No.%2031%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 31 Squadrons</a> were dispatched from airfields near Darwin area to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Learmonth">"Potshot"</a> airfield in the Exmouth Gulf region; these units operated <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">North American B-25 Mitchell</a> medium bombers and <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> heavy fighters respectively. To bolster "Potshot"'s air defences, <a href="No.%20120%20%28Netherlands%20East%20Indies%29%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron</a> was ordered to fly its <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk</a> fighters there from <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. To replace the two Spitfire squadrons, the Kittyhawk-equipped <a href="No.%2084%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 84 Squadron</a> was directed to redeploy from <a href="Horn%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Horn Island, Queensland</a>, to <a href="Strauss%20Airfield">Strauss Airfield</a> near Darwin. <a href="No.%2043%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 43 Squadron</a>, a maritime patrol unit operating Catalinas, was also ordered to Darwin from <a href="Karumba%2C%20Queensland">Karumba, Queensland</a>.

A large force of USAAF transport aircraft was assigned to help move the squadrons' personnel and equipment, and additional fuel supplies and bombs were also transported to Western Australia. The movement of each squadron took place in two parts: their aircraft and crews travelled together as the first echelon, and maintenance personnel with 14 days' worth of supplies formed the second echelon.

Air Commodore <a href="Raymond%20Brownell">Raymond Brownell</a>, the head of Western Area Command, disagreed with Bostock's decision to station three squadrons at Exmouth Gulf. Brownell believed that Exmouth Gulf was unlikely to be attacked, and units stationed there would be too far from Perth to assist that region if it was the target of a Japanese raid. Bostock believed that the Japanese force might attack the Darwin area, and wanted to retain air units at Exmouth Gulf so they could rapidly redeploy to Darwin if necessary.

The RAAF squadrons received orders to redeploy on 8 March and, after hasty preparations, began to depart their home bases the next day. The two Spitfire squadrons encountered difficult weather conditions during their long trip along the west coast from Darwin to Perth. Inadequate servicing equipment and support personnel at the airfields that they used for refuelling also caused delays. One of the Spitfires crashed at Carnarvon, and another made a forced landing at <a href="Gingin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gingin</a> near Perth. The two squadrons eventually arrived at <a href="Guildford%2C%20Western%20Australia">Guildford</a> outside of Perth on 12 March, two days later than originally planned. The squadrons' replacement at Darwin, No. 84 Squadron, also experienced difficulty moving from Horn Island. The initial attempt by this unit's 24 P-40 Kittyhawk fighters to fly from Horn Island had to be abandoned when they struck bad weather, one of the Kittyhawk pilots dying when his aircraft crashed. No. 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadron's long journey from Canberra to Exmouth Gulf was uneventful. Operations by the squadrons stationed at Exmouth Gulf were greatly disrupted on 10 March when a severe <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a> struck the area and flooded the airfield.

The Allied air units in Western and Northern Australia conducted patrols into the Indian Ocean in search of the feared Japanese force. These operations included patrols by Catalinas from Patrol Wing 10, as well as RAAF Beauforts based in Western Australia. No. 43 Squadron RAAF's Catalinas also flew night patrols out of Darwin. None of these aircraft sighted Japanese vessels. The cyclone off the coast of Western Australia greatly hampered the flights, and led to concerns that the Japanese force could be approaching under the cover of bad weather.
The air defences of the Perth–Fremantle area were improved in response to the threat of attack. No. 85 Squadron was initially the only fighter squadron available in the region, but the two Spitfire squadrons also assumed responsibility for this task within hours of their arrival on 12 March. No. 25 Squadron was assigned to attack any Japanese warships with its dive bombers. As well as these air units, the light cruiser and heavy cruiser were anchored near the merchant ships in Gage Roads on 10 March to provide anti-aircraft defence in the event of an attack.

All III Corps units were placed on six hours' notice to respond to attacks from 8 March. Training exercises were cancelled so the Corps' personnel and formations could be concentrated near the threatened region. Soldiers from the 104th Tank Attack Regiment manned anti-aircraft <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> positions near the flying boat station in the Perth suburb of <a href="Crawley%2C%20Western%20Australia">Crawley</a>. The coastal defences on Rottnest Island were also fully manned, and the 10th Garrison Battalion took up defensive positions on the island. The build-up of the region's defences was noticed by civilians, leading to rumours that a raid or invasion was imminent.

On the afternoon of 10 March, the radar station at Geraldton repeatedly detected what its crew believed was an unidentified aircraft. Acting upon advice from Brownell, the commanding officer of III Corps, Lieutenant General <a href="Gordon%20Bennett%20%28general%29">Gordon Bennett</a>, ordered an air raid warning for Fremantle and Perth. This led to No. 85 Squadron being readied, air raid sirens being sounded, <a href="air%20raid%20warden">air raid warden</a>s taking their posts, and the evacuation of hospitals. No raid eventuated and the "all clear" siren was soon sounded. The military authorities and government did not give any reason for the air raid alert until the next day, when the Western Australian minister with responsibility for civil defence, <a href="Alexander%20Panton">Alexander Panton</a>, released a brief statement noting that the alarms had been sounded on legitimate grounds and the incident had not been a hoax.

Further military activity took place on 11 March. That morning one of the Allied submarines patrolling off Western Australia reported radar signals from a Japanese warship, but this proved to be a false alarm. Also that day, "Adelaide" escorted eight merchant ships to sea and then proceeded to Albany to protect the submarine tenders. The <a href="10th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">10th Light Horse Regiment</a> established coast-watching positions, and an exercise practising the full activation of VDC-manned coastal and anti-aircraft defences on the night of 11/12 March was held.

Concerns over the prospect of an attack soon dissipated. Air patrols conducted in improving weather conditions on 11 March did not locate any Japanese warships, and most units other than Fremantle Fortress' anti-aircraft and coastal-defence positions were stood down on 12 March. The units normally stationed in Western Australia returned to their usual locations and activities on 13 March, and the submarine tenders were escorted back to Fremantle by "Adelaide". On 20 March, Kenney advised Bostock that the threat of attack had passed, and ordered that all the additional RAAF units sent to Western Australia return to their home bases.

The Japanese raiding force dispatched to the Indian Ocean encountered only a single Allied ship: on the morning of 9 March, "Tone" shelled and sank the British steamer "Behar", which was bound from Fremantle to <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a> on a voyage to the United Kingdom. After being attacked, the steamer's crew broadcast a distress signal to warn other Allied ships, causing the commander of the raiding force to abandon the operation. The heavy cruisers were escorted through the Sunda Strait by "Kinu", "Ōi" and five destroyers, and arrived back at the Netherlands East Indies on 16 March. Shortly afterwards, 89 of the 104 "Behar" survivors who had been rescued by "Tone"s crew were murdered aboard the cruiser. The commander of the raiding force, Vice Admiral <a href="Naomasa%20Sakonju">Naomasa Sakonju</a>, and "Tone"s captain were convicted of this crime after the war. The Allies were unaware of the attack on "Behar" until a ship that had picked up the steamer's distress signal arrived in Fremantle on 17 March. The orders diverting Allied shipping from the central Indian Ocean were cancelled on 18 March.

Allied concerns over the Combined Fleet's presence at Singapore eased considerably during March when it was learned that the ships there were being put through a maintenance program and that the Japanese did not intend to undertake major operations in the Indian Ocean area. Allied military commanders believed that the March 1944 emergency had some beneficial effects. Christie judged that military personnel and civilians in Western Australia had become complacent before the emergency, and the mobilisation had gone some way towards addressing this. The RAAF and USAAF regarded the reinforcement of Western Australia as having provided useful experience in rapidly redeploying combat units. The emergency also demonstrated that the VDC could be rapidly mobilised to man fixed defence positions. An editorial published in the newspaper "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>" on 13 March judged that the air raid alert on 10 March had given Perth's population a reminder of the potential threat posed by "hit and run" raids, but was highly critical of the lack of information regarding the cause of the alert, especially in light of the rumours sweeping the city. The <a href="Daily%20News%20%28Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia%29">"Daily News"</a> expressed similar views. The rationale for reinforcing Western Australia and the air raid alarms in March 1944 was not revealed by the Australian Government until 17 August 1945, two days after the end of the war.

Louis Jean Joseph Leblanc (born January 26, 1991) is a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> retired professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="Centre%20%28ice%20hockey%29">centre</a>. Leblanc played <a href="minor%20ice%20hockey">minor hockey</a> in the <a href="Greater%20Montreal">Montreal region</a> before he moved to the United States in 2008, playing one season with the <a href="Omaha%20Lancers">Omaha Lancers</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Hockey%20League">United States Hockey League</a> (USHL) and becoming Rookie of the Year. Eligible for the <a href="2009%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2009 NHL Entry Draft</a>, he was selected 18th overall by the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. He then enrolled at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> and spent one season with the <a href="Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey">Crimson</a>, being named <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> rookie of the year, before he signed a contract with the Canadiens in 2010. Later that year Leblanc joined the <a href="Montreal%20Junior%20Hockey%20Club">Montreal Juniors</a>, who had earlier acquired his <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Major Junior Hockey League</a> (QMJHL) playing rights.

Leblanc spent three seasons with the Canadiens, mainly playing for their <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL) affiliates, before being traded in 2014 to the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a>, who kept him in the AHL. In 2015, Leblanc moved to Europe, joining <a href="HC%20Slovan%20Bratislava">HC Slovan Bratislava</a> of the <a href="Kontinental%20Hockey%20League">Kontinental Hockey League</a> (KHL), though he only played seven games for them before being released. After appearing in four games for <a href="Lausanne%20HC">Lausanne HC</a> of the Swiss <a href="National%20League%20A">National League A</a>, he retired from hockey. Internationally, Leblanc played in the <a href="2008%20Ivan%20Hlinka%20Memorial%20Tournament">2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament</a>, where Canada won the gold medal, and in the <a href="2011%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, where he helped <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canada</a> win a silver medal. Leblanc was considered a <a href="draft%20%28sports%29%23Draft%20bust">draft bust</a>, having failed to reach his potential and retiring from hockey at an early age.

Leblanc was born to Yves and Marie Leblanc in <a href="Pointe-Claire">Pointe-Claire</a>, a suburb of <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, on January 26, 1991. Yves Leblanc was employed as a chemist by <a href="Merck%20Frosst">Merck Frosst</a>, one of the world's largest <a href="pharmaceutical%20companies">pharmaceutical companies</a>, in Montreal before transferring to their facility at <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in 2009; he worked four-day weeks and returned to Montreal on weekends. Marie was a piano teacher. His younger brother Jean also plays hockey. Growing up on the <a href="West%20Island">West Island</a> town of <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Quebec">Kirkland</a>, Quebec, Leblanc skated from the age of three and entered organized hockey two years later. As a youth, he played in the 2004 <a href="Quebec%20International%20Pee-Wee%20Hockey%20Tournament">Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament</a> with the Lakeshore <a href="minor%20ice%20hockey">Minor Hockey</a> Association. After playing with Lakeshore, it became apparent that he had the ability to pursue the sport at a higher level; at the age of 15, he joined the <a href="Lac%20St-Louis%20Lions">Lac St. Louis Lions</a>, a <a href="minor%20ice%20hockey">midget</a> team based in Montreal. He played two seasons for the Lions and led the triple-A league in scoring both times.

Leblanc was selected 18th overall by the <a href="Val-d%27Or%20Foreurs">Val-d'Or Foreurs</a> in the 2007 <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Major Junior Hockey League</a> (QMJHL) draft. But as he wished to attend an American university, he went instead to the <a href="Omaha%20Lancers">Omaha Lancers</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Hockey%20League">United States Hockey League</a> (USHL) where he spent the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20USHL%20season">2008–09 season</a>, playing in 60 games and finishing with 28 goals and 31 assists for 59 points. He led the team in points scored and tied for tenth overall in the USHL; his goal total was tied for eighth overall, and the six game-winning goals Leblanc scored were tied for second overall. In recognition of his performance that season, the USHL named him the league's <a href="rookie">rookie of the year</a>.

At the end of the season, Leblanc was ranked by the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) <a href="NHL%20Central%20Scouting%20Bureau">Central Scouting Bureau</a> as a top prospect for the <a href="2009%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2009 NHL Entry Draft</a>; their final list had him 13th overall among North American skaters, and he was ultimately selected 18th overall by the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, who were hosts of the Draft. 
The previous <a href="francophone">francophone</a> selected in the first round of the Entry Draft by the Canadiens had been <a href="Eric%20Chouinard">Eric Chouinard</a> in <a href="1998%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1998</a>. Coaches and scouts for the Canadiens praised Leblanc for his speed, determination, goal-scoring ability and his willingness to go to the corners for the puck. Canadiens General Manager <a href="Bob%20Gainey">Bob Gainey</a> felt that Leblanc's decision to move to the United States to play in the USHL—rather than stay in his native Quebec with the QMJHL, which would have been the easier choice—would help his development as a player and displayed the type of character that the team sought. Leblanc enrolled at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in September 2009, and began playing for the university's hockey team, the <a href="Harvard%20Crimson%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey">Crimson</a>. In his one year at Harvard, he led the team in goals (11), assists (12) and points (23). Named the <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> rookie of the year, he was also a finalist for the <a href="ECAC%20Hockey">ECAC</a> rookie of the year.
In mid-2010, Leblanc's QMJHL rights were owned by <a href="Montreal%20Junior%20Hockey%20Club">Montreal Junior Hockey Club</a> (Montreal Juniors)—his rights having been traded from Val-d'Or to the <a href="Chicoutimi%20Saguen%C3%A9ens">Chicoutimi Saguenéens</a> in 2009, then to the Juniors in June 2010. On July 30, Leblanc signed a three-year contract with the Canadiens, and he attended a training camp with the team in September. By signing a professional contract, he forfeited his <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">National Collegiate Athletic Association</a> (NCAA) eligibility and had to leave Harvard, being considered a professional according to NCAA standards. Following the camp, the Canadiens announced on September 27 that they were returning him to the Juniors for the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20QMJHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>. He finished 2010–11 with 58 points in 51 games for the Juniors. In the off-season, the team relocated to <a href="Boisbriand%2C%20Quebec">Boisbriand</a>, a suburb of Montreal, and were renamed the <a href="Blainville-Boisbriand%20Armada">Blainville-Boisbriand Armada</a>; the team traded Leblanc's major junior rights to the <a href="Shawinigan%20Cataractes">Shawinigan Cataractes</a>. Before he had a chance to play for the Cataractes, the Canadiens exercised their contract rights to him, putting him in the <a href="Hamilton%20Bulldogs%20%28AHL%29">Hamilton Bulldogs</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL), the Canadiens' minor league affiliate.

Leblanc made his professional debut on October 27, 2011 with the Bulldogs, and scored three points, including the game-winning goal in overtime, to give his team a 3–2 victory over the <a href="Rochester%20Americans">Rochester Americans</a>. After 14 games with the Bulldogs, in which he recorded 10 points, Leblanc was recalled by the Canadiens and made his NHL debut on November 30 against the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a>. His first point, an assist on a goal by <a href="Andrei%20Kostitsyn">Andrei Kostitsyn</a>, came on December 3, against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>, while his first NHL goal was against <a href="Sergei%20Bobrovsky">Sergei Bobrovsky</a> in a 4–3 loss against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a> on December 15. Leblanc split the remainder of the season between Montreal and Hamilton. He played 42 games for the Canadiens, with whom he had 5 goals and 5 assists, and 31 games with the Bulldogs, scoring 11 goals and 11 assists; he was the leading Canadien goal-scorer among rookies, and was second in both assists and points. The <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20season">following season</a> was delayed by the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20lockout">2012–13 NHL lockout</a>; when the NHL resumed play in January 2013, Leblanc stayed in the AHL with Hamilton, where he recorded 18 points in 62 games, minor injuries restricting his playing time and limiting his production. Prior to the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20NHL%20season">2013–14 NHL season</a>, Leblanc was once again assigned to Hamilton, one of the first players the Canadiens cut from their roster; with his early demotion to the AHL, it was speculated in the media whether Leblanc, who had one year remaining on his contract with the Canadiens, had a future with the team. He was recalled to the Canadiens early in the season and played eight games for them, going pointless before being sent back to the AHL, his NHL career was once again questioned. In the 70 games he played for Hamilton, Leblanc scored 13 goals and 15 assists. As Leblanc had failed to establish himself on the Canadiens roster, he was traded, on June 14, 2014, to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a conditional fifth-round pick in the <a href="2015%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2015 NHL Entry Draft</a>. A <a href="restricted%20free%20agent">restricted free agent</a>, Leblanc signed a one-year extension with the Ducks, though he spent the season with their AHL affiliate, the <a href="Norfolk%20Admirals%20%28AHL%29">Norfolk Admirals</a>, scoring 29 points in 71 games.

On July 17, 2015, Leblanc signed as a free agent to a one-year contract with the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a>. After failing to secure a spot in New York's lineup and being assigned to New York's AHL affiliate, <a href="Bridgeport%20Sound%20Tigers">Bridgeport Sound Tigers</a>, the team agreed to release him from his contract and he quickly signed with <a href="HC%20Slovan%20Bratislava">HC Slovan Bratislava</a> of the <a href="Kontinental%20Hockey%20League">Kontinental Hockey League</a> (KHL). Visa issues initially prevented Leblanc from joining the team, so he was loaned to <a href="MsHK%20%C5%BDilina">MsHK Žilina</a> of the <a href="Slovak%20Extraliga">Slovak Extraliga</a>. Once cleared to join Slovan, Leblanc only played seven games, failing to record a point, before being released. He was criticized by the coach, <a href="Milo%C5%A1%20%C5%98%C3%ADha">Miloš Říha</a>, for playing "un-Canadian" (not physical enough). As the KHL had a limit on foreign players, Leblanc needed to be among the best players to retain his place; the coach did not judge Leblanc to meet that standard. Instead, he signed with <a href="Lausanne%20HC">Lausanne HC</a> of the Swiss <a href="National%20League%20A">National League A</a> (NLA). He finished the season with them, scoring one goal in four games, and decided to retire in June. He was considered one of the Canadiens' biggest <a href="draft%20%28sports%29%23draft%20bust">draft busts</a> in the period between 2000 and 2009, having failed to reach the potential expected at the time of his selection.

Leblanc first participated in an international tournament when he played for the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian national junior team</a> at the <a href="2008%20Ivan%20Hlinka%20Memorial%20Tournament">2008 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament</a> in the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> and <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> in August 2008. He led the team with three goals and added two assists for five points as Canada won the gold medal. Leblanc was then invited to try out for the national junior team prior to the <a href="2010%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>, but was one of the last players cut from the team. There was speculation that his participation in the NCAA rather than the <a href="Canadian%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Hockey League</a> (CHL) hindered his chances of making the team, as CHL players had played considerably more games than those in the NCAA. Leblanc also had university exams scheduled around the time of the camp. He was invited to the summer camp the following year in <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador</a>, and was one of the top scorers at the camp. After the pre-tournament camp in December 2010, Leblanc was named to the final roster for the <a href="2011%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2011 World Juniors</a>.

In Canada's first game against <a href="Russia%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Russia</a>, Leblanc earned his first point, an assist. He scored his first goal, <a href="short-handed">short-handed</a> (Canada's first in the tournament), and added an assist in the second game, versus the <a href="Czech%20Republic%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech Republic</a>. He later recorded an assist in the gold medal game, where Canada lost to Russia 5–3. He finished the tournament with three goals and seven points over seven games and fourth overall on the team in scoring.

Leblanc was in a relationship with <a href="tennis">tennis</a> player <a href="Aleksandra%20Wozniak">Aleksandra Wozniak</a>, who is also from the Montreal region. When Leblanc was assigned to the AHL prior to the 2013–14 season, Wozniak critiqued the move on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>, saying Leblanc had not been given "a fair shot". While at Harvard, Leblanc majored in economics, and hoped eventually to earn his degree. In lieu of this, he took a business class at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> in Montreal when he moved back to the city in 2010. When he announced his retirement in 2016, it was reported he planned to return to Harvard later that year.

Nature fakers controversy

The nature fakers controversy was an early 20th-century American literary debate highlighting the conflict between <a href="science">science</a> and sentiment in popular <a href="nature%20writing">nature writing</a>. The debate involved important <a href="United%20States">American</a> literary, environmental and political figures. Dubbed the "War of the Naturalists" by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", it revealed seemingly irreconcilable contemporary views of the natural world: while some nature writers of the day argued as to the veracity of their examples of <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> wild animals, others questioned an animal's ability to adapt, learn, teach, and reason.

The controversy arose from a new literary movement, which followed a growth of interest in the natural world beginning in the late 19th century, and in which the natural world was depicted in a compassionate rather than realistic light. Works such as <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a>'s "<a href="Wild%20Animals%20I%20Have%20Known">Wild Animals I Have Known</a>" (1898) and <a href="William%20J.%20Long">William J. Long</a>'s "School of the Woods" (1902) popularized this new genre and emphasized sympathetic and individualistic animal characters. In March 1903, naturalist and writer <a href="John%20Burroughs">John Burroughs</a> published an article entitled "Real and Sham Natural History" in "<a href="The%20Atlantic%20Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>". Lambasting writers such as Seton, Long, and <a href="Charles%20G.%20D.%20Roberts">Charles G. D. Roberts</a> for their seemingly fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of realistic animal fiction as "<a href="yellow%20journalism">yellow journalism</a> of the woods". Burroughs' targets responded in defense of their work in various publications, as did their supporters, and the resulting controversy raged in the public press for nearly six years.

The constant publicity given to the debate contributed to a growing distrust of the truthfulness of popular nature writing of the day, and often pitted scientist against writer. The controversy effectively ended when President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> publicly sided with Burroughs, publishing his article "Nature Fakers" in the September 1907 issue of "<a href="Everybody%27s%20Magazine">Everybody's Magazine</a>". Roosevelt popularized the negative colloquialism by which the controversy would later be known to describe one who purposefully fabricates details about the natural world. The definition of the term later expanded to include those who depicted nature with excessive sentimentality.

A renewed public interest in nature and its promise of aesthetic and recreational enjoyment began in the United States during the late 19th century. The country's first national park, <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone</a>, was established in 1872, and by 1900 it had been followed by half a dozen more. Railroads made it easy to get to the parks, and their advertising promoted the wonders of nature that could be seen courtesy of their trains. Tourists frequented the parks regularly, but there were also numerous opportunities for people to enjoy nature and outdoor recreation closer to home. City parks, such as <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>'s <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, became popular destinations because of their accessibility, and camps like the ones owned by the <a href="YMCA">YMCA</a> were frequented by boys and girls of all ages.

<a href="Wilderness">Wilderness</a> protection and the <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a>, led by figures such as <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a>, founder of the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>, also began to appear at this time. By the turn of the century, those in favor of recreational ideals of nature began to clash with conservationists such as Muir. Likewise, critics and natural scientists became skeptical of what they saw as a growing <a href="cult">cult</a> of nature, which was thought to wrongly champion sentimentality and aesthetics rather than scientific facts. Sympathy for animals and their survival also became a developing thought in the 19th century, due in part to wide acceptance of theories pertaining to organic <a href="evolution">evolution</a>. In 1837, <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> wrote in his diary that "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, death, suffering and famine—our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements—they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor—we may be all melted together."

As the popularity and marketability of the natural world rose during the late 19th century, books dedicated to nature came to be in great demand. One reviewer noted in 1901 that "It is a part of the progress of the day that the <a href="Nature%20study">Nature study</a> is coming into prominence in our schemes of education, and, beyond these, is entering into our plans for coveted diversion, yet it is a real surprise that so large and increasing a number of each season's publications are devoted to the purpose." Such <a href="literature">literature</a> was regularly published in a wide variety of subjects: children's animal books, wilderness novels, nature guides, and travelogues were all immensely popular. The study of nature quickly became part of the public school curriculum, making nature writing increasingly profitable. As the public's hunger for such imaginative works grew, a new genre in which nature was depicted in a compassionate, rather than realistic, light began to take form.
The tendency to portray animals as having human traits was not new; <a href="Aesop">Aesop</a>'s moralistic animal tales were still popular with readers of the day, and inspired such works as <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s "<a href="The%20Jungle%20Book">The Jungle Book</a>" (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics. <a href="Anna%20Sewell">Anna Sewell</a>'s "<a href="Black%20Beauty">Black Beauty</a>", for example, told the story of a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against <a href="animal%20cruelty">animal cruelty</a>. The budding <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a> movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them in a positive light. One popular nature writer of the day, <a href="Mabel%20Osgood%20Wright">Mabel Osgood Wright</a>, told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.

Author and illustrator <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a> published his first book, the bestselling "<a href="Wild%20Animals%20I%20Have%20Known">Wild Animals I Have Known</a>", in 1898. The first entry in a new genre of realistic wild-animal stories, Seton's collection of short stories quickly became one of the most popular books of its day. Although he had considered himself "a naturalist of the usual type, trying merely to accumulate specimens and facts" during his early career, he later began to write factual material "in the form of romantic stories—fiction in the form of presentation, but solid in fact in their basis and their message." The first story in the collection, "<a href="Lobo%20the%20King%20of%20Currumpaw">Lobo, The King of Currumpaw</a>" was based upon Seton's experience hunting wolves in the Southwest. It became a classic, setting the tone for his future works that would similarly depict animals—especially predators who were often demonized in literature—as compassionate, individualistic beings. Seton was reportedly denounced by readers for having killed Lobo, only to write about the experience; however, as biographer Brian Morris stated, the readers' sympathies "are directed, as Seton meant them to be, toward the wild animal, rather than against the teller of the tale".

Seton's intention in writing his stories was to "freely translate" the animals' language into English, as they "have no speech as we understand it". The stories were typically prefaced by the author's strong assertion of their accuracy, and "Wild Animals I Have Known" marked the nature writer's first emphasis on the perspective of a wild animal. As Canadian poet and author <a href="Charles%20G.D.%20Roberts">Charles G.D. Roberts</a> described it, the genre focused on "the personality, individuality, mentality, of an animal, as well as its purely physical characteristics."

Naturalist and writer <a href="John%20Burroughs">John Burroughs</a> (1837–1921) was respected for his numerous nature essays. Known as an outspoken advocate for the conservation movement in the United States, he was later described by his biographer <a href="Edward%20J.%20Renehan%2C%20Jr.">Edward Renehan</a> as "a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world". Burroughs believed that the nature writer must remain faithful to nature as well as the personal responses to what they witness; he wrote in the introduction to his 1895 book "Wake-Robin" that the "literary naturalist does not take liberties with facts; facts are the flora upon which he lives. The more and the fresher the facts the better."

When "<a href="The%20Atlantic%20Monthly">The Atlantic Monthly</a>" published a glowing review of the Reverend <a href="William%20J.%20Long">William J. Long</a>'s 1902 work "School of the Woods: Some Life Studies of Animal Instinct and Animal Training", Burroughs became incensed. Long had previously published six books, and while Burroughs was not pleased with the clergyman's previous efforts, he believed this particular work was an unacceptable example of nature writing. Long insisted not only that animals demonstrated unique and individualistic behavior, unpredictable to science, but he also wrote that there was "absolutely no limit to the variety and adaptiveness of Nature, even in a single species." Burroughs was not the first to take issue with the growing genre that blurred the line between fact and fiction, or the liberties it often took with the natural world; <a href="Ernest%20Ingersoll">Ernest Ingersoll</a> also found fault with "School of the Woods", stating it "would be an epoch-making book in both zoology and psychology could its statements be established." Believing that authors such as Long were deliberately misleading the public for financial gain, Burroughs decided to prove that their fantastical depictions of wild animals were not only impossible, but ultimately damaging to the general public's understanding of nature.
In March 1903, Burroughs submitted a scathing essay to "The Atlantic Monthly" entitled "Real and Sham Natural History"; the editor, Bliss Perry, reportedly found the piece so "ill-natured" and "peevish" that he sent it back to Burroughs for revisions. Burroughs began his article with praise for authors such as Ingersoll, <a href="Frank%20M.%20Chapman">Frank M. Chapman</a> and <a href="Florence%20Merriam%20Bailey">Florence Merriam Bailey</a>, all of whom he believed exemplified good nature writing. Championing his own strict adherence to observed fact, Burroughs singled out four books for criticism: Seton's "Wild Animals I have Known", Roberts' "The Kindred of the Wild", <a href="William%20Davenport%20Hulbert">William Davenport Hulbert</a>'s "Forest Neighbours", and Long's "School of the Woods". In particular he blamed Seton's collection of stories for founding the sentimental animal story genre; he even amended the title of the collection to "Wild Animals I" Alone "Have Known". Further denouncing Seton's claims that his stories featured events and behaviors he had personally witnessed, Burroughs wrote:

Mr. Thompson Seton says in capital letters that his stories are true, and it is this emphatic assertion that makes the judicious grieve. True as romance, true in their artistic effects, true in their power to entertain the young reader, they certainly are but true as natural history they as certainly are not ... There are no stories of animal intelligence and cunning on record, that I am aware of, that match his.

Chief among Burroughs' complaints was Long's questioning of the role of <a href="instinct">instinct</a> in <a href="animal%20learning">animal learning</a>, something that Burroughs and many scientists of the day accepted without doubt. Long had written that after many years of studying wild animals, he was "convinced that instinct plays a much smaller part than we have supposed; that an animal's success or failure in the ceaseless struggle for life depends, not upon instinct, but upon the kind of training which the animal learns from its mother." In reply to this assertion, Burroughs wrote in "Real and Sham Natural History": "The crows do not train their young. They have no fortresses, or schools, or colleges, or examining boards, or diplomas, or medals of honor, or hospitals, or churches, or telephones, or postal deliveries, or anything of the sort. Indeed, the poorest backwoods hamlet has more of the appurtenances of civilization than the best organized crow or other wild animal community in the land!" Burroughs summed up by deeming Long a fraud, stating that his "book reads like that of a man who has really never been to the woods, but who sits in his study and cooks up these yarns from things he has read in "<a href="Forest%20and%20Stream">Forest and Stream</a>", or in other sporting journals. Of real observation there is hardly a vestige in his book; of deliberate trifling with natural history there is no end".

Soon after the publication of Burroughs' article, "The Atlantic Monthly" began receiving responses from readers. Among the many letters written in support for Burroughs' assertions was an article published in the "Boston Evening Transcript" in defense of Long's reputation as both a writer and a respected man of the cloth. Written by fellow clergyman Charles Prescott Daniels, the article, which was titled "Discord in the Forest: John Burroughs vs. William J. Long", suggested that Burroughs left "the reader with a kinder feeling for Mr. Long than for Mr. Burroughs, and [left] him, too, with a suspicion that, after all, the beasts and birds will forgive Mr. Long for having so amiably misrepresented them."

Many of the authors Burroughs criticized in his essays chose not to issue direct rebuttals. As <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a> would later write, they chose to simply "climb a tree and let the cataclysm go by". Seton, who had previously met Burroughs and had a great deal of respect for the elder naturalist, was confident enough in his own reputation so as not to stage a public reply. Other authors wrote to both him and Burroughs in Seton's defense, however; author and editor <a href="Hamlin%20Garland">Hamlin Garland</a> both wrote to Burroughs and spoke to him personally in this regard, saying that Seton's "stories are based on careful observation." Three weeks after Burroughs' article appeared in "The Atlantic Monthly", he and Seton met at a literary dinner given by <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>; while accounts of the meeting vary, the two men seemed to make amends.

William J. Long, on the other hand, readily became a publicly vocal enemy of the naturalist after receiving much of Burroughs' initial criticism. A <a href="Congregationalist">Congregationalist</a> minister from Massachusetts, Long was an amateur naturalist and avid camper who spent summers hiking in Canada. Shortly after Burroughs published his initial essay, Long was reported to have previously resigned from his parish so as to devote himself to writing and lecturing on nature full-time. Rather than be discouraged by Burroughs' criticism—which included the other man calling Long "the worst of these nature-writing offenders"—within weeks of the publication of "Real and Sham Natural History", Long submitted a stern reply to the "Boston Evening Transcript". Two months later, he published a longer article titled "The Modern School of Nature-Study and its Critics" in the "North American Review".
In the latter essay, Long insisted that there was a difference between the study of nature and the study of science; whereas science concerned itself with laws and generalizations, the study of nature was far more complex as it allowed for the recognition of individual life forms. He wrote, "The difference between Nature and Science is the difference between a man who loves animals, and so understands them, and the man who studies Zoology; it is the difference between the woman who cherishes her old-fashioned flower-garden and the professor who lectures on Botany in a college class-room." Long's intention was to divide the old school naturalists (which included Burroughs among its members) from what he saw as the newly formed school, of which he was part, whose members were capable of seeing animals as individuals. Because he wrote personal nature essays, and not scientific reports, Long believed that his readers required from him "not simply eyes and ears and a note-book; but insight, imagination, and, above all, an intense human sympathy, by which alone the inner life of an animal becomes luminous, and without which the living creatures are little better than stuffed specimens".

While his explanation was found to be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two <a href="New%20World%20oriole">orioles</a> he had seen building a nest outside his window. Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair "plainly deliberated" their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then "tied a single knot at the extreme end" of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time. Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that what he wrote was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. "The Atlantic Monthly" did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by "<a href="Century%20Magazine">Century Magazine</a>". Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, "After such an example as this, how long will it be before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?"

Threatened financially by Burroughs' condemnation, Long's publishers came to their client's defense by distributing a pamphlet defending his positions. In late 1903, Long published a new book titled "A Little Brother to the Bear". In the preface, he wrote: "Except where it is plainly stated otherwise, all the incidents and observations have passed under my own eyes and have been confirmed later by other observers ... I have simply tried to make all these animals as interesting to the reader as they were to me when I discovered them." While "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reviewed it favorably, pointing out its "close observation and loving attention to the details of wood life", Long's critics were quick to note a number of propositions regarding wildlife. An essay in the book titled "Animal Surgery", in which Long wrote of various animals' ability to treat and mend their own injuries, particularly riled his critics. He told of how animals such as muskrat, beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean. The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a "<a href="American%20Woodcock">woodcock</a> genius" who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury:
At first he took soft clay in his bill from the edge of the water and seemed to be smearing it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.

Long's theories about animal surgery garnered negative attention from the scientific community as well as the literary; biologist <a href="William%20Morton%20Wheeler">William Morton Wheeler</a> wrote to "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>" in February 1904 that Long's story was "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed." Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that "If scientists and <a href="Comparative%20psychology">comparative-psychologists</a> are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, I have enough to fill several regular editions of "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>", every one of which is supported not only by my own personal observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation." As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was a bandage around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a woody fiber of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and "Science" followed Long's essay with the note, "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further."

Ruminating on his previous clashes with Long in regard to an animal's ability to learn behaviors, Burroughs began to focus the ire of his essay-writing on those who upheld the idea of animal psychology. In a series of articles published in "Century Magazine", he steadfastly argued that animals functioned on little more than instinct and a very limited ability to learn from experience. He wrote that creatures, unlike humans, are "rational without reason, and wise without understanding." Although mainly repeating his earlier points, one of Burroughs' essays was accompanied by a cartoon parodying Long's "School of the Woods"; dubbed "A Lesson in Wisdom", it showed Mother Nature sitting in a field surrounded by five foxes who look on as she reads from a book titled "The Fox Who Lost His Tail in the Trap".

The belief that animals were intelligent enough to learn and reason, much like a human, was largely born from Darwin's assertion of the evolutionary link between humans and animals. Beginning in the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, the progression from the cause of animal welfare—due to the budding belief that animals could feel pain and suffering—to that of an animal's mental capacity was readily made in popular nature writing. Therefore, Long was not the first to write of the learned intelligence of animals. Seton often stressed in his stories the wit of the animals he witnessed, as well as the fact that most of them had been "taught" survival skills by either their mothers or their pack leaders. Other writers supported the idea of animal education: Ernest Ingersoll wrote of "morning lessons" in hunting for nuts, and respected bird watcher <a href="Olive%20Thorne%20Miller">Olive Thorne Miller</a> described several different teaching endeavors, such as a music lesson taught from one mother bird to her chicks. Miller would also suggest, although partly in jest, that even some of the flowers were intelligent.

Largely silent until then, in 1904 both Seton and Roberts made small efforts to defend their brand of nature writing from its critics, mainly Burroughs. In the preface to his new book "The Watchers of the Trails", Roberts specifically responded to Burroughs' criticism by carefully pointing out that his stories were "avowedly fiction". However, he continued: "They are, at the same time, true, in that the material of which they are moulded consists of facts". Later that year, "Century Magazine" published Seton's only public response to Burroughs' criticisms, especially those made in the previous year's "Atlantic Monthly" article in which the naturalist branded Seton the originator of the faulty genre. Seton's response was in the form of a lighthearted tale about a critic named Little Mucky—obviously meant to parody Burroughs himself—who climbs a hill called Big Periodic, only to throw mud at a newcomer who attracts attention away from him. The moral of the story, Seton wrote, was that "Notoriety is a poisonous substitute for fame."

Despite the best efforts of the press, the debate began to die down in late 1904. In December that year, after suffering from ailing eyesight for several years, Long went temporarily blind at the age of 47. Despite this setback, he continued to write; in early 1905 he began publishing a series of essays in "<a href="Harper%27s%20Monthly">Harper's Monthly</a>" under the pseudonym Peter Rabbit; told from the point of view of the "author", the essays commented upon the human condition, animal intelligence, and the controversy first begun by Burroughs two years prior. The essays were published a year later in a collection titled "Brier-Patch Philosophy". This book included the dedication: "To those who have found Their Own World to be something of a Brier-Patch the Rabbit Dedicates his little book of Cheerful Philosophy."

Burroughs continued to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, and a number of his essays dedicated to "sham nature history" were collected in the volume "Ways of Nature", published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." <a href="Mabel%20Osgood%20Wright">Mabel Osgood Wright</a> weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.

Although Roberts had largely escaped criticism for his previous work, his novel "Red Fox" attracted attention from Burroughs and his allies after its publication in 1906. The work contains stories relating to a single animal, the eponymous Red Fox, who was described by the author as "fairly typical, both in his characteristics and in the experiences that befall him, in spite of the fact that he is stronger and cleverer than the average run of foxes." Burroughs' critique of the book began by expressing his admiration for Roberts' "genius", but again stressed his belief that animals were governed by instinct, rather than instruction or intuition. He pointed to particular passages, such as when the fox escaped a group of hounds by running across the backs of sheep on a field, as disingenuous and misleading.

President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, known for his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world and the animals who inhabited it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially in the name of progress. Roosevelt had been following the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> and its surrounding areas together.

In late 1905, Roosevelt received a copy of Long's book "Northern Trails" from the publisher. Based upon the author's travels in Canada, most of the stories involved a noble, white wolf named Wayeeses. As in other works, Long asserted that "every incident in this wolf's life, from his grasshopper hunting to the cunning caribou chase, and from the den in the rocks to the meeting of wolf and children on the storm-swept barrens, is minutely true in fact, and is based squarely upon my own observations and that of my Indians." While Roosevelt reportedly enjoyed a majority of the book—he even read it aloud to his children—he found fault with Long's dramatic description of how a wolf killed caribou by piercing the animal's heart with its teeth. "A terrific rush," Long wrote in "Northern Trails", "a quick snap under the stag's chest just behind the fore legs, where the heart lay". Drawing upon his own extensive hunting experience, Roosevelt wrote confidentially to the book's publisher about Long's description being "sheer nonsense", concluding that it "is so very unusual" and anatomically impossible that it could not be true. In his letter, of which he also sent a copy to Burroughs, Roosevelt pointed out the physical difficulty a wolf would have if attempting to kill its prey in such a manner, while also commenting upon the unlikeliness of other wolf stories written by Long.

Burroughs agreed with the President's assertions, and urged him to comment publicly on the subject, although the other man demurred. When Roosevelt published "Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter" in October 1905, however, he not only dedicated it to the elder naturalist, but he also made his first public foray in what would become known as the nature fakers controversy: "I wish to express my hearty appreciation of your warfare against the sham nature-writers—those whom you have called 'the yellow journalists of the woods' ... You in your own person have illustrated what can be done by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest."

After four years of privately denouncing the popular nature writers in letters and conversation, Roosevelt decided to weigh in publicly; while alerting Burroughs that he had finally broken his silence, he wrote: "I know that as President I ought not to do this". He had given an interview to journalist Edward B. Clark, who quoted Roosevelt in the article "Roosevelt on the Nature <a href="Charlatan">Faker</a>s" in the June 1907 issue of "Everybody's Magazine". Roosevelt not only spoke out against Long, but other authors like <a href="Jack%20London">Jack London</a> and Roberts, who wrote what he called "'unnatural' history". Roosevelt popularized the term "nature faker" over Clark's original spelling, and defined it in his essay as "an object of derision to every scientist worthy of the name, to every real lover of the wilderness, to every faunal naturalist, to every true hunter or nature lover. But it is evident that [the nature faker] completely deceives many good people who are wholly ignorant of wild life. Sometimes he draws on his own imagination for his fictions; sometimes he gets them second-hand from irresponsible guides or trappers or Indians." He voiced displeasure with and disbelief of London's descriptions of <a href="dog%20fighting">dog fighting</a> in "<a href="White%20Fang">White Fang</a>", as well as Long's stories about Wayeeses the wolf taking down prey; Roosevelt was so specific as to debate the depicted outcome of the fights based on the size of the animals involved. Long's books in particular were deemed a "genuine crime", especially against the country's children. Fearing that a curriculum including sentimental nature stories would corrupt young children, Roosevelt wrote: "As for the matter of giving these books to children for the purpose of teaching them the facts of natural history—why, it's an outrage."
Not long after Roosevelt's views were made public, Long responded with vigor, and the resulting publicity started the controversy anew. He began by sending a private letter to the President, which he later released to the press, informing Roosevelt that he would soon regret his "foolish words ... With all my soul I regret this necessity and shrink from it, but you have brought it upon yourself." In an interview with "The New York Times", Long called Roosevelt "cowardly" and the article "venomous", but his main criticism stemmed from the President's status as a "gamekiller"; Roosevelt, Long claimed, "has no sympathy with any brand of nature study except his own." While a number of scientists wrote in support of Roosevelt and his position, Long produced several witnesses to prove his claims; to combat one of Roosevelt's specific complaints, Long provided a statement from "a full-blooded <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> Indian" who declared that wolves in the area where Wayeeses was said to live were known to attack prey in the chest. Long also insisted that he himself had come upon the remains of a deer slain in a similar way.

Long's most effective tactic against Roosevelt, however, was not to argue biological matters, but to attack the President's motives in becoming involved in such a debate. In reference to Roosevelt's published works describing his hunting expeditions, Long wrote: "I find after carefully reading two of his big books that every time he gets near the heart of a wild thing he invariably puts a bullet through it." "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" published an article titled "President a Slayer Not Lover of Animals", while the same missive was called "Long Will Combat Roosevelt Until Latter is Whipped" in Philadelphia's "<a href="Public%20Ledger%20%28Philadelphia%29">Public Ledger</a>"; in it, Long wrote: "Roosevelt is a man who takes savage delight in whooping through the woods killing everything in sight." He continued, "The idea of Mr. Roosevelt assuming the part of a naturalist is absurd. He is a hunter".

Not everyone took the President's involvement in the controversy seriously; he was often included in satirical cartoons of the day, pointing to the superficial and tedious disagreements for which the writers lambasted one another. Writing in the June 8, 1907 issue of the "Outlook", editor <a href="Lyman%20Abbot">Lyman Abbot</a> stated that Roosevelt's desire to become embroiled in such a debate stemmed from his "extraordinary vitality, coupled with his unusual interest in all that concerns human welfare" making "it very difficult for him to keep silence in the presence of anything which he thinks injurious to his fellow-men." The President's participation in the controversy attested to its magnitude, however; as one observer wrote, "From an insignificant smudge [the issue] has become a roaring blaze and its sparks are kindling throughout the land."

Roosevelt did not at first respond to Long's claims, allegedly considering the author "too small game to shoot twice." He did, however, write to Burroughs that he had "no quarrel with Mr. Long for the conclusions he draws from the facts. Our quarrel with him is because he invents the facts." Burroughs proceeded to publicly defend the President against Long's attacks, condemning him and the expert witnesses Long produced to support his claims about the events and behaviors he depicted in his works. Newspapers around the country continuously published interviews with the two naturalists, while comedic depictions of the controversy and its participants were becoming popular with readers. One such parody referred to a non-existent book called "How to Tell the Animals from the Wild Flowers", including an illustration which depicted an anthropomorphic "<a href="Dandy">Dandy</a> Lion" with a cane, top hat and monocle. This joke inspired a similarly satirical book, which was published under the title "How to Tell the Birds from the Flowers"; a collection of humorous illustrations and poems by physicist and children's author <a href="Robert%20Williams%20Wood">Robert Williams Wood</a>, the work included pairings of birds and their corresponding flowers, emphasizing their visual similarities. Making a thinly veiled reference to the much publicized controversy surrounding those authors who were now called "nature fakers", the book concludes: "I have freely drawn upon / The works of <a href="Asa%20Gray">Gray</a> and <a href="John%20James%20Audubon">Audubon</a>, / Avoiding though the frequent blunders / Of those who study Nature's wonders."

Seeing that his initial pronouncement did nothing to quell the controversy surrounding the faults of popular nature writing, Roosevelt finally responded to Long's ongoing criticism in the fall of 1907. His article, which was written under his own name and simply titled "Nature Fakers", was published in the September issue of "Everybody's Magazine". Beginning with a list of nature writers that the President admired and felt best represented the genre (Burroughs, Muir, and Olive Thorne Miller, among others), he soon fell into criticizing the "yellow journalists of the woods" who "can easily believe three impossible things before breakfast; and they do not mind in the least if the impossibilities are mutually contradictory". While he focused on the "nature fakers", especially Long, he shifted the focus of his attack to place responsibility not on the authors, but on their publishers and the school boards who regularly accepted their works for reading material. He wrote:

Our quarrel is not with these men, but with those who give them their chance. We who believe in the study of nature feel that a real knowledge and appreciation of wild things, of trees, flowers, birds, and of the grim and crafty creatures of the wilderness, give an added beauty and health to life. Therefore we abhor deliberate or reckless untruth in this study as much as in any other; and therefore we feel that a grave wrong is committed by all who, holding a position that entitles them to respect, yet condone and encourage such untruth.

With Roosevelt's final public word on the matter, the controversy began to die down in earnest, although its key players continued to comment on the debate's major points for the next few years. "The New York Times" favored the President's position in an editorial titled "The War of the Naturalists", while some still supported Long and his literary efforts. Long was traveling in Maine when Roosevelt's "Nature Fakers" article was published, and did not respond to the criticisms against him with his past vigor. He later wrote that "the only fakir in the whole controversy, in my judgment, is the big fakir at Washington". Long's literary reputation steadily declined, although he continued to write and publish well into the early 1950s. For his remaining life, Burroughs continued to write disparagingly about the effect of sentimental animal stories. In his 1908 book "Leaf And Tendril", he wrote:
A great many intelligent persons tolerate or encourage our fake natural history on the ground that they find it entertaining, and that it interests the school-children in the wild life about them. Is the truth, then, without value for its own sake? What would these good people think of a United States school history that took the same liberties with facts that some of our nature writers do: that, for instance, made Washington take his army over the Delaware in balloons, or in sleighs on the solid ice with bands playing; or that made Lincoln a victim of the Evil Eye; or that portrayed his slayer as a self-sacrificing hero; or that represented the little <a href="USS%20Monitor">Monitor</a> that eventful day on <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> as diving under the <a href="USS%20Merrimack%20%281855%29">Merrimac</a> and tossing it ashore on its beak?

The nature fakers take just this kind of liberties with the facts of our natural history. The young reader finds it entertaining, no doubt, but is this sufficient justification?

Also in 1908, Jack London broke his silence on his condemnation during the controversy by publishing an essay in "<a href="Collier%27s%20Weekly">Collier's Weekly</a>" entitled "The Other Animals". Directly addressing Roosevelt's past criticism of his novels, London called the President "<a href="anthropocentrism">homocentric</a>" and "amateur". He further wrote: "I have been guilty of writing two animal—two books about dogs. The writing of these two stories, on my part, was in truth a protest against the 'humanizing' of animals, of which it seemed to me several 'animal writers' had been profoundly guilty. Time and again, and many times, in my narratives, I wrote, speaking of my dog-heroes: 'He did not think these things; he merely did them,' etc. And I did this repeatedly, to the clogging of my narrative and in violation of my artistic canons; and I did it in order to hammer into the average human understanding that these dog-heroes of mine were not directed by abstract reasoning, but by instinct, sensation, and emotion, and by simple reasoning. Also, I endeavored to make my stories in line with the facts of evolution; I hewed them to the mark set by scientific research, and awoke, one day, to find myself bundled neck and crop into the camp of the nature-fakers."

Hoping to establish his credentials once and for all as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work "Life-Histories of Northern Animals", which was published in 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as "Lives of Game Animals", Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.

Over time, the term "nature faker" began to take on a new meaning; rather than describing someone who purposefully told false stories about animals, it became synonymous with those who overly sentimentalized the natural world. In 1910, journalist and writer <a href="Richard%20Harding%20Davis">Richard Harding Davis</a> published a short story titled "The Nature Faker" in "Collier's Weekly", which used the negative colloquialism to refer to the lead character, Herrick, a hapless nature sentimentalist. Animation pioneer <a href="John%20R.%20Bray">John R. Bray</a> also showcased this new definition of "nature faker" while satirizing Roosevelt in two silent cartoons called "Colonel Heeza Liar, Nature Faker" (1915 and 1924).

The controversy had far-reaching effects in literary and scientific circles, and marked the only time that a President of the United States weighed in as a "literary and cultural critic—specifically, as an ecocritic." Though blind naturalist and author <a href="Clarence%20Hawkes">Clarence Hawkes</a> deemed the literary debate "a veritable tempest in the teapot", after the controversy had died down, he came to believe "if I ever make a bad break in regard to my natural history statements that I was doomed." The author Ralph H. Lutts wrote in his 1990 work "The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science & Sentiment", the nature fakers controversy "was far more than a clash over the accuracy of animal stories or the question of whether animals can reason"; rather, the debate signified the changing sensibilities of writers and readers at the turn of the 20th century.

Polyozellus

Polyozellus is a fungal <a href="genus">genus</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Thelephoraceae, a grouping of <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s known collectively as the <a href="leathery%20earthfans">leathery earthfans</a>. A <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a> genus, it contains the single species Polyozellus multiplex, first described in 1899, and <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as the blue chanterelle, the clustered blue chanterelle, or, in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the black chanterelle. The distinctive <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> of this species comprises blue- to purple-colored clusters of vase- or spoon-shaped <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a> with veiny wrinkles on the undersurface that run down the length of the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>.

"Polyozellus" has had a varied <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history and has been <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">reclassified</a> several times at both the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> and genus level. The <a href="range%20%28biology%29">range</a> of "Polyozellus" includes North America and eastern Asia, where "P. multiplex" may be found growing on the ground in <a href="temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous forests</a>, usually under <a href="spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a> trees. It is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species, and has been harvested for commercial purposes. "Polyozellus multiplex" contains the <a href="bioactive%20compound">bioactive compound</a> <a href="polyozellin">polyozellin</a>, shown to have various <a href="physiology">physiological</a> properties, including suppressive effects on <a href="stomach%20cancer">stomach cancer</a>.

The first published <a href="species%20description">description</a> of the species was written by botanist <a href="Lucien%20Marcus%20Underwood">Lucien M. Underwood</a> in 1899, based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of <a href="Mount%20Desert%2C%20Maine">Mount Desert, Maine</a>. Although he called the new species a "<a href="Cantharellus">Cantharellus</a>", he noted that "the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit might well form a distinct genus since it has little in common with "Cantharellus" except its fold-like gills." In 1910, <a href="William%20Murrill">William Murrill</a> transferred it to the new genus "Polyozellus"; Murrill thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it being separated from "Cantharellus" species, which have simpler stem structures. In 1920, specimens from a Japanese collection compiled by A. Yasuda were sent to mycologist <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a>, who believed the fungus to be a new species and named it "Phyllocarbon yasudai".No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, Canada. The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus "Polyozellus" to be superfluous, pointed out that the compound <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> and the wrinkled <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> were instead consistent with the genus "<a href="Craterellus">Craterellus</a>". In 1939, American mycologist <a href="Lee%20Oras%20Overholts">Lee Oras Overholts</a>, in a letter to the journal "<a href="Mycologia">Mycologia</a>", opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by <a href="Calvin%20Henry%20Kauffman">Calvin Henry Kauffman</a>, who made notes and photos of the species collected in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> of <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> and <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and in the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Mountains</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a> and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. Kauffman believed the species to be merely "a very extreme growth condition" of "Cantharellus clavatus" (now known as "<a href="Gomphus%20clavatus">Gomphus clavatus</a>") and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus "Craterellus". Mycologists <a href="Alexander%20Hanchett%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Eaton%20Morse">Elizabeth Eaton Morse</a>, in their 1947 publication on "Cantharellus" species in the United States, placed the species in a new section "Polyozellus", but did not separate it from the genus "Cantharellus"; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of "Polyozellus" as the small, roughened, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> spores and the color change of the flesh in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> solution, adding that "the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species."

In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki took into consideration differences in <a href="spore">spore</a> characteristics: species in the genus "Cantharellus" were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like "Polyozellus"; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the Thelephoraceae family ("Cantharellus" belongs in a different family, the <a href="Cantharellaceae">Cantharellaceae</a>). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), and the presence of <a href="thelephoric%20acid">thelephoric acid</a>, a mushroom <a href="pigment">pigment</a> common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae. The suggested family-level <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomical</a> change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it "Thelephora multiplex". As of 2009, both <a href="Index%20Fungorum">Index Fungorum</a> and <a href="MycoBank">MycoBank</a> list "Polyozellus" as being within the Thelephoraceae family, a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the <a href="leathery%20earthfans">leathery earthfans</a>. The genus name is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "poly" meaning "many", and "oz", meaning "branch". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "multiplex" means "in many pieces", referring to the compound nature of the fruit body. <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s for this species include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle. In <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle, although this name is shared with some "<a href="Craterellus">Craterellus</a>" species.

"Polyozellus multiplex" is part of the group of fungi collectively known as cantharelloid mushrooms (which includes the genera "<a href="Cantharellus">Cantharellus</a>", "Craterellus", "<a href="Gomphus%20%28fungus%29">Gomphus</a>", and "Polyozellus") because of the similarity of their <a href="fruit%20body">fruit body</a> structures and the <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> of the spore-producing region (the <a href="hymenophore">hymenophore</a>) on the underside of the caps. The fan- or funnel-shaped fruit bodies of the black chanterelle grow clustered together on the ground, often in large masses that may reach aggregate diameters of up to , although they are usually up to .

The individual <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a>, wide and almost as long, are violet-black, with edges that are initially whitish, and with a <a href="glaucous">glaucous</a> surface—a white powdery accumulation of spore deposit. The upper surface may be <a href="wikt%3Azonate">zonate</a>—lined with what appear to be multiple concentric zones of texture caused by areas of fine hairs (a <a href="Trichome%23Plant%20trichomes">tomentum</a>); and the edges of the caps have a layer of very fine hairs and are lobed and wavy. The underside of the caps bears the fertile, spore-making tissue called the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, which typically has shallow, crowded wrinkles or veins that are roughly the same color or paler than the top surface. Some variation in color has been observed depending on the collection location. For example, specimens found in Alaska are more likely to be jet-black in color with a dark gray underside.

Fruit bodies may be up to high (including the stem) and wide. Occasionally, much larger clusters of fused mushrooms are found, up to a meter in diameter. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> is dark purplish-black with a smooth (<a href="glabrousness">glabrous</a>) and dry surface; the stems are often fused at the base. It is typically wide and up to long. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is dark violet, soft but breaking easily. The <a href="spore%20print">spore deposit</a> is white.

The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are roughly spherical to broadly <a href="wikt%3Aellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> in shape, covered with small wart-like projections (tubercules), and have dimensions of 6–8.5 by 5.5–8 <a href="Micrometre">µm</a>. Viewed microscopically, they are <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>, meaning they appear translucent or colorless. Chemical tests may also be used to help distinguish the spores: in the presence of <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH), the spores turn slightly green; the spores are not <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a>, meaning they do not take <a href="iodine">iodine</a> when treated with <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>; the spores are acyanophilous, meaning they do not readily absorb <a href="methyl%20blue">methyl blue</a> stain. The <a href="cystidium">cystidia</a> that comprise the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a> are <a href="wikt%3Afilamentous">filamentous</a> and 3–4 µm wide by 28–40 µm long. The outer tissue layer of the cap—the cuticle, or <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>—is made of interwoven <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e, and stains olive-green in KOH. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present, but not at all the <a href="septum">cell partitions</a>. The <a href="basidium">basidia</a>, the spore-bearing cells, are 32–38 by 5–6 µm and four-spored.

The horn-of-plenty mushroom ("<a href="Craterellus%20cornucopioides">Craterellus cornucopioides</a>") also has a blackish fruit body and a smooth hymenium, but is distinguished from "P. multiplex" by its thin flesh, a trumpet- or tubular-shaped fruit body (rather than fan- or spoon-shaped), and grey to black colors. A closely related species, the fragrant chanterelle ("<a href="Cantharellus%20odoratus">Cantharellus odoratus</a>"), also tends to grow in dense clusters, but it is orange rather than blue. "<a href="Craterellus%20caeruleofuscus">Craterellus caeruleofuscus</a>" does not form compound clusters, and is not restricted to coniferous forests. The pig's ear Gomphus, species "<a href="Gomphus%20clavatus">Gomphus clavatus</a>", is similar in shape and form but fleshier, and light violet to pink.

"Polyozellus multiplex" is an <a href="Mycorrhiza%23Ectomycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizal</a> species, meaning that the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e of the fungus grow in a <a href="Mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a> association with the roots of plants, but the fungal hyphae generally do not penetrate the cells of the plant's roots. The species grows in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous woods</a> under <a href="spruce">spruce</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a>, and more frequently at higher elevations. It is most often encountered in summer and fall.

This species is northern and <a href="alpine%20climate">alpine</a> in distribution, and rarely encountered. Collections have been made in the United States (including <a href="Maine">Maine</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, and Alaska), Canada (<a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>), China, Japan, and Korea. The <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct distribution</a> of this species in North America and East Asia has been noted to occur in a number of other fungal species as well. "Polyozellus multiplex" is also found in the <a href="Queen%20Charlotte%20Islands">Queen Charlotte Islands</a>, where it is commercially harvested.

"Polyozellus multiplex" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, and is collected for sale in Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and China. In North America, it is sometimes collected recreationally, and commercially. The taste is described as mild, and the odor as mild or aromatic. Mycologist <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> claims the flavor to be inferior to "Craterellus". Fruit bodies may be preserved by drying.

The compound <a href="polyozellin">polyozellin</a>—a chemical which can be isolated and purified from "P. multiplex"—inhibits <a href="prolyl%20endopeptidase">prolyl endopeptidase</a> (PEP), an <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that has a role in processing proteins (specifically, <a href="amyloid%20precursor%20protein">amyloid precursor protein</a>) in <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>. Chemicals that inhibit PEP have attracted research interest due to their potential therapeutic effects. Further analyses of extracts from "P. multiplex" revealed similar <a href="dibenzofuran">dibenzofuran</a>yl <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> of polyozellin, each with different <a href="Chemical%20property">chemical properties</a>, including <a href="kynapcin">kynapcin</a>-12, kynapcin-13 and -28, and -24. A <a href="total%20synthesis">total synthesis</a> of kynapcin-24 was achieved in 2009.

Research conducted in 2003 suggests that extracts from "Polyozellus multiplex" may have suppressive effects on <a href="stomach%20cancer">stomach cancer</a>. The study showed that feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced the <a href="Enzyme%20assay%23Enzyme%20activity">activities</a> of the enzymes <a href="glutathione%20S-transferase">glutathione S-transferase</a> and <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>, and increased the abundance of the molecule <a href="glutathione">glutathione</a>. The extract also augmented the <a href="protein%20expression%20%28biotechnology%29">expression</a> of the protein <a href="p53">p53</a>. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.

Premiership of John Edward Brownlee

<a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee">John Edward Brownlee</a> was <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a>, Canada, from 1925 to 1934 as leader of the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA) caucus in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>. After a number of early successes, his popularity and his government's suffered from the hardships of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. In 1934, he was embroiled in a <a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee%20sex%20scandal">sex scandal</a> when a family friend sued him for seduction. Though Brownlee denied the events she alleged, when the jury found in her favour he announced his resignation as premier.

Brownlee became premier on November 23, 1925, when, at the request of the UFA caucus, he took over from the indecisive <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>, in whose cabinet he had served as attorney-general. After winning the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201926">1926 election</a> for the UFA, Brownlee achieved a number of successes. In 1929 he signed an agreement with the federal government that transferred control of Alberta's natural resources to its provincial government, which had been a priority of his three immediate predecessors as premier. In 1928 he divested the government of the money-losing railways it had acquired after the syndicates that founded them went out of business, by selling them to <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific</a> and <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National</a>. This was part of his program to balance the provincial budget, at which he was successful beginning in 1925. His government also introduced a controversial <a href="Sexual%20Sterilization%20Act%20of%20Alberta">sexual sterilization program</a> to prevent the mentally disabled from procreating.

His government's fortunes entered a decline following the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201930">1930 election</a>. Agricultural prices collapsed, throwing many of Alberta's farmers into abject poverty. Urban unemployment shot up, and the government had no choice but to return to <a href="deficit%20spending">deficit spending</a>. Brownlee tried to broker deals between farmers and banks, but found neither side eager to compromise. Political radicalism increased, as communism, the new <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a>, and <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>'s <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a> movement gained new adherents. The UFA itself elected as its president radical socialist <a href="Robert%20Gardiner%20%28politician%29">Robert Gardiner</a>. In 1933, Prime Minister <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> named Brownlee to the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">Royal Commission on Banking and Currency</a> as a representative of western interests and unorthodox viewpoints. In this capacity Brownlee travelled the country questioning witnesses, especially bankers and farmers. While he concurred with the commission's ultimate recommendation for the creation of a central bank, he also made a series of recommendations of his own, including that the central bank be controlled entirely by the government.

In 1934 Brownlee was sued for the seduction of Vivian MacMillan, a family friend and a secretary in his government's attorney-general's office. MacMillan claimed that she and Brownlee had carried on an affair for three years. Though Brownlee denied MacMillan's story completely, and though his lawyer exposed inconsistencies in cross-examination, the jury sided with MacMillan. In deference to public outrage over the charges, John Brownlee resigned as premier July 10, 1934, and was succeeded by <a href="Richard%20Gavin%20Reid">Richard Gavin Reid</a>.

Brownlee became Premier November 23, 1925, when <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Alberta">Lieutenant Governor of Alberta</a> <a href="William%20Egbert">William Egbert</a>, at the behest of much of the UFA caucus, asked him to form a government. Previously, Brownlee had been Attorney-General in the government of <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>. Greenfield was a weak and indecisive premier, and UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) began increasingly to look to Brownlee to leadership. Though Brownlee resisted early calls to assume the premiership out of loyalty to Greenfield, he was eventually persuaded by the advice of UFA President <a href="Henry%20Wise%20Wood">Henry Wise Wood</a> and Greenfield's assurances that he would happily step aside in Brownlee's favour.

When Brownlee became premier it had already been more than four years since the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">last election</a>. The law required an election at least every five years, and Brownlee called one for June 28, 1926. The <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberals</a> were the <a href="official%20opposition">official opposition</a> and the UFA's major opponent in the election; in 1924, with Greenfield still premier, Liberal leader <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a> had predicted a Liberal victory. Boyle had since been appointed to the bench, and the party was now led by <a href="Joseph%20Tweed%20Shaw">Joseph Tweed Shaw</a>. Shaw had served as the <a href="Labour%20candidates%20and%20parties%20in%20Canada">Labour</a> Member of Parliament for <a href="Calgary%20West">Calgary West</a> from 1921 until 1925; in this capacity he had been endorsed by and enjoyed warm relations with the UFA. Now, running against the UFA government, this previous relationship and his recorded sentiments about it were handicaps.

The <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservatives</a> were led by <a href="Alexander%20McGillivray%20%28politician%29">A. A. McGillivray</a>, an outstanding courtroom lawyer and friend of Brownlee's who the latter had, as attorney-general, hired to prosecute <a href="Emilio%20Picariello">Emilio Picariello</a>. McGillivray had released his party's entire platform shortly after becoming leader in 1925, and so had little new to say during the campaign. While Brownlee admired his intellect, he considered that he was out of touch with voters' views, likening him to federal Conservative leader <a href="Arthur%20Meighen">Arthur Meighen</a>.

During the campaign, Brownlee travelled the province speaking to public meetings. He emphasized his record and the UFA's, pointing to the province's improving financial position and to its involvement in the establishment of the <a href="Alberta%20Wheat%20Pool">Alberta Wheat Pool</a>. He touted the period since the last election as "five years of progress". In keeping with the UFA's view of good government as being the non-partisan administration of business rather than any clash of ideologies, he concluded his speeches by asking "Are we going to return in this Province to Government based on the two-party system, or are we going to continue to work for a better [way]?"

The UFA contested 46 of Alberta's 60 seats, including lawyer <a href="John%20Lymburn">John Lymburn</a>'s candidacy in <a href="Edmonton%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Edmonton</a> (the first time the rural UFA had run a candidate in either of the province's two major cities). Of these 46 candidates, 43—including Lymburn and Brownlee, who was acclaimed in his <a href="Ponoka%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Ponoka</a> riding—were elected. This was an increase from the 38 who were elected in 1921. Seven Liberals and four Conservatives were elected. The remaining six seats went to <a href="Labour%20candidates%20and%20parties%20in%20Canada">Labour</a> candidates who were generally friendly with the UFA, though Labour MLA <a href="Alex%20Ross%20%28politician%29">Alex Ross</a>, who had served in Brownlee's cabinet, was defeated in <a href="Calgary%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Calgary</a>.

At the time that Brownlee became premier, provincial governments were still the junior partners in the <a href="Canadian%20federalism">Canadian federation</a>. Amendments to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Canada">Constitution of Canada</a> expanding provincial powers were still years in the future, as was the advent of the <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a>, which expanded the importance of such provincial responsibilities as health care and education. Brownlee was reliant on cooperation from the federal government for virtually all of his major objectives. <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a> <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> was <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a> for almost all of the first five years of Brownlee's premiership.

During this period King led a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> that relied for its survival in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons of Canada</a> on a block of <a href="Progressive%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressive</a> and allied members of Parliament (MPs). Eleven of this group sat as members of the UFA, and Brownlee met with several of them shortly after taking office to coordinate strategy on Alberta's objectives. These MPs were doubly influential with King because of his desire to absorb them into the Liberal Party; he viewed Progressives as "Liberals in a hurry". In <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, Liberal Premier <a href="Charles%20Avery%20Dunning">Charles Avery Dunning</a> remained in office with the support of the progressive farmers' movement, but in Alberta Brownlee and the UFA were strong enough to govern without the support of the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">provincial Liberals</a>, who remained bitter opponents of his government.

The relationship between Brownlee and King was helped by the former's preference for the Liberals over the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservatives</a>. After King lost his seat in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201925">1925 federal election</a>, he sought and received Brownlee's advice on running in a by-election in any of the four Liberal-controlled Alberta constituencies. Brownlee's preferences were not shared by all in the UFA: his Railways Minister, <a href="Vernor%20Smith">Vernor Smith</a>, was accused of actively lobbying UFA MPs to vote with <a href="Arthur%20Meighen">Arthur Meighen</a>'s Conservatives during the <a href="King%E2%80%93Byng%20Affair">King–Byng Crisis</a>. Moreover, not all of King's ministers shared his desire to cooperate with Progressives: his cabinet's Alberta representative, <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Charles Stewart</a>, was implacably opposed to Brownlee and the UFA, which had defeated him in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">1921 provincial election</a> when he was the Liberal Premier of Alberta.

King held Brownlee in high regard: he considered recruiting him to his cabinet as a replacement for Stewart in 1925. He put this plan on hold when Brownlee became premier, but did not abandon it. When he made another attempt in 1929, Brownlee expressed interest, reasserting his support for the federal Liberals, but indicated that he was not politically ambitious and that he would expect the right to resign if he disagreed with government policy. King found this response discouraging, and decided to await the results of the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201930">1930 election</a> before pressing the issue. King's defeat in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201930">1930 federal election</a> rendered the question moot.

On no issue was Brownlee's relationship with the King government more critical than it was for the control of natural resources. The terms under which Alberta, like Saskatchewan and Manitoba, entered Canada left control of its natural resources with the federal government; the <a href="Constitution%20Act%2C%201867">British North America Act</a> gave control of the older provinces' natural resources to their provincial governments. While Alberta did receive compensation in the form of an annual grant, Brownlee, like his three immediate predecessors, felt that it was insufficient. The federal government had been committed since 1920 to the principle of transferring resource control to the province; only the specific terms of the transfer remained to be established. Alberta, though willing to give up the grant, felt that it was owed compensation for land grants and mineral leases that were made by the federal government, but which Alberta would be expected to honour after the resources were transferred.

After years of wrangling between the federal government and <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>'s Alberta government—wrangling in which Brownlee, as Greenfield's attorney-general, played a major role—it initially appeared that the transfer was agreed upon: Brownlee met with King in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> in January 1926 and signed the agreement (subject to ratification by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">federal Parliament</a> and the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>). However, the next month federal lawyer O. M. Biggar came to <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> to discuss minor changes to the agreement. One of these changes was a requirement that Alberta administer school lands and the school lands fund "for the support of schools organized and carried on therein, in accordance with the provisions of Section 17 of the <a href="Alberta%20Act">Alberta Act</a>". Understanding this to mean only that the province would be required to use the school lands fund to support schools—a proposition to which Brownlee had no objection—he agreed. It soon emerged that what was actually intended was that Alberta continue to support separate <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> schools. Brownlee took exception to this, less from any objection to funding Catholic schools than on the principle that education was a matter of provincial jurisdiction, but King would not allow him to rescind his agreement. In fact, the change had been made at the instigation of <a href="Ernest%20Lapointe">Ernest Lapointe</a>, King's <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> lieutenant, who wanted to placate Quebec nationalist leader <a href="Henri%20Bourassa">Henri Bourassa</a>, and in <a href="Tim%20Byrne">Tim Byrne</a>'s opinion "was obviously a political move that had little to do with the agreement". Brownlee countered by putting a modified version of the agreement to his legislature, one that replaced the offending language with "organized in accordance with the laws of the Province". It passed unanimously.

This remained a point of contention until 1929, when Brownlee and King agreed on a new wording: "organized in accordance with the laws of the Province, but in keeping with the letter and the spirit of the constitution." The federal government had already agreed to continue the resource subsidy in perpetuity, but Brownlee objected to its plans to base the amount on Alberta's 1929 population, which would see it receive less than Saskatchewan in perpetuity despite having a much faster-growing population. When the federal Turgeon Commission recommended that Manitoba, in addition to a perpetual subsidy, receive a one-time payment of more than $4 million, Brownlee demanded the same for Alberta. King countered that the purpose of that one time payment was to compensate Manitoba for years during which it, unlike Alberta and Saskatchewan, did not receive a subsidy; Brownlee responded that the federal government had given away more than three times as much of Alberta's land as Manitoba's to the railways. King left the meeting in protest against this new demand, but he was determined to settle with Manitoba and Alberta in order to isolate Saskatchewan Premier <a href="James%20Thomas%20Milton%20Anderson">James Thomas Milton Anderson</a> and his more extravagant demands. He eventually accepted Brownlee's terms, and an agreement was signed December 14, 1929. The agreement provided for an annual subsidy of $562,000 until Alberta's population reached 800,000 and $750,000 until it reached 1,200,000, after which it would be $1,125,000.

Brownlee was hailed as a hero in Alberta; he had succeeded where every previous premier had failed. Despite sub-zero temperatures, 3,000 people greeted him at the railway station on his return to Edmonton, where he was feted by a band, a bonfire, and fireworks. As <a href="Lakeland%20College%20%28Alberta%29">Lakeland College</a> historian and Brownlee biographer Franklin Foster wrote, Brownlee was "at the peak of his political career". In Byrne's view, "this was the greatest achievement of Brownlee's career as premier" and would, had he retired at the time, allowed him to "[enter] history as one of Alberta's great premiers".

In 1925, the Alberta government owned four small railways whose founding syndicates, on whose behalf the government had made guarantees to financiers, had collapsed. The Greenfield government's attempts to sell these lines to one or both of <a href="Canadian%20Pacific">Canadian Pacific</a> (CP) or <a href="Canadian%20National">Canadian National</a> (CN) had failed. By 1925, the money-losing lines represented an annual drain of $1.5 million on the provincial budget. Brownlee reprised old attempts in January 1926, making direct offers to CN President <a href="Henry%20Thornton%20%28railway%20manager%29">Henry Thornton</a> and CP President <a href="Edward%20Wentworth%20Beatty">Edward Wentworth Beatty</a>, but neither was interested, owing to the Alberta lines' debts and operating losses. Faced with no buyers, potential leasers willing to operate the lines only on terms unfavourable to the province, and in <a href="Vernor%20Smith">Vernor Smith</a> a Minister of Railways who vigorously supported public ownership, Brownlee's government opted to take over direct operation of the lines in 1927. It also moved its contract for the transcontinental transport of the lines' freight from CP to CN, in the hopes that doing so would ensure that both companies would have firsthand knowledge of the lines' freight levels and be interested in acquiring them in better economic times.

Late in 1927, Brownlee began to advocate for joint acquisition of the lines by CN and CP. When, in early 1928, the lines began to show a profit thanks to the management of Deputy Minister of Railways John Callaghan, he began to pursue the idea with more vigour. One of the lines, the Lacombe and North Western, was sold to CP for $1.5 million, and CP and CN made a joint offer of $15 million for the <a href="Edmonton%2C%20Dunvegan%20and%20British%20Columbia">Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia</a>, the largest of the lines. Brownlee recommended against acceptance of the latter offer, believing that the price was too low, the terms of payment too unfavourable (none would be made until 1930, and the interest rate applied was only one and a half percent—less than Brownlee believed that the province could earn in operating profits by keeping the railway), and the result of Alberta being left with a department of railways responsible for a single railway too undesirable.

This caution paid off later in the year when the province received and accepted a $25 million offer from CP (with CN holding an option to acquire 50% ownership) to purchase the remaining lines. Brownlee's negotiating skill was widely praised in the aftermath of the deal.

As attorney-general in the Greenfield government, Brownlee had been critical of its large deficits, and putting a stop to them was one of his priorities on taking office. He accomplished this objective sooner than he might have expected: though the government had projected a deficit for 1925, on February 11, 1926, he announced to the legislature that the year's accounts had actually recorded a surplus of $188,019. A second small surplus was recorded in 1926. Securing control of natural resources and disposing of the railways were two elements of Brownlee's strategy for ensuring that these surpluses continued, but he also took other measures. For example, on a trip to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in the summer of 1927, he met with international financiers in an effort to increase their confidence in the creditworthiness of his government.

Brownlee advocated austerity despite surpluses. In November 1927, at a <a href="First%20Ministers%27%20conference">First Ministers' conference</a>, he complained of increased public demand for spending in areas of provincial jurisdiction, such as education, health, and welfare. In the meantime, the federal government's relatively reduced role in public spending allowed it the political credit that comes with running surpluses, reducing its debt, and cutting taxes. The following year he recommended that Alberta not opt into the new federal-provincial <a href="old%20age%20pension">old age pension</a> program because he felt that Alberta's share was too onerous. The legislature accepted his recommendation for one year, to give him time to persuade the federal government to take on a greater share of the cost, but opted into the program after that even though no greater commitment from the federal government was forthcoming.

In 1928, the Alberta government ran a surplus of $1,578,823, the largest in its history and the second largest in the country. Despite this, Brownlee held firm to his desire to limit spending, warning of serious problems if the economy should go into recession. His resulting "<a href="Ebenezer%20Scrooge">Scrooge</a>-like" reputation began to take a toll on his popularity.

At Brownlee's instigation, the Greenfield government had implemented a "Debt Adjustment Act", which allowed farmers in Alberta's drought-stricken southeast to access credit counselling services and provided a way to settle creditors' claims without ruining farmers or resorting to litigation. At the time, Brownlee had wanted to extend it province-wide, but had been dissuaded by the opposition of moneylenders. In 1928, as premier, Brownlee tried again. Lending institutions again objected, and threatened to withdraw from the province if the act was extended. Brownlee felt that these threats were disingenuous, noting that similar measures already existed to protect merchants. However, it was a prosperous time for farmers, and so mobilized support for the legislation was in shorter supply than it might have been during a time of economic hardship; Brownlee, newly disillusioned with bankers, withdrew the bill.

In autumn 1928, an early frost reduced farm incomes by between ten and 25 percent. Farmers began to demand the extension of the "Debt Adjustment Act" over the entire province, along with more radical measures. Citing the example of R. W. Barritt, a farmer near <a href="Mirror%2C%20Alberta">Mirror</a> who had lost his farm at the end of 1928 to Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation despite diligent efforts to pay off his debt, they demanded legislation that would spread the burden of failed crops between debtor and creditor, rather than leaving it all on farmers. Brownlee rejected such calls: "Unless we are to say that individuals or companies who lend money in this Province in good faith must wait indefinitely for repayment, whatever may be the contract or agreement at the time, there comes a limit to the extent to which the Government is justified in interfering".

As attorney-general, Brownlee had played a major role in the creation of the <a href="Alberta%20Wheat%20Pool">Alberta Wheat Pool</a>. As premier, he continued his support of it. In May 1927 he attended the Second International Cooperative Wheat Pool Conference in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, where he spoke on the importance of wheat pools in ensuring that farmers received "not occasionally, but with reasonable regularity, the cost of production plus an adequate and substantial return for [their] labor and investment". On his return to Alberta, he participated in a rally to encourage farmers to sign on with the pool; the effort enticed several new farmers, including the manager of the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>' ranch, to join. On a July 1927 trip to Europe, he investigated the possibility of marketing Alberta wheat directly to European millers, rather than passing it through multiple grain buyers, exporters, shippers, and importers, but found that European millers feared that buying directly from foreign sources would alienate domestic producers.

In 1927, <a href="Perren%20Baker">Perren Baker</a>, Brownlee's Minister of Education, had announced as his priorities improving the quality of teaching and ensuring that sufficient schools existed for the growing number of students wishing to earn a high school diploma. In pursuit of these objectives, he released a new "School Act" in 1929, whose major initiative was to consolidate Alberta's thousands of autonomous school districts, each with control over its own finances, into a smaller number of <a href="school%20division">school division</a>s. The act also moved responsibility for teacher salaries and employment conditions from the school districts to the provincial government and standardized educational <a href="mill%20rate">mill rate</a>s across the province. Educational reformers supported the legislation as a vehicle for coherent reform of the sort that was impossible under the decentralized status quo, but a large majority of rural residents, the staple of the UFA's support base, opposed it for fear that it would lead to the closure of local schools and greater travel distances for rural students. While Brownlee strongly supported the bill, he ordered it withdrawn in deference to public opinion.

In 1928, Brownlee's government had to select a replacement for <a href="Henry%20Marshall%20Tory">Henry Marshall Tory</a>, the first President of the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>, who was leaving to become the first head of the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20%28Canada%29">National Research Council</a>. After narrowing the candidates to <a href="Premier%20of%20Manitoba">Premier of Manitoba</a> <a href="John%20Bracken">John Bracken</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> geologist <a href="Robert%20Charles%20Wallace">Robert Charles Wallace</a>, Brownlee privately consulted friend and former <a href="Progressive%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressive</a> leader <a href="Thomas%20Crerar">Thomas Crerar</a>, who knew both men. Crerar reported that in his opinion and those of his close friends Bracken was the better choice, owing to his superior administrative experience. Brownlee eventually opted for Wallace, both because of concern for Bracken's health and for fear that he would be seen as a political appointment.

The 1920s <a href="Progressivism">Progressive movement</a> of which the Brownlee government was a part advocated <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a>, including the sexual sterilization of so-called "mental defectives" to improve the genetic quality of the human race. <a href="First-wave%20feminism">First-wave feminists</a> such as <a href="Nellie%20McClung">Nellie McClung</a> made public appeals to "save" mentally retarded girls from pregnancy. The medical profession suggested that many inmates of <a href="insane%20asylum">insane asylum</a>s could be safely released but for the concern that they would procreate. In 1928, the Brownlee government introduced the "<a href="Sexual%20Sterilization%20Act%20of%20Alberta">Sexual Sterilization Act</a>", allowing a Board of Examination—jointly nominated by the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> Senate and the <a href="Alberta%20College%20of%20Physicians%20and%20Surgeons">College of Physicians</a>—to mandate the sterilization of any psychiatric patient if it was "unanimously of the opinion that the patient might be safely discharged if the danger of procreation with its attendant risk of multiplication of the evil by transmission of the disability to progeny were eliminated". Permission of the patient was nominally required, but permission of the nearest relative could be substituted in cases where the board considered the patient not mentally competent.
The Liberals and Conservatives opposed the bill, as did two of the five Labour members. Nor were the UFA members unanimous in the legislation's support: <a href="Maurice%20Conner">Maurice Conner</a> abstained, and thirteen others—including <a href="Archibald%20Matheson">Archibald Matheson</a>, who had made early attempts to have the bill die on the order paper—were absent for the final vote. Even so, the bill passed by a vote of 31 to 11. The next day, posters appeared along <a href="Jasper%20Avenue">Jasper Avenue</a> advocating the sterilization of <a href="George%20Hoadley%20%28Alberta%20politician%29">George Hoadley</a>, Brownlee's Minister of Health and the bill's sponsor.

During the first part of Brownlee's premiership, the presidency of the UFA was still held by his old friend and ally <a href="Henry%20Wise%20Wood">Henry Wise Wood</a>. Wood's considerable influence helped hold in check the organization's more radical elements, who were generally antagonistic to the cautious and conservative Brownlee. Even so, Foster and Byrne suggest that towards the beginning of Brownlee's term, he started to replace Wood as the "centre" of the UFA in a way that Greenfield had not. Despite this, his relationship with the UFA grassroots was sometimes stormy. The 1929 UFA convention saw vocal criticisms of Brownlee's failure to adopt the old age pension and his decision to withdraw the "Debt Adjustment Act" in the face of opposition from banks. He also rejected the notion, dear to many UFA members, that a UFA government should be bound by the resolutions of the UFA membership. He felt that the heated atmosphere of UFA conventions did not lend itself to the development of prudent policy, and that the government of Alberta ought to be accountable not only to UFA members but to the population at large.

Not helping matters, the UFA, once a populist <a href="mass%20movement">mass movement</a>, was beginning to lose touch with its <a href="grassroots">grassroots</a>. In advance of the 1926 election, several constituencies had trouble generating the interest necessary for a nomination meeting. While the UFA membership strongly endorsed Baker's proposed educational reforms, it soon emerged that a large majority of farmers opposed them. Such incidents only reinforced Brownlee's disinclination to accept marching orders from UFA convention resolutions.

Brownlee wanted to call an election in 1929 after his government won control of Alberta's natural resources, but could not convince his cabinet or his caucus. Taking advantage of a period of increased popularity to call an early election was considered immoral by many in the UFA, the sort of thing that the old-style parties might try but which the UFA had been elected to hold itself above. As such, an election was not held until June 19, 1930, four years less nine days after the previous one.

Brownlee was the campaign's dominant figure, and gave 67 speeches around the province. He stressed the UFA government's experience and contrasted it with the Liberals' and Conservatives' lack thereof. Having signed the resource agreement, he asked for a mandate to administer its implementation. In response to claims that a strong opposition was needed to exercise a check on his certain-to-be-re-elected government, he restated his view of government as "the administration of business" by saying "an opposition is a thing that is no more needed in the public business of this Province ... than in the management of the affairs of any of our large corporations." Byrne suggests that Brownlee arrived at this belief rationally but, once he had done so, "adhered to [it] with an almost religious conviction".

The election gave the UFA a slightly reduced majority, with 39 of the legislature's 63 seats. Labour candidates, on behalf of many of whom Brownlee campaigned, won a further four. The Liberals remained the official opposition with eleven members, while the Conservatives returned six. The remaining three seats were won by independent candidates.

In the 1920s and 1930s, Alberta's economy was heavily reliant on <a href="wheat">wheat</a>, and in 1930 the price of wheat began to fall drastically. From its peak of $1.78 per bushel in summer 1929, by February 1930 it had fallen to $1.07 because of world oversupply and <a href="Dumping%20%28pricing%20policy%29">dumping</a> by the Soviet Union and Argentina. By March it had reached $1.00, a level at which most Alberta wheat farmers could not profit. By the fall, it had had fallen below $0.60 and by the end of the year to $0.45. Other agricultural products, especially cattle, poultry, and eggs, saw similar or greater price decreases.
In February 1930 Brownlee advocated a federally guaranteed minimum price to farmers of $0.70 per bushel of wheat. In November he asked new Prime Minister <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a>, with whom he had practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous, to stabilize wheat "at some reasonable price". Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable in the face of a global oversupply of 400 million bushels. Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks' increasing reluctance to lend money to farmers, many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans. Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance, but only quietly and only in the last resort; he was concerned that a well-publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to lend money under predatory terms, knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would. When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks' loans to farmers for <a href="binder%20twine">binder twine</a>, he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government. To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans, he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter. As he had hoped, this threat enhanced lenders' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating <a href="foreclosures">foreclosures</a> and to initiate them only where farmers' payments did not even cover interest. Despite these minor successes, Brownlee's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished. It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat, part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply.

A second consequence of collapsing wheat prices was the threat they posed to the <a href="Alberta%20Wheat%20Pool">Alberta Wheat Pool</a> (AWP). Falling prices and the attendant tightened credit conditions led the Pool, along with its counterparts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, to seek help from its provincial government in 1930. Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool, but told the legislature that he did not expect this guarantee to prove necessary, since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell "to a level never reached on Canadian markets". In October 1930, with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $1.00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers, the banks refused to lend more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency (CSA) a general manager acceptable to the banks. Brownlee and Premiers <a href="John%20Bracken">John Bracken</a> of Manitoba and <a href="James%20Thomas%20Milton%20Anderson">James Thomas Milton Anderson</a> of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir <a href="George%20Perley">George Perley</a>, seeking direct federal aid to the Pools. The premiers' pleas rejected, CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers. The first was John McFarland, former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company. The second was Brownlee. The banks chose McFarland. Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance: he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto capital expenditures, and he required it to increase its sales commission from three quarters of a cent per bushel to one cent. While these conditions met with resistance from farmer leaders who believed that they would transform the AWP from a farmers' organization to a grain company like any other, Brownlee was supported by UFA President <a href="Henry%20Wise%20Wood">Henry Wise Wood</a>, the AWP was reliant on provincial support, and the conditions were accepted.

The effects of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> were not felt only on Alberta's farms. By the winter of 1930–1931, unemployment in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> and <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> was at record levels, which were only exacerbated by a migration of farmers' offspring, hoping to find work, to the cities. Brownlee, who had long advocated curtailed immigration to the western provinces, urged the federal government to prevent new migrants from swelling the ranks of Alberta's unemployed. He also asked that it shoulder a greater share of ever-rising relief payments; by 1932, it started to do so.
Unemployment bred labour militancy. In December 1930, Brownlee asked <a href="John%20Lymburn">John Lymburn</a>, his attorney-general, to prepare a list of known <a href="Communist">Communist</a> leaders so he could arrange for their deportation where possible. He staunchly opposed the activities of organizations that he viewed as communist, including the <a href="Ukrainian%20Labour%20Farmer%20Temple%20Association">Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association</a> and the Farmers' Unity League. In December 1932, labour organizers staged a "Hunger March", at which 1,000 unemployed met in Edmonton's Market Square and marched to the legislature building. Brownlee refused to grant permission for the march and requested and received police assistance in breaking it up. While he pronounced himself willing to meet with a delegation of the march's leaders, he believed that the atmosphere at the march would be dangerously volatile and refused to address it. One participant said "A lot of us understood that [Brownlee] couldn't do too much, but we figured since it's a farmers' government, least he can do is come out and explain. But they wouldn't let us near the Parliament Building."

The shrinking provincial economy and increasing relief payments brought about the return of public deficits to Alberta. Brownlee, a fiscal conservative in good times, became still more aggressive in cutting spending. In 1931 the government closed all but two of the province's <a href="agricultural%20college">agricultural college</a>s, the creation of which by the Liberal government of <a href="Arthur%20Sifton">Arthur Sifton</a> had been a major UFA victory. The <a href="civil%20service">civil service</a> shrank from 2,566 at the beginning of 1930 to 1,600 at the end of 1931. Government spending on advertising fell from $36,000 in 1929 to less than $8,000 in 1932. In 1932 the government disbanded the <a href="Alberta%20Provincial%20Police">Alberta Provincial Police</a> and asked the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> to take over policing in the province. The same year, government employees earning more than $100 per month took 10% pay cuts; in Brownlee's case, this translated into an annual reduction of nearly $1,500.
Brownlee's government also took action to increase government revenues: the 1932 budget increased corporate taxes and imposed a new personal <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> on individuals earning more than $750 per year and couples earning more than $1,500; fewer than 100 farmers in the province earned enough to pay it. In 1933 he joined Bracken and Anderson in protesting to Bennett that nothing more could be done: in Brownlee's view, the province's impoverished people could not pay more taxes, and yet expectations of provincial governments were constantly growing. Left to their own devices, the premiers said, they would have to either drastically cut relief payments or default on debt payments. They asked that the federal government increase its share of unemployment relief from one third to one half and that it lend the provinces the money they needed to pay their share. Bennett replied by chastising the premiers for not doing enough to "work into a position of self-reliance" and decreed that federal support would be cut off unless budget deficits were limited to $1 million. In a separate letter to Brownlee, he praised him for doing "better than any one of the Western Provinces" but said that, in the interests of equality, he was imposing the same conditions on Alberta as on the others.

Despite Brownlee's efforts, Alberta's budgetary position worsened. In 1931 the government ran a deficit of $2.5 million, the first of Brownlee's premiership; 1932's deficit surpassed $4 million. Also in 1932, the Alberta government came within hours of defaulting on a $3 million <a href="bond%20%28finance%29">bond</a>, and was saved only by a loan from the federal government. Over the longer-term, it funded its operations by a $15 million issue at record interest rates; even this was taken up only because of guarantees from the federal government.

Henry Wise Wood declined to seek re-election as UFA President at its 1931 convention, and was replaced by <a href="Robert%20Gardiner%20%28politician%29">Robert Gardiner</a>. In contrast to Wood, Gardiner was firmly entrenched on the progressive movement's left-wing. He denounced Brownlee's approach to economic policy, saying that his austerity only exacerbated the problem of <a href="underconsumption">underconsumption</a>. Under Gardiner, the UFA moved increasingly to the left, well out of step with the Brownlee government, and passed resolutions calling for the nationalization of land, radio broadcasting, and hydroelectricity, along with the cancellation of interest payments as long as the price of agricultural commodities was less than the cost of their production. In 1932, prominent UFA members—including MP <a href="William%20Irvine%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">William Irvine</a>—attended the founding convention of the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> in Calgary. This new federal party advocated <a href="socialism">socialism</a> and considered itself a partnership between farmers and labourers; Brownlee wanted no part of its policies.
At around the same time, Calgary radio evangelist <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a> began to preach a new economic theory called <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a>. Though the theory required control of <a href="monetary%20policy">monetary policy</a>, a federal responsibility, it became increasingly popular among former UFA supporters who, following Aberhart's instructions, began to form local social credit "study groups". Brownlee argued against social credit on the basis that its application by a provincial government would be unconstitutional and that it would do nothing to create markets for Alberta's unsold wheat, which he viewed as the source of Alberta's woes. The legislature held a series of hearings to investigate the theory, and both Aberhart and <a href="C.%20H.%20Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a>, the theory's originator, testified at them. Brownlee questioned both on how the introduction of "credit certificates" issued by the Alberta government could help people so heavily dependent on interprovincial and international trade; neither answered the question to his satisfaction.

In defending his conservatism, Brownlee emphasized that "history has yet to record a single instance of the revolutionary method that has not resulted in a welter of discord and misery" and mused that "if the results were not so tragical, I would like to see Canada put under the most extreme form of socialistic or communistic Government in order that our people could have the actual experience of what would happen and learn for themselves the lesson that in our present day world situation, one nation cannot fashion for itself any level of prosperity regardless of the position of the rest of the world". Even as he rejected the radical solutions posed by others, Brownlee had no solutions of his own to offer but government thrift and moderate debt adjustment.

While Brownlee was viewed as an orthodox conservative in his approach to economic matters within Alberta, elsewhere in Canada he was still regarded as a leader of the country's radical farmer movement. Accordingly, when Bennett struck a <a href="royal%20commission">royal commission</a> to examine the government's role in economic and monetary management, he asked Brownlee to serve on it as a representative of Western and unorthodox views. Though he was concerned that the commission's other two Canadian members, Beaudry Leman and <a href="William%20Thomas%20White">William Thomas White</a>, were involved in the banking industry, Brownlee agreed to the appointment. He was formally appointed with the rest of the members July 31, 1933, and the commission began its work in Ottawa on August 8.
The royal commission conducted hearings across the country. In <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a>, Brownlee questioned witnesses on how poverty among prairie farmers was hurting British Columbia's lumber and <a href="salmon">salmon</a> packing industries. In Calgary he drew testimony from farmers that farming conditions were excellent—in contrast with the wide belief in eastern Canada that western farmers' troubles were caused by drought and land unsuited for agriculture—and that the problem was "not due to Acts of God but to Acts of Man".

The UFA's submission, presented in Calgary by Gardiner, emphasized these points and accused the banks of charging predatory interest rates. It called on the commission to recommend a government-owned <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a> and controls on interest, and concluded that "the monetary system has failed". Brownlee himself wrote the Alberta government's submission, though it was presented at the commission's Edmonton hearings by Acting Premier <a href="George%20Hoadley%20%28Alberta%20politician%29">George Hoadley</a>. It echoed the UFA's points about interest rates and the importance of a government-owned central bank, and accused the banks of treating the west unequally to the east. The commission concluded its hearings in Ottawa in September, where representatives of the banks testified. Brownlee criticized them for "discounting", a practice whereby banks charged higher de facto interest rates than the legal maximum by requiring loan recipients to consent to having a portion of their loan withheld.

The commission's report, issued September 29, recommended the establishment of a central bank and an inquiry on the availability of credit to farmers. Brownlee supported both recommendations, and attached a <a href="wikt%3Aminority%20report">minority report</a> calling for banks to end their disparate treatment of eastern and western debtors, urging that a statutory maximum interest rate be maintained and possibly lowered, and recommending that the proposed central bank be entirely government owned and controlled. This last recommendation came to pass in 1938, when the <a href="Bank%20of%20Canada">Bank of Canada</a>, originally controlled by a mix of public and private interests, was reorganized as a federal <a href="Crown%20corporation">Crown corporation</a>.

Provincially, Brownlee had always enjoyed better relations with the Conservatives than the Liberals. <a href="Alexander%20McGillivray%20%28politician%29">A. A. McGillivray</a>, Conservative leader from 1925 until 1929, was a friend of his, as was his successor <a href="David%20Milwyn%20Duggan">David Duggan</a>. The Liberals despised Brownlee and the UFA, and in 1932 selected <a href="William%20R.%20Howson">William R. Howson</a>, one of their most militant MLAs, as leader. Howson was aggressive in trying to uncover evidence of scandal and malfeasance, including the sensational divorce of <a href="Oran%20McPherson">Oran McPherson</a>. He was aided in these attacks by the unabashedly Liberal "<a href="Edmonton%20Bulletin">Edmonton Bulletin</a>", which distributed free copies of issues containing coverage of the divorce in McPherson's southern <a href="Little%20Bow">Little Bow</a> riding. As the depression and, later, Brownlee's sex scandal took their toll on Brownlee's government, Howson was certain that he would imminently become premier.

Brownlee's relations with the federal parties were somewhat more harmonious. While he personally preferred the Liberals, his history with Bennett led to a cordial working relationship. Both parties made overtures towards Brownlee: King had invited him to join his cabinet while he was still attorney-general, and in 1932 sent an emissary to encourage union of all political parties opposed to the Conservatives. Brownlee reiterated his policy to deal "equally with Liberals and Conservatives in Ottawa", and declined King's overtures. So too did Alberta Liberals, led by Howson and <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Charles Stewart</a>, who sought to replace Brownlee rather than join with him. In 1934, the Conservatives sent <a href="H.%20R.%20Milner">H. R. Milner</a> to raise the possibility of the UFA and the Conservatives joining together against the Liberals and <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a>; Brownlee expressed interest, but made no move to enact such a coalition. A frustrated Bennett dismissed him as "a time server whose one object, apparently, is to retain office."

On September 22, 1933, Liberal lawyer Neil MacLean filed a <a href="statement%20of%20claim">statement of claim</a> on behalf of Vivian MacMillan and her father Allan MacMillan, suing Brownlee for the <a href="Seduction%20%28tort%29">seduction</a> of Vivian. It alleged that Brownlee had lured her to Edmonton from her home in <a href="Edson%2C%20Alberta">Edson</a> in 1930 with the promise of a job in the provincial attorney-general's office. Upon her arrival, she had become a close friend of the family's. One night Brownlee had told her that because of his wife Florence's ill health, they were unable to have a sexual relationship, and that MacMillan must yield to him to prevent him from resuming a sexual relationship with Florence that would likely kill her. MacMillan had eventually yielded, and the ensuing affair lasted until July 1933. Brownlee denied MacMillan's story completely and counter-sued MacMillan and her fiance, John Caldwell, for <a href="Conspiracy%20%28civil%29">conspiracy</a>.

A sensational trial ensued in June 1934, which was reported in lurid detail by the "Bulletin". Despite Brownlee's exposure of contradictions in MacMillan's story, the jury found in favour of the plaintiffs and awarded Vivian $10,000 and her father $5,000. Trial judge <a href="William%20Carlos%20Ives">William Carlos Ives</a> disagreed with the jury's finding and ruled that even if Vivian MacMillan's story had been true, as a matter of law there could be no successful suit for seduction without damages being proved. He overturned the jury's finding and ruled in Brownlee's favour. The case was eventually appealed to the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the British Privy Council</a>, at the time Canada's highest court of appeal, which found in favour of the plaintiffs.

The legal processes and arguments were irrelevant to John Brownlee's political career: as soon as the jury found that he had seduced Vivian MacMillan, he announced that he would resign as premier as soon as a successor could be found. On July 10, 1934, he was succeeded as Premier of Alberta by <a href="Richard%20Gavin%20Reid">Richard Gavin Reid</a>.

Bat

Bats are <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s of the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Chiroptera; with their forelimbs adapted as <a href="wing">wing</a>s, they are the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained <a href="flight">flight</a>. Bats are more manoeuvrable than <a href="bird">bird</a>s, <a href="Bat%20flight">flying</a> with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin <a href="skin">membrane</a> or <a href="patagium">patagium</a>. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is <a href="Kitti%27s%20hog-nosed%20bat">Kitti's hog-nosed bat</a>, which is in length, across the wings and in mass. The largest bats are the <a href="Flying%20fox%23Physical%20characteristics">flying foxes</a> and the <a href="giant%20golden-crowned%20flying%20fox">giant golden-crowned flying fox</a>, "Acerodon jubatus", which can weigh and have a wingspan of .

The second largest order of mammals, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,200 species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating <a href="megabat">megabat</a>s, and the <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocating</a> <a href="microbat">microbat</a>s. But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into <a href="Yinpterochiroptera">Yinpterochiroptera</a> and <a href="Yangochiroptera">Yangochiroptera</a>, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats. Many bats are <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s, and most of the rest are <a href="frugivore">frugivore</a>s (fruit-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the <a href="vampire%20bat">vampire bat</a>s <a href="Hematophagy">feed on blood</a>. Most bats are <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape <a href="predator">predator</a>s. Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. They are important in their ecosystems for <a href="pollinator">pollinating</a> <a href="flower">flower</a>s and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services.

Bats provide humans with some benefits, at the cost of some threats. Bat dung has been mined as <a href="guano">guano</a> from caves and used as fertiliser. Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. They are sometimes numerous enough to serve as tourist attractions, and are used as food across Asia and the <a href="Pacific%20Rim">Pacific Rim</a>. They are <a href="natural%20reservoir">natural reservoir</a>s of many <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s, such as <a href="rabies">rabies</a>; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease. In many cultures, bats are popularly associated with darkness, malevolence, witchcraft, <a href="vampire">vampire</a>s, and death.

An older English name for bats is <a href="wikt%3Aflittermouse">flittermouse</a>, which matches their name in other <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a> (for example German "Fledermaus" and Swedish "fladdermus"), related to the fluttering of wings. <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> had "bakke", most likely cognate with Old Swedish "natbakka" ("night-bat"), which may have undergone a shift from "-k-" to "-t-" (to Modern English "bat") influenced by Latin "blatta", "moth, nocturnal insect". The word "bat" was probably first used in the early 1570s. The name "Chiroptera" derives from – "cheir", "hand" and πτερόν – "pteron", "wing".

The delicate <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>s of bats do not fossilise well, and it is estimated that only 12% of bat genera that lived have been found in the fossil record. Most of the oldest known bat fossils were already very similar to modern microbats, such as "Archaeopteropus" (32 million years ago). The extinct bats "<a href="Palaeochiropteryx%20tupaiodon">Palaeochiropteryx tupaiodon</a>" (48 million years ago) and "<a href="Hassianycteris%20kumari">Hassianycteris kumari</a>" (55 million years ago) are the first fossil mammals whose colouration has been discovered: both were reddish-brown.

Bats were formerly grouped in the superorder <a href="Archonta">Archonta</a>, along with the <a href="treeshrew">treeshrew</a>s (Scandentia), <a href="colugo">colugo</a>s (Dermoptera), and <a href="primate">primate</a>s. Modern genetic evidence now places bats in the superorder <a href="Laurasiatheria">Laurasiatheria</a>, with its <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> as <a href="Fereuungulata">Fereuungulata</a>, which includes <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>ns, <a href="pangolin">pangolin</a>s, <a href="odd-toed%20ungulate">odd-toed ungulate</a>s, <a href="even-toed%20ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s, and <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns. One study places Chiroptera as a sister taxon to odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla).

The phylogenetic relationships of the different groups of bats have been the subject of much debate. The traditional subdivision into Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera reflected the view that these groups of bats had evolved independently of each other for a long time, from a <a href="common%20descent">common ancestor</a> already capable of flight. This hypothesis recognised differences between microbats and megabats and acknowledged that flight has only evolved once in mammals. Most molecular biological evidence supports the view that bats form a natural or <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group.

<a href="Genetics">Genetic</a> evidence indicates that megabats originated during the early <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, and belong within the four major lines of microbats. Two new suborders have been proposed; <a href="Yinpterochiroptera">Yinpterochiroptera</a> includes the <a href="Megabat">Pteropodidae</a>, or megabat family, as well as the families <a href="Horseshoe%20bat">Rhinolophidae</a>, <a href="Hipposideridae">Hipposideridae</a>, <a href="Craseonycteridae">Craseonycteridae</a>, <a href="Megadermatidae">Megadermatidae</a>, and <a href="Rhinopomatidae">Rhinopomatidae</a>. <a href="Yangochiroptera">Yangochiroptera</a> includes the other families of bats (all of which use laryngeal echolocation), a conclusion supported by a 2005 DNA study. A 2013 phylogenomic study supported the two new proposed suborders.

In the 1980s, a hypothesis based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> evidence stated the Megachiroptera evolved flight separately from the Microchiroptera. The <a href="flying%20primate%20hypothesis">flying primate hypothesis</a> proposed that, when adaptations to flight are removed, the Megachiroptera are allied to <a href="primate">primate</a>s by anatomical features not shared with Microchiroptera. For example, the brains of megabats have advanced characteristics. Although recent genetic studies strongly support the monophyly of bats, debate continues about the meaning of the genetic and morphological evidence.

The 2003 discovery of an early fossil bat from the 52 million year old <a href="Green%20River%20Formation">Green River Formation</a>, "<a href="Onychonycteris">Onychonycteris finneyi</a>", indicates that flight evolved before echolocative abilities. "Onychonycteris" had claws on all five of its fingers, whereas modern bats have at most two claws on two digits of each hand. It also had longer hind legs and shorter forearms, similar to climbing mammals that hang under branches, such as <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s and <a href="gibbon">gibbon</a>s. This palm-sized bat had short, broad wings, suggesting that it could not fly as fast or as far as later bat species. Instead of flapping its wings continuously while flying, "Onychonycteris" probably alternated between flaps and glides in the air. This suggests that this bat did not fly as much as modern bats, but flew from tree to tree and spent most of its time climbing or hanging on branches. The distinctive features of the "Onychonycteris" fossil also support the hypothesis that mammalian flight most likely evolved in arboreal locomotors, rather than terrestrial runners. This model of flight development, commonly known as the "trees-down" theory, holds that bats first flew by taking advantage of height and gravity to drop down on to prey, rather than running fast enough for a ground-level take off.
The molecular phylogeny is controversial, as it points to microbats <a href="paraphyly">not having a unique common ancestry</a>, which implies that some seemingly unlikely transformations occurred. The first is that laryngeal echolocation evolved twice in bats, once in Yangochiroptera and once in the rhinolophoids. The second is that laryngeal echolocation had a single origin in Chiroptera, was subsequently lost in the family Pteropodidae (all megabats), and later evolved as a system of tongue-clicking in the genus "Rousettus". Analyses of the sequence of the vocalization gene "FoxP2" were inconclusive on whether laryngeal echolocation was lost in the pteropodids or gained in the echolocating lineages. Echolocation probably first derived in bats from communicative calls. The Eocene bats "<a href="Icaronycteris">Icaronycteris</a>" (52 million years ago) and "<a href="Palaeochiropteryx">Palaeochiropteryx</a>" had cranial adaptations suggesting an ability to detect <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a>. This may have been used at first mainly to forage on the ground for insects and map out their surroundings in their gliding phase, or for communicative purposes. After the adaptation of flight was established, it may have been refined to target flying prey by echolocation. Bats may have evolved echolocation through a shared common ancestor, in which case it was then lost in the Old World megabats, only to be regained in the horseshoe bats; or, echolocation evolved independently in both the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera lineages. Analyses of the hearing gene "Prestin" seem to favour the idea that echolocation developed independently at least twice, rather than being lost secondarily in the pteropodids.

Bats are <a href="placental%20mammal">placental mammal</a>s. After <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, they are the largest <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a>, making up about 20% of mammal species. In 1758, <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> classified the seven bat species he knew of in the genus "<a href="Vespertilio">Vespertilio</a>" in the order <a href="Primates">Primates</a>. Around twenty years later, the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Blumenbach">Johann Friedrich Blumenbach</a> gave them their own order, Chiroptera. Since then, the number of described species has risen to over 1,200, traditionally classified as two suborders: <a href="Megabat">Megachiroptera</a> (megabats), and <a href="Microbat">Microchiroptera</a> (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Several characteristics distinguish the two groups. Microbats use <a href="Animal%20echolocation">echolocation</a> for navigation and finding prey, but megabats apart from those in the genus "<a href="Rousettus">Rousettus</a>" do not, relying instead on their eyesight. Accordingly, megabats have a well-developed <a href="visual%20cortex">visual cortex</a> and good <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a>. Megabats have a claw on the second finger of the forelimb. The external ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats <a href="frugivory">eat fruit</a>, <a href="nectarivore">nectar</a>, or pollen, while most microbats <a href="insectivory">eat insects</a>; others feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, <a href="piscivore">fish</a>, frogs, small mammals, or <a href="hematophagy">blood</a>.
The following classification from Agnarsson and colleagues in 2011 reflects the traditional division into megabat and microbat suborders.


The head and teeth shape of bats can vary by species. In general, megabats have longer snouts, larger eye sockets and smaller ears, giving them a more dog-like appearance, which is the source of their nickname of "flying foxes". Among microbats, longer snouts are associated with nectar-feeding. while vampire bats have reduced snouts to accommodate large incisors and canines.

Small insect-eating bats can have as many as 38 teeth, while vampire bats have only 20. Bats that feed on hard-shelled insects have fewer but larger teeth with longer canines and more robust lower jaws than species that prey on softer bodied insects. In nectar-feeding bats, the canines are long while the cheek-teeth are reduced. In fruit-eating bats, the cusps of the cheek teeth are adapted for crushing. These feeding behaviors are true for both megabats and <a href="microbat">microbat</a>s. The upper incisors of vampire bats lack <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, which keeps them razor-sharp. The bite force of small bats is generated through <a href="mechanical%20advantage">mechanical advantage</a>, allowing them to bite through the <a href="sclerotization">hardened</a> armour of insects or the <a href="Peel%20%28fruit%29">skin</a> of fruit.

Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight, as opposed to <a href="glide%20%28flight%29">gliding</a>, as in the <a href="flying%20squirrel">flying squirrel</a>. The fastest bat, the <a href="Mexican%20free-tailed%20bat">Mexican free-tailed bat</a> ("Tadarida brasiliensis"), can achieve a <a href="ground%20speed">ground speed</a> of .

The finger bones of bats are much more flexible than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, is due to the <a href="upregulation">upregulation</a> of <a href="bone%20morphogenetic%20protein">bone morphogenetic protein</a>s (Bmps). During <a href="embryo">embryonic development</a>, the gene controlling Bmp signalling, "<a href="Bone%20morphogenetic%20protein%202">Bmp2</a>", is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialised limbs required for powered flight. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones undergo <a href="bending">bending</a> and <a href="shear%20stress">shearing</a> <a href="stress%20%28mechanics%29">stress</a>; the bending stresses felt are smaller than in terrestrial mammals, but the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.

As in other mammals, and unlike in birds, the <a href="radius%20%28anatomy%29">radius</a> is the main component of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the <a href="leading%20edge">leading edge</a> of the wing, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against aerodynamic <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>, without having to be thick as in <a href="pterosaur">pterosaur</a> wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the <a href="trailing%20edge">trailing edge</a>, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dexterous than gliding mammals.

The wings of bats are much thinner and consist of more bones than the wings of birds, allowing bats to manoeuvre more accurately than the latter, and fly with more lift and less drag. By folding the wings in toward their bodies on the upstroke, they save 35 percent energy during flight. The membranes are delicate, tearing easily, but can regrow, and small tears heal quickly. The surface of the wings is equipped with touch-sensitive receptors on small bumps called <a href="Merkel%20cell">Merkel cell</a>s, also found on human fingertips. These sensitive areas are different in bats, as each bump has a tiny hair in the centre, making it even more sensitive and allowing the bat to detect and adapt to changing airflow; the primary use is to judge the most efficient speed to fly at, and possibly also to avoid <a href="Stall%20%28fluid%20mechanics%29">stalls</a>. Insectivorous bats may also use tactile hairs to help perform complex manoeuvres to capture prey in flight.

The <a href="patagium">patagium</a> is the wing membrane; it is stretched between the arm and finger bones, and down the side of the body to the hind limbs and tail. This skin membrane consists of <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a>, <a href="elastic%20fibre">elastic fibre</a>s, <a href="nerve">nerve</a>s, <a href="muscle">muscle</a>s, and <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The extent to which the tail of a bat is attached to a patagium can vary by species, with some having completely free tails or even no tails. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of <a href="epidermis">epidermis</a> and <a href="dermis">dermis</a>, as well as <a href="hair%20follicle">hair follicle</a>s, <a href="sweat%20gland">sweat gland</a>s and a fatty subcutaneous layer, is very different from the skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin double layer of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue centre, rich with <a href="collagen">collagen</a> and elastic fibres. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. For bat embryos, <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> (cell death) only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits that forms into the wing membranes. Unlike birds, whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane that can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. This adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspans, unlike birds, which can partly fold their wings in flight, radically reducing the wing span and area for the upstroke and for gliding. Hence bats cannot travel over long distances as birds can.

Nectar- and pollen-eating bats can hover, in a similar way to <a href="hummingbird">hummingbird</a>s. The sharp leading edges of the wings can create <a href="vortex">vortices</a>, which provide <a href="Vortex%20lift">lift</a>. The vortex may be stabilised by the animal changing its wing curvatures.

When not flying, bats hang upside down from their feet, a posture known as roosting. The femurs are attached at the hips in a way that allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. This does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected in the structure of the <a href="cervical%20vertebra">cervical or neck vertebra</a>e in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.

When on the ground, most bats can only crawl awkwardly. A few species such as the <a href="New%20Zealand%20lesser%20short-tailed%20bat">New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat</a> and the <a href="common%20vampire%20bat">common vampire bat</a> are agile on the ground. Both species make lateral gaits (the limbs move one after the other) when moving slowly but vampire bats move with a bounding gait (all limbs move in unison) at greater speeds, the folded up wings being used to propel them forward. Vampire bat likely evolved these gaits to follow their hosts while short-tailed bats developed in the absence of terrestrial mammal competitors. Enhanced terrestrial locomotion does not appear to have reduced their ability to fly.

Bats have an efficient <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a>. They seem to make use of particularly strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of <a href="vein">venous</a> wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Since their bodies are relatively small and lightweight, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.

Bats possess a highly adapted <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a> to cope with the demands of powered flight, an energetically taxing activity that requires a large continuous throughput of oxygen. In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are larger than in most other small quadrupedal mammals. Because of the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.

It takes a lot of energy and an efficient circulatory system to work the flight muscles of bats. Energy supply to the muscles engaged in flight require about double the amount compared to the muscles that do not use flight as a means of mammalian locomotion. In parallel to energy consumption, blood oxygen levels of flying animals are twice as much as those of their terrestrially locomoting mammals. As the blood supply controls the amount of oxygen supplied throughout the body, the <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory system</a> must respond accordingly. Therefore, compared to a terrestrial mammal of the same relative size, the bat's <a href="heart">heart</a> can be up to three times larger, and pump more blood. Cardiac output is directly derived from heart rate and <a href="stroke%20volume">stroke volume</a> of the blood; an active <a href="microbat">microbat</a> can reach a heart rate of 1000 <a href="beats%20per%20minute">beats per minute</a>.

With its extremely thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing can significantly contribute to the organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wings spread it allows for an increase in surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful degree of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane lie very close to the surface and allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

The <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> of bats has varying adaptations depending on the species of bat and its diet. As in other flying animals, food is processed quickly and effectively to keep up with the energy demand. Insectivorous bats may have certain <a href="digestive%20enzyme">digestive enzyme</a>s to better process insects, such as <a href="chitinase">chitinase</a> to break down <a href="chitin">chitin</a>, which is a large component of insects. Vampire bats, probably due to their diet of blood, are the only vertebrates that do not have the enzyme <a href="maltase">maltase</a>, which breaks down <a href="malt%20sugar">malt sugar</a>, in their intestinal tract. Nectivorous and frugivorous bats have more maltase and <a href="sucrase">sucrase</a> enzymes than insectivorous, to cope with the higher sugar contents of their diet.

The adaptations of the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s of bats vary with their diets. Carnivorous and vampire bats consume large amounts of protein and can output concentrated <a href="urine">urine</a>; their kidneys have a thin cortex and long <a href="renal%20papilla">renal papilla</a>e. Frugivorous bats lack that ability and have kidneys adapted for <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>-retention due to their low-electrolyte diet; their kidneys accordingly have a thick cortex and very short conical papillae.

Bats have higher metabolic rates associated with flying, which lead to an increased respiratory water loss. Their large wings are composed of the highly vascularized membranes, increasing the surface area, and leading to <a href="cutaneous">cutaneous</a> evaporative water loss. Water helps maintain their <a href="electrolyte%20imbalance">ionic balance</a> in their blood, <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> system, and removal of wastes and toxins from the body via urine. They are also susceptible to <a href="Blood%20urea%20nitrogen">blood urea</a> poisoning if they do not receive enough fluid.

The structure of the uterine system in female bats can vary by species, with some having two <a href="uterine%20horn">uterine horn</a>s while others have a single mainline chamber.

Microbats and a few megabats emit ultrasonic sounds to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, the brain and auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localise, and classify their prey in darkness. Bat calls are some of the loudest airborne animal sounds, and can range in intensity from 60 to 140 <a href="decibels">decibels</a>. Microbats use their <a href="larynx">larynx</a> to create <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a>, and emit it through the mouth and sometimes the nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats ("Rhinolophus" spp.). Microbat calls range in frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000 Hz, extending well beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000 Hz). Various groups of bats have evolved fleshy extensions around and above the nostrils, known as <a href="nose-leaf">nose-leaves</a>, which play a role in sound transmission.

In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can separate their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. Bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes allows the bat to estimate the range to their prey.

In high-duty cycle echolocation, bats emit a continuous call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. The ears of these bats are sharply tuned to a specific frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range by taking advantage of the <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.

In addition to echolocating prey, bat ears are sensitive to the fluttering of <a href="moth">moth</a> wings, the sounds produced by <a href="tymbal">tymbal</a>ate insects, and the movement of ground-dwelling prey, such as centipedes and earwigs. The complex geometry of ridges on the inner surface of bat ears helps to sharply focus echolocation signals, and to passively listen for any other sound produced by the prey. These ridges can be regarded as the acoustic equivalent of a <a href="Fresnel%20lens">Fresnel lens</a>, and exist in a large variety of unrelated animals, such as the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a>, <a href="lesser%20galago">lesser galago</a>, <a href="bat-eared%20fox">bat-eared fox</a>, <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>, and others. Bats can estimate the elevation of their target using the <a href="interference%20pattern">interference pattern</a>s from the echoes reflecting from the <a href="tragus%20%28ear%29">tragus</a>, a flap of skin in the external ear.

By repeated scanning, bats can mentally construct an accurate image of the environment in which they are moving and of their prey. Some species of moth have exploited this, such as the <a href="Arctiidae">tiger moths</a>, which produces <a href="aposematic">aposematic</a> ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected and therefore distasteful. Moth species including the tiger moth can produce signals to <a href="Echolocation%20jamming">jam bat echolocation</a>. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a <a href="tympanal%20organ">tympanum</a>, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive manoeuvres.

The eyes of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor <a href="visual%20acuity">visual acuity</a>, but no species is blind. Most microbats have <a href="mesopic%20vision">mesopic vision</a>, meaning that they can only detect light in low levels, whereas other mammals have <a href="photopic%20vision">photopic vision</a>, which allows colour vision. Microbats may use their vision for orientation and while travelling between their roosting grounds and feeding grounds, as echolocation is only effective over short distances. Some species can detect <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV). As the bodies of some microbats have distinct coloration, they may be able to discriminate colours.

Megabat species often have eyesight as good as, if not better than, human vision. Their eyesight is adapted to both night and daylight vision, including some colour vision.

Microbats make use of <a href="magnetoreception">magnetoreception</a>, in that they have a high sensitivity to the <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">Earth's magnetic field</a>, as birds do. Microbats use a polarity-based compass, meaning that they differentiate north from south, unlike birds, which use the strength of the magnetic field to differentiate <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s, which may be used in long-distance travel. The mechanism is unknown but may involve <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> particles.

Most bats are <a href="homeothermic">homeothermic</a> (having a stable body temperature), the exception being the vesper bats (Vespertilionidae), the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), the free-tailed bats (Molossidae), and the bent-winged bats (Miniopteridae), which extensively use <a href="heterothermy">heterothermy</a> (where body temperature can vary). Compared to other mammals, bats have a high <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a>. The wings are filled with blood vessels, and lose body heat when extended. At rest, they may wrap their wings around themselves to trap a layer of warm air. Smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bats, and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermy.

Bats may avoid flying during the day to prevent overheating in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats may not be able to dissipate heat if the ambient temperature is too high; they use saliva to cool themselves in extreme conditions. Among megabats, the flying fox "<a href="Pteropus%20hypomelanus">Pteropus hypomelanus</a>" uses saliva and wing-fanning to cool itself while roosting during the hottest part of the day. Among microbats, the <a href="Yuma%20myotis">Yuma myotis</a> ("Myotis yumanensis"), the Mexican free-tailed bat and the <a href="pallid%20bat">pallid bat</a> ("Antrozous pallidus") cope with temperatures up to 45 Celsius by panting, salivating and licking their fur to promote evaporative cooling; this is sufficient to dissipate twice their metabolic heat production.

Bats also possess a system of <a href="sphincter">sphincter</a> valves on the arterial side of the vascular network that runs along the edge of their wings. When fully open, these allow oxygenated blood to flow through the <a href="capillary">capillary</a> network across the wing membrane; when contracted, they <a href="shunt%20%28medical%29">shunt</a> flow directly to the veins, bypassing the wing capillaries. This allows bats to control how much heat is exchanged through the flight membrane, allowing them to release heat during flight. Many other mammals use the capillary network in oversized ears for the same purpose.

<a href="Torpor">Torpor</a>, a state of decreased activity where the body temperature and <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> decreases, is especially useful for microbats, as they use a large amount of energy while active, depend upon an unreliable food source, and have a limited ability to store fat. They generally drop their body temperature in this state to , and may reduce their energy expenditure by 50 to 99%. Around 97% of all microbats use torpor. Tropical bats may use it to avoid predation, by reducing the amount of time spent on foraging and thus reducing the chance of being caught by a predator. Megabats were generally believed to be homeothermic, but three species of small megabats, with a mass of about , have been known to use torpor: the <a href="common%20blossom%20bat">common blossom bat</a> ("Syconycteris australis"), the <a href="long-tongued%20nectar%20bat">long-tongued nectar bat</a> ("Macroglossus minimus"), and the <a href="eastern%20tube-nosed%20bat">eastern tube-nosed bat</a> ("Nyctimene robinsoni"). Torpid states last longer in the summer for megabats than in the winter.

During <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>, bats enter a torpid state and decrease their body temperature for 99.6% of their hibernation period; even during periods of arousal, when they return their body temperature to normal, they sometimes enter a shallow torpid state, known as "heterothermic arousal". Some bats <a href="aestivation">become dormant during higher temperatures</a> to keep cool in the summer months.

Heterothermic bats during long migrations may fly at night and go into a torpid state roosting in the daytime. Unlike migratory birds, which fly during the day and feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between travelling and eating. The energy saved reduces their need to feed, and also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. In some species, pregnant individuals may not use torpor.

The smallest bat is <a href="Kitti%27s%20hog-nosed%20bat">Kitti's hog-nosed bat</a> ("Craseonycteris thonglongyai"), which is long with a wingspan and weighs . It is also arguably the smallest <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> species of mammal, next to the <a href="Etruscan%20shrew">Etruscan shrew</a>. The largest bats are a few species of "<a href="Pteropus">Pteropus</a>" megabats and the <a href="giant%20golden-crowned%20flying%20fox">giant golden-crowned flying fox</a>, ("Acerodon jubatus"), which can weigh with a wingspan of . Larger bats tend to use lower frequencies and smaller bats higher for echolocation; high-frequency echolocation is better at detecting smaller prey. Small prey may be absent in the diets of large bats as they are unable to detect them. The adaptations of a particular bat species can directly influence what kinds of prey are available to it.

Flight has enabled bats to become one of the most widely distributed groups of mammals. Apart from the high Arctic, the Antarctic and a few isolated oceanic islands, bats exist in almost every habitat on Earth. Tropical areas tend to have more species than temperate ones. Different species select different habitats during different seasons, ranging from seasides to mountains and deserts, but they require suitable roosts. Bat roosts can be found in hollows, crevices, foliage, and even human-made structures, and include "tents" the bats construct with leaves. Megabats generally roost in trees. Most microbats are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> and megabats are typically <a href="Diurnal%20cycle">diurnal</a> or <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>.

In temperate areas, some microbats <a href="Animal%20migration">migrate</a> hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens; others pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for as much as six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain; it interferes with their echolocation, and they are unable to hunt.

Different bat species have different diets, including insects, nectar, pollen, fruit and even vertebrates. Megabats are mostly fruit, nectar and pollen eaters. Due to their small size, high-metabolism and rapid burning of energy through flight, bats must consume large amounts of food for their size. Insectivorous bats may eat over 120 percent of their body weight, while frugivorous bats may eat over twice their weight. They can travel significant distances each night, exceptionally as much as in the spotted bat ("<a href="Euderma%20maculatum">Euderma maculatum</a>"), in search of food. Bats use a variety of hunting strategies. Bats get most of their water from the food they eat; many species also drink from water sources like lakes and streams, flying over the surface and dipping their tongues into the water.

The Chiroptera as a whole are in the process of losing the ability to synthesise <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>. In a test of 34 bat species from six major families, including major insect- and fruit-eating bat families, all were found to have lost the ability to synthesise it, and this loss may derive from a common bat ancestor, as a single mutation. At least two species of bat, the frugivorous bat ("Rousettus leschenaultii") and the insectivorous bat ("Hipposideros armiger"), have retained their ability to produce vitamin C.

Most microbats, especially in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span many species, including <a href="flies">flies</a>, <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>s, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, moths, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>s, <a href="termite">termite</a>s, <a href="bee">bee</a>s, <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s, <a href="mayflies">mayflies</a> and <a href="caddisflies">caddisflies</a>. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats ("Tadarida brasiliensis") fly hundreds of metres above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the <a href="little%20brown%20bat">little brown bat</a> ("Myotis lucifugus"), may catch an insect in mid-air with the mouth, and eat it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost and eat it there. Slower moving bat species such as the <a href="brown%20long-eared%20bat">brown long-eared bat</a> ("Plecotus auritus") and many horseshoe bat species, may take or <a href="Bat%20flight%23Gleaning">glean</a> insects from vegetation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.

Fruit eating, or frugivory, is found in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, pulling it off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and spitting the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and many species of plants depend on bats for <a href="seed%20dispersal">seed dispersal</a>. The <a href="Jamaican%20fruit%20bat">Jamaican fruit bat</a> ("Artibeus jamaicensis") has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14 g (0.11–0.49 oz) or even as much as 50 g (1.8 oz).

Nectar-eating bats have acquired specialised adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible <a href="tongue">tongue</a>s covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The <a href="tube-lipped%20nectar%20bat">tube-lipped nectar bat</a> ("Anoura fistulata") has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial to them in terms of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach deep into the long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. Because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than other types of bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s, as pollen gets attached to their fur while they are feeding. Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Many rainforest plants depend on bat pollination.

Some bats prey on other vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, birds and mammals. The <a href="fringe-lipped%20bat">fringe-lipped bat</a> ("Trachops cirrhosus,") for example, is skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate large groups of frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them from the surface of the water with their sharp canine teeth. The <a href="greater%20noctule%20bat">greater noctule bat</a> can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat ("<a href="Noctilio%20leporinus">Noctilio leporinus</a>") hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the <a href="spectral%20bat">spectral bat</a> ("Vampyrum spectrum"), and the <a href="ghost%20bat">ghost bat</a> ("Macroderma gigas").

A few species, specifically the common, <a href="white-winged%20vampire%20bat">white-winged</a>, and <a href="Hairy-legged%20vampire%20bat">hairy-legged</a> vampire bats, only feed on animal blood (<a href="hematophagy">hematophagy</a>). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as <a href="cattle">cattle</a>; the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors in the nose help them to detect blood vessels near the surface of the skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> in the saliva.

Bats are subject to predation from <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, such as <a href="owls">owls</a>, <a href="hawks">hawks</a>, and <a href="falcons">falcons</a>, and at roosts from terrestrial predators able to climb, such as cats. Twenty species of tropical New World <a href="snake">snake</a>s are known to capture bats, often waiting at the entrances of refuges, such as caves, for bats to fly past. J. Rydell and J. R. Speakman argue that bats evolved nocturnality during the early and middle <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> period to avoid predators. The evidence is thought by some zoologists to be equivocal so far.

Among <a href="ectoparasite">ectoparasite</a>s, bats carry <a href="flea">flea</a>s and <a href="mite">mite</a>s, as well as specific parasites such as <a href="bat%20bug">bat bug</a>s and bat flies (<a href="Nycteribiidae">Nycteribiidae</a> and <a href="Streblidae">Streblidae</a>). Bats are among the few non-aquatic mammalian orders that do not host <a href="lice">lice</a>, possibly due to competition from more specialised parasites that occupy the same niche.

<a href="White%20nose%20syndrome">White nose syndrome</a> is a condition associated with the deaths of millions of bats in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">Eastern United States</a> and Canada. The disease is named after a white <a href="fungus">fungus</a>, "<a href="Pseudogymnoascus%20destructans">Pseudogymnoascus destructans</a>", found growing on the muzzles, ears, and wings of afflicted bats. The fungus is mostly spread from bat to bat, and causes the disease. The fungus was first discovered in central New York State in 2006 and spread quickly to the entire Eastern US north of Florida; mortality rates of 90–100% have been observed in most affected caves. <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and the <a href="mid-Atlantic%20states">mid-Atlantic states</a> have, since 2006, witnessed entire species completely extirpated and others with numbers that have gone from the hundreds of thousands, even millions, to a few hundred or less. Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick have witnessed identical die offs, with the Canadian government making preparations to protect all remaining bat populations in its territory. Scientific evidence suggests that longer winters where the fungus has a longer period to infect bats result in greater mortality. In 2014, the infection crossed the Mississippi River, and in 2017, it was found on bats in Texas.

Bats are <a href="natural%20reservoir">natural reservoir</a>s for a large number of <a href="zoonosis">zoonotic</a> <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s, including <a href="Rabies%20in%20animals%23Bats">rabies</a>, endemic in many bat populations, <a href="histoplasmosis">histoplasmosis</a> both directly and in guano, <a href="Henipavirus">Nipah and Hendra viruses</a>, and possibly the <a href="ebola%20virus">ebola virus</a>. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial <a href="sympatry">sympatry</a> (range overlap) of species, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more <a href="zoonotic">zoonotic</a> viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to their immune systems. Their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission. Bats are implicated in the emergence of <a href="severe%20acute%20respiratory%20syndrome">severe acute respiratory syndrome</a> (SARS) in China, since they serve as natural hosts for <a href="Coronavirus">Coronavirus</a>es, several from a single cave in <a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a>, one of which developed into the SARS virus.

Some bats lead solitary lives, while others live in colonies of more than a million. Living in large colonies lessens the risk to an individual of predation. Temperate bat species may <a href="Swarm%20behaviour">swarm</a> at hibernation sites as autumn approaches. This may serve to introduce young to hibernation sites, signal reproduction in adults and allow adults to breed with those from other groups.

Several species have a <a href="fission%E2%80%93fusion%20society">fission-fusion social structure</a>, where large numbers of bats congregate in one roosting area, along with breaking up and mixing of subgroups. Within these societies, bats are able to maintain long term relationships. Some of these relationships consist of <a href="matrilineal">matrilineal</a>ly related females and their dependent offspring. Food sharing and mutual grooming may occur in certain species, such as the common vampire bat ("Desmodus rotundus"), and these strengthen social bonds.

Bats are among the most vocal of mammals and produce calls to attract mates, find roost partners and defend resources. These calls are typically low-frequency and can travel long distances. Mexican free-tailed bats are one of the few species to "sing" like birds. Males sing to attract females. Songs have three phrases: chirps, trills and buzzes, the former having "A" and "B" syllables. Bat songs are highly stereotypical but with variation in syllable number, phrase order, and phrase repetitions between individuals. Among <a href="greater%20spear-nosed%20bat">greater spear-nosed bat</a>s ("Phyllostomus hastatus"), females produce loud, broadband calls among their roost mates to form group cohesion. Calls differ between roosting groups and may arise from vocal learning.

In a study on captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the directed calls could be identified by the researchers as to which individual bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched in close proximity to each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individual bats, especially those of the opposite sex. In the highly <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a> <a href="hammer-headed%20bat">hammer-headed bat</a> ("Hypsignathus monstrosus"), males produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signals for traffic control. Greater bulldog bats honk when on a collision course with each other.

Bats also communicate by other means. Male <a href="little%20yellow-shouldered%20bat">little yellow-shouldered bat</a>s ("Sturnira lilium") have shoulder glands that produce a spicy odour during the breeding season. Like many other species, they have hair specialised for retaining and dispersing secretions. Such hair forms a conspicuous collar around the necks of the some Old World megabat males. Male <a href="greater%20sac-winged%20bat">greater sac-winged bat</a>s ("Saccopteryx bilineata") have sacs in their wings in which they mix body secretions like saliva and urine to create a perfume that they sprinkle on roost sites, a behaviour known as "salting". Salting may be accompanied by singing.

Most bat species are <a href="Polygyny%20in%20animals">polygynous</a>, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males unable to claim a site are forced to live on the periphery where they have less reproductive success. <a href="Promiscuity">Promiscuity</a>, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. There appears to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> pairs. <a href="Lek%20mating">Lek mating</a>, where males aggregate and compete for female choice through display, is rare in bats but occurs in the hammerheaded bat.

For temperate living bats, mating takes place in late summer and early autumn. Tropical bats may mate during the dry season. After copulation, the male may leave behind a <a href="mating%20plug">mating plug</a> to block the sperm of other males and thus ensure his paternity. In hibernating species, males are known to mate with females in torpor. Female bats use a variety of strategies to control the timing of pregnancy and the birth of young, to make delivery coincide with maximum food ability and other ecological factors. Females of some species have delayed fertilisation, in which sperm is stored in the reproductive tract for several months after mating. Mating occurs in the autumn but fertilisation does not occur until the following spring. Other species exhibit <a href="delayed%20implantation">delayed implantation</a>, in which the egg is fertilised after mating, but remains free in the reproductive tract until external conditions become favourable for giving birth and caring for the offspring. In another strategy, fertilisation and implantation both occur, but development of the foetus is delayed until good conditions prevail. During the delayed development the mother keeps the fertilised egg alive with nutrients. This process can go on for a long period, because of the advanced gas exchange system.

For temperate living bats, births typically take place in May or June in the northern hemisphere; births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth at the beginning of the rainy season. In most bat species, females carry and give birth to a single pup per litter. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and the pelvic girdle of the female can expand during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a head-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the female cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in <a href="Maternity%20colony%20%28bats%29">maternity colonies</a> and may assist each other in birthing.

Most of the care for a young bat comes from the mother. In monogamous species, the father plays a role. Allo-suckling, where a female suckles another mother's young, occurs in several species. This may serve to increase colony size in species where females return to their natal colony to breed. A young bat's ability to fly coincides with the development of an adult body and forelimb length. For the little brown bat, this occurs about eighteen days after birth. Weaning of young for most species takes place in under eighty days. The common vampire bat nurses its offspring beyond that and young vampire bats achieve independence later in life than other species. This is probably due to the species' blood-based diet, which is difficult to obtain on a nightly basis.

The maximum lifespan of bats is three-and-a-half times longer than other mammals of similar size. Six species have been recorded to live over 30 years in the wild: the brown long-eared bat ("Plecotus auritus"), the little brown bat "(Myotis lucifugus)", <a href="Brandt%27s%20bat">Brandt's bat</a> ("Myotis brandti"), the <a href="lesser%20mouse-eared%20bat">lesser mouse-eared bat</a> ("Myotis blythii") the <a href="greater%20horseshoe%20bat">greater horseshoe bat</a> ("Rhinolophus ferrumequinum"), and the <a href="Indian%20flying%20fox">Indian flying fox</a> ("Pteropus giganteus"). One hypothesis consistent with the <a href="rate-of-living%20theory">rate-of-living theory</a> links this to the fact that they slow down their <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a> while <a href="hibernating">hibernating</a>; bats that hibernate, on average, have a longer lifespan than bats that do not. Another hypothesis is that flying has reduced their mortality rate, which would also be true for birds and gliding mammals. Bat species that give birth to multiple pups generally have a shorter lifespan than species that give birth to only a single pup. Cave-roosting species may have a longer lifespan than non-roosting species because of the decreased predation in caves. A male Brandt's bat was recaptured in the wild after 41 years, making it the oldest known bat.

Groups such as the <a href="Bat%20Conservation%20International">Bat Conservation International</a> aim to increase awareness of bats' ecological roles and the environmental threats they face. In the United Kingdom, all bats are protected under the <a href="Wildlife%20and%20Countryside%20Act">Wildlife and Countryside Act</a>s, and disturbing a bat or its roost can be punished with a heavy fine.
In <a href="Sarawak">Sarawak</a>, Malaysia, "all bats" are protected under the <a href="Malaysian%20Wildlife%20Law">Wildlife Protection Ordinance 1998</a>, but species such as the <a href="hairless%20bat">hairless bat</a> ("Cheiromeles torquatus)" are still eaten by the local communities. Humans have caused the extinction of several species of bat in modern history, the most recent being the <a href="Christmas%20Island%20pipistrelle">Christmas Island pipistrelle</a> ("Pipistrellus murrayi"), which was declared extinct in 2009.

Many people put up bat houses to attract bats. The 1991 <a href="University%20of%20Florida">University of Florida</a> bat house is the largest occupied artificial roost in the world, with around 400,000 residents. In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground <a href="British%20hardened%20field%20defences%20of%20World%20War%20II">World War II pillboxes</a> have been converted to make roosts for bats, and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments. <a href="Cave%20gate">Cave gate</a>s are sometimes installed to limit human entry into caves with sensitive or endangered bat species. The gates are designed not to limit the airflow, and thus to maintain the cave's micro-ecosystem.

<a href="Bat%20as%20food">Bats are eaten</a> in countries across Asia and the Pacific Rim. In some cases, such as in Guam, flying foxes have become endangered through being hunted for food. There is evidence that <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a>s create sufficient <a href="barotrauma">barotrauma</a> (pressure damage) to kill bats. Bats have typical <a href="Lung%23Mammalian%20lungs">mammalian lungs</a>, which are thought to be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than <a href="Avian%20lungs">the lungs of birds</a>, making them more liable to fatal rupture. Bats may be attracted to turbines, perhaps seeking roosts, increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.

Since bats are mammals, yet can fly, they are considered to be <a href="liminal%20being">liminal being</a>s in various traditions. In many cultures, including in Europe, bats are associated with darkness, death, witchcraft, and malevolence. Among <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> such as the <a href="Creek%20%28people%29">Creek</a>, <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> and <a href="Apache%20Tribe">Apache</a>, the bat is a <a href="trickster">trickster</a> spirit. In Tanzania, a winged batlike creature known as <a href="Popobawa">Popobawa</a> is believed to be a shapeshifting <a href="evil%20spirit">evil spirit</a> that assaults and <a href="sodomises">sodomises</a> its victims. In <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a> <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, bats symbolised the land of the dead, destruction, and decay. An East Nigerian tale tells that the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat, and now hides by day to avoid arrest.

More positive depictions of bats exist in some cultures. In China, bats have been associated with happiness, joy and good fortune. Five bats are used to symbolise the "Five Blessings": longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue and peaceful death. The bat is sacred in <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a> and is often considered the physical manifestation of a separable <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a>. In the <a href="Zapotec%20civilisation">Zapotec civilisation</a> of Mesoamerica, the bat god presided over corn and fertility.

The <a href="Weird%20Sisters">Weird Sisters</a> in Shakespeare's "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>" used the fur of a bat in their brew. In <a href="Western%20culture">Western culture</a>, the bat is often a symbol of the night and its foreboding nature. The bat is a primary animal associated with fictional characters of the night, both <a href="villain">villain</a>ous <a href="vampire">vampire</a>s, such as <a href="Count%20Dracula">Count Dracula</a> and before him "<a href="Varney%20the%20Vampire">Varney the Vampire</a>", and <a href="hero">hero</a>es, such as <a href="Batman">Batman</a>. <a href="Kenneth%20Oppel">Kenneth Oppel</a>'s <a href="Silverwing%20%28series%29">Silverwing novels</a> narrate the adventures of a young bat, based on the <a href="silver-haired%20bat">silver-haired bat</a> of North America.

The bat is sometimes used as a <a href="Bat%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic symbol</a> in Spain and France, appearing in the coats of arms of the towns of <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, <a href="Palma%20de%20Mallorca">Palma de Mallorca</a>, <a href="Fraga">Fraga</a>, <a href="Albacete">Albacete</a>, and <a href="Montchauvet%2C%20Yvelines">Montchauvet</a>. Three US states have an official <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20bats">state bat</a>. Texas and Oklahoma are represented by the Mexican free-tailed bat, while Virginia is represented by the <a href="Virginia%20big-eared%20bat">Virginia big-eared bat</a> ("Corynorhinus townsendii virginianus").

Insectivorous bats in particular are especially helpful to farmers, as they control populations of agricultural pests and reduce the need to use <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s. It has been estimated that bats save the agricultural industry of the United States anywhere from <a href="USD">$</a>3.7 billion to $53 billion per year in pesticides and damage to crops. This also prevents the overuse of pesticides, which can pollute the surrounding environment, and may lead to resistance in future generations of insects.

Bat dung, a type of <a href="guano">guano</a>, is rich in nitrates and is mined from caves for use as <a href="fertiliser">fertiliser</a>. During the <a href="US%20Civil%20War">US Civil War</a>, <a href="saltpetre">saltpetre</a> was collected from caves to make <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a>; it used to be thought that this was bat guano, but most of the nitrate comes from <a href="nitrifying%20bacteria">nitrifying bacteria</a>.

The <a href="Ann%20W.%20Richards%20Congress%20Avenue%20Bridge">Congress Avenue Bridge</a> in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, is the summer home to North America's largest urban bat colony, an estimated 1,500,000 Mexican free-tailed bats. About 100,000 tourists a year visit the bridge at twilight to watch the bats leave the roost.

On the Mindless Menace of Violence

On the Mindless Menace of Violence is a speech given by <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> and presidential candidate <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a>. He delivered it in front of the <a href="City%20Club%20of%20Cleveland">City Club of Cleveland</a> at the <a href="Renaissance%20Cleveland%20Hotel">Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel</a> on April 5, 1968, the day after the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">assassination of</a> <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> With the speech, Kennedy sought to counter the <a href="King%20assassination%20riots">King-related riots</a> and disorder emerging in various cities, and address the growing problem of violence in American society.

On April 4, King, a prominent African-American civil rights leader, was assassinated. <a href="Ethnic%20conflict">Race riots</a> subsequently broke out across the United States. After delivering <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%27s%20speech%20on%20the%20assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">an improvised speech</a> on the matter in Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a single engagement before the City Club of Cleveland. Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 to craft a response to the assassination. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft en route to Cleveland. Speaking for only ten minutes, Kennedy outlined his view on violence in American society before a crowd of 2,200. He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, were responsible for the deterioration of social conditions in the United States. He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but urged the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with other Americans.

Kennedy's speech received much less attention than his famous remarks in Indianapolis and was largely forgotten by the news media and scholars. However, several of his aides considered it to be among his finest orations. Journalist <a href="Jack%20Newfield">Jack Newfield</a> was of the opinion that the address was a suitable epitaph for the senator, who was <a href="Assassination%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">assassinated</a> two months later.

On April 4, 1968, African-American civil rights leader <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> was <a href="assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">assassinated</a> by a sniper in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. United States Senator <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> was traveling to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> to promote <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201968">his presidential campaign</a> when he heard the news. He delivered a brief, <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%27s%20speech%20on%20the%20assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">improvised speech</a> on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the <a href="Marott%20Hotel">Marott Hotel</a>. After several phone conversations with <a href="African-American">African-American</a> community leaders, he decided to speak out against the <a href="King%20assassination%20riots">violent backlash</a> to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the <a href="City%20Club%20of%20Cleveland">City Club of Cleveland</a>. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with <a href="Coretta%20Scott%20King">Coretta Scott King</a>, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide <a href="Frank%20Mankiewicz">Frank Mankiewicz</a> to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28civil%20rights%20leader%29">John Lewis</a> and <a href="Earl%20G.%20Graves%20Sr.">Earl Graves</a>, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of incoming calls while his staff established a <a href="Call%20centre">phone bank</a> at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.

That night at the Marott Hotel, Kennedy hosted a meeting with 14 local black leaders. The meeting had been arranged before the assassination by aide James Tolan and took place in Tolan's room. The group had debated among themselves as to whether they should hold the meeting. Kennedy eventually arrived, and the conversation quickly became heated as leaders accused him of being an unreliable member of "the white establishment." He lost his temper, saying, "I don't need all this aggravation. I could sit next to my swimming pool. You know, God's been good to me and I really don't need anything. But I just feel that if He's been that good, I should try to put something back in. And you all call yourselves leaders and you've been moaning and groaning about personal problems. You haven't once talked about your own people." The meeting ended with most attendees pledging their support to Kennedy's campaign. One of them later acknowledged that Kennedy was "completely sympathetic and understanding".
Kennedy then restlessly wandered around the hotel, checking in on his staff. When asked if King's murder had reminded him of the 1963 <a href="assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination of John F. Kennedy</a>, his brother, Kennedy replied, "Well, that. But it makes me wonder what they might do to me too." He told speechwriter <a href="Jeff%20Greenfield">Jeff Greenfield</a>, "You know, the death of Martin Luther King isn't the worse thing that ever happened in the world." Greenfield later said, "I could not for the life of me understand that callousness until, of course, I realized he had been thinking of the death of his brother."

Meanwhile, in their room, Greenfield and fellow speechwriter <a href="Adam%20Walinsky">Adam Walinsky</a> worked on a formal response to the King assassination with assistance over the phone from <a href="Ted%20Sorenson">Ted Sorenson</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Sorenson's memory differed in that he recalled receiving a call from Kennedy at his home in Washington D.C, rather than New York, on the night of April 4. Kennedy asked for Sorenson's thoughts on a speech being prepared for his appearance in Cleveland and said he would call back within the hour. Sorenson, mindful of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, quickly began writing notes on scrap pieces of paper. When Kennedy called back, Sorenson dictated what he had produced and the senator transcribed it. Mankiewicz later recalled being "occasionally" involved in the drafting process.

At about 02:30 on April 5, Kennedy discovered Walinsky asleep over his typewriter and Greenfield passed out on his bed. Kennedy pulled a blanket over Greenfield, who awoke and said, "You aren't so ruthless after all." Kennedy responded, "Don't tell anyone." Later in the morning, Walinsky and Greenfield inserted Sorenson's contributions and finished the speech (mostly the work of Walinsky).

Meanwhile, Kennedy sat down for an interview with entertainer <a href="Jack%20Paar">Jack Paar</a>. The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, "Do you think that is going to be my biggest problem?" When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by "compassion for one's fellow human beings." Paar then asked, "What did you think when you heard that Dr. King had been assassinated?" Kennedy answered, "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country."

During the flight to Cleveland Kennedy reviewed and considerably revised his speech. The plane arrived 90 minutes late. A planned motorcade from <a href="Hopkins%20International%20Airport">Hopkins International Airport</a> was canceled out of respect for King. Instead, the senator rode into the city in an open white convertible. An aide from a <a href="car%20phone">phone-equipped vehicle</a> waved down his car and informed him that police believed a sniper might be hiding in a church steeple across from the hotel where he was to give the speech. Bill Barry, Kennedy's bodyguard, recommended that the senator wait alongside the road while he would drive ahead to investigate. Kennedy angrily dismissed the suggestion, saying, "No. We'll never stop for that kind of threat." Kennedy passed through a crowd of approximately 10,000 people in <a href="Public%20Square%2C%20Cleveland">Public Square</a> that had gathered for a memorial service for King. He had been scheduled to speak there as well but canceled the event.

Kennedy's appearance had been anticipated; in the week leading up to the address, the City Club sold over 1,400 tickets for people wishing to attend the <a href="luncheon">luncheon</a> event at the <a href="Renaissance%20Cleveland%20Hotel">Sheraton-Cleveland Hotel</a>. Local channels <a href="WKYC">WKYC-TV 3</a> and <a href="WEWS-TV">WEWS-TV 5</a> interrupted their coverage of the King assassination to televise Kennedy's speech. It was delivered before approximately 2,200 members of the City Club of Cleveland (most rich and white) and lasted only for 10 minutes. Kennedy spoke quietly and solemnly, incorporating <a href="tragedy">tragic themes</a>.

Kennedy opens by dismissing his own political position and ambition as a presidential candidate and emphasizing the situation at hand, saying,

This statement sets the tone of the speech. The senator then develops a notion of "violence" using strong, emotional language. He notes that violence afflicted all Americans, regardless of race. He proceeds to allude to King's death and to highlight the meaninglessness of violence, asking,

By saying this, Kennedy is admonishing people not to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions to that of the civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, he portrays the American public as a people increasingly succumbing to its violent tendencies that undermine its <a href="American%20Dream">national ideals</a>. He argues that all deaths degrade American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence are unacceptable.

Kennedy describes how the United States was becoming increasingly tolerant of violence, from the acceptance of news reports on the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, to the frequency of killing in movies and television shows, to insufficient <a href="gun%20control">gun control</a>. He also criticizes double standards on foreign and domestic policy, arguing that some Americans support <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a> abroad but not within the United States while others who denounce riots are responsible for the conditions that had led to them. The statement leads into his next comment, observing that some Americans "look for scapegoats, others look for conspiracies." He then criticizes government and private establishment:

Even in the 1960s, such words were radical and potentially controversial. Kennedy proceeds to caution that when society tries to "teach" people to hate one another or that an individual is a "lesser man" (alluding to racially prejudiced rhetoric common of other public figures), the likelihood of cooperation decreases while the possibility for violent confrontation increases.

Kennedy lists no specific programs or proposals to address the problems at hand, as he believed there was no single solution that would bring an end to violence. Still, the senator asserts that if nothing were done, violence in the United States would persist. He voices his hope that it could be stopped if people work together to bring about change. As Kennedy approaches the end of his speech, his words become more forceful and hopeful. He finishes with an allusion to Lincoln's <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20second%20inaugural%20address">second inaugural address</a>:

Several women were reportedly in tears by the time Kennedy finished. Breaking with the tradition of other City Club speakers, he took no questions. The audience gave him a standing ovation. While "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>", Cleveland's major daily newspaper, praised the speech as "timeless" and devoted a significant amount of coverage to it, Kennedy's remarks received relatively little national media attention.

After the speech Kennedy took a chartered plane to Washington D.C. As it approached the city, the passengers could see smoke rising from fires started during the riots. Kennedy asked the pilot to circle again to get another view. Upon landing, Kennedy proposed driving into the riot zone to calm down the mobs, saying, "I think I can do something with these people." Most of his aides were shocked at the idea. <a href="Fred%20Dutton">Fred Dutton</a>, attempting to delay, suggested that Kennedy inform Mayor <a href="Walter%20Washington">Walter Washington</a> of his plans as a courtesy. <a href="John%20Bartlow%20Martin">John Bartlow Martin</a> told him that little could be done while people were still rioting, and that he would appear to be <a href="grandstanding">grandstanding</a>. Kennedy then reluctantly went home.
Two days later Kennedy and his wife, <a href="Ethel%20Skakel">Ethel</a>, attended an 8 a.m. <a href="Palm%20Sunday">Palm Sunday</a> service at New Bethel Baptist Church in the riot zone. <a href="Stokely%20Carmichael">Stokely Carmichael</a>, widely blamed for inciting local disorder, was among the others in the congregation. Kennedy, a devout Catholic, took <a href="Eucharist">communion</a> with the rest of the parishioners, much to the chagrin of the Bishop of Washington. After the service he asked the minister, <a href="Walter%20E.%20Fauntroy">Walter E. Fauntroy</a>, how bad the destruction was in the surrounding area. Fauntroy then walked Kennedy towards the worst devastation on <a href="14th%20Street%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">14th street</a>. Ethel, aide <a href="Peter%20Edelman">Peter Edelman</a>, <a href="Marian%20Wright%20Edelman">Marian Wright Edelman</a> (wife of Peter Edelman), and a small group of reporters, local officials, and parishioners closely followed. People joined the crowd as it walked, becoming so large that a group of <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guardsmen</a> mistook it for a mob of looters. Fearing a confrontation, they put on their gas masks and fixed their bayonets. A trailing police car quickly accelerated and parked itself in between the crowd and the guardsmen to prevent any incident from occurring. Fauntroy remembered, "When [the guardsmen] saw it was Bobby Kennedy, they took off their masks and let us through. They looked awfully relieved."

That evening Kennedy held a televised press conference on the possibility of a domestic <a href="Peace%20Corps">Peace Corps</a>-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8, Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how to get the attention of middle-class whites weary of the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a> in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 delivered his third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation. He reiterated the same arguments he delivered in Cleveland about America's internal faults through the rest of his campaign. 

"On the Mindless Menace of Violence" has been greatly overshadowed by Kennedy's Indianapolis remarks and largely ignored by scholars, but it is still considered by some to be historically significant. Journalist <a href="Jack%20Newfield">Jack Newfield</a> said the speech was "probably the best written text of the campaign, and perhaps of Kennedy's public career." Another journalist, <a href="David%20Halberstam">David Halberstam</a>, considered it "perhaps the best speech of the campaign, perhaps the best speech of his life." Greenfield also later called the address "the best written speech of the campaign." Mankiewicz wrote that it was "perhaps the best speech Robert Kennedy made during the campaign, and certainly one of the best of his career" and "the most eloquent and memorable of RFK's view of humanity and the threats to its flowering and [...] survival." Journalist <a href="Jules%20Witcover">Jules Witcover</a> said that the "speech was, in a very real sense, a turning
point in the presidential campaign of Robert Kennedy," as it allowed him to find new themes around which to reorient his campaign. Following <a href="Assassination%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Kennedy's assassination</a> in June 1968, Representative <a href="Charles%20Vanik">Charles Vanik</a> of Ohio, in a speech before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, called the City Club address the late senator's "most significant statement [...] on crime and violence". In Newfield's opinion the speech was a suitable epitaph for Kennedy himself.

In 1999, Marian Wright Edelman delivered a speech in Colorado during which she quoted Kennedy's address. Shortly after the <a href="2015%20San%20Bernardino%20attack">2015 San Bernardino attack</a>, she gave a speech at the <a href="Children%27s%20Defense%20Fund">Children's Defense Fund</a>'s 25th annual Beat the Odds Awards ceremony deploring gun violence and citing Kennedy's words. President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> quoted the senator's remarks in an open letter to <a href="American%20law%20enforcement">American law enforcement</a> in the aftermath of the <a href="2016%20shooting%20of%20Dallas%20police%20officers">2016 shooting of Dallas police officers</a>. Journalist and former <a href="White%20House%20Press%20Secretary">White House Press Secretary</a> <a href="Bill%20Moyers">Bill Moyers</a> wrote about the speech after the Dallas shooting, saying, "Today, [Kennedy's] moving words are still so relevant". <a href="John%20M.%20Murphy">John M. Murphy</a> described the oration as an "American <a href="jeremiad">jeremiad</a>" and said that it "resembled a sermon more than a campaign address." According to "<a href="The%20Weekly%20Standard">The Weekly Standard</a>", "[I]t played a role in making the word "violence" synonymous with any lamentable social ill."

While many books and movies discuss Kennedy's Indianapolis speech at length, most entirely omit his Cleveland remarks or mention them only in passing. The most high-profile portrayal occurred in the 2006 film <a href="Bobby%20%282006%20film%29">"Bobby"</a>, when the speech was spoken at the end over both real and recreated footage of Kennedy's assassination in California. Robert F. Kennedy's daughter, <a href="Kerry%20Kennedy">Kerry</a>, later said, "I actually think that the speech that he gave in Cleveland would have always been viewed as the best speech he ever gave except for the speech he gave the day before." Following the <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20shooting">Virginia Tech shooting</a> in 2007, historian Zachary J. Martin wrote a book about the speech, "The Mindless Menace of Violence: Robert F. Kennedy's Vision and the Fierce Urgency of Now", which was published in 2009. A 2015 <a href="short%20film">short film</a> entitled "The Mindless Menace of Violence" depicted gun violence in various American neighborhoods between a diverse array of people with portions of audio of the speech overlaying the video. The City Club of Cleveland hosted an event on April 5, 2018 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the delivery of the address.

Michigan State Trunkline Highway System

The State Trunkline Highway System consists of all the <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a>s in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, including those designated as <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">United States Numbered</a> (US Highways), or State Trunkline highways. In their abbreviated format, these classifications are applied to highway numbers with an "I"-, "US", or "M"- prefix, respectively. The system is maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) and comprises of trunklines in all <a href="List%20of%20counties%20in%20Michigan">83 counties</a> of the state on both the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper</a> and <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower</a> peninsulas (UP, LP), which are linked by the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a>. Components of the system range in scale from 10-lane urban <a href="freeway">freeway</a>s with <a href="local-express%20lanes">local-express lanes</a> to two-lane rural <a href="undivided%20highway">undivided highway</a>s to a non-motorized highway on <a href="Mackinac%20Island">Mackinac Island</a> where cars are forbidden. The longest highway is nearly long, while the shortest is about three-quarters of a mile (about 1.2 km). Some roads are <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned highway</a>s, lacking signage to indicate their maintenance by MDOT; these may be remnants of highways that are still under state control whose designations were <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioned</a> or roadway segments left over from realignment projects.

Predecessors to today's modern highways include the foot trails used by <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> in the time before European settlement. Shortly after the creation of the <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a> in 1805, the new government established the first road districts. The federal government aided in the construction of roads to connect population centers in the territory. At the time, road construction was under the control of the <a href="civil%20township">township</a> and <a href="county%20%28United%20States%29">county</a> governments. The state government was briefly involved in roads until prohibited by a new constitution in 1850. Private companies constructed <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a>s and charged <a href="toll%20road">tolls</a>. Local township roads were financed and constructed through a statute labor system that required landowners to make improvements in lieu of taxes. Countywide coordination of road planning, construction and maintenance was enacted in the late 19th century.

In the early 20th century, the constitutional prohibition on state involvement in roads was removed. The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) was created in 1905, and the department paid counties and townships to improve roads to state standards. On May 13, 1913, the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act was passed, creating the State Trunkline Highway System. The MSHD assigned internal highway numbers to roads in the system, and in 1919, the numbers were signposted along the roads and marked on maps. The US Highway System was created in 1926, and highways in Michigan were renumbered to account for the new designations. Legislation in the 1930s consolidated control of the state trunklines in the state highway department. During the 1940s, the first freeways were built in Michigan. With the introduction of the Interstate Highway system in the 1950s, the state aborted an effort to build the <a href="Michigan%20Turnpike">Michigan Turnpike</a>, a tolled freeway in the southeast corner of the LP. Construction on Michigan's Interstates started in the latter part of that decade and continued until 1992. During that period, several freeways were canceled in the 1960s and 1970s, while others were delayed or modified over environmental and political concerns. Since 1992, few additional freeways have been built, and in the early years of the 21st century, projects are underway to bypass cities with new highways.

The letter "M" in the state highway numbers is an integral part of the designation and included on the diamond-shaped <a href="reassurance%20marker">reassurance marker</a>s posted alongside the highways. The state's highways are referred to using an "M-n" syntax as opposed to "Route n" or "Highway n", which are common elsewhere. This usage dates from 1919, when Michigan's state trunklines were first signed along the roadways, and continues to this day in official and unofficial contexts. Michigan is one of only two states following this syntax, the other one being <a href="List%20of%20Kansas%20numbered%20highways">Kansas</a>.

Although "M-n" outside of Michigan could conceivably refer to other state, provincial, local, or national highways, local usage in those areas does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases. In countries like the United Kingdom, "M" refers to <a href="motorway">motorway</a>s, analogous to freeways in the United States, whereas "M"-numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state trunklines in general and may exist on any type of highway. "M"-numbered trunklines are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas. The system also includes <a href="M-185%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-185</a> on <a href="Mackinac%20Island">Mackinac Island</a>, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.
The highest numbers used for highway designations include <a href="M-553%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-553</a> in the UP and <a href="Interstate%20696">Interstate 696</a> (I-696) running along the northern Detroit suburbs. The lowest numbers in use are <a href="M-1%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-1</a> along Woodward Avenue in the Detroit area and <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20%28Michigan%29">US Highway 2</a> (US 2) across the UP. Most M-numbered trunkline designations are in the low 200s or under, but some have been designated in the low 300s. MDOT has not assigned a designation outside the Interstate System in the 400s at this time. No discernible pattern exists in Michigan's numbering system, although most of the "M"-numbered routes lower than 15 are typically located in or around the major cities of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>.

Unlike some other states, there are no formal rules prohibiting the usage of the same route number under different systems. Motorists using Michigan's highways may encounter I-75 and <a href="M-75%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-75</a>, as well as both <a href="U.S.%20Route%208">US 8</a> and <a href="M-8%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-8</a>. Many of the state's US Highways were assigned numbers duplicating those of state trunklines when the US Highway System was created in 1926. The introduction of the Interstate Highway System in the late 1950s further complicated the situation, as each mainline Interstate designation has an unrelated "M-n" trunkline counterpart elsewhere in the state.

Many former US Highways in Michigan have left an "M"-numbered highway with the same number as a relic of their existence. For example, <a href="M-27%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-27</a> runs along a portion of former <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a>. In addition, there are two occurrences of original "M"-numbered state routes which became US Highways with the same designations: all of M-16 became <a href="U.S.%20Route%2016%20in%20Michigan">US 16</a> and most of M-10 from Detroit to Saginaw was assumed into the route of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> in 1926. In fact, each iteration of M-10 has existed in whole or part along a former or future alignment of US 10.
There are also instances of "M"-numbered state highways that once existed as extensions of US Highways. <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> was originally an extension of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20in%20Michigan">US 25</a> before the latter was decommissioned in Michigan, and <a href="M-24%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-24</a> was once an extension of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> before routing changes separated the two highways. <a href="M-131%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-131</a> was an extension of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> until US 131 was routed onto the former M-131. There was also once an <a href="M-112%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-112</a> that served as an alternate routing for <a href="U.S.%20Route%20112">US 112</a> (both have since been changed to I-94 and US 12, respectively).

There are four types of highways maintained by MDOT as part of the overall State Trunkline Highway System. In addition, there are systems of roads maintained by the federal government and local counties. There are frequent overlaps between designations when different types of highways share the same stretch of pavement in <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrencies</a>. As just one example of the phenomenon, the freeway between Flint and Standish carries both the <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> designations for around .

The State Trunkline Highway System comprises four types of highways: Michigan's portions of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> (US Highways), and the regular state trunklines; the fourth type, <a href="special%20route">special route</a>s, are variations of the other three types of highway, and are distinguished by special plates placed above the route marker. The plates indicate the routes as business or connector routes. Business loops and spurs of the Interstate Highway System use a special green version of the standard Interstate marker which places the word "Business" at the top where "Interstate" would otherwise appears. These business loops and spurs connect downtown districts to main highways after realignments and bypasses have routed the main highway out of the downtown area. Another category, connector routes, serve to connect two highways as their names suggest; most of these connectors are unsigned. The highways names for special routes are formulated by prefacing the parent highway with the type of special route. The full names are commonly abbreviated like other highways: Business Loop Interstate 196 (BL I-196), Business M-60 (Bus. M-60) or Connector M-44 (Conn. M-44). there are of state trunklines in Michigan, making up about eight percent of the state's roadways. Of that mileage, some of state-maintained highways are included in the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, which are highways selected for their importance to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The state trunkline highways in Michigan carry approximately 51 percent of the state's traffic, .

The highways in the system range in length from the unsigned <a href="Interstate%20375%20Business%20%28Detroit%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Spur Interstate 375</a> (BS I-375) at and signed <a href="M-212%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-212</a> at to I-75 at . Some trunklines in Michigan are maintained by MDOT but bear no signage along the route to indicate so. These <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned trunklines</a> are mostly segments of former highway designations that have been moved or <a href="decommissioned%20highway">decommissioned</a>. They remain under state control until their respective city or county accepts jurisdiction of the roadway from the state.
Highways in the state maintained by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane <a href="freeway">freeway</a>s. In addition to the Interstates, other trunklines are built to freeway standards. Sections of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> have been upgraded to freeway standards. All or part of several state trunklines are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a>, <a href="M-8%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-8</a> (Davison Freeway), <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> (Lodge Freeway), <a href="M-14%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-14</a>, <a href="M-39%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-39</a> (Southfield Freeway), <a href="M-53%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-53</a> (Van Dyke Freeway), and <a href="M-59%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-59</a> have such sections. In the rest of the state, <a href="M-6%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-6</a> near <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="M-13%20Connector%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Conn.

, there are three sources of revenue that contribute to the Michigan Transportation Fund (MTF): fuel excise taxes, vehicle registration fees and federal aid. Michigan levies an excise tax of 18.7 cents per gallon on gasoline and 15 cents per gallon on diesel fuel to generate approximately $955 million in revenue per year. Vehicle registrations account for about $868 million while federal aid from federal fuel taxes accounts for the last third of funding in Michigan. Money from the MTF is distributed between MDOT, county road commissions, city or village street departments and local public transit agencies. For fiscal year 2013, MDOT has budgeted approximately $1.2 billion on the highway system, including $273.4 million in routine maintenance. The remainder financed major projects in terms of planning, right-of-way acquisition or construction. In terms of winter maintenance, MDOT classifies all state highways into two priority levels for snow removal, authorizing overtime to clear some highways in the state.

MDOT assigns the numbers for a parallel system of <a href="List%20of%20County-Designated%20Highways%20in%20Michigan">county-designated highways</a> in the state; the numbers are assigned in a grid system by the department. These highways, while signed from connecting trunklines and shown on the official MDOT map, are maintained by the various counties. They were started in 1970 as a supplement to the main trunkline system and carry a letter-number combination on the national standard pentagon-shaped marker in blue and yellow. The letter component of the name corresponds to a zone of the state; zones A–F are in the Lower Peninsula while G and H are in the Upper Peninsula. The numbers correspond to a numbered grid within each lettered zone. Other county systems are designated and maintained in each of the 83 counties, and signage and numbering practices vary. The state's 533 incorporated cities and villages also maintain their own street networks, but townships in the state have no jurisdiction over roads.

The <a href="U.S.%20Forest%20Service">U.S. Forest Service</a> and <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> designate <a href="Forest%20Route">Federal Forest Highways</a> providing access to the handful of National Forests in the state. In addition, Michigan participates in the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a> program, signing tours along the state-maintained highway closest to Michigan's <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> shorelines. The Michigan Heritage Route System was created in 1993 to highlight trunklines with historic, recreational or scenic qualities; the name was changed to <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> on December 30, 2014.

The history of the highway system in Michigan dates back to the old Native American trails that crossed the state. These trails were pathways no wider than approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails, including the <a href="Great%20Trail">Great Trail</a> from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> from <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> to <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>, Ohio. This trail connected with <a href="Braddock%27s%20Road">Braddock's Road</a> which led to the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Coast</a>.

The <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a> was established in 1805, and the territorial governor established the first road districts. The districts built <a href="farm-to-market%20road">farm-to-market road</a>s to serve the agricultural needs of the farming population of the area at the time; they connected farmers with markets in their local communities. The local streets in the individual communities were the responsibility of those communities. At the same time, Detroit created <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">rights-of-way</a> for the five great avenues in the city following a fire.

Outside of Detroit, the situation was quite different. Maps of the territory were printed with the words "interminable swamp" across the interior until 1839. Reports of the first explorers and government surveyors crossing the future state only seemed to confirm the assessment that Michigan land was unsuitable for agriculture or other productive activities. The few roads in the area were impassable for half of the year. The poor quality of the early roads meant that most transportation in the state was by way of the lakes and rivers at first. Commerce was limited to trade to and from Canada.

These roads proved inadequate to the needs of the military during the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Territorial Governor <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> lobbied the federal government for road construction funding to bolster defensive needs as well as aid in settlement of the territory. Military roads debuted in 1816 with the construction of the Detroit–Fort Meigs Road to Toledo as a response to transportation needs. More roads were built with Congressional appropriations in the 1820s and 1830s connecting Detroit to <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>, <a href="Saginaw%2C%20Michigan">Saginaw</a>, <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>.

Townships were given authority to construct roads under the supervision of county commissioners in 1817. This supervision was difficult since in one case, one county covered all of the Upper Peninsula and several of today's counties in the Lower Peninsula. Direct supervision over construction was granted to the townships in 1827, and federal involvement in road building ended with the 1837 grant of statehood.

The first <a href="Constitution%20of%20Michigan">state constitution</a> encouraged state involvement in <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> like roads. The <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a> devastated the new state's efforts, and the government defaulted on bond payments. Private construction companies built roads starting in 1844 to fill the void in long-distance road construction left by the departure of the federal government. The first roads were <a href="corduroy%20road">corduroy road</a>s; to build these, logs of all sizes were placed across the road. The gaps between the logs were filled in with smaller logs or earth. In swampy or marshy areas, brush was laid down first for drainage. In time, the logs would rot, leaving large gaps to the roadway that would catch wagon wheels or draft animal feet. Later, roads were built with oak planks. The <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> companies had to be chartered by the state after passage of legislation in 1848. According to the plank road law, these companies had to build their roads to a set of minimum specifications. These specifications included in total width, a road surface wide with at least made of planks. Later amendments to the law allowed the companies to substitute gravel for the planks. Starting with the enactment of a new state constitution in 1850, the state was prohibited from being "a part to, or interested in, any work of internal improvement"; this provision ended the state government's involvement in Michigan's roads.
The early plank roads were funded by tolls; these fares were collected at turnstiles every few miles along the roads, at rates of $0.02/mile for wagons pulled by two animals (equivalent to $ in ). As time passed, the planks would warp and rot. The tolls were insufficient to fund the maintenance necessary to keep the roads in good repair. Even <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> remarked, "The road could not have been bad if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it," after a trip to Grand Rapids. The planks were removed over time and replaced with gravel roads. The longest chartered road was a distance of from <a href="Zilwaukee%2C%20Michigan">Zilwaukee</a> to <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a> by way of <a href="Traverse%20City%2C%20Michigan">Traverse City</a>; the shortest was a mile (1.6 km) near <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>.

Townships continued to maintain and build local roads using the "statute labor system". An able-bodied man residing in a local road district was expected to pay his road taxes by performing 30 days of labor on the roads in his district. If he was unable to work off the tax, a rate of $0.625/day was assessed (equivalent to $ in ). This road maintenance was performed under the guidance of the township road overseer, a separate elected township official, according to the wishes of his constituents, often without any county-level planning or coordination. Often the "improved roads" were in worse condition than unimproved roads due to the amateur nature of the maintenance.

An early form of federal aid contributed to the road network in the state starting in the 1850s. Congress granted certain forest and swamp lands to the state in 1850. A stipulation on the grant stated that the proceeds from the lands would be used to reclaim them for use. The <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> established several roads to be built by contractors, paid with the proceeds from the sale of the land adjoining the roads, or with land itself. Despite these efforts, only of the of plank roads authorized by the state were ever built by 89 of the 202 chartered plank road companies.

The tax system was partially reformed in 1881, allowing for direct payment of road taxes instead of relying totally on the statute-labor system. The first road district larger than the township level was created in <a href="Bay%20County%2C%20Michigan">Bay County</a> in 1883 under Public Act 278. This road district encompassed eight townships and provided for better coordination and planning of road construction. Other county systems were created in 1893 with passage of legislation which allowed other counties to follow the lead of Bay County. By 1900, the plank roads were generally abandoned. While a few were still in good repair, most consisted of rotting logs with intermittent patches of gravel. Toll houses were empty shacks, and the ditches were clogged with duck ponds. Only 23 of the original 202 plank roads chartered by the state were still in operation.

The <a href="Good%20Roads%20Movement">Good Roads Movement</a>, borne out of the needs of the bicycle craze of the 1880s and 1890s, turned its attention towards the needs of automobiles at the turn of the century. <a href="Horatio%20Earle">Horatio S. "Good Roads" Earle</a>, a <a href="Michigan%20Senate">state senator</a> from Detroit was elected national president of the <a href="League%20of%20American%20Wheelmen">League of American Wheelmen</a> in 1901. Earle worked on a committee report that called for the removal of the prohibition on road improvements from the state constitution. That report also recommended the creation of a commission and system for state highways.

The first state road agency, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD), was created on July 1, 1905. At first the department administered rewards to the counties and townships for building roads to state minimum specifications. In 1905, there were of roads in Michigan. Of these roads, only were improved with gravel and were <a href="macadam">macadam</a>. The state's statute labor system was abolished in 1907. Instead, a property tax system was instituted with the funding only for permanent improvements, not maintenance. Rural farmers opposed the state's efforts, and even <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> was against the idea of reforming road construction and maintenance. In response to this opposition, the department's work was decentralized; standards for road improvement came from the state, but work was carried out by the townships and counties. The nation's first mile of <a href="concrete">concrete</a> roadway was laid along <a href="Woodward%20Avenue">Woodward Avenue</a> in 1909 between Six Mile and Seven Mile roads in Detroit; this section of street was wide and cost $14,000 (equivalent to $ in ).
Passage of the State Reward Trunk Line Highways Act on May 13, 1913, provided for of roadways in a state-financed system. The system comprised 10 "divisions", several of which had associated "branches", that ran along existing roads throughout the state. After the creation of the system, the Huron Shore Road Association scheduled a Road Bee Day on June 13, 1913; some 5,000 men, 200 women, 3,000 teams of horses and 750 automobiles participated in the effort that improved of roads in the state. Further legislation at the time allowed for special assessment taxing districts for road improvements, taxation of automobiles based on weight and horsepower, and tree-planting along highway roadsides. Congress passed the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Road%20Act%20of%201916">Federal Aid Road Act of 1916</a>, and the state passed a constitutional amendment in 1917 to qualify for federal aid with state funding matches.

The first centerline was painted on a state highway in 1917 along the Marquette–Negaunee Road which was designated Trunkline 15, now <a href="County%20Road%20492%20%28Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">County Road 492</a> in <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a>. Winter maintenance started during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> to keep of strategic highways clear; some $13,200 (equivalent to $ in ) was appropriated with partial funding from the <a href="War%20Loan%20Board">War Loan Board</a>.
In 1919, the legislature passed the Aldrich Act; combined with the approval of the Bond Issue Act during an election that April, the MSHD was authorized to assume responsibility over the roadways that composed the State Trunkline Highway System. The state highway commissioner was required to sign the state trunkline highways, and Michigan become the second state after Wisconsin to do so. Alan Williams, Ionia County engineer, helped to design the diamond marker used to sign the highways; he is also known for placing a picnic table alongside <a href="U.S.%20Route%2016%20in%20Michigan">US 16</a> (Grand River Avenue) in 1929 south of <a href="Saranac%2C%20Michigan">Saranac</a>, considered the first in the country. Other sources say that the first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> near <a href="Iron%20River%2C%20Michigan">Iron River</a> in 1919–20. The first crows nest traffic tower in the US was installed at the intersection of Woodward and Michigan avenues in Detroit on October 9, 1917. The tower elevated a police officer above the center of the intersection to direct traffic before it was replaced in October 1920 with the world's first four-way <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a>.

While Michigan was the second state to post route designations along its highway system in 1919, Michigan actually began assigning internal trunkline designations for internal inventory purposes as early as 1913. From 1918 to 1926, only the "M"-numbered highway designations existed on state highways throughout Michigan, while the creation of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">US Highway System</a> in 1926 caused several existing designations to be either reassigned or retired altogether. Public Act 131 of 1931 allowed the MSHD to take control over the city and village streets that carried state highways through cities and villages in the state. The 1932 McNitt Act consolidated all of the township-controlled roads into 83 county road commissions. On May 4, 1935, the state opened the first highway <a href="welcome%20center">welcome center</a> next to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> in <a href="New%20Buffalo%2C%20Michigan">New Buffalo</a> near the Indiana state line; Michigan was the first state in the country to do so at the time.

The state passed legislation in 1941 that authorized the creation of limited-access roadways; the MSHD could prohibit access to a state trunkline from the adjacent properties. Around the same time, single-digit highways like <a href="M-9%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-9</a> were renumbered to set aside those numbers for future freeways in the state. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Ecorse%20Road">Willow Run Expressway</a>, the <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">Detroit Industrial Expressway</a> and the <a href="M-8%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Davison Freeway</a> were built, ushering in the beginnings of the state's freeway system. These highway improvements were financed by the <a href="Defense%20Highway%20Act%20of%201941">Defense Highway Act of 1941</a> to aid in national defense. After the war, the MSHD and the Good Roads Federation studied the highway needs of the state. Their study reported that road maintenance and improvement deteriorated since the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20States">Great Depression</a>. It also stated that funding needed to be increased to deal with pressures from traffic increases after the war.

Public Act 51 of 1951 amended and clarified the current system of jurisdiction over roads in the state. The existing tri-level system was maintained, splitting road jurisdiction between the state, counties and cities, as well as subdividing each level into several classifications. Further legislation redefined the exact distribution, but Act 51 set up a system to distribute road funding from gas taxes from a single funding source, currently the Michigan Transportation Fund. Funding was increased during the 1950s as the fuel taxes were increased. Whereas those revenues during the war dropped to levels barely sufficient to keep existing highways in usable condition, they were increased during the following decade to deal with increasing traffic. The state highway department was also authorized to sell bonds to provide funding for the proposed road improvements.
The Michigan Turnpike Authority (MTA), an agency created in 1951, proposed the construction of a <a href="toll%20highway">toll freeway</a> to run north–south in the state. The original termini for the <a href="Michigan%20Turnpike">Michigan Turnpike</a> were <a href="Bridgeport%2C%20Michigan">Bridgeport</a> and <a href="Rockwood%2C%20Michigan">Rockwood</a>. The state highway commissioner at the time, <a href="Charles%20Ziegler">Charles Ziegler</a>, distrusted a separate agency dealing with statewide road building at the time and worked to stall progress on any proposed turnpikes. He also opposed the idea because the state had three freeways under planning or construction. Ziegler and the MSHD announced plans for a full freeway to run north through the Lower Peninsula and continue across to the Upper Peninsula. This announcement derailed the efforts to build the Michigan Turnpike. The Interstate Highway System was authorized by the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956</a>, and the state had already designed several freeways for its portion of that system. Seizing the opportunity brought by a 1957 state law, the department sold $700 million in bonds (equivalent to $ in ) in the late 1950s and early 1960s to finance land purchases and construction of the new freeways. The first Interstate Highway in the state was signposted in October 1959 when I-75 signs were first installed along the Detroit–Toledo Expressway. These signs replaced US 24A signage in the Monroe area, after the state received final approval for the numbering system to be used in the state. Michigan was the first state to complete a border-to-border <a href="Interstate%20Highway">Interstate Highway</a> in 1960 with the completion of I-94. The last gravel state highway was paved in the early 1960s as well; bids were let in March 1962 to finish paving <a href="M-48%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-48</a> in <a href="Chippewa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Chippewa County</a>.
The original goal of Michigan's freeways was to connect every city with a population of more than 50,000 people with a network of roads that would accommodate traffic at . Following the start of these highway improvements, the MSHD adopted a policy to allow traffic to use the state's trunklines every day of the year regardless of the weather. The state also invested in improving non-freeway roads in the highway system; better materials and construction methods were used to improve safety and traffic flow throughout the state.

The post-war years were also a period of major bridge building in the state. The <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> opened on November 1, 1957, the <a href="Portage%20Lake%20Lift%20Bridge">Portage Lake Lift Bridge</a>, the largest double-deck <a href="lift%20bridge">lift bridge</a> was completed in August 1959, and the <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20International%20Bridge">International Bridge</a> opened across the <a href="St.%20Marys%20River%20%28Michigan%E2%80%93Ontario%29">St. Marys River</a> three years later on October 31, 1962. The State Highway Department started erecting <a href="milepost">milepost</a>s along the Interstates in 1963, and later expanded the practice to other freeways and used the mileages to number the interchanges along I-94.

Freeway construction continued through the 1970s. On April 6, 1972, the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US 12 to one adjacent to I-94. Later that year, the state switched paint colors for its centerlines; yellow was used for the lines separating directions of travel and white for lines separating lanes traveling in the same direction. Also in 1972, a gas tax increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor <a href="William%20G.%20Milliken">William G. Milliken</a>, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based <a href="exit%20number">exit number</a>s along the remaining Interstates in Michigan. By late 1977, the state highway department shifted its focus from construction of new highways to improvements of the existing system.

During the 1960s and 1970s, various freeway projects in the Detroit area were cancelled or scaled back in scope. The route of I-96 along Grand River Avenue was cancelled in response to <a href="freeway%20revolts">freeway revolts</a> in the city, and a new routing along the <a href="C%26amp%3BO%20Railroad">C&O Railroad</a> right-of-way in <a href="Livonia%2C%20Michigan">Livonia</a> was used instead. Plans to transfer the Davison Freeway in the 1970s to state control and extend it west to I-96 (Jeffries Freeway) and east to a Van Dyke Freeway (extended <a href="M-53%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-53</a>) were dropped. Another freeway project near Lansing, the Van Atta Connector, was proposed in 1961 to provide an eastern freeway beltway around East Lansing, but by 1981 the highway's impact to neighboring elementary schools along with larger economic impacts led to the project's cancellation.
The Michigan Highway Commission canceled the northern section of <a href="Interstate%20275%20%28Michigan%29">I-275</a> on January 26, 1977, after it spent $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway. This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time, bearing the designation M-275 instead. Opposition to construction came from various citizen's groups, different levels of local government, and both "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" and "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>". The Detroit City Council, led by then-Chairman <a href="Carl%20Levin">Carl Levin</a>, opposed the plan as well. Levin said at the time, "At last I think people are waking up to the dangers of more and more expressways. At some point we've got to say enough. And I think we've reached it." The United States Department of the Interior reviewed the state's environmental impact study of the project and stated the project "will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands, wetlands, surface waters and wildlife habitat." The total project to link <a href="Farmington%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Farmington Hills</a> with <a href="Davisburg%2C%20Michigan">Davisburg</a> with the freeway would have cost $69.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) and saved drivers an estimated eight minutes off travel time around the city of Detroit. Other freeway projects cancelled during the 1970s included an extension of the <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> freeway northward to Petoskey, an extension of the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> freeway from <a href="Standish%2C%20Michigan">Standish</a> to <a href="Alpena%2C%20Michigan">Alpena</a>, and a freeway running across the southern Lower Peninsula toward Chicago. These ventures, along with the I-275 extension, were dropped over concerns related to rising construction costs, the environment and the <a href="Arab%20Oil%20Embargo">Arab Oil Embargo</a>. Even with these cancelled highways, several proposals were left to be completed.

At the end of the 1970s, MDOT took part in a FHWA-backed initiative called the Positive Guidance Demonstration Project, and the two agencies audited signage practices in the vicinity of the I-96/M-37 and <a href="Interstate%20296">I-296</a>/US 131 interchange in <a href="Walker%2C%20Michigan">Walker</a> near Grand Rapids. MDOT determined that usage of the I-296 designation was "a potential source of confusion for motorists." FHWA agreed with the department's proposal to eliminate all signage and public map references to the designation in April 1979. MDOT then received permission from the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> (AASHTO) on October 13, and from the FHWA on December 3, 1979, on the condition that MDOT would continue to use the designation on official documents. The approval explicitly retained the highway in the Interstate system for funding and other purposes. The last state map to show the I-296 designation was published in 1979, as the 1980 map lacks any reference to the designation.

Following this program, the Reflective Systems Unit at MDOT reviewed the state of two- and three-way concurrencies along the highway system in Michigan. They approached the department's Trunkline Numbering Committee and the district traffic and safety engineers on October 19, 1982, for proposals to reduce or eliminate the various overlapping designations to "avoid driver confusion and save funds". When the unit released its final recommendations on March 17, 1983, the memo recommended 19 changes to eliminate various concurrent routings, including the truncation of US 2 to <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>, changes to the routing of US 10, and the removal of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2033%20in%20Michigan">US 33</a> from the state. These changes were implemented October 1983, 1985, and 1986, respectively. Other changes recommended at the time, like the truncation of <a href="M-54%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-54</a> to remove it from the <a href="wrong-way%20concurrency">wrong-way concurrency</a> with <a href="M-83%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-83</a> near <a href="Birch%20Run%2C%20Michigan">Birch Run</a>, has never been implemented.

The final section of the controversial <a href="Interstate%20696">I-696</a> opened at a cost of $436 million (equivalent to $ in ) on December 15, 1989; the freeway's central segment was delayed over concerns related to its routing through Detroit's northern suburbs. The Interstate Highway network in Michigan was completed in 1992 with the last of <a href="Interstate%2069%20in%20Michigan">I-69</a> near the <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> area. Since the completion of these freeways, a handful of major projects have added to the trunkline system and the end of the 20th and the start of the 21st centuries. A bypass of <a href="St.%20Johns%2C%20Michigan">St. Johns</a> along <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a> (now <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a>) opened on August 31, 1998. <a href="M-6%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-6</a>, a southern freeway bypass of Grand Rapids first proposed in the 1960s, was built between 1997 and 2004; that freeway was controversial based on the choice of a <a href="Minority%20business%20enterprise">minority-owned subcontractor</a> and route location. Bypasses of <a href="Cadillac%2C%20Michigan">Cadillac</a> and <a href="Manton%2C%20Michigan">Manton</a> opened in 2001 and 2003, extending the <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> freeway northward. The final segment of the <a href="M-5%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-5</a> Haggerty Connector opened to traffic on November 1, 2002. Another venture was the construction of a new bridge over the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> in <a href="Ottawa%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ottawa County</a> for a highway designated <a href="M-231%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-231</a>; that highway opened in October 2015.

There are several future highway projects current in stages of planning or construction. One is looking at improvements to US 131 in <a href="St.%20Joseph%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph County</a>, which includes the bypass of <a href="Constantine%2C%20Michigan">Constantine</a> that opened in October 2013. MDOT continues to purchase parcels for <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> to be used for future upgrades of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20127%20in%20Michigan">US 127</a> along the <a href="limited-access%20highway">expressway</a> section between <a href="Ithaca%2C%20Michigan">Ithaca</a> and <a href="St.%20Johns%2C%20Michigan">St. Johns</a>.

One project currently on hold would complete the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20Valley%20Parkway">St. Joseph Valley Parkway</a>, a section of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a> in <a href="Berrien%20County%2C%20Michigan">Berrien County</a>. The original plan for the freeway would have routed US 31 to connect directly into the I-196/US 31 interchange on I-94. Concerns over the habitat of the <a href="Mitchell%27s%20satyr">Mitchell's satyr</a> butterfly meant this routing would need to be redesigned with a set of bridges to cross the habitat unobtrusively in the Blue Creek Fen. In 2001, MDOT began a study of a new design alternative to route the US 31 freeway to connect with I-94 at the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Benton%20Harbor-St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-94</a> interchange just south of the I-196/US 31 interchange. In the interim, MDOT built a freeway segment north to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003, at a cost of $97 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The United States Congress legislated a highway proposal in 1991 known as <a href="Interstate%2073%20in%20Michigan">I-73</a>. Originally set to run along I-75 to Detroit, the definition was amended in 1995 to include a branch that would run along <a href="U.S.%20Route%20223">US 223</a> and US 127 to <a href="Grayling%2C%20Michigan">Grayling</a>, then on a continuation along I-75 to <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. MDOT examined three options to build the freeway, but abandoned further study after June 12, 2001, diverting remaining funds to improvement of safety along the corridor. The department stated there was a "lack of need" for sections of the proposed freeway, and the project's website was taken offline in 2002. According to 2011 press reports, a group advocating on behalf of the freeway is working to revive the I-73 proposal in Michigan, but state and local governments continue to express disinterest in resurrecting the freeway.

Tytan (band)

Tytan is a British rock band that lasted about two years during the early 1980s by former Angel Witch bassist Kev Riddles. The album "Rough Justice" was released after their split. They formed out of the <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">new wave of British heavy metal</a> movement and are best known for their strong melodies. The band reformed in 2012 to play Keep It True in Germany and have been touring since. In 2016 the band recorded a follow-up album "Justice Served" with Chris Tsangarides for High Roller Records. It was released in May 2017.

Tytan was a <a href="British%20people">British</a> <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> band formed at the height of the <a href="new%20wave%20of%20British%20heavy%20metal">new wave of British heavy metal</a> in the autumn of 1981 by the former <a href="Angel%20Witch">Angel Witch</a> rhythm section, bassist Kevin Riddles and drummer <a href="Dave%20Dufort">Dave Dufort</a> (ex-<a href="E.%20F.%20Band">E. F. Band</a>), Scottish vocalist Norman 'Kal' Swan, and guitarists Steve Gibbs. Stuart Adams left and Gary Owens (ex-<a href="A%20II%20Z">A II Z</a>, Aurora) had a brief stay before <a href="Steve%20Mann%20%28guitarist%29">Steve Mann</a> (ex-Liar, <a href="Lionheart%20%28UK%20band%29">Lionheart</a>) joined.

Signed to Kamaflage Records, a subsidiary of DJM, Tytan recorded their lone album at Ramport Studios in Battersea with Will Reid-Dick manning the boards. Former <a href="Judas%20Priest">Judas Priest</a> and <a href="Lionheart%20%28UK%20band%29">Lionheart</a> drummer Les Binks joined the band just in time for the recording in place of Dave Dufort. Jody Turner of <a href="Rock%20Goddess">Rock Goddess</a> made a guest vocal appearance on the song 'Women On The Frontline.' Binks would be replaced by Tony Boden on the band's October 1982 UK tour with the <a href="Tygers%20Of%20Pan%20Tang">Tygers Of Pan Tang</a> who was gone shortly thereafter, replaced by <a href="Simon%20Wright%20%28musician%29">Simon Wright</a> (ex-Tora Tora, A II Z, Aurora).

Kamaflage folded before the album was released but managed to release the single 'Blind Men and Fools' in both 7" and 12" formats in September 1982 before the band split up the following summer. Wright would join <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> and subsequently work with <a href="Dio%20%28band%29">Dio</a>, <a href="Rhino%20Bucket">Rhino Bucket</a>, and <a href="UFO%20%28band%29">UFO</a>. Vocalist Kal Swan moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California, where he formed the band <a href="Lion%20%28band%29">Lion</a> with former <a href="Lone%20Star%20%28band%29">Lone Star</a> guitarist Tony Smith whose replacement was future <a href="Dio%20%28band%29">Dio</a> and <a href="Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a> axeman <a href="Doug%20Aldrich">Doug Aldrich</a>. Swan and Aldrich went on to record a further 3 albums in the 1990s under the name <a href="Bad%20Moon%20Rising%20%28band%29">Bad Moon Rising</a>. <a href="Steve%20Mann%20%28guitarist%29">Steve Mann</a> returned to <a href="Lionheart%20%28UK%20band%29">Lionheart</a> and recorded the 1984 "Hot Tonight" album with the band before joining the <a href="McAuley%20Schenker%20Group">McAuley Schenker Group</a>, <a href="The%20Sweet">Sweet</a>, and German prog rock institution <a href="Eloy%20%28band%29">Eloy</a>.

In 1985, London-based label Metal Masters released the shelved Tytan tapes as the "Rough Justice" LP. A Japanese CD bootleg followed in the early 1990s, before Majestic Rock Records gave the album an official CD re-issue in 2004 and again in 2006, with 4 BBC 'Friday Rock Show' session live tracks ('Cold Bitch', 'The Watcher', 'Far Side of Destiny' & 'Blind Men and Fools') and a live DVD added as bonus on the second edition.

In 2012, an invitation to perform at Keep It True XV Festival in Germany, saw Tytan reform with a revised line-up. Joining original bandmembers Kevin Riddles, Steve Gibbs and Steve Mann were vocalist Tom Barna (from the band Diamond Faith), Andrew Thompson on keyboards, and Angel Witch drummer Andrew Prestidge.
Steve Gibbs left the band in early 2014. Drummer's Chris Benton and then Mikey Ciancio joined during 2012 and 2013 and in 2015-17 saw James Wise take over the role, followed by current drummer Seth Markes. Meanwhile, Dave Strange (Midnight Messiah) joined the band in Nov 2014 when Steve Mann departed. 

Tom Barna's replacement, Tony Coldham, performed his last show with the band on 13th October 2018, as he decided to concentrate on his other outfit, 'The Deep.' 

In December 2018, the band recruited vocalist Grant Foster (ex Black Bone Fever) and are looking to record a new, third album in 2019.

Buildings of Nuffield College, Oxford

The buildings of Nuffield College, one of the <a href="Colleges%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Oxford">colleges</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, are to the west of the city centre of <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, England, and stand on the site of the basin of the <a href="Oxford%20Canal">Oxford Canal</a>. <a href="Nuffield%20College%2C%20Oxford">Nuffield College</a> was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University by the car manufacturer <a href="William%20Morris%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nuffield">Lord Nuffield</a>; he gave land for the college, as well as £900,000 (approximately £246 million in present-day terms) to build and endow it. The architect <a href="Austen%20Harrison">Austen Harrison</a>, who had worked in Greece and Palestine, was appointed by the University to design the buildings. His initial design, heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture, was rejected by Nuffield, who called it "un-English" and refused to allow his name to be associated with it. Harrison reworked the plans, aiming for "something on the lines of <a href="Cotswold%20architecture">Cotswold domestic architecture</a>", as Nuffield wanted.

Construction of the second design began in 1949 and was finished in 1960. Progress was hampered by post-war building restrictions, and the effects of inflation on Nuffield's donation led to various cost-saving changes to the plans. In one change, the tower, which had been planned to be ornamental, was redesigned to hold the college's library. It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about tall, including the <a href="fl%C3%A8che">flèche</a> on top. The buildings are arranged around two <a href="quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">quadrangle</a>s, with residential accommodation for students and <a href="Oxbridge%20Fellow">fellows</a> in one, and the hall, library and administrative offices in the other. The chapel has <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows designed by <a href="John%20Piper%20%28artist%29">John Piper</a>.

The architectural historian <a href="Howard%20Colvin">Sir Howard Colvin</a> said that Harrison's first design was Oxford's "most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s"; it has also been described as a "missed opportunity" to show that Oxford did not live "only in the past". Reaction to the architecture of the college has been largely unfavourable. In the 1960s, it was described as "Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction". The tower has been described as "ungainly", and marred by repetitive windows. The travel writer <a href="Jan%20Morris">Jan Morris</a> wrote that the college was "a hodge-podge from the start". However, the architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Sir Nikolaus Pevsner</a>, although unimpressed with most of the college, thought that the tower helped the Oxford skyline and predicted it would "one day be loved". The writer <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> doubted Pevsner's prediction, and claimed that "vegetation" was the "best hope" for the tower – as well as the rest of the college.

The history of <a href="Nuffield%20College%2C%20Oxford">Nuffield College</a> dates from 16 November 1937, when the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">university</a> entered a Deed of Covenant and Trust with <a href="William%20Morris%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nuffield">Lord Nuffield</a>. Nuffield, known as William Morris before he was raised to the peerage, was an industrialist and the founder of <a href="Morris%20Motors">Morris Motors</a>, which was based in <a href="Cowley%2C%20Oxford">Cowley</a>, east Oxford. For the creation of Nuffield College and for his other donations (which included funding a chair of Spanish studies and donating £2 million in 1936 for a school of medical research), he was described in 1949 by an editorial in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as "the greatest benefactor of the University since the Middle Ages". He donated land on New Road, to the west of the city centre near the mound of <a href="Oxford%20Castle">Oxford Castle</a>, on the site of the largely disused basin of the <a href="Oxford%20Canal">Oxford Canal</a>. In 1937, "The Times" described the half-mile between the <a href="Oxford%20railway%20station">railway station</a> and the city (an area including the site of the proposed college) as "something between a refuse heap and a slum"; Nuffield had originally bought the canal basin to beautify that part of the city before he had the idea of building a college to accomplish this. As well as the land, Nuffield gave £900,000 to build the college and to provide it with an endowment fund.

His plan was to create a college that specialised in engineering and business methods to provide a link between academia and industry, for which he initially offered the University £1 million; £100,000 was used for a physical chemistry laboratory (completed in 1941), of which he approved. However, although he was persuaded to put the remainder towards a college for social science studies instead, he still felt "cheated". He later described the college as "that bloody Kremlin", "where left-wingers study at my expense". He was sufficiently pleased with the work of the college to leave it most of his remaining fortune (which was more than £3 million) when he died in 1963, although most of the bequest did not reach the college as it was needed to pay <a href="inheritance%20tax">inheritance tax</a> on Nuffield's estate.

Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (<a href="William%20Beveridge">Sir William Beveridge</a> from <a href="University%20College%2C%20Oxford">University College</a>; <a href="Alfred%20Brotherston%20Emden">Alfred Emden</a> from <a href="St%20Edmund%20Hall%2C%20Oxford">St Edmund Hall</a>; and <a href="Linda%20Grier">Linda Grier</a> from <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Hall%2C%20Oxford">Lady Margaret Hall</a>), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including <a href="Louis%20de%20Soissons">Louis de Soissons</a>, <a href="Vincent%20Harris">Vincent Harris</a>, <a href="Austen%20Harrison">Austen Harrison</a>, <a href="Charles%20Holden">Charles Holden</a>, <a href="Edward%20Maufe">Edward Maufe</a>, and <a href="Hubert%20Worthington">Hubert Worthington</a>. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine. Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later <a href="University%20of%20Ghana">University of Ghana</a>. Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the "general idea" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a "beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs.

After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the main site, aligned east to west, with a tower at the west end; the upper <a href="quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">quadrangle</a>, to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle, again aligned east to west, with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle. The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street. The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 – he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.
Harrison's design had "little that was English, still less that was recognisably Oxonian", said the architectural historian <a href="Howard%20Colvin">Sir Howard Colvin</a>. There were no pitched roofs, battlements, or pinnacles. Instead, the proposed building had "a strongly Mediterranean character", inspired by medieval buildings in that region. White <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> was the chosen building material; there were to be "stark" external walls and flat roofs, and a large semi-circular doorway at the main entrance, with facetted <a href="voussoir">voussoir</a>s demonstrating the influence of the <a href="Muslim%20architecture">Muslim architecture</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily%23Norman%20kingdom">Norman Sicily</a>. The tower, which was to have an internal dome and an external <a href="polygon">polygon</a>al design, showed (in Colvin's view) influences of <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> and parts of southern France. In the hall, there were to be <a href="aisle">aisle</a>s on the north and south sides of the main body of the hall, as in a <a href="basilica">basilica</a>, with the arches and columns of the aisles designed in a Greek <a href="Doric%20order">Doric style</a>. The hall and its grand staircase, said Colvin, would have rivalled those of Christ Church. Although Harrison had not finished plans for the <a href="common%20room%20%28university%29">common room</a>s, the initial sketches had oriental touches, including fireplaces reminiscent of the <a href="Topkap%C4%B1%20Palace">Topkapı Palace</a> in Istanbul. The Warden's Lodging would have been "one of the most handsome and commodious of its kind". However, Colvin thought that the chapel design was better suited to Mediterranean sunlight than Oxford gloom.

Colvin said that the "relationship between the principal buildings" was "elegantly worked out" and, "in a university of self-contained spaces", a design using two intersecting axes – one from the entrance to the hall and tower, the other from the chapel to the lodging – "represented an innovation in planning that was highly effective". Colvin's view was that the failure to construct the college according to this "impressive" design led to it being Oxford's "most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s". Had it been built, he said, it "would have taken its place among the major architectural monuments of Oxford".

Nuffield was dismayed by the model of Harrison's plans, as the buildings were not in the general Oxford collegiate style that he was known to favour. After a meeting with the University's Vice-Chancellor, <a href="A.%20D.%20Lindsay">A. D. Lindsay</a>, Nuffield wrote to him on 15 August 1939 to say that he felt "obliged to adhere to my adverse judgement of the plans". The design was "un-English and out of keeping with the best tradition of Oxford architecture", said Nuffield, adding that "if a building of this type were to be erected, I would not allow my name to be associated therewith".

Harrison protested that the so-called Oxford architectural tradition was a vague concept and also an accident of history: there was no uniform style uniting the buildings of the university and colleges, but instead different designs had been used, with varying modifications, over many centuries. Only a compromise would suit "a 20th century donor with an industrial background who sighs for romance, a committee of economists who are after results [and] the governing committee of a University steeped in its tradition". Nevertheless, Harrison agreed to attempt to satisfy Nuffield's desire for "something on the lines of <a href="Cotswolds">Cotswold</a> domestic architecture", and produced a second design. The amount of accommodation provided was reduced. The main entrance was moved from the west to the south of the college, under the chapel; it was to have an arcaded vestibule, allowing the quadrangle to be seen from the street, as Nuffield wanted. The flat roofs were replaced with pitched roofs with <a href="gable">gable</a> ends and <a href="dormer%20window">dormer window</a>s. The staircase leading to the hall was removed, and the hall repositioned on ground level, without aisles but with a <a href="hammerbeam%20roof">hammerbeam roof</a> of oak trusses. The tower, which would now contain the common room, was moved from the area of the former hall staircase to the east end of the chapel. When the plans were shown to Nuffield in early 1940, the only change that he requested before giving his approval was for a "more conventional" tower to replace the spire on Harrison's design.

The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on <a href="Banbury%20Road">Banbury Road</a> and <a href="Woodstock%20Road%20%28Oxford%29">Woodstock Road</a>. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper <a href="fl%C3%A8che">flèche</a>, or small spire.

A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the <a href="Nuffield%20Foundation">Nuffield Foundation</a> upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the <a href="Oxbridge%20Fellow">fellows</a> of the college used the upper floor as a <a href="Senior%20Common%20Room">Senior Common Room</a>. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by <a href="royal%20charter">royal charter</a> in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the <a href="Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Duke of Edinburgh</a> on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.

Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan, the college as finally built contained none of the elements that had given Harrison's first design "interest and distinction". The remaining "vestiges" of the first plan, he said, were the two main axes within the college, although "no longer focussed on major architectural incidents", and the masonry around the main doors, cut to resemble the buildings of medieval Italy rather than those of Tudor England.

The college presents a symmetrical front to New Road and the castle mound, with four small gables between a larger gable at either end. There are two <a href="quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">quadrangle</a>s, with steps leading down from the upper quadrangle (to the east) to the lower quadrangle (to the west). Residential accommodation for students and fellows is located in the lower quadrangle, whilst the hall, library, and administrative offices are in the upper quadrangle. The buildings are two storeys high, with <a href="dormer">dormer</a>s above. There are pools in the centre of the quadrangles (the one in the lower quadrangle is the longer of the two); the writer <a href="Simon%20Jenkins">Simon Jenkins</a> said that these are "almost puddles", and saw them as relics of Harrison's Mediterranean plan. The writer Peter Sager, however, thought that the pond represents the canal basin that previously occupied the site. The main entrance leads into the upper quadrangle, which has the hall on its east side. The square-<a href="mullion">mullion</a>ed windows facing the quadrangles are arranged in close-set groups of three; at the east end of the upper quadrangle, the common room has a larger bay window. An abstract sculpture by <a href="Hubert%20Dalwood">Hubert Dalwood</a>, from 1962, has been positioned on the lawn inside the college. Dalwood also designed the fountain in the pool in the upper quadrangle, although his plan for a spray of water was not implemented, "leaving the sculpture with no obvious purpose".
The hall has a floor of black and white marble and arches made of concrete supporting an oak roof with red panels. The furniture in the hall was designed by, and the chairs were built by, <a href="Edward%20Barnsley">Edward Barnsley</a>. Lord Nuffield's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> are displayed over the fireplace, carved from a single piece of stone, and his portrait, painted by <a href="Arthur%20Stockdale%20Cope">Sir Arthur Cope</a>, hangs in the hall. The chapel, on the south side of the college, can seat forty people. It has five abstract <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows that were designed by <a href="John%20Piper%20%28artist%29">John Piper</a> and executed by <a href="Patrick%20Reyntiens">Patrick Reyntiens</a>, and a metal <a href="reredos">reredos</a> with a bronze crucifix. The roofs are finished with <a href="Collyweston%20stone%20slate">Collyweston stone slate</a>s from <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>. Many other Oxford colleges are roofed with <a href="Taynton%20Limestone%20Formation">Stonesfield stone slate</a> from a quarry northwest of Oxford, but these were no longer available when Nuffield was built. The main building stone used is <a href="Clipsham">Clipsham</a> stone. The tower, which has nine floors, is about tall, with the flèche taking the total height to about . It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years. Work was carried out in the library in 1999 to extend the total shelf-length to just under . The library contains paintings of "Spring" and "Winter" by <a href="Derrick%20Greaves">Derrick Greaves</a> and "Summer" and "Autumn" by <a href="Edward%20Middleditch">Edward Middleditch</a>.

The architectural writer Geoffrey Tyack has written that Nuffield College was Oxford's "most important architectural project of the immediate post-war years". Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied, although most have been unfavourable. The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford said that it was "Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction". The Cotswold style was "taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched", and did not "harmonise with the clumsy tower", whilst the spire "[perched] uneasily ... despite its elaborate base". An unnamed journalist wrote in "The Times" in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were "somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles". The same writer said that the tower rose "Manhattan-wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century, only to have a diminutive spire, escaped from the fifteenth, push through its top to steal the last laugh". Peter Sager, too, thought that the "high-rise library" could "easily stand on the Hudson". Sir Howard Colvin said that the "utilitarian function" of the tower "accorded ill with its original ornamental purpose", and that the architects had "failed to find a satisfactory solution" to the "repetitive uniformity of fenestration". Of the flèche, Colvin said that it "makes its contribution to the Oxford skyline without any overt reference to historical precedent". Geoffrey Tyack also disliked the tower, describing it as "an ungainly structure" that was "lit by a monotonous array of windows punched out of the wall surface"; however, he thought the hall was "an effective reinterpretation of the traditional collegiate pattern".

The architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Sir Nikolaus Pevsner</a> compared the college unfavourably to the designs of the Danish architect <a href="Arne%20Jacobsen">Arne Jacobsen</a> for <a href="St%20Catherine%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St Catherine's College, Oxford</a>, construction of which began in 1960 (the year that Nuffield College was completed): St Catherine's, in his view, was "the most perfect piece of architecture of 20th-century Oxford" and made Nuffield "look even more absurd". Nevertheless, he "proposed forgiveness" for the "mighty tower", which "positively helps the famous skyline of Oxford", adding that it has "enough identity to be sure that one day it will find affection". He said that the tower had something of the architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Edwin Lutyens</a>' "felicitous manipulation of period details into a non-period whole and will, I prophesy, one day be loved", although he was less sure that this fate awaited the rest of the buildings. Simon Jenkins said of Pevsner's prophecy about the tower, "I doubt it"; he described it as "at best ungainly", with a "weak spire", and said that "vegetation was its best hope, as for the rest of Nuffield". The college, in his view "required a sense of humour".
Writing in 1952, after the first section of the buildings was complete, <a href="J.%20M.%20Richards">J. M. Richards</a>, the editor of the "<a href="Architectural%20Review">Architectural Review</a>", said that Nuffield was "a large-scale example of period-style architecture which has no justification whatever on grounds of consideration for the neighbours and represents missed opportunity of a really tragic kind". As the site was away from the "ancient colleges" of the city centre and in an area of "undistinguished nineteenth century commercial building", there had been a "rare opportunity" of building something "belonging ... to the twentieth century, and of showing that Oxford does not live only in the past". He said that the "compromise between contemporary needs and what is imagined to be the English collegiate tradition is quite unworthy of the educational enterprise the new foundation represents". He was, however, "thankful" that the building used smooth-faced stone "in the proper Oxford style" rather than rubble facing, which he said had been used elsewhere in Oxford "with extraordinarily unpleasing results".

The architectural correspondent of "The Times" wrote that the architecture of the college was incongruous – it was "remarkable" that a college with connections to modern industry should be looking backwards in this way. "That a college devoted to modern scientific studies should be dressed up [in the style of an antique Cotswold manor house] has already been the subject of puzzled comment by many foreign visitors to Oxford." Writing in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", <a href="Patience%20Gray">Patience Gray</a> also disliked the college's design, referring to the "Cotswold dementia" of the architecture, and the college's "pokey windows and grotesque sugarloaf tower." The chapel was described by the travel writer <a href="Jan%20Morris">Jan Morris</a> as "one of the sweetest little sanctuaries in Oxford"; "very simple, almost stern" with a contrast between the black and white pews and the "rich colour" of the stained glass. However, she said that whilst Oxford colleges change in style over time as buildings are added or altered, "Nuffield was a hodge-podge from the start, with a faintly Levantine tower upon a Cotswold Gothic base".
The writer Miles Jebb considered the contrast between the hall's black and white floor and red-panelled roof to be "most effective". He thought that the enclosed layout of the college was "a principal attraction", but wrote that the tower's "palpably utilitarian function detracts from its aesthetic attraction", even though it made the "emphatic addition" to the skyline of Oxford that Nuffield wanted. A. R. Woolley, author of an <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> guide to the city and university, was more positive. He described the tower as "an exciting breakaway from the conventional", with its spire as a "secular contribution to the sky-line". He said that the buildings "make a picturesque group of gabled Cotswold roofs", adding that "[t]heir design is simple and depends for its effects upon its just proportions. It is at once traditional and original."

In 1993, the college became a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, a designation given to buildings of national importance and special interest. The kerbstones around the pool in the west quadrangle have been given separate Grade II listing, as an "integral part of the Nuffield College scheme".

Monetary values are inflated to contemporary values using changes in the British <a href="Gross%20Domestic%20Product">Gross Domestic Product</a> (GDP). This measures the social cost of construction or investment as a proportion of the economy's total output of goods and services, showing the equivalent social impact in current terms: how much contemporary Britons would need to forgo in order to invest a similar amount of the current British economy. As of January 2017, the latest year for which contemporary figures are available is 2015.

Interactions (The Spectacular Spider-Man)

"Interactions" is the second episode of the <a href="animated%20cartoon">animated</a> <a href="television%20series">television series</a> "<a href="The%20Spectacular%20Spider-Man%20%28TV%20series%29">The Spectacular Spider-Man</a>," based on the <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> character <a href="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> created by <a href="Stan%20Lee">Stan Lee</a> and <a href="Steve%20Ditko">Steve Ditko</a>. The episode sees Spider-Man confronting the <a href="supervillain">supervillain</a> <a href="Electro%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29">Electro</a>, whose body was corrupted with electricity after a freak lab accident.

Directed by Troy Adomitis, "Interactions" was written by Kevin Hopps, who researched all the available comic books he had that featured Electro. The character's appearance in the episode draws on his traditional comic book style, though designer <a href="Victor%20Cook">Victor Cook</a> emphasized the color green and removed the character's customary star-shaped mask. His voice actor, <a href="Crispin%20Freeman">Crispin Freeman</a>, sought to reflect the character's declining sanity in his vocal style.

"Interactions" first aired March 8, 2008, on the <a href="Kids%27%20WB">Kids' WB</a> block of <a href="The%20CW">The CW</a> network, following the first episode. Its 1.4/4 <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen rating</a> was higher than that of the pilot, "<a href="Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest%20%28The%20Spectacular%20Spider-Man%29">Survival of the Fittest</a>". The episode received mixed reviews; <a href="IGN">IGN</a> commented that "<nowiki>[w]</nowiki>hile not as strong as the pilot, the episode had some notable moments".

The episode opens in <a href="Lizard%20%28comics%29">Dr. Connors</a>'s laboratory, where Connors demonstrates to his interns <a href="Spider-Man">Peter</a> and <a href="Gwen%20Stacy">Gwen</a> a new potential source of <a href="clean%20energy">clean energy</a>: genetically modified eels. After Gwen and Peter leave, an electrician, <a href="Electro%20%28Marvel%20Comics%29">Max Dillon</a>, attempts to upgrade the lab's electrical filters, but gets electrocuted and is sent to the hospital. There, he is found to be emitting strong <a href="electrical%20field">electrical field</a>s and is placed in <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a>. Max is further angered when a doctor explains that, although he is stable, he must wear a special suit to contain this emitted <a href="bioelectricity">bioelectricity</a>.

Peter, meanwhile, is assigned to tutor a popular girl named <a href="Liz%20Allan">Liz Allan</a>. He is attempting to teach her science in a café when an angry Max enters and accidentally <a href="short%20circuit">short circuit</a>s the power. Max leaves; Peter, believing him to be dangerous, pursues him as Spider-Man. Peter manages to photograph Max and remove his mask; Max, enraged, attacks, but flees while Peter is distracted by a phone call from <a href="Aunt%20May">Aunt May</a>.

The following day Peter discovers that his photographs have not developed properly, but is still able to identify the man he fought as Max. He meets with Dr. Connors, Eddie, and Gwen to seek a way to contain Max, who has meanwhile been attacked by the police and has decided to seek help from the lab. On arrival, though, Max becomes aggressive and threatens Connors's wife, Martha. Eddie distracts him long enough for Peter to lead the girls to safety and return as Spider-Man: Max, declaring himself "Electro," begins to fight with Spider-Man. The battle leads the pair out from the lab into the rain, where Spider-Man spots a <a href="Radio%20masts%20and%20towers">radio tower</a> beside a pool: he knocks Electro into the water, causing him to short circuit into unconsciousness.

At school the next day Peter talks to Liz in the hall; she is complimenting his tutoring when the popular students approach, making her change her attitude, act rudely, and walk away. In the lab, Dr. Connors picks up a vial of lizard <a href="DNA">DNA</a> that Electro had electrified, and leaves with his wife.

"Interactions" was written by Kevin Hopps and directed by Troy Adomitis. Hopps, who had previously written for animated series such as "<a href="Buzz%20Lightyear%20of%20Star%20Command">Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</a>," "<a href="Justice%20League%20%28TV%20series%29">Justice League</a>," and "<a href="Darkwing%20Duck">Darkwing Duck</a>," researched for the episode by re-reading every available comic book that featured Electro. Hopps notes that he "like[s] the humanity" of Electro: "Here's a person who didn't ask to be a villain, but found himself thrust into that role."

The radio tower scene initially called for Electro to climb to the very top of the structure, a concept the crew found "clunky" throughout the <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ing and directing process. <a href="Victor%20Cook">Victor Cook</a>, a producer and developer for "The Spectacular Spider-Man," observed "He's gonna climb the whole tower? It just seems kind of weird." Before release, the scene was altered to have Electro gradually propel himself up the tower with several electrical blasts.

Cook retained the "classic silhouette" of Electro's suit from the original comics, but removed his star-shaped mask. Cook made green the key color in the Electro design, noting that "In the 1960s it seems like the majority of <a href="List%20of%20Spider-Man%20enemies">Spider-man's rogues gallery</a> had green as part of their costumes." In Cook's broader color scheme for the cartoon green is used to symbolize negative situations in Peter's life, while positive settings and occurrences, such as Peter's <a href="biology">biology</a> class, feature other key colors like yellow.

Electro was voiced by <a href="Crispin%20Freeman">Crispin Freeman</a>, who sought to reflect in his vocal style the psychological decline brought on by the character's new powers: "It never occurred to me before how that would have an effect on his character – to be dealing with that curse and blessing. And when you think about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." The episode's title, "Interactions," expands the series theme "The Education of Peter Parker" chosen by developer <a href="Greg%20Weisman">Greg Weisman</a>. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the <a href="Biology">biological science</a>s.

"Interactions" originally aired on March 8, 2008, on the <a href="Kids%27%20WB">Kids' WB</a> block of <a href="The%20CW%20Network">The CW Network</a>, following the show's pilot, "<a href="Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest%20%28The%20Spectacular%20Spider-Man%29">Survival of the Fittest</a>." <a href="Disney%20XD">Disney XD</a> aired the episode on March 23, 2009, between "Survival of the Fittest" and "<a href="Natural%20Selection%20%28The%20Spectacular%20Spider-Man%29">Natural Selection</a>". The episode's initial broadcast garnered a Nielsen rating of 1.4/4, which is considered high for American television and was the network's 2007–08 highest rating for the 10:30 a.m. timeslot. It beat the previous episode's rating of 1.2/3 (the highest for the 10:00 a.m. timeslot for the same season) and represented a 75% increase in the share of viewers aged 2 to 11 and a 200% increase in viewers aged 2 to 5. "Interactions" rated the highest of the season for kids and boys aged 9 to 14.

The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Eric Goldman of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> thought the episode "wasn't as strong as the pilot" and rated it at 7.4 ("Decent"). Goldman wrote that Electro's redesigned costume retained "some nice visual nods to the Electro many of us grew up with." Liz Allan's characterization, though, he found confusing, with the character's accent and background unclear, and the scene where Peter fought Electro while conducting a phonecall with Aunt May "just a bit too much": "Come on, Aunt May isn't freaking out hearing "[that]"?" Nonetheless, Goldman praised the episode's humorous scenes and the introduction of Dr. Conner's limb regeneration experiments.

Rob M. Worley of the entertainment website Mania said that Freeman "charges up" the series with his role, writing that he "steps away from his luminary status in the world of anime and video game voiceovers." Ultimate Disney reviewer Luke Bonanno did not include the episode among his top five episodes of "The Spectacular Spider-Man's" first season, but "feel[s] obligated to point out that the uniform excellence of the lot [makes] this a challenging task." <a href="DVD%20Talk">DVD Talk</a> reviewer Todd Douglass Jr. described Electro's design as "[incorporating] some sharp edges and dynamic plays" to an "old" character.

Of Human Feelings

Of Human Feelings is a <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="jazz">jazz</a> saxophonist, composer, and bandleader <a href="Ornette%20Coleman">Ornette Coleman</a>. It was recorded on April 25, 1979, at <a href="CBS%20Studio%20Building">CBS Studios</a> in New York City with his Prime Time band, which featured guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and <a href="Bern%20Nix">Bern Nix</a>, bassist <a href="Jamaaladeen%20Tacuma">Jamaaladeen Tacuma</a>, and drummers Calvin Weston and Coleman's son <a href="Denardo%20Coleman">Denardo</a>. It followed the saxophonist's failed attempt to record a <a href="direct%20to%20disc%20recording">direct-to-disc</a> session earlier in March of the same year and was the first jazz album to be <a href="digital%20recording">recorded digitally</a> in the United States.

The album's <a href="jazz-funk">jazz-funk</a> music continued Coleman's <a href="harmolodic">harmolodic</a> approach to improvisation with Prime Time, whom he introduced on his 1975 album "<a href="Dancing%20in%20Your%20Head">Dancing in Your Head</a>". He drew on <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> influences from early in his career for "Of Human Feelings", which had shorter and more distinct compositions than "Dancing in Your Head". Coleman also applied <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a> principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of <a href="funk">funk</a>.

Following a change in management, Coleman signed with <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>, and "Of Human Feelings" was released in 1982 by its subsidiary label <a href="Antilles%20Records">Antilles Records</a>. Critics generally praised the album's expressive music and harmolodic approach, but it made little commercial impact and went <a href="out%20of%20print">out of print</a>. Coleman enlisted his son Denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album's <a href="royalties">royalties</a>, a change that inspired him to perform publicly again during the 1980s.

By the end of the 1960s, Ornette Coleman had become one of the most influential musicians in <a href="jazz">jazz</a> after pioneering its most controversial subgenre, <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a>, which jazz critics and musicians initially derided for its deviation from conventional structures of <a href="harmony">harmony</a> and <a href="tonality">tonality</a>. In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called <a href="harmolodics">harmolodics</a>. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a>, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of "<a href="collective%20consciousness">collective consciousness</a>" that stresses "human feelings" and "biological rhythms", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.

"Of Human Feelings" was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album "<a href="Dancing%20in%20Your%20Head">Dancing in Your Head</a>". The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and <a href="Bern%20Nix">Bern Nix</a>, bassist <a href="Jamaaladeen%20Tacuma">Jamaaladeen Tacuma</a>, and drummers <a href="Ronald%20Shannon%20Jackson">Ronald Shannon Jackson</a> and <a href="Denardo%20Coleman">Denardo Coleman</a>, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album "<a href="Body%20Meta">Body Meta</a>", which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist <a href="Charles%20Earland">Charles Earland</a>, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist: "When we read Ornette's music we have his <a href="note%20%28music%29">notes</a>, but we listen for his <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrases</a> and phrase the way he wants to. I can take the same melody, then, and phrase it like I want to, and those notes will determine the phrasing, the rhythm, the harmony – all of that."

In March 1979, Coleman went to <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA Records</a>' New York studio to produce an album with Prime Time by <a href="Direct%20to%20disc%20recording">direct-to-disc recording</a>. They had mechanical problems with the studio equipment and the recording was rejected. The failed session was a project under Phrase Text, Coleman's <a href="Music%20publisher%20%28popular%20music%29">music publishing company</a>. He wanted to set up his own record company with the same name, and chose his old friend Kunle Mwanga as his manager. In April, Mwanga arranged another session at <a href="CBS%20Studio%20Building">CBS Studios</a> in New York City, and Coleman recorded "Of Human Feelings" there on April 25; the session was originally titled "Fashion Faces". Jackson did not record with the band; instead, Calvin Weston was hired in his place to play simultaneously with Denardo Coleman. They recorded all the album's songs on the first take without any equipment problems. 

The album's recording session was captured using a Sony <a href="PCM%20adaptor">PCM-1600</a> two-track <a href="digital%20recording">digital recorder</a>, a rare item at the time. According to journalist Howard Mandel, the <a href="passage%20%28music%29">passages</a> played by the band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album, because it had been <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> with a middle-<a href="frequency">frequency</a> range and <a href="dynamic%20range%20compression">compressed dynamics</a>. Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a>, <a href="Multitrack%20recording">multi-tracking</a>, and <a href="remix">remix</a>ing. According to him, "Of Human Feelings" was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.

According to "<a href="The%20New%20Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music</a>" (2004), "Of Human Feelings" features <a href="jazz-funk">jazz-funk</a>, a type of music that originated around 1970 and was characterized by intricate rhythmic patterns, a recurrent bass line, and <a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin rhythmic</a> elements. Lloyd Sachs of the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" wrote that, although Coleman was not viewed as a <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> artist, the album can be described as such because of its combination of free jazz and <a href="funk">funk</a>. <a href="Glenn%20Kenny">Glenn Kenny</a> disagreed and felt its boisterous style had more in common with the <a href="no%20wave">no wave</a> genre and the artists of New York City's <a href="downtown%20music">downtown music</a> scene such as <a href="John%20Zorn">John Zorn</a>. Jazz writer Stuart Nicholson viewed it as the culmination of Coleman's musical principles that dated back to his free jazz music in 1960, but reappropriated with a funk-oriented <a href="backbeat">backbeat</a>. According to <a href="music%20journalism">jazz critic</a> Barry McRae, "it was as if Coleman was translating the concept of the famous double quartet" from his 1961 album "<a href="Free%20Jazz%20%28album%29">Free Jazz</a>" to what was required to perform jazz-funk.
Coleman incorporated traditional <a href="Musical%20form">structures</a> and rhythms, and other elements from the <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> music he had played early his career. According to Mandel, the album's simple, brisk music was more comparable to a coherent R&B band than jazz fusion. Although Coleman still performed the melodies on a song, he employed two guitarists for <a href="contrast%20%28music%29">contrast</a> to make each pair of guitarist and drummer responsible for either the rhythm or melody. Ellerbee provided <a href="accent%20%28music%29">accented</a> <a href="linear%20counterpoint">linear counterpoint</a> and Nix played variations of the song's melody, while Denardo Coleman and Weston played both <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>s and backbeats. On songs such as "Jump Street" and "Love Words", Ellerbee incorporated <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">distortion</a> into his guitar playing, which gave the songs a thicker <a href="Texture%20%28music%29">texture</a>. Tacuma and Ornette Coleman's instrumental <a href="call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">responses</a> were played as the foreground to the less prominent guitars. McRae remarked that Coleman and Prime Time exchanged "directional hints" throughout the songs, as one player changed key and the others <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulated</a> accordingly. The band made no attempt to harmonize their radically different parts while playing.
"Of Human Feelings" features shorter and more distinct compositions than "Dancing in Your Head". "Sleep Talk", "Air Ship", and "Times Square" were originally performed by Coleman during his concerts in 1978 under the names "Dream Talking", "Meta", and "Writing in the Streets", respectively. "What Is the Name of That Song?" was titled as a sly reference to two of his older compositions, "Love Eyes" and "Forgotten Songs" (also known as "Holiday for Heroes"), whose <a href="theme%20%28music%29">themes</a> were played concurrently and transfigured by Prime Time. The theme from "Forgotten Songs", originally from Coleman's 1972 album "<a href="Skies%20of%20America">Skies of America</a>", was used as a <a href="refrain">refrain</a>. "Jump Street" is a <a href="blues">blues</a> piece, "Air Ship" comprises a six-<a href="bar%20%28music%29">bar</a> riff, and the <a href="atonality">atonal</a> "Times Square" has futuristic dance themes. "Love Words" heavily uses <a href="Polymodal%20chromaticism">polymodality</a>, a central feature of harmolodics, and juxtaposes Coleman's extended solo against a dense, rhythmically complex backdrop. Nicholson observed <a href="Music%20of%20West%20Africa">West African</a> rhythms and collective improvisation rooted in <a href="Dixieland">New Orleans jazz</a> on "Love Words", and suggested that "Sleep Talk" was derived from the opening <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> solo in <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>'s 1913 orchestral work "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>".

A few weeks after "Of Human Feelings" was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with <a href="Kenwood%20Corporation">Trio Records</a> to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to <a href="record%20press">press</a> the album once Mwanga provided the label with the <a href="matrix%20numbers">record stamper</a>. Coleman was also set to perform his song "Skies of America" with the <a href="NHK%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NHK Symphony Orchestra</a>, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and <a href="Sid%20Bernstein">Sid Bernstein</a> as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>. He signed with the record label that year, and "Of Human Feelings" was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label <a href="Antilles%20Records">Antilles Records</a>. "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.

According to jazz writer <a href="Francis%20Davis">Francis Davis</a>, "a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for <a href="airplay">radio airplay</a> by Mandel, who described its production as "the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere". "Of Human Feelings" had no success on the American <a href="hit%20parade">pop charts</a>, only charting on the <a href="Top%20Jazz%20Albums">Top Jazz Albums</a>, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. "<a href="Sound%20%26amp%3B%20Vision%20%28magazine%29">Sound & Vision</a>" critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans preferred. The album later went <a href="out%20of%20print">out of print</a>.

"Of Human Feelings" received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing the album for "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>", <a href="Gary%20Giddins">Gary Giddins</a> hailed it as another landmark recording from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he found clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. In his opinion, the discordant keys radically transmute conventional <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> and may be the most challenging part for listeners, who he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and "let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center". Giddins also highlighted the melody of "Sleep Talk", deeming it among the best of the saxophonist's career. Kofi Natambu from the "<a href="Metro%20Times">Detroit Metro Times</a>" wrote that Coleman's synergetic approach displays expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair while calling the record "a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness". He found the songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in <a href="African-American%20music">African-American music</a> over the previous century. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> called its "warm, listenable harmolodic funk" an artistic "breakthrough if not a miracle". He found its exchange of rhythms and simple melodies heartfelt and sophisticated, writing in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", "the way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian."

<a href="wikt%3Apurist">Purist</a> critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of danceable beats and electric guitar. In "<a href="Stereo%20Review">Stereo Review</a>", <a href="Chris%20Albertson">Chris Albertson</a> deemed the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk occasionally captivating but ultimately unfocused. Dan Sullivan of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" believed the album's supporters in "hip rock circles" had overlooked flaws, arguing that Tacuma and Coleman's playing sound like a unique "beacon of clarity" amid an incessant background. <a href="Leonard%20Feather">Leonard Feather</a> wrote in the "<a href="The%20Blade%20%28Toledo%29">Toledo Blade</a>" that the music is stylistically ambiguous, potentially controversial, and difficult to assess but interesting enough to warrant a listen. 

At the end of 1982, "Of Human Feelings" the year's best album by "Billboard" editor Peter Keepnews, who viewed it as a prime example of fusing free jazz with modern funk. In year-end lists for "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Boston Phoenix</a>", James Hunter and Howard Hampton ranked the album number one and number four, respectively. It was voted 13th best in the <a href="Pazz%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in "The Village Voice". Christgau, the poll's supervisor, ranked it number one in an accompanying list, and in 1990 he named it the second-best album of the 1980s.

Coleman received $25,000 for the <a href="publishing%20rights">publishing rights</a> to "Of Human Feelings" but said his managers sold it for less than the recording costs and that he did not receive any of its <a href="royalties">royalties</a>. According to Stan Bernstein, Coleman had financial expectations that were "unrealistic in this business unless you're Michael Jackson". Antilles label executive Ron Goldstein felt the $25,000 Coleman received was neither a great nor a fair amount for someone in jazz. After he had gone over budget to record a follow-up album, Island did not release it nor pick up their <a href="option%20%28finance%29">option</a> on him, and in 1983, he left the Bernstein Agency. He chose Denardo Coleman to manage his career while overcoming his reticence of public performance, which had been rooted in his distrust of doing business with a predominantly White music industry. According to Nicholson, "the man once accused of standing on the throat of jazz was welcomed back to the touring circuits with both curiosity and affection" during the 1980s. Coleman did not record another album for six years and instead performed internationally with Prime Time.

In a 1986 article for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" on Coleman's work with Prime Time, <a href="Robert%20Palmer%20%28writer%29">Robert Palmer</a> said "Of Human Feelings" was still innovative and radical by the standards of other music in 1982, three years after it was recorded. Because writers and musicians had heard its <a href="white%20label">test pressing</a> in 1979, the album's mix of jazz improvisation and gritty, <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a> and funk-derived energy sounded "prophetic" when it was released, Palmer explained. "The album is clearly the progenitor of much that has sounded radically new in the ongoing fusion of punk rock, black dance rhythms, and free jazz." <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> critic <a href="Scott%20Yanow">Scott Yanow</a> said although Coleman's compositions never achieved popularity, they succeeded within the context of an album that showcased his distinctive saxophone style, which was high-brow yet catchy. Joshua Klein from "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" recommended "Of Human Feelings" as the best album for new listeners of Coleman's harmolodics-based music, while "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" rock critic <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> included it in his guide for novice jazz listeners; he named it one of the few albums that helped him both become a better listener of rock music and learn how to enjoy jazz. In 2008, "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine's Martin Johnson included it in his list of canonical albums from what he felt had been New York's sceneless yet vital jazz of the previous 40 years; "Of Human Feelings" exuded what he described as a spirit of sophistication with elements of funk, Latin, and <a href="Music%20of%20Africa">African music</a>, all of which were encapsulated by music that retained a jazz identity.

All compositions were written by Ornette Coleman.

Convoy GP55

Convoy GP55 was a <a href="Convoy%23World%20War%20I">convoy</a> of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> ships that travelled from <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> to <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> in June 1943 during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. It comprised ten cargo ships, three <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">landing ships, tank (LSTs)</a> and an escort of five <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s. The Japanese submarine <a href="Japanese%20submarine%20I-174">"I-174"</a> attacked the convoy on 16 June, sinking the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> transport ship and damaging <a href="USS%20LST-469">USS "LST-469"</a>. Two of the corvettes counter-attacked "I-174", but only lightly damaged her.

The Australian military conducted an intensive search for "I-174" in the days after the attack in the mistaken belief that she had been significantly damaged. This search was not successful and highlighted the unsatisfactory communications between the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN) and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). However, another Japanese submarine passing through the area may have been sunk by RAAF aircraft. Because of Japan's deteriorating strategic situation, "I-174" was the last <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) submarine to operate off the Australian east coast.

During 1942 and 1943, Japanese submarines periodically operated in the waters surrounding Australia. A force of <a href="midget%20submarine">midget submarine</a>s <a href="Attack%20on%20Sydney%20Harbour">raided Sydney Harbour</a> on the night of 31 May – 1 June 1942 and attacks on merchant shipping travelling off the east coast began several days later. These attacks continued until August 1942, when the Japanese submarine force was redeployed. The "I-174" made a 24-day patrol off Australia in July and August 1942, but did not attack any ships. In response to the Japanese attacks, the Australian naval authorities ordered that all ships with a displacement of more than 1,200 tons and a maximum speed of less than 12 knots travel in escorted convoys from 8 June. These convoys were successful in minimising losses, and no escorted ships were sunk off Australia during 1942.
Japanese submarines resumed operations in Australian waters in January 1943. <a href="Japanese%20submarine%20I-21">"I-21"</a> made a highly successful patrol in January and February, during which she sank five ships, and two other submarines operated off Sydney and Brisbane in March. A force of five boats from the IJN's 3rd Submarine Squadron subsequently attacked shipping along the full length of the Australian east coast during April and May in an attempt to disrupt the Allied supply line to <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. This marked the peak of the Japanese submarine offensive against Australia and nine ships were sunk off the east coast within a month. In contrast with 1942, several successful attacks were made against ships travelling in convoys.

The large number of Japanese attacks in 1943 put great strain on the Allied forces responsible for protecting shipping off eastern Australia. The Australian naval authorities were forced in April to reduce the number of convoys that sailed so their escort could be increased to at least four warships. The RAAF also greatly increased the number of aircraft allocated to escort convoys and ships sailing independently. Further ships and aircraft fitted for <a href="anti-submarine%20warfare">anti-submarine warfare</a> (ASW) became available in May, but were still not adequate to counter the Japanese attacks.

The sinking of the hospital ship <a href="AHS%20Centaur">AHS "Centaur"</a> on 14 May 1943 with heavy loss of life led the <a href="Advisory%20War%20Council%20%28Australia%29">Advisory War Council</a> to seek information from the RAN and RAAF on the actions being taken to protect shipping. While the RAN acknowledged that the <a href="Bathurst%20class%20corvette">"Bathurst"-class corvettes</a> that made up most of its escort force were too slow, it argued that the losses suffered by escorted convoys were no worse than those in other parts of the world. Despite the Navy's assurances, Australia's anti-submarine forces were constrained by a shortage of training opportunities and poor coordination between the RAN, RAAF and the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. The Australian military had also not kept pace with improvements to British and United States ASW doctrine by fully implementing the tactics that had proven most successful in other theatres of the war.

"I-174" departed from the major Japanese naval base at <a href="Chuuk%20State">Truk</a> on 16 May 1943 under the command of Lieutenant Nobukiyo Nanbu and arrived off Sandy Cape, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> on 27 May. She was the only Japanese boat operating off Australia at the time, as all other available submarines were deployed to counter Allied advances in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. She made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on the American ship "Point San Pedro" on 1 June, exchanged gunfire with U.S. Army transport "Edward Chambers" three days later, and on 5 June was driven off by convoy PG 53's escorts. On 7 June, "I-174" fired four torpedoes at the American Liberty ship "John Bartram", all of which missed. She sighted another convoy on 13 June, too far away to attack. During this period, she was repeatedly attacked by Allied aircraft and warships, but did not sustain any damage.

Convoy GP55 was assembled in mid-June 1943 as one of at least 69 convoys that sailed from Sydney to Brisbane during 1943. It comprised ten cargo ships and three U.S. Navy Landing Ships, Tank (LST), and was escorted by the "Bathurst"-class corvettes (which embarked the convoy's senior officer), , , and . After departing Sydney at 8.45 am on 15 June the convoy maneuvered into five columns, with three ships in each of the centre columns and two in those at the edges. The escorts surrounded the convoy, with four sailing ahead of it and "Deloraine" to the stern. RAAF <a href="Avro%20Anson">Anson</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Beaufort">Beaufort</a> aircraft also patrolled over the convoy at all times. U.S. Army transport "Portmar", which had been badly damaged in the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">Bombing of Darwin</a> on 19 February 1942, had difficulty maintaining her position in the convoy and at times straggled behind the other ships.

"I-174" sighted Convoy GP55 about east of <a href="Smoky%20Cape">Smoky Cape</a> at 4.37 pm on 16 June. The submarine immediately began preparations to attack the Allied ships and easily penetrated the escort screen. At this time "Portmar" was trying to return to her station and was passing to the port of USS "LST-469". This made the ships an ideal target for Nanbu as they overlapped from the viewpoint of his periscope. Accordingly, he fired two torpedoes at them at 5.20 pm. A single torpedo struck the LST near her stern two minutes later, resulting in severe damage and the loss of 26 lives and 17 wounded. "Portmar" spotted the second torpedo and attempted to evade it but was also struck on her starboard side. The transport's cargo of petrol and ammunition quickly caught fire and she sank within ten minutes. One of her crew and a passenger were killed, and 71 survivors, including four who were injured, were rescued by "Deloraine". Despite losing steerage "LST-469" remained afloat and was taken under tow by the corvette. "I-174"'s attack on Convoy GP55 was probably the most successful made by a Japanese submarine off Australia.

While "Deloraine" attended to the torpedoed ships, the other four escorts attempted to locate the Japanese submarine. "I-174" had not been detected approaching the convoy, and after the attack the Australian corvettes reversed their courses to conduct a sonar sweep of the area from where she was presumed to have attacked. This was in accordance with tactics that had recently been adopted by the RAN after they proved successful in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>. "Warrnambool" detected the submarine 23 minutes after the attack, and she and "Kalgoorlie" subjected "I-174" to four <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> attacks over two hours until contact was lost. An Anson from <a href="No.%2071%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 71 Squadron</a> was escorting the convoy at the time the two ships were torpedoed but was low on fuel and returned to base shortly after the attack. While the corvettes believed that they had sunk "I-174", she was only lightly damaged and withdrew to the east. The Australian failure to sink the submarine was due to a lack of practice and too few ships being available to create an adequate search scheme.

After breaking off their attack "Warrnambool" rejoined the convoy while "Kalgoorlie" assisted "Deloraine" in protecting the damaged LST. Deteriorating weather broke the tow-line between "Deloraine" and "LST-469", and instead the corvette proceeded to the nearby town of <a href="Coffs%20Harbour%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Coffs Harbour</a> with "Portmar"'s survivors and the LST's wounded personnel. The <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a> was dispatched from Brisbane on 16 June to recover the LST and towed her to Sydney, where they arrived on 20 June. "LST-469" had been carrying troops and supplies for <a href="Operation%20Chronicle">Operation Chronicle</a>, an amphibious landing at <a href="Woodlark%20Island">Woodlark</a> and <a href="Kiriwina">Kiriwina</a> islands on 30 June, and this operation was hindered by her unavailability.

Following the attack, the Australian <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Naval Staff</a>, Admiral Sir <a href="Guy%20Royle">Guy Royle</a>, judged that the submarine had been damaged and ordered that "special measures" be taken to search for it. The RAAF commenced air searches of an box south-east of Coffs Harbour on the night of 16/17 June, while "Deloraine", "Kalgoorlie" and the recently arrived <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> patrolled the area. On 17 June, Anson aircraft were assigned to patrol the submarine's most likely escape routes in the hope that this would force her to remain submerged during the day and surface at night. Radar-equipped Beauforts relieved the Ansons after dusk and continued the search.
In the early morning of 18 June, two <a href="No.%2032%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 32 Squadron</a> Beauforts attacked with bombs and gunfire what they took to be a submarine. "Deloraine" was less than from the area of the RAAF attack, but did not acknowledge repeated attempts by the aircraft to communicate with her. The Beauforts reported that they had damaged the submarine and intensive efforts were made on 19 June to locate and sink her, with twelve Ansons continuously sweeping the area while six <a href="A-31%20Vengeance">Vengeance</a> dive bombers were held in readiness nearby. No further sightings were made and it was assumed that the submarine had been damaged by a No. 32 Squadron aircraft but escaped. Naval historian David Stevens has written that the sighting made on 18 June was probably mistaken, as "I-174" was at least to the east of where the RAAF attack took place and the incident was not recorded in her war diary. However, other historians believe that the Beauforts may have sunk <a href="Japanese%20submarine%20I-178">"I-178"</a>, which was patrolling off the east coast of Australia at the time; this submarine disappeared some time after 17 June 1943, and the cause of her loss has never been confirmed. "I-174" was ordered to depart from Australian waters on 20 June, and returned to <a href="Truk%20Lagoon">Truk</a> on 1 July. She did not make contact with any Allied ships or aircraft after attacking GP55.

The seeming failure of the RAAF and RAN to cooperate to finish off a damaged submarine led Royle to order an inquiry into the attack. This found that a breakdown in communication between the two services was the main cause of the failure, with both the aircraft and the naval signal room in Sydney making procedural errors. Rear Admiral <a href="Gerard%20Muirhead-Gould">Gerard Muirhead-Gould</a>, the naval officer in command of the Sydney region, also noted that communications between the RAN and RAAF were unsatisfactory at higher levels, and that the communication procedures to be used in anti-submarine operations were not well known or understood. In response, he suggested that the RAN establish the position of Commander Escort Vessels Group to organise and command escorts and coordinate their tactics.

The attack on Convoy GP55 was the last attack made by a Japanese submarine on the east coast of Australia. Two submarines were dispatched to operate off Australia in July 1943, but were diverted to the Solomon Islands shortly before reaching the east coast. Following this, the Japanese submarines were fully occupied responding to Allied offensives and transporting supplies to isolated garrisons. As the threat to shipping declined, the RAN ceased running convoys in waters south of <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> on 7 December 1943 and Sydney–Brisbane convoys ended on 10 February 1944.

<doc id="23663117" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23663117" title="Horse Protection Act of 1970">
Horse Protection Act of 1970

The Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA); (codified ) is a United States <a href="federal%20law">federal law</a>, under which the practice of <a href="soring">soring</a> is a crime punishable by both <a href="Civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil</a> and <a href="Criminal%20law">criminal</a> penalties, including fines and jail time. It is illegal to show a horse, enter it at a <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>, or to auction, sell, offer for sale, or transport a horse for any of these purposes if it has been sored.

Soring is the practice of applying irritants or blistering agents to the front feet or forelegs of a horse, making it pick its feet up higher in an exaggerated manner that creates the movement or "action" desired in the <a href="horse%20show">show ring</a>. Soring is an act of <a href="animal%20cruelty">animal cruelty</a> that gives practitioners an unfair advantage over other competitors. The Horse Protection Act is enforced by the <a href="Animal%20and%20Plant%20Health%20Inspection%20Service">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</a> (APHIS), a branch of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA). Although violations of the law are seen most often in the <a href="Tennessee%20Walking%20Horse">Tennessee Walking Horse</a> industry, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.

Originally all inspectors were from APHIS, but a lack of funding led to a 1976 amendment to the act, which allows non-USDA employees to be trained and certified as inspectors. This program has not always been successful, with some non-USDA inspectors being more lenient on violators than others, and citations for violations tend to increase significantly when USDA inspectors are present at a show. Several methods are used to detect violations of the act, including observation, <a href="palpation">palpation</a> and <a href="gas%20chromatography">gas chromatography</a>/<a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> to identify chemicals on horses' legs. Certain training techniques and topical anesthetics can be used to avoid detection by the first two methods. There have been a number of unsuccessful challenges to the act on the grounds on constitutionality, as well as challenges on varying other issues. In 2013, an amendment to the act was proposed in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. The amendment would allow only USDA employees to perform inspections, toughen penalties for violations, and outlaw the use of action devices and "stacks", or layers of pads attached to the bottom of the front hooves.

Soring began in the 1950s with <a href="gaited%20horse">gaited horse</a> trainers who were looking to improve their chances of winning at <a href="horse%20show">horse show</a>s. To do this, they developed methods to enhance the desired high action <a href="horse%20gait">gaits</a> to levels greater than that produced by traditional training methods. Thus began the use of irritants, including chemicals and physical objects, or abusive shoeing and hoof-trimming practices on the front legs. Attempting to relieve the pain in its legs, a sored horse lifts its front feet off the ground more quickly, creating a flashier gait. By the 1960s, soring had gained popularity, as horses so treated gained an edge in competition. However, public opposition to the practice also grew, and in 1966, the American Horse Protection Association was created in part to address the issue of soring. In 1969, Senator <a href="Joseph%20Tydings">Joseph Tydings</a> sponsored legislation to prohibit soring, leading to the passing of the Horse Protection Act in 1970, amended in 1976. While <a href="Tennessee%20Walking%20Horse">Tennessee Walking Horse</a>s, <a href="Racking%20horse">Racking Horse</a>s and other "high-stepping breeds" are generally targeted by these abusive practices, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.

Soring is defined by the HPA with four meanings:

(3)(A) an irritating or blistering agent has been applied, internally or externally, by a person to any limb of a horse, <br>(B) any burn, cut, or laceration has been inflicted by a person on any limb of a horse, <br>(C) any tack, nail, screw, or chemical agent has been injected by a person into or used by a person on any limb of a horse, or <br>(D) any other substance or device has been used by a person on any limb of a horse or a person has engaged in a practice involving a horse, and, as a result of such application, infliction, injection, use, or practice, such horse suffers, or can reasonably be expected to suffer, physical pain or distress, inflammation, or lameness when walking.

The Horse Protection Act is found in <a href="Title%2015%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Code">Title 15</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Code">United States Code</a>, which covers commerce and trade. Section (§) 1821 covers the definitions of the terms used in the act and §1822 details the Congressional statement of findings. The requirements placed upon horse shows and exhibitions are covered in §1823. §1824 covers the core provisions of the act, prohibiting the "shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, or receiving of any horse which is sore" as well as the actual showing, exhibition, entry into a show, sale, or auction of a sored horse, including offering a sored horse for sale, as well as outlining the responsibilities of show management and recordkeeping requirements. The export of horses is covered in §1824a. §1825 covers penalties for violations detailed previously in the act, which may be civil or criminal, with fines of up to $50,000 and imprisonment of up to five years. §1826 details the required notice of violations to the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Attorney General of the United States</a>. The utilization of USDA and state government staff is covered in §1827, as is non-financial assistance to states. Rules and regulations pertaining to the act's statutes are covered in §1828. §1829 covers <a href="federal%20preemption">federal preemption</a> of state laws, <a href="concurrent%20jurisdiction">concurrent jurisdiction</a>, and prohibitions on certain state actions. §1830 is currently reserved for future use, and §1831 details the authorization of appropriations for expenses related to the enforcement of the provisions of the act.

As originally enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to be enforced by <a href="Animal%20and%20Plant%20Health%20Inspection%20Service">Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service</a> (APHIS), a branch of the USDA. However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates "the potential for a "fox guarding the chicken coop" situation", as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring, the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring. When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly. Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted, have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses. In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.

For the first decades following passage of the act, foreign substances applied to the legs, including chemicals, were detected by feel, sight or smell. Since 2006, the USDA has used <a href="gas%20chromatography">gas chromatography</a>/<a href="mass%20spectrometry">mass spectrometry</a> to identify chemicals found on horses' legs at events. Samples of suspicious substances are swabbed at the show, and sent to a laboratory for analysis; owners and trainers are later informed of the results. However, this method is only used by APHIS veterinary medical officers at present.

Soring can be also detected by observing the horse for <a href="Lameness%20%28equine%29">lameness</a>, assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs. Some trainers evaded detection from inspectors by training horses not to react to the pain that palpation may cause, often by severely punishing the horse for flinching after the sored area is touched. The practice is called "stewarding", in reference to the <a href="horse%20show%20steward">horse show steward</a>. Others use topical anesthetics, such as <a href="lidocaine">lidocaine</a> and <a href="benzocaine">benzocaine</a>, which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring. Use of chemicals can be completely avoided if pressure shoeing is also used. This process involves placing some type of hard foreign object (such as a small piece of wood, stone, hard acrylic, or sharp object such as a tack or nail) against the sole of the horse's foot before applying the horseshoe and pads. It can also be done by trimming down the horse's hoof to its sensitive structures, then shoeing. Either method causes pain when the horse places its foot on the ground.

There have been a number of challenges to the Horse Protection Act on the grounds of constitutionality, mainly regarding <a href="due%20process">due process</a> and <a href="equal%20protection">equal protection</a>, none of which were successful. Courts have also ruled on other issues with regard to the act, including whether knowledge of soring or intent to sore is required in order to prove a violation of the act, and courts have repeatedly held that it is not. The issue of digital palpation, one of the main methods used by inspectors to find and verify soreness, has been contested in several courts, and is the only issue that has had courts come to varying conclusions on its legitimacy. The majority of courts with appeals rising to the <a href="United%20States%20courts%20of%20appeals">Circuit Court</a> level, have held that palpation is a legitimate method for identifying soreness, and that soreness found through palpation is grounds for penalties under the Horse Protection Act. However, in a decision promulgated by the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit">Fifth Circuit Court</a>, it was found that soreness found through digital palpation alone was not sufficient evidence upon which to base penalties.

The largest association in the United States for <a href="equine%20veterinarian">equine veterinarian</a>s, the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20Equine%20Practitioners">American Association of Equine Practitioners</a> (AAEP), called the practice of soring "one of the most significant welfare issues affecting any equine breed or discipline" after releasing a <a href="white%20paper">white paper</a> on the subject in 2008. The organization pointed out that despite over three decades of work, the HPA law had failed to prevent sored horses from being trained, shown, and sold. The AAEP blamed this failure on what they called the "woefully inadequate" level of funding for enforcement, which the law caps at $500,000 annually. The federal <a href="Office%20of%20Inspector%20General">Office of Inspector General</a> found in 2010 that the self-enforcement system of HIOs and DQPs was inadequate for eliminating the practice of soring. This led to the June 2012 strengthening of penalty systems.

In 2010, the Friends of Sound Horses launched a website containing the names of the over 8,700 people who had received suspensions from the horse showing and training world under the Horse Protection Act between 1986 and 2010. This list was developed as part of the USDA Horse Protection Operating Plan for 2007–2009, and supported by most of the USDA-certified HIOs. Despite the work being done to dissuade trainers from soring horses, APHIS inspectors found hundreds of violations in the course of their work during the 2012 year.

Since the 1976 amendment, there have been several other proposed changes to the act, all unsuccessful so far. In 2005, HR 503, titled the "Horse Slaughter Prohibition Bill", was introduced by U.S. Representative <a href="John%20E.%20Sweeney">John E. Sweeney</a> (R-NY). The bill would have made major changes to the focus of the Horse Protection Act, by prohibiting the "shipping, transporting, moving, delivering, receiving, possessing, purchasing, selling, or donation of horses and other equines to be slaughtered for human consumption." It passed the House of Representatives in 2006, but died in the Senate.

In September 2012, U.S. Representatives <a href="Ed%20Whitfield">Ed Whitfield</a>, a <a href="republican%20party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Republican</a> from Kentucky, and <a href="Steve%20Cohen">Steve Cohen</a>, a <a href="Democratic%20party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Democrat</a> from Tennessee, proposed HR 6388, titled the "Horse Protection Act Amendments of 2012". That bill died in committee. A similar bill, HR 1518, titled the "Prevent All Soring Tactics Act" was introduced on April 11, 2013. If passed, the bill, nearly identical to HR 6388, would amend the Horse Protection Act of 1970 to increase fines to $5,000, increase prison time to three years, and increase other penalties. It would also mandate the USDA to assign a licensed inspector if a show management indicates its intent to hire one, currently a voluntary practice. The bill would prohibit the use of "action devices" and "stacks". Action devices are weights attached around the <a href="pastern">pastern</a>s of horses, and if attached so that they move, they can rub or irritate sored areas and thus further enhance gaits. Stacks are layers of pads attached to the bottom of the front hooves between the <a href="horseshoe">horseshoe</a> and the hoof, which increase the lift of the foot and the impact with the ground by adding height and weight to horses' front feet. The final change would be to increase penalties for violations of the act. The bill was assigned to the House <a href="United%20States%20House%20Energy%20Subcommittee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Manufacturing%20and%20Trade">Committee on Energy and Commerce</a>. Both bills have been opposed by some organizations within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. The President and executive committee of the <a href="Tennessee%20Walking%20Horse%20Breeders%27%20and%20Exhibitors%27%20Association">Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association</a> (TWHBEA) voted to support this legislation, but the full board of directors chose not to. The initial bill was supported by several outside organizations, including the AAEP, the <a href="American%20Veterinary%20Medical%20Association">American Veterinary Medical Association</a> (AVMA) and the <a href="Humane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States">Humane Society of the United States</a> (HSUS).

Henry Edwards (entomologist)

Henry Edwards (27 August 1827 – 9 June 1891), known as "Harry", was an English stage actor, writer and <a href="entomology">entomologist</a> who gained fame in Australia, San Francisco and New York City for his theatre work.

Edwards was drawn to the theatre early in life, and he appeared in amateur productions in London. After sailing to Australia, Edwards appeared professionally in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>an plays and light comedies primarily in Melbourne and Sydney. Throughout his childhood in England and his acting career in Australia, he was greatly interested in <a href="Insect%20collecting">collecting insects</a>, and the <a href="Museum%20Victoria">National Museum of Victoria</a> used the results of his Australian fieldwork as part of the genesis of their collection.

In San Francisco, Edwards was a founding member of the <a href="Bohemian%20Club">Bohemian Club</a>, and a gathering in Edwards' honour was the spark which began the club's traditional summer encampment at the <a href="Bohemian%20Grove">Bohemian Grove</a>. As well, Edwards cemented his reputation as a preeminent stage actor and theatre manager. After writing a series of influential studies on <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Pacific Coast</a> butterflies and moths he was elected life member of the <a href="California%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">California Academy of Sciences</a>. Relocating to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast</a>, Edwards spent a brief time in Boston theatre. This led to a connection to <a href="Wallack%27s%20Theatre">Wallack's Theatre</a> and further renown in New York City. There, Edwards edited three volumes of the journal "Papilio" and published a major work about the life of the butterfly. His large collection of insect specimens served as the foundation of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>'s butterfly and moth studies.

Edwards' wide-ranging studies and observations of insects brought him into contact with specimens not yet classified. Upon discovering previously unknown insects he would give them names, which led to a number of <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a>, <a href="moth">moth</a> and <a href="beetle">beetle</a> species bearing "Hy. Edw." (for Henry Edwards) as an attribution. From his theatre interests to entomology, Edwards carried forward an appreciation of Shakespeare—in the designation of new insect species he favoured female character names from Shakespeare's plays.

Henry Edwards was born to Hannah and Thomas Edwards (c. 1794 – 1857) at Brook House in <a href="Ross-on-Wye">Ross-on-Wye</a>, Herefordshire, England, on 27 August 1827, and was christened on 14 September. From his older brother William, he picked up an interest in examining insects. He collected butterflies as a hobby, and studied them under the tutelage of <a href="Edward%20Doubleday">Edward Doubleday</a>. His solicitor father intended a law career for his son, but after a brief period of unsuccessful study, Edwards took a position at a <a href="counting%20house">counting house</a> in London, and began acting in amateur theatre. He then journeyed to join his brother William who had settled in Australia, nine miles (14 km) north-west of Melbourne along the bank of <a href="Merri%20Creek">Merri Creek</a>, a location then called Merrivale. Aboard the sailing ship "Ganges" from March to June 1853, he wrote descriptions of creatures such as the <a href="albatross">albatross</a> that he encountered for the first time. After arriving in Melbourne, Edwards began collecting and cataloguing the insects he found on his brother's land, and further afield. Within two years, he had gathered 1,676 species of insects, shot and mounted 200 birds, and pressed some 200 botanical specimens. This collection and that of William Kershaw were purchased by <a href="Frederick%20McCoy">Frederick McCoy</a> to form the nucleus of the new <a href="Museum%20Victoria">National Museum of Victoria</a>.

The first Australian stage appearance by Edwards was with <a href="George%20Selth%20Coppin">George Selth Coppin</a>'s company at the Queen's Theatre in Melbourne. Later, he joined <a href="Gustavus%20Vaughan%20Brooke">Gustavus Vaughan Brooke</a>'s theatrical group. The part of <a href="Petruchio">Petruchio</a>, the male lead in Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Taming%20of%20the%20Shrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a>", was filled by Edwards at the Princess's Theatre in Sydney in November 1859, playing opposite <a href="Tragedy">tragedian</a> <a href="Avonia%20Jones">Avonia Jones</a> as Katharine. In December that year Brooke retired from management, yielding the reins of his company to the team of Edwards and George Fawcett Rowe, English actor and playwright. Brooke continued to act under Edwards and Rowe: his starring performance in April 1860 as <a href="Louis%20XI%20of%20France">Louis XI</a> in <a href="Dion%20Boucicault">Dion Boucicault</a>'s play of the same name was a stirring portrayal that Edwards, playing <a href="Jacques%20d%27Armagnac%2C%20Duke%20of%20Nemours">Jacques d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours</a>, recalled vividly for the rest of his life. Sharing the stage again in August, Brooke and Edwards were well received in their portrayal of twin brothers in a production of Shakespeare's "<a href="The%20Comedy%20of%20Errors">The Comedy of Errors</a>" in Melbourne, the first Australian mounting of that work. As a twist to pique public interest, Edwards and Brooke exchanged roles after two weeks' run. However, not all of Edwards' performances were successful: his turn at <a href="Angelo%20%28Measure%20for%20Measure%29">Angelo</a> in Shakespeare's "<a href="Measure%20for%20Measure">Measure for Measure</a>" was called "invertebrate" by drama critic William John Lawrence; in Lawrence's estimation, Edwards and his fellow actors paled against the powerful performance of Avonia Jones as Isabella.

The renowned entomologist and collector <a href="William%20Sharp%20Macleay">William Sharp Macleay</a> was sought out by Edwards whenever his stage appearances took him to Sydney. Beginning in 1858, Macleay mentored Edwards and encouraged him to search for more insect specimens when his theatre obligations allowed. Robust and adventuresome, Edwards occasionally trekked out into the wilds of Australia on the hunt for insects. While in Sydney, Edwards went up two times in a <a href="hot%20air%20balloon">hot air balloon</a> as a favour to George Coppin, narrowly avoiding severe injury or death in the first ascent. Edwards' further travels included New Zealand, Peru, Panama and Mexico in pursuit of insects and dramatic roles.

In 1865, Edwards began a 12-year residence in San Francisco, California. At the <a href="1870%20United%20States%20Census">1870 United States Census</a>, Edwards reported himself as a non-voting foreign-born resident, a <a href="Comedy%20%28drama%29">comedian</a> by trade, living in a home worth $1,000. Edwards lived in San Francisco with a white woman listed in the census as "Mariana", born in England, age 40, and a 16-year-old Chinese servant named Heng Gim. The woman Mariana was likely Edwards's wife, the former Marianne Elizabeth Woolcott Bray who was born about 1822–1823 in <a href="New%20Street%2C%20Birmingham">New Street</a>, Birmingham. In 1851 at the age of 28, Bray married Gustavus Vaughan Brooke, and the two went to Australia to manage Brooke's then-new theatre company. It was there that Edwards met Brooke and his wife, but after several years of the two men working together, Brooke remarried in February 1863, taking Avonia Jones (1836–1867) as his second wife. Brooke died in an accident at sea in January 1866, and Avonia Jones Brooke died in New York City the next year. Later reports spoke of Edwards marrying Brooke's widow, without naming her.
In 1868–1869 Edwards leased and managed the Metropolitan Theater, and he was a founding member of the acting company of the <a href="California%20Theatre%20%28San%20Francisco%29">California Theatre</a>, which opened in January 1869. The theatre was directed and managed by actor <a href="John%20Edward%20McCullough">John McCullough</a>, and among the more notable productions was "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>" in May 1872, with McCullough playing Orlando and Edwards the banished Duke Senior. Walter M. Leman, who carried the part of Adam, opined in 1886 that "never since "time was" has Shakespeare's charming idyl been better put upon the stage."

Edwards was one of the founders and the first vice-president of the Bohemian Club, and served two terms as president, 1873–1875. He hosted Shakespeare celebrations at the club in April 1873, 1875 and 1877, and a Bohemian Christmas celebration in December 1877: "The Feast of Reason and Flow of Soul". Edwards became a director of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Art%20Association">San Francisco Art Association</a>, and spoke for <a href="Lotta%20Crabtree">Lotta Crabtree</a> at the dedication of <a href="Lotta%27s%20Fountain">Lotta's Fountain</a> in September 1875.

Still very much interested in insects, Edwards spent his spare time at the <a href="California%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">California Academy of Sciences</a> studying butterflies under <a href="Hans%20Hermann%20Behr">Hans Hermann Behr</a>, the academy's curator for <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>, the scientific <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of moths and butterflies. Elected a member of the academy in 1867, he concentrated on describing the structure and habits of moths and butterflies on the <a href="Pacific%20coast">Pacific coast</a> from <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> to <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>. He went to visit <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a> in <a href="Yosemite%20Valley">Yosemite Valley</a> in June 1871, with a letter of introduction from Jeanne Carr, the wife of California's chief geologist <a href="Ezra%20S.%20Carr">Ezra S. Carr</a>. The letter described Edwards as "one of Nature's truest and most devoted disciples", a sojourner who "has the keys to the Kingdom". After the visit, Muir occasionally sent specimens from the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierras</a> to add to Edwards' collection, carried to San Francisco by men such as geologist and artist <a href="Clarence%20King">Clarence King</a> who were returning from Yosemite field study. Edwards presented a series of papers to the academy entitled "Pacific Coast Lepidoptera", and classified two species as new to science. He named one "Gyros muiri" for Muir, with "Hy. Edw." as the attribution. In 1872, Muir sent Edwards a letter, writing "You are now in constant remembrance, because every flying flower is branded with your name." In 1873, Edwards became the curator of <a href="entomology">entomology</a> at the academy, and began to serve on the Publications Committee which produced the journal "Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences". Beginning early that year, he befriended <a href="George%20Robert%20Crotch">George Robert Crotch</a>. Although it is sometimes claimed that he accompanied Crotch on his insect collecting tour of California, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and British Columbia, Edwards was only aware of Crotch's travels as a correspondent. Edwards independently visited British Columbia in 1873, missing Crotch by several days at Vancouver Island. In 1874, Edwards began to serve as one of the academy's vice-presidents, and for the academy in late 1874 after Crotch's death from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, he published a memorial tribute to the man. Edwards also wrote one of many tributes to academician <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> at his death in late 1873. At the academy on 2 January 1877, Edwards was elected member for life.

Though successful in San Francisco, Edwards decided to head for Boston and New York City to see if his career as an actor could benefit from appearances in the eastern United States. On 29 June 1878, somewhat fewer than 100 of his Bohemian friends gathered in the woods near <a href="Taylorville%2C%20California">Taylorville, California</a> (present-day <a href="Samuel%20P.%20Taylor%20State%20Park">Samuel P. Taylor State Park</a>), for a night-time send-off party in Edwards' honour. Bohemian Club historian <a href="Porter%20Garnett">Porter Garnett</a> later wrote that the men at the "nocturnal picnic" were "provided with blankets to keep them warm and a generous supply of liquor for the same purpose". Japanese lanterns were used for illumination and decoration. This festive gathering was repeated without Edwards by club members the next year, and every year thereafter, eventually evolving and expanding into the club's annual summer encampment at the <a href="Bohemian%20Grove">Bohemian Grove</a>, famous (or infamous) for the casual commingling of top politicians and powerful captains of industry in attendance.

In late 1878, Edwards joined a theatre company in Boston, replacing another actor as "Schelm, Chief of Police" at a revival of the spectacle "The Exiles" at the <a href="Boston%20Theatre">Boston Theatre</a> on Washington Street. After a four-week run, he performed in other productions at the theatre through the 1879–1880 season. In June, Edwards answered the <a href="1880%20United%20States%20Census">1880 census</a> to report himself an England-born actor living with his English wife "Marian" and his Chinese servant, Gim Hing.
From Boston, Edwards moved to New York to stay for some ten years, performing on stage and participating in insect studies. He was active in the <a href="Brooklyn%20Entomological%20Society">Brooklyn</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Entomological%20Society">New York Entomological Societies</a>. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled "<a href="Papilio%20%28New%20York%20Entomological%20Club%29">Papilio</a>", named for the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Papilio" in the <a href="swallowtail%20butterfly">swallowtail butterfly</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Swallowtail%20butterfly">Papilionidae</a>. Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave the reins to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. "Papilio" was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general "<a href="Entomologica%20Americana%20%28Brooklyn%20Entomological%20Society%29">Entomologia Americana</a>", published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.

Beginning in December 1880 under <a href="John%20Lester%20Wallack">Lester Wallack</a>, the charismatic son of the theatre's founder, Edwards was associated with <a href="Wallack%27s%20Theatre">Wallack's Theatre</a> in New York, called the "finest theatre company in America". Now in his 50s, the entomologist and actor appeared in such representative British dramatic roles as Prince Malleotti in "Forget Me Not", Max Harkaway in "<a href="London%20Assurance">London Assurance</a>", Baron Stein in "Diplomacy", and Master Walter in "The Hunchback", reprising <a href="James%20Sheridan%20Knowles">James Sheridan Knowles</a>'s earlier portrayal. Edwards used Wallack's Theatre as his professional mailing address, and helped manage it upon occasion. Wallack, already head "Shepherd" of the <a href="Lambs%20Club">Lambs Club</a>, a modest meetinghouse of professional stage actors, invited Edwards to join. Once a Lamb, Edwards threw his energies in with those of Wallack and other club members to aid newspaper editor <a href="Harrison%20Grey%20Fiske">Harrison Grey Fiske</a> in the <a href="Charitable%20organization">organisation of a charitable fund</a> to support destitute actors or their widows. Wallack was made president of the resulting <a href="Actors%27%20Fund">Actors' Fund</a>. A year after its first meeting on 15 July 1882 at Wallack's Theatre, Edwards was made secretary, a position he held for one year. His wife joined the Women's Executive Committee of the Fund.

Edwards appeared in early 1882 at <a href="Palmer%27s%20Theatre">Palmer's Theatre</a> on Broadway and West 30th Street in a production of the English <a href="Comedy%20%28drama%29">comedy</a> "<a href="The%20School%20for%20Scandal">The School for Scandal</a>". Wallack stalwart <a href="John%20Gibbs%20Gilbert">John Gibbs Gilbert</a> reached the height of his fame in the production, playing Sir Peter Teazle. As Sir Oliver Surface, Edwards, too, was lauded—Gilbert and Edwards shared the stage with <a href="Stella%20Weaver">Stella Boniface</a>, Osmond Tearle, Gerald Eyre, <a href="Madame%20Ponisi">Madame Ponisi</a> and <a href="Rose%20Coghlan">Rose Coghlan</a>.

Gathering together under one cover his various short subjects, essays, and elegies to fallen friends, Edwards published in 1883 a wryly humorous book entitled "A Mingled Yarn", including tales of travels and stories of his time in the Bohemian Club. Dedicated to the Bohemians, "with grateful memories, and feelings of affectionate regard," the book was favourably reviewed in the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>". This review was reprinted in the "Literary News": "Mr. Edwards—remarkable for attainments in science no less than for versatile proficiency in the art of acting—presents a rare type of the union of talents greatly divergent and seldom found in one and the same person."
In 1886, Edwards was interviewed for "The Theatre", a weekly magazine published in New York. Edwards was described as "unusually popular and genial", with a "charming English" wife and a Chinese servant named Charlie who "adores his employers" and had served them for 17 years. The Edwards' home was observed to be comfortable but decorated with an astonishing collection of wonders from around the globe. Displayed amid the biological specimens, rugs, china, furniture, and valuable photographs were paintings executed by other actors, including ones by <a href="Edward%20Askew%20Sothern">Edward Askew Sothern</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Jefferson">Joseph Jefferson</a>. Edwards showed letters he had received from a wide array of notables such as writers <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>, <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="Anthony%20Trollope">Anthony Trollope</a> and naturalists <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> and <a href="John%20Lubbock%2C%201st%20Baron%20Avebury">John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury</a>. One floor of the residence was seen to be wholly devoted to the entomologist's collection of specimens, which Edwards said was insured for $17,000, $ in current value. Surrounded by his exotic possessions and "in the most perfect congeniality with his wife", Edwards was reported to be the host of a "cultivated home".

Two years after <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, completed his "<a href="Idylls%20of%20the%20King">Idylls of the King</a>", a poetic telling of the <a href="King%20Arthur">King Arthur</a> legend, Edwards and <a href="George%20Parsons%20Lathrop">George Parsons Lathrop</a> adapted it to the stage as a drama in four acts. The result was "Elaine", a story of young love between <a href="Elaine%20of%20Astolat">Elaine of Astolat</a> and <a href="Lancelot">Lancelot</a>, fashioned with "flower-like fragility" and "winning touches of tenderness". Its first public presentation was a staged "author's reading" at Madison Square Theatre on 28 April 1887, at which Edwards played the part of Elaine's father, Lord Astolat. Months later it was presented by the company of A. M. Palmer, without Edwards in the cast, opening on 6 December 1887, at the same venue. The production proved both popular and profitable for Lathrop and Edwards. <a href="Annie%20Russell">Annie Russell</a>'s Elaine was admired for her "sweet simplicity and pathos which captured nearly every heart". After a successful six-week New York run, Palmer took "Elaine" on the road.

Actors associated with Wallack's Theatre announced to the public that beginning in February 1888 a final series of old comedies would be revived, after which the company would be disbanded. Edwards served as <a href="stage%20manager">stage manager</a> for the run, and reprised several of his earlier roles including those of Max Harkaway in "London Assurance" and Colonel Rockett in "Old Heads and Young Hearts". Taking part once again in "The School for Scandal", the sixth and final play of the nostalgic series, Edwards received high praise for his depiction of a wealthy Englishman recently returned from India: "there is probably no better Sir Oliver on our stage than Mr. Edwards." "Justly esteemed" in the role, he was called a "sterling player", representative "of a school which is fast disappearing".

A testimonial production of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" was mounted at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera%20House%20%2839th%20St%29">Metropolitan Opera House</a> on 21 May 1888, to celebrate the life and accomplishments of an ageing Lester Wallack, and to raise money to ease the chronic <a href="sciatica">sciatica</a> that arrested his career. "One of the greatest casts ever assembled" was formed into a company composed of Edwards as the priest, <a href="Edwin%20Booth">Edwin Booth</a> as Hamlet, <a href="Lawrence%20Barrett">Lawrence Barrett</a> as the ghost, <a href="Frank%20M.%20Mayo">Frank Mayo</a> as the king, John Gibbs Gilbert as Polonius, Rose Coghlan as the player queen and <a href="Helena%20Modjeska">Helena Modjeska</a> as Ophelia. Other stars made <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>s, and Wallack was assisted up onto the stage to address the <a href="Standing-room%20only">standing room</a> crowd at intermission. Notables such as Mayor <a href="Abram%20Stevens%20Hewitt">Hewitt</a> and General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">Sherman</a> were in attendance. More than $10,000 was raised for Wallack's care. In the following months, Edwards teamed with other actors and Wallack's wife to help him write his memoir; Wallack died in September.

The next year, Edwards published a significant treatise entitled "Bibliographic Catalogue of the Described Transformation of North American Lepidoptera". In response to an invitation and after arranging a business contract, he travelled back to Australia to accept a position as stage manager of a theatrical company in Melbourne. Frustrated with the experience, Edwards sailed back to New York the next year with the intention of returning to acting, but poor health kept him from full enjoyment of the <a href="limelight">limelight</a>. In March, Edwards appeared as Holofernes in "<a href="Love%27s%20Labour%27s%20Lost">Love's Labour's Lost</a>" at <a href="Augustin%20Daly">Augustin Daly</a>'s Daly Theatre, but was often short of breath and unable to keep pace with the run—his part was given to a young <a href="Tyrone%20Power%2C%20Sr.">Tyrone Power</a> who also covered Edwards' old role of Sir Oliver Surface for Daly's road show of "The School for Scandal".

To regain his strength, Edwards and his wife took a carriage to a rustic cottage refuge in Arkville in the <a href="Catskill%20Mountains">Catskill Mountains</a> but isolation, plain food and rest yielded little improvement. A physician was called and he informed Mrs. Edwards that there would be no recovery for her husband from the advanced <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a> with complications from chronic <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> so she brought him back to New York City. Edwards died at home at 185 East <a href="116th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">116th Street</a> in <a href="Spanish%20Harlem">East Harlem</a> late on 9 June 1891, just hours after returning.

After his death, Edwards' collection of 300,000 insect specimens, one of the largest in the United States, was bought by his friends for $15,000 for the financial benefit of his widow, and donated to the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> (AMNH) as the cornerstone of their collection. Mrs. Harry Edwards also donated some of his other specimens, including two eggs of the order <a href="Rajiformes">Rajiformes</a>, the true rays. Museum trustees purchased the 500 volumes of entomology texts and 1,200 pamphlets owned by Edwards to form the "Harry Edwards Entomological Library", one of the handful of important book acquisitions made by the AMNH to expand their library in its early years. <a href="William%20Schaus">William Schaus</a>, a student that Edwards guided and encouraged, but never met in person, went on to further define moth and butterfly characteristics in a large body of published work.

The "Hy. Edw." designation appended to some butterfly species names indicates first description by Henry Edwards. This is not to be confused with the "Edw." designation which stands for <a href="William%20Henry%20Edwards">William Henry Edwards</a>, an unrelated contemporary and correspondent of Edwards'. At least two specimens were designated "Mrs. Hy. Edwards." because they were collected and identified by his wife. Edwards named many butterflies in the families <a href="Theclinae">Theclinae</a>, <a href="Nymphalidae">Nymphalidae</a>, Papilionidae and <a href="Lycaenidae">Lycaenidae</a>, but his largest contribution was in the description of moth species in North America including Mexico: <a href="Arctiidae">Arctiidae</a>, <a href="Bombycidae">Bombycidae</a>, <a href="Hepialidae">Hepialidae</a>, <a href="Sesiidae">Sesiidae</a>, <a href="Noctuidae">Noctuidae</a>, <a href="Sphingidae">Sphingidae</a>, <a href="Lasiocampidae">Lasiocampidae</a>, <a href="Dalceridae">Dalceridae</a>, <a href="Dysderidae">Dysderidae</a>, <a href="Geometer%20moth">Geometridae</a>, <a href="Pyralidae">Pyralidae</a>, <a href="Saturniidae">Saturniidae</a>, <a href="Thyatirinae">Thyatiridae</a>, <a href="Urodidae">Urodidae</a> and <a href="Zygaenidae">Zygaenidae</a>. In choosing names, Edwards favoured female characters from the plays of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, such as <a href="Ophelia%20%28character%29">Ophelia</a> from "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", <a href="Hermia">Hermia</a> from "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>", and <a href="Desdemona%20%28Othello%29">Desdemona</a> from "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>". For example, Edwards collected, classified and named the moth species "<a href="Catocala%20ophelia">Catocala ophelia</a>" and "<a href="Catocala%20hermia">Catocala hermia</a>" in 1880, and "<a href="Catocala%20desdemona">Catocala desdemona</a>" in 1882.
The birth date that Edwards gave as his own varied depending on the time and place he was asked. Parish records show he was christened in England on 14 September 1827, and corroborating this date he gave his age as 25 in June 1853 when he first arrived in Australia. However, when questioned in San Francisco for the <a href="1870%20United%20States%20Census">1870 United States Census</a>, he gave his birth year as 1830. <a href="1880%20United%20States%20Census">Ten years later</a> in Boston, he reported his age as 45, implying a birth year of 1835, but he returned to supplying the year 1830 along with the date 27 August for the brief biographical sketches used by theatre and entomological publications. Two years before he died, he told a reporter from the "Lorgnette" that he was born in 1832. A prominent obituary in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that his family gave his birthday as 23 September 1830, but that some published lists of actors' ages, "not always trustworthy", put his birth year at 1824.

The Left Hand of Darkness

The Left Hand of Darkness is a science fiction novel by U.S. writer <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, published in <a href="1969%20in%20literature">1969</a>. The novel became immensely popular and established Le Guin's status as a major author of science fiction. The novel is part of the "<a href="Hainish%20Cycle">Hainish Cycle</a>", a series of novels and short stories by Le Guin set in the fictional Hainish universe, which she introduced in 1964 with "<a href="The%20Dowry%20of%20the%20Angyar">The Dowry of the Angyar</a>". Among the Hainish novels, it was preceded in the sequence of writing by "<a href="City%20of%20Illusions">City of Illusions</a>" and followed by "<a href="The%20Word%20for%20World%20Is%20Forest">The Word for World Is Forest</a>".

The novel follows the story of Genly Ai, a native of <a href="Earth">Terra</a>, who is sent to the planet of <a href="Gethen">Gethen</a> as an envoy of the Ekumen, a loose confederation of planets. Ai's mission is to persuade the nations of Gethen to join the Ekumen, but he is stymied by his lack of understanding of Gethenian culture. Individuals on Gethen are <a href="bisexuality">ambisexual</a>, with no fixed sex. This fact has a strong influence on the culture of the planet, and creates a barrier of understanding for Ai. 

"The Left Hand of Darkness" was among the first books in the genre now known as <a href="feminist%20science%20fiction">feminist science fiction</a> and is the most famous examination of <a href="androgyny">androgyny</a> in science fiction. A major theme of the novel is the effect of sex and gender on culture and society, explored in particular through the relationship between Ai and Estraven, a Gethenian politician who trusts and helps him. Within that context, the novel also explores the interaction between the unfolding loyalties of its main characters, the loneliness and rootlessness of Ai, and the contrast between the religions of Gethen's two major nations. The theme of gender also touched off a feminist debate when it was first published, over depictions of the ambisexual Gethenians.

"The Left Hand of Darkness" has been reprinted more than 30 times, and received a highly positive response from reviewers. It was voted the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo</a> and <a href="Nebula%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Nebula Awards</a> for Best Novel by fans and writers, respectively, and was ranked third behind <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>'s "<a href="Dune%20%28novel%29">Dune</a>" and <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "<a href="Childhood%27s%20End">Childhood's End</a>" in a 1975 poll in <a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">"Locus"</a> magazine. In 1987, "Locus" ranked it second among science fiction novels after "Dune" and <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> stated: "Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time".

Le Guin's father <a href="Alfred%20Louis%20Kroeber">Alfred Louis Kroeber</a> was an <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a>, and the experience that this gave Le Guin influenced all of her works. The protagonists of many of Le Guin's novels, such as "The Left Hand of Darkness" and "<a href="Rocannon%27s%20World">Rocannon's World</a>", are also anthropologists or social investigators of some kind. Le Guin used the term "Ekumen" for her fictional alliance of worlds, a term coined by her father, who derived it from the Greek "Oikoumene" to refer to Eurasian cultures that shared a common origin.

Le Guin's interest in <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> influenced much of her science fiction work. According to Douglas Barbour, the fiction of the Hainish universe (the setting for several of Le Guin's works) contain a theme of balance between light and darkness, a central theme of Taoism. She was also influenced by her early interest in mythology, and her exposure to cultural diversity as a child. Her protagonists are frequently interested in the cultures they are investigating, and are motivated to preserve them rather than conquer them. Authors who influenced Le Guin include <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, <a href="Italo%20Calvino">Italo Calvino</a>, and <a href="Lao%20Tzu">Lao Tzu</a>.

Le Guin identified with <a href="feminism">feminism</a>, and was interested in <a href="non-violence">non-violence</a> and ecological awareness. She participated in demonstrations against the <a href="Opposition%20to%20United%20States%20involvement%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> and <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">nuclear weapons</a>. These sympathies can be seen in several of her works of fiction, including those in the Hainish universe. The novels of the Hainish cycle frequently explore the effects of differing social and political systems, although according to Suzanne Reid, she displayed a preference for a "society that governs by consensus, a communal cooperation without external government". Her fiction also frequently challenges accepted depictions of race and gender.

The original 1969 edition of "The Left Hand of Darkness" did not contain an introduction. After reflecting on her work, Le Guin wrote in the 1976 edition that the genre of science fiction was not as "rationalist and simplistic" as simple extrapolation. Instead, she called it a "thought experiment" which presupposes some changes to the world, and probes their consequences. The purpose of the <a href="thought%20experiment">thought experiment</a> is not to predict the future, but to "describe reality, the present world". In this case, her thought experiment explores a society without men or women, where individuals share the biological and emotional makeup of both sexes. Le Guin has also said that the genre in general allows exploration of the "real" world through metaphors and complex stories, and that science fiction can use imaginary situations to comment on human behaviors and relationships.

In her new introduction to the <a href="Library%20of%20America">Library of America</a> reprint in 2017, the author wrote:
"The Left Hand of Darkness" is set in the fictional <a href="Hainish%20cycle">Hainish</a> universe, which Le Guin introduced in her first novel "<a href="Rocannon%27s%20World">Rocannon's World</a>", published in 1966. In this fictional history, human beings did not evolve on Earth, but on <a href="Planets%20of%20the%20Hainish%20Cycle%23Hain">Hain</a>. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including <a href="Planets%20of%20the%20Hainish%20Cycle%23Terra">Terra</a> (Earth) and <a href="Gethen">Gethen</a>, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. Some of the groups that "seeded" each planet were the subjects of genetic experiments, including on Gethen. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece it together from various works.

The novels and other fictional works set in the Hainish universe recount the efforts to re-establish a galactic civilization. Explorers from Hain as well as other planets use <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar ships</a> traveling nearly as fast as light. These take years to travel between planetary systems, although the journey is shortened for the travelers due to relativistic <a href="time%20dilation">time dilation</a>, as well as through instantaneous interstellar communication using the <a href="ansible">ansible</a>, introduced in "The Dispossessed". This galactic civilization is known as the "League of All Worlds" in works set earlier in the chronology of the series, and has been reconstructed as the "Ekumen" by the time the events in "The Left Hand of Darkness" take place. During the events of the novel, the Ekumen is a union of 83 worlds, with some common laws. At least two "thought experiments" are used in each novel. The first is the idea that all humanoid species had a common origin; they are all depicted as descendants of the original Hainish colonizers. The second idea is unique to each novel.

"The Left Hand of Darkness" takes place many centuries in the future—no date is given in the book itself. Reviewers have suggested the year 4870 AD, based on extrapolation of events in other works, and commentary on her writing by Le Guin. The protagonist of the novel, the envoy Genly Ai, is on a planet called Winter ("Gethen" in the language of its own people) to convince the citizens to join the Ekumen. Winter is, as its name indicates, a planet that is always cold.

The inhabitants of Gethen are ambisexual humans; for twenty-four days ("somer") of each twenty-six-day lunar cycle, they are sexually latent <a href="androgyne">androgyne</a>s. They only adopt sexual attributes once a month, during a period of sexual receptiveness and high fertility, called "kemmer". During "kemmer" they become sexually male or female, with no predisposition towards either, although which sex they adopt can depend on context and relationships. Throughout the novel Gethenians are described as "he", whatever their role in kemmer. This absence of fixed gender characteristics led Le Guin to portray Gethen as a society without war, and also without sexuality as a continuous factor in social relationships. On Gethen, every individual takes part in the "burden and privilege" of raising children, and rape and seduction are almost absent.

The protagonist of the novel is Genly Ai, a male <a href="Terran%20%28demonym%29">Terran</a> native, who is sent to invite <a href="Gethen">Gethen</a> to join the <a href="Ekumen">Ekumen</a>, the coalition of humanoid worlds. Ai travels to the Gethen system on a ship which remains in solar <a href="orbit">orbit</a> with Ai's companions, who are in <a href="stasis%20%28fiction%29">stasis</a>; Ai himself is sent to Gethen alone, as the "first mobile". Like all envoys of the Ekumen, he can "mindspeak"—a form of quasi-telepathic speech, which Gethenians are capable of, but for which they have lost the ability. He lands in the Gethenian kingdom of Karhide, and spends two years attempting to persuade the members of its government of the value of joining the Ekumen. Karhide is one of two major nations on Gethen, the other being Orgoreyn.

The novel begins the day before an audience that Ai has obtained with Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but the night before the audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate and ambiguous. The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by "shifgrethor", an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it difficult for him to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his distrust of Estraven. The next day, as he prepares to meet the King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of <a href="treason">treason</a>, and exiled from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king, who rejects his invitation to join the Ekumen. Discouraged, Ai decides to travel through Karhide, as the spring has just begun, rendering the interior of the country accessible.

Ai travels to a fastness, a dwelling of people of the Handdarrata, one of two major Gethenian religions. He pays the fastness for a foretelling, an art practiced to prove the "perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the wrong question". He asks if Gethen/Winter will be a member of the Ekumen in five years, expecting that the foretellers will give him an ambiguous response, but he is answered "yes". This leads him to muse that the Gethenians have "trained hunch to run in harness". After several months of travelling through Karhide, Ai decides to pursue his mission in Orgoreyn, to which he has received an invitation.

Ai reaches the Orgota capital of Mishnory, where he finds that the Orgota politicians are initially far more direct with him. He is given comfortable quarters, and is allowed to present his invitation to the council that rules Orgoreyn. Three members of the council, Shusgis, Obsle, and Yegey, are particularly supportive of him. These three are members of an "Open Trade" faction, which wants to end the conflict with Karhide. Estraven, who was banished from Karhide, is found working with these council members, and tells Ai that he was responsible for Ai's invitation to Orgoreyn. Despite the support, Ai feels uneasy; Estraven warns him not to trust the Orgota leaders, and he hears rumors of the "Sarf", or secret police, that truly control Orgoreyn. He ignores both his feeling and the warning, and is once again blindsided; he is arrested unexpectedly one night, interrogated, and sent to a far-northern work camp where he suffers harsh cold, is forced into hard labor, and is given debilitating drugs intended to prevent kemmer. He becomes ill and his death seems imminent. 

His captors expect him to die in the camp, but to Ai's great surprise, Estraven—whom Ai still distrusts—goes to great lengths to save him. Estraven poses as a prison guard and breaks Ai out of the farm, using his training with the Handdarrata to induce "dothe", or hysterical strength, to aid him in the process. Estraven spends the last of his money on supplies, and then steals more, breaking his own moral code. The pair begin a dangerous 80-day trek across the northern Gobrin ice sheet back to Karhide, because Estraven believes that the very appearance of Ai in Karhide will force its acceptance of the Ekumen treaty. Over the journey Ai and Estraven learn to trust and accept one another's differences. Ai is eventually successful in teaching Estraven mindspeech; Estraven hears Ai speaking in his mind with the voice of Estraven's dead sibling and lover Arek, demonstrating the close connection that Ai and Estraven have developed. When they reach Karhide, Ai sends a radio transmission to his ship, which lands a few days later. Estraven tries to return to the land border with Orgoreyn, because he is still exiled from Karhide, but is killed by border guards, who capture Ai. Estraven's prediction is borne out when Ai's presence in Karhide, along with the fallout from Estraven's death, triggers the collapse of governments in both Karhide and Orgoreyn. Soon after, Karhide agrees to join the Ekumen, followed shortly by Orgoreyn, completing Ai's mission.

Genly Ai is the protagonist of the novel; a male native of Terra, or Earth, who is sent to Gethen by the Ekumen as a "first mobile" or envoy. He is called "Genry" by the Karhiders, who have trouble pronouncing the letter "L". He is described as rather taller and darker than the average Gethenian. Although curious and sensitive to Gethenian culture in many ways, he struggles at first to trust the ambisexual Gethenians. His own masculine mannerisms, learned on Terra, also prove to be a barrier to communication. At the beginning of the book, he has been on Gethen for one year, trying to gain an audience with the king, and persuade the Karhidish government to believe his story. He arrives equipped with basic information about the language and culture from a team of investigators who had come before him.

In Karhide, the king is reluctant to accept his diplomatic mission. In Orgoreyn, Ai is seemingly accepted more easily by the political leaders, yet Ai is arrested, stripped of his clothes, drugged, and sent to a work camp. Rescued by Estraven, the deposed Prime Minister of Karhide, Genly realizes that cultural differences—specifically "shifgrethor", gender roles and Gethenian sexuality—had kept him from understanding their relationship previously. During their 80-day journey across the frozen land to return to Karhide, Ai learns to understand and love Estraven.

Therem Harth rem ir Estraven is a Gethenian from the Domain of Estre in Kerm Land, at the southern end of the Karhidish half of the continent. He is the Prime Minister of Karhide at the very beginning of the novel, until he is exiled from Karhide after attempting to settle the Sinnoth Valley dispute with Orgoreyn. Estraven is one of the few Gethenians who believe Ai, and he attempts to help him from the beginning, but Ai's inability to comprehend "shifgrethor" leads to severe misunderstanding between them. Estraven is said to have made a taboo kemmering vow to his brother, Arek Harth rem ir Estraven, while they were both young. Convention required that they separate after they had produced a child together; because of the first vow, the second vow he made with Ashe Foreth, another partner, which was also broken before the events in "Left Hand", is called a "false vow, a second vow". In contrast to Ai, Estraven is shown with both stereotypically masculine and feminine qualities, and is used to demonstrate that both are necessary for survival.

Argaven Harge XV is the king of Karhide during the events of the novel. He is described both by his subjects and by Estraven as being "mad". He has sired seven children, but has yet to bear "an heir of the body, king son". During the novel he becomes pregnant but loses the child before it is born, triggering speculation as to which of his sired children will be named his heir. His behavior towards Ai is consistently paranoid; although he grants Ai an audience, he refuses to believe his story, and declines the offer to join the Ekumen. The tenure of his prime ministers tends to be short, with both Estraven and Tibe rising and falling from power during the two Gethenian years that the novel spans. Argaven eventually agrees to join the Ekumen due to the political fallout of Estraven's death and Ai's escape from Orgoreyn.

Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe is Argaven Harge's cousin. Tibe becomes the prime minister of Karhide when Estraven is exiled at the beginning of the novel, and becomes the regent for a brief while when Argaven is pregnant. In contrast to Estraven, he seems intent on starting a war with Orgoreyn over the Sinnoth Valley dispute; as well as taking aggressive actions at the border, he regularly makes belligerent speeches on the radio. He is strongly opposed to Ai's mission. He orders Estraven to be killed at the border at the end of the novel, as a last act of defiance, knowing that Estraven and Ai's presence in Karhide means his own downfall; he resigns immediately after Estraven's death.

Obsle, Yegey, and Shusgis are Commensals, three of the thirty-three councilmen that rule Orgoreyn. Obsle and Yegey are members of the "Open Trade" faction, who wish to normalize relations with Karhide. Obsle is the commensal of the Sekeve District, and was once the head of the Orgota Naval Trade Commission in Erhenrang, where he became acquainted with Estraven. Estraven describes him as the nearest thing to an honest person among the politicians of Orgoreyn. Yegey is the commensal who first finds Estraven during his exile, and who gives Estraven a job and a place to live in Mishnory. Shusgis is the commensal who hosts Genly Ai after Ai's arrival in Mishnory, and is a member of the opposing faction, which supports the Sarf, the Orgota secret police. Although Obsle and Yegey support Ai's mission, they see him more as a means of increasing their own influence within the council; thus they eventually betray him to the Sarf, in order to save themselves. Their Open Trade faction takes control of the council after Ai's presence in Karhide becomes known at the end of the novel.

"The Left Hand of Darkness" has received highly positive critical responses since its publication. It won both the <a href="Nebula%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Nebula Award</a>, given by the <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Writers%20of%20America">Science Fiction Writers of America</a>, and the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo Award</a>, determined by science fiction fans. In 1987, "<a href="Locus%20%28magazine%29">Locus</a>" ranked it number two among "All-Time Best SF Novels", based on a poll of subscribers. The novel was also a personal milestone for Le Guin, with critics calling it her "first contribution to feminism". It was one of her most popular books for many years after its publication. By 2014, the novel had sold more than a million copies in English.

The book has been widely praised by genre commentators, academic critics, and literary reviewers. Fellow science fiction writer <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a> praised the novel as "a narrative so fully realized, so compellingly told, so masterfully executed". He found the book "a novel written by a magnificent writer, a totally compelling tale of human peril and striving under circumstances in which human love, and a number of other human qualities, can be depicted in a fresh context". <a href="Darko%20Suvin">Darko Suvin</a>, one of the first academics to study science fiction, wrote that "Left Hand" was the "most memorable novel of the year", and Charlotte Spivack regards the book as having established Le Guin's status as a major science-fiction writer. In 1987 Harold Bloom described "The Left Hand of Darkness" as Le Guin's "finest work to date", and argued that critics have generally undervalued it. Bloom followed this up by listing the book in his "<a href="The%20Western%20Canon">The Western Canon</a>" (1994) as one of the books in his conception of artistic works that have been important and influential in Western culture. In Bloom's opinion, "Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time".

Critics have also commented on the broad influence of the book, with writers such as Budrys citing it as an influence upon their own writing. More generally it has been asserted that the work has been widely influential in the science fiction field, with "<a href="The%20Paris%20Review">The Paris Review</a>" claiming that "No single work did more to upend the genre's conventions than "The Left Hand of Darkness"". Donna White, in her study of the critical literature on Le Guin, argued that "Left Hand" was one of the seminal works of science fiction, as important as "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>", by <a href="Mary%20Shelley">Mary Shelley</a>, which is often described as the very first science fiction novel. Suzanne Reid wrote that at the time the novel was written, Le Guin's ideas of androgyny were unique not only to science fiction, but to literature in general.

"Left Hand" has been a focus of literary critique of Le Guin's work, along with her <a href="Earthsea">Earthsea</a> fiction and <a href="utopian%20fiction">utopian fiction</a>. The novel was at the center of a <a href="Feminism">feminist</a> debate when it was published in 1969. <a href="Alexei%20Panshin">Alexei Panshin</a> objected to the use of masculine "he/him/his" <a href="Gender-specific%20and%20gender-neutral%20pronouns">gender pronouns</a> to describe its androgynous characters, and called the novel a "flat failure". Other feminists maintained that the novel did not go far enough in its exploration of gender. Criticism was also directed at the portrayal of androgynous characters in the "masculine" roles of politicians and statesmen but not in family roles. Sarah LeFanu, for example, wrote that Le Guin turned her back on an opportunity for experimentation. She stated that "these male heroes with their crises of identity, caught in the stranglehold of liberal individualism, act as a dead weight at the center of the novel". Le Guin, who identifies as a <a href="feminist">feminist</a>, responded to these criticisms in her essay "Is Gender Necessary?" as well as by switching masculine pronouns for feminine ones in a later reprinting of "<a href="Winter%27s%20King">Winter's King</a>", an unconnected short story set on Gethen. In her responses, Le Guin admitted to failing to depict androgynes in stereotypically feminine roles, but said that she considered and decided against inventing gender-neutral pronouns, because they would mangle the language of the novel.

Le Guin's works set in the Hainish universe explore the idea of human expansion, a theme found in the <a href="future%20history">future history</a> novels of other science-fiction authors such as <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>. The Hainish novels, such as "<a href="The%20Dispossessed">The Dispossessed</a>", "Left Hand", and "<a href="The%20Word%20for%20World%20is%20Forest">The Word for World is Forest</a>," also frequently explore the effects of differing social and political systems. Le Guin believed that contemporary society suffered from a high degree of alienation and division, and her depictions of encounters between races, such as in "The Left Hand of Darkness," sought to explore the possibility of an "improved mode of human relationships", based on "integration and integrity". "The Left Hand of Darkness" explores this theme through the relationship between Genly Ai and Estraven; Ai initially distrusts Estraven, but eventually comes to love and trust him. Le Guin's later Hainish novels also challenge contemporary ideas about gender, ethnic differences, the value of ownership, and human beings' relationship to the natural world.

A prominent theme in the novel is social relations in a society where gender is irrelevant; in Le Guin's words, she "eliminated gender, to find out what was left". In her 1976 essay "Is Gender Necessary?" Le Guin wrote that the theme of gender was only secondary to the novel's primary theme of loyalty and betrayal. Le Guin revisited this essay in 1988, and stated that gender was central to the novel; her earlier essay had described gender as a peripheral theme because of the defensiveness she felt over using masculine pronouns for her characters.

The novel also follows changes in the character of Genly Ai, whose behavior shifts away from the "masculine" and grows more androgynous over the course of the novel. He becomes more patient and caring, and less rigidly rationalist. Ai struggles to form a bond with Estraven through much of the novel, and finally breaks down the barrier between them during their journey on the ice, when he recognizes and accepts Estraven's dual sexuality. Their understanding of each other's sexuality helps them achieve a more trusting relationship. The new intimacy they share is shown when Ai teaches Estraven to mindspeak, and Estraven hears Ai speaking with the voice of Estraven's dead sibling (and lover) Arek.

Feminist theorists criticized the novel for what they saw as a <a href="homophobic">homophobic</a> depiction of the relationship between Estraven and Ai. Both are presented as superficially masculine throughout the novel, but they never physically explore the attraction between them. Estraven's death at the end was seen as giving the message that "death is the price that must be paid for forbidden love". In a 1986 essay, Le Guin acknowledged and apologized for the fact that "Left Hand" had presented <a href="heterosexuality">heterosexuality</a> as the norm on Gethen.

The androgynous nature of the inhabitants of Gethen is used to examine gender relations in human society. On Gethen, the permanently male Genly Ai is an oddity, and is seen as a "pervert" by the natives; according to reviewers, this is Le Guin's way of gently critiquing masculinity. Le Guin also seems to suggest that the absence of gender divisions leads to a society without the constriction of gender roles. The Gethenians are not inclined to go to war, which reviewers have linked to their lack of sexual aggressiveness, derived from their ambisexuality. According to Harold Bloom, "Androgyny is clearly neither a political nor a sexual ideal" in the book, but that "ambisexuality is a more imaginative condition than our bisexuality. ... the Gethenians "know" more than either men or women". Bloom added that this is the major difference between Estraven and Ai, and allows Estraven the freedom to carry out actions that Ai cannot; Estraven "is better able to love, and freed therefore to sacrifice".

The book features two major religions: the Handdara, an informal system reminiscent of <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, and the Yomeshta or Meshe's cult, a close-to-<a href="monotheism">monotheistic</a> religion based on the idea of absolute knowledge of the entirety of time attained in one visionary instant by Meshe, who was originally a Foreteller of the Handdara, when attempting to answer the question: "What is the meaning of life?" The Handdara is the more ancient, and dominant in Karhide, while Yomesh is the official religion in Orgoreyn. The differences between them underlie political distinctions between the countries and cultural distinctions between their inhabitants. Estraven is revealed to be an adept of the Handdara.

Le Guin's interest in Taoism influenced much of her science fiction work. Douglas Barbour said that the fiction of the Hainish Universe contains a theme of balance between light and darkness, a central theme of Taoism. The title "The Left Hand of Darkness" derives from the first line of a lay traditional to the fictional planet of Gethen: 
Suzanne Reid stated that this presentation of light and dark was in strong contrast to many western cultural assumptions, which believe in strongly contrasted opposites. She went on to say that Le Guin's characters have a tendency to adapt to the rhythms of nature rather than trying to conquer them, an attitude which can also be traced to Taoism. The Handdarrata represent the Taoist sense of unity; believers try to find insight by reaching the "untrance", a balance between knowing and unknowing, and focusing and unfocusing.

The Yomesh cult is the official religion of Orgoreyn, and worships light. Critics such as David Lake have found parallels between the Yomesh cult and Christianity, such as the presence of saints and angels, and the use of a dating system based on the death of the prophet. Le Guin portrays the Yomesh religion as influencing the Orgota society, which Lake interprets as a critique of the influence of Christianity upon Western society. In comparison to the religion of Karhide, the Yomesh religion focuses more on enlightenment and positive, obvious statements. The novel suggests that this focus on positives leads to the Orgota being not entirely honest, and that a balance between enlightenment and darkness is necessary for truth.

Loyalty, fidelity, and betrayal are significant themes in the book, explored against the background of both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to view themselves as citizens of the planet.

These conflicts are demonstrated by the varying loyalties of the main characters. Genly Ai tells Argaven after Estraven's death that Estraven served mankind as a whole, just as Ai did. During the border dispute with Orgoreyn, Estraven tries to end the dispute by moving Karhidish farmers out of the disputed territory. Estraven believes that by preventing war he was saving Karhidish lives and being loyal to his country, while King Argaven sees it as a betrayal. At the end of the novel Ai calls his ship down to formalize Gethen's joining the Ekumen, and feels conflicted while doing so because he had promised Estraven that he would clear Estraven's name before calling his ship down. His decision is an example of Le Guin's portrayal of loyalty and betrayal as complementary rather than contradictory, because in joining Gethen with the Ekumen Ai was fulfilling the larger purpose that he shared with Estraven. Donna White wrote that many of Le Guin's novels depict a struggle between personal loyalties and public duties, best exemplified in "The Left Hand of Darkness", where Ai is bound by a personal bond to Estraven, but must subordinate that to his mission for the Ekumen and humanity.

The theme of loyalty and trust is related to the novel's other major theme of gender. Ai has considerable difficulty in completing his mission because of his prejudice against the ambisexual Gethenians and his inability to establish a personal bond with them. Ai's preconceived ideas of how men should behave prevents him from trusting Estraven when the two meet; Ai labels Estraven "womanly" and distrusts him because Estraven exhibits both male and female characteristics. Estraven also faces difficulties communicating with Ai, who does not understand "shifgrethor", the Gethenians' indirect way of giving and receiving advice. A related theme that runs through Le Guin's work is that of being rooted or rootless in society, explored through the experiences of lone individuals on alien planets.

"Shifgrethor" is a fictional concept in the Hainish universe, first introduced in "The Left Hand of Darkness". It is first mentioned by Genly Ai, when he thinks to himself "shifgrethor—prestige, face, place, the pride-relationship, the untranslatable and all-important principle of social authority in Karhide and all civilizations of Gethen". It derives from an old Gethenian word for shadow. George Slusser describes "shifgrethor" as "not rank, but its opposite, the ability to maintain equality in any relationship, and to do so by respecting the person of the other". According to <a href="University%20of%20West%20Georgia">University of West Georgia</a> Professor Carrie B. McWhorter, "shifgrethor" can be defined simply as "a sense of honor and respect that provides the Gethenians with a way to save face in a time of crisis".

Ai initially refuses to see a connection between his sexuality and his mode of consciousness, preventing him from truly understanding the Gethenians; thus he is unable to persuade them of the importance of his mission. Ai's failure to comprehend "shifgrethor" and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much of the advice that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.

The novel is framed as part of the report that Ai sends back to the Ekumen after his time on Gethen, and as such, suggests that Ai is selecting and ordering the material. Ai narrates ten chapters in the first person; the rest are made up of extracts from Estraven's personal diary and ethnological reports from an earlier observer from the Ekumen, interspersed with Gethenian myths and legends. The novel begins with the following statement from Ai, explaining the need for multiple voices in the novel:

The myths and legends serve to explain specific features about Gethenian culture, as well as larger philosophical aspects of society. Many of the tales used in the novel immediately precede chapters describing Ai's experience with a similar situation. For instance, a story about the dangers of foretelling is presented before Ai's own experience witnessing a foretelling. Other stories include a discussion of the legend of the "place inside the storm"; another discusses the roots of the Yomeshta cult; a third is an ancient Orgota creation myth; a fourth is a story of one of Estraven's ancestors, which discusses what a traitor is. The presence of myths and legends has also been cited by reviewers who state that Le Guin's work, particularly "Left Hand", is similar to <a href="allegory">allegory</a> in many ways. These include the presence of a guide (Estraven) for the protagonist (Ai), and the use of myths and legends to provide a backdrop for the story.

The heterogeneous structure of the novel has been described as "distinctly post-modern", and was unusual for the time of its publication, in marked contrast to (primarily male-authored) traditional science fiction, which was straightforward and linear. In 1999, literary scholar Donna White wrote that the unorthodox structure of the novel made it initially confusing to reviewers, before it was interpreted as an attempt to follow the trajectory of Ai's changing views. Also in contrast to what was typical for male authors of the period, Le Guin narrated the action in the novel through the personal relationships she depicted.

Ai's first-person narration reflects his slowly developing view, and the reader's knowledge and understanding of the Gethens evolves with Ai's awareness. He begins in <a href="naivety">naivety</a>, gradually discovering his profound errors in judgement. In this sense, the novel can be thought of as a "<a href="Bildungsroman">Bildungsroman</a>", or coming of age story. Since the novel is presented as Ai's journey of transformation, Ai's position as the narrator increases the credibility of the story. The narration is complemented by her writing style, described by a reviewer as "precise, dialectical—always evocative in its restrained pathos" which is "exquisitely fitted to her powers of invention".

In December 2004, Phobos Entertainment acquired media rights to the novel and announced plans for a feature film and video game based on it. In 2013, the Portland Playhouse and <a href="Hand2Mouth%20Theatre">Hand2Mouth Theatre</a> produced a stage adaptation of "The Left Hand of Darkness" in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. On April 12 and 19, 2015, <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> broadcast a two-part adaptation of the novel, starring Kobna Holdbrook-Smith as Genly Ai, <a href="Lesley%20Sharp">Lesley Sharp</a> as Estraven, <a href="Toby%20Jones">Toby Jones</a> as Argaven, <a href="Ruth%20Gemmell">Ruth Gemmell</a> as Ashe, <a href="Louise%20Brealey">Louise Brealey</a> as Tibe and Gaum, <a href="Stephen%20Critchlow">Stephen Critchlow</a> as Shusgis, and David Acton as Obsle. The radio drama was adapted by Judith Adams and directed by Allegra McIlroy. The adaptation was created and aired as part of a thematic month centered on the life and works of Ursula Le Guin, in honor of her 85th birthday. In early 2017, the novel was picked up for production by Critical Content as a television limited series with Le Guin serving as a consulting producer. The first university production of "Left Hand of Darkness" premiered in the University of Oregon's Robinson Theater on November 3, 2017 with a script adapted by John Schmor. Many works of the transgender artist <a href="Tuesday%20Smillie">Tuesday Smillie</a> exhibited at the <a href="Rose%20Art%20Museum">Rose Art Museum</a> take inspiration from the book.

Geastrum triplex

Geastrum triplex is an inedible <a href="fungus">fungus</a> which is found in the <a href="detritus">detritus</a> and leaf litter of <a href="hardwood%20forest">hardwood forest</a>s in many parts of the world. It is commonly known as the collared earthstar, the saucered earthstar, or the triple earthstar—and less commonly by the alternative species name "Geastrum indicum". It is the largest member of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Geastrum" (or <a href="Geastrum">earthstar fungi</a>) and expanded mature specimens can reach a tip-to-tip length of up to .

Immature <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are spherical—somewhat resembling <a href="puffball">puffball</a>s with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely buried in the ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exo<a href="peridium">peridium</a>) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner <a href="spore">spore</a> sac. The spore sac contains the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, a mass of spores and fertile <a href="Mycelium">mycelial</a> tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits around the perimeter of the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the <a href="peristome">peristome</a>, which has a small hole from which <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> may be released.

The species is widespread and can be found in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and both North and South America. The fungus has a history of use in the <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>s of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">native North America</a> and China. Fruit bodies have been <a href="analytical%20chemistry">analyzed chemically</a> to determine their <a href="lipid">lipid</a> content, and various chemical <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivatives</a> of the fungal sterol <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> have been identified.

The species was first described scientifically, by German botanist <a href="Franz%20Wilhelm%20Junghuhn">Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn</a>, as "Geaster triplex" in 1840. The earlier genus name "Geaster", introduced by Italian botanist <a href="Pier%20Antonio%20Micheli">Pier Antonio Micheli</a> in 1727 in "Nova Plantarum Genera", is considered an <a href="orthographical%20variant">orthographical variant</a> of "Geastrum". Junghuhn, who was living in Indonesia and extensively surveyed its fungal flora, discovered the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> on <a href="Mount%20Gede">Mount Panggerangi</a> on the island <a href="Java">Java</a>, at an elevation between . Today, the type specimen is kept at the <a href="National%20Herbarium%20of%20the%20Netherlands">National Herbarium of the Netherlands</a> in <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a>. The <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> feature used by Junghuhn to differentiate "G. triplex" from other similar earthstars was the collar-like structure of the inner layer of the exo<a href="peridium">peridium</a>. American mycologist <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> would later erroneously suggest that the species was a "giant form" of "<a href="Geastrum%20saccatum">Geastrum saccatum</a>".

Several authors have regarded "Geastrum indicum" as the correct name for "G. triplex". This is because "G. indicum"—a species described by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Klotzsch">Johann Friedrich Klotzsch</a> in 1832 as "Cycloderma indicum" and then moved to Geastrum by <a href="Stephan%20Rauschert">Stephan Rauschert</a> in 1959—may be the same species as "Geastrum triplex". If it is in fact the same species, the first published name (i.e., "G. indicum") has <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">nomenclatorial</a> priority according to the rules of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a>. More recently, several authors argue that "G. indicum" should be rejected as a "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>" and "G. triplex" maintained as the correct name for the species.

Stellan Sunhede's 1989 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of European species of "Geastrum" follows V. J. Staněk's concept for the infrageneric (below the level of genus) placement of "Geastrum", and places "G. triplex" with species that do not incorporate and encrust forest debris (<a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> Basimyceliata). "G. triplex" is further categorized in subsection Laevistomata, which includes species with a fibrillose peristome—that is, made of parallel, thin, thread-like filaments. Within subsection Laevistomata it is in <a href="wikt%3Astirp">stirps</a> Triplex, due to its <a href="wikt%3Adelimited">delimited</a> (with a distinct restricting edge) or irregularly torn peristome.

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "triplex" means "threefold", and refers to the three-layered <a href="peridium">peridium</a>. "Geastrum triplex" has acquired several <a href="common%20name">vernacular names</a>, including the collared earthstar, the saucered earthstar, and the triple earthstar.

Like all <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s, the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> of "Geastrum triplex" is the visible part of a larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of nearly invisible fungal threads called <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a>, which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The fruit body—created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal—is designed to produce and disseminate <a href="spore">spore</a>s. "Geastrum triplex" has the largest fruit body of the <a href="Geastrum">earthstar</a> mushrooms. The immature fruit body is typically in diameter, and up to broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5 cm) after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the <a href="ostiole">ostiole</a>, covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a>) grayish brown to "wood brown" when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a <a href="sporangium%23Internal%20structures">columella</a> not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited.

The exoperidium's rays are long and up to 4 mm (3/16 in) thick. The outer surface of the rays (the lower surface, after expansion) and unopened specimens have a rough texture. In several "Geastrum" species, dirt and debris adhere to the underside, this is not the case in "G. triplex". The inner fleshy layers (upper surface) of these rays are near "wood brown" in color when dried, and have a layer of surface tissue that cracks into patches. There is a great deal of variation, however, to the extent in which the upper surface tissue of the rays crack: this tissue layer may also remain closely attached as a sheet over the unsegmented part of the outer wall with the part adhering to the rays variously cracked and sometimes finally peeling off in places.

In "G. triplex", the bases of the rays usually break around the perimeter of the endoperidium to form a saucerlike platform or receptacle in which the endoperidium rests. However, not all specimens form this receptacle, leading to possible confusion with other "Geastrum" species. <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> claimed that in tropical regions, with an abundance of high temperatures and humidity, the fungus expands rapidly, which is more conducive to the fleshy layer breaking away to form a receptacle; in more <a href="temperate">temperate</a> areas this effect would not be as pronounced and "usually does not occur at all".

The endoperidium is in diameter by high, sessile, and a dull grayish brown. The peristome is made of radially arranged fibrils that clump together at the apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn. The circular area bordering the peristome is a paler color. Spores are thought to be dispersed by the wind sucking them out when it blows over the hole, or when falling raindrops hit the flexible endoperidium, creating a puff of air that forces the spores through the ostiole.

The spore sac contains the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, which is composed of a pseudocolumella, unbranched threads (the <a href="capillitia">capillitium</a>), the spore-bearing cells (<a href="basidia">basidia</a>) and the <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> themselves; all of these microscopic elements have certain characteristic features that help distinguish "G. triplex" from other superficially similar earthstars.

The spores are spherical, and 3.5–4.5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a> in diameter. They are covered with short narrow abruptly terminating projections of a translucent (<a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>) substance, which turn a pale cinnamon brown in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, and a dark dull brown (nearly <a href="sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a>) when stained with <a href="iodine">iodine</a>. The capillitium is made of what appears to be encrusted cylindrical filaments 3–6 µm in diameter, of a color varying from hyaline to dull yellowish brown in <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, and yellowish in <a href="iodine">iodine</a>; its walls are thickened to the point where the interior (<a href="Lumen%20%28anatomy%29">lumen</a>) appears as only a line. Either two or four spores are attached to the basidia, and the <a href="sterigmata">sterigmata</a> (extensions of the basidia that attach the spores) are long, up to 20 µm. "Geastrum triplex" does not have <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>.

"Geastrum triplex" may be confused with "<a href="Geastrum%20saccatum">G. saccatum</a>" or "<a href="Geastrum%20fimbriatum">G. fimbriatum</a>", as the rays do not always crack around the perimeter to form a bowl under the spore case. However, it is larger than either of these species. The combination of characteristics which distinguish "G. triplex" from other earthstars include the lack of debris adhering to the outer surfaces, the saucer-like base in which the spore case is seated, the relatively large size, the fibrillose peristome and the paler area surrounding the peristome separating it from the rest of the endoperidium. Unlike some other "Geastrum" species, the rays of "G. triplex" are not <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a>: they do not open and close in response to changes in humidity.

"Geastrum triplex" is a <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a> fungus: it derives nutrients from decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in <a href="hardwood%20forest">hardwood forest</a>s where much <a href="humus">humus</a> has accumulated; in Mexico, they have been collected in <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20moist%20broadleaf%20forests">tropical deciduous forest</a>. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose <a href="forest%20floor">duff</a>, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for "G. triplex" to grow on soil made <a href="calcium">calcium</a>-rich from washed-out <a href="chalk">chalk</a> of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under <a href="beech">beech</a> trees.

"Geastrum triplex" has a widespread distribution, and has been collected in Asia (China, Korea Iran, and Turkey), Australia, Europe (Belgium, Czech Republic, Sweden, and the Canary Islands), and Africa (Congo, South Africa). In North America, its range extends north to Canada and south to Mexico, including the whole <a href="continental%20United%20States">continental United States</a> and Hawaii. In Central and South America the fungus has been reported from Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.

Although the fruit bodies of "Geastrum triplex" are nonpoisonous, they are tough and fibrous, and of "no alimentary interest". Mycologist <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> says that they are reputed to be <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> when immature—when the gleba is still white and firm—but adds that they are rarely found in this form.

Earthstars were used medicinally by Native American Indians. The <a href="Blackfoot">Blackfoot</a> called them "ka-ka-toos", meaning "fallen stars", and according to legend, they were an indication of supernatural events. The <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> put fruit bodies on the navels of babies after childbirth until the withered umbilical cord fell off, "both as a prophylactic and a therapeutic measure". In <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a>, "G. triplex" is used to reduce <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> in the respiratory tract, and to staunch bleeding and reduce swelling.

The fruit bodies of "Geastrum triplex" have been <a href="analytical%20chemistry">chemically analyzed</a> and shown to contain a number of <a href="Bioactive%20compound">bioactive</a> compounds, including fungal <a href="sterol">sterol</a>s such as ergosta-4,6,8,(14),22-tetraen-3-one,5,6-dihydroergosterol, <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a>, and peroxyergosterol. The fungus also contains various <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s, notably <a href="myristic%20acid">myristic</a>, <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic</a>, <a href="stearic%20acid">stearic</a>, <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic</a>, <a href="alpha-linolenic%20acid">alpha-linolenic</a>, and <a href="linoeic%20acid">linoeic</a> acid.

Johann von Klenau

Johann von Klenau (13 April 1758 – 6 October 1819), also called Johann Josef Cajetan von Klenau und Janowitz, was a field marshal in the <a href="Hapsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> army. Klenau, the son of a <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>n noble, joined the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">Habsburg</a> military as a teenager and fought in the <a href="War%20of%20Bavarian%20Succession">War of Bavarian Succession</a> against <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, Austria's <a href="Austro%E2%80%93Turkish%20War%20%281787%E2%80%931791%29">wars</a> with the Ottoman Empire, the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>, and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, in which he commanded a corps in several important battles.

In the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars, Klenau distinguished himself at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Wissembourg%20%281793%29">Wissembourg lines</a>, and led a battle-winning charge at <a href="Heidelberg%23City%20districts">Handschuhsheim</a> in 1795. As commander of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">Coalition's</a> left flank in the <a href="Adige">Adige</a> campaign in northern Italy in 1799, he was instrumental in isolating the French-held fortresses on the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a> by organizing and supporting a peasant uprising in the countryside. Afterward, Klenau became the youngest <a href="Lieutenant%20Field%20Marshal">lieutenant field marshal</a> in the history of the Habsburg military.

As a corps commander, Klenau led key elements of the Austrian army in its victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Aspern-Essling">Aspern-Esslingen</a> and its defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Wagram</a>, where his troops covered the retreat of the main Austrian force. He commanded the IV Corps at the 1813 <a href="Battle%20of%20Dresden">Battle of Dresden</a> and again at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nations">Battle of Nations</a> at <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, where he prevented the French from outflanking the main Austrian force on the first day of the engagement. After the Battle of Nations, Klenau organized and implemented the successful Dresden blockade and negotiated the French capitulation there. In the 1814–15 campaign, he commanded the "Corps Klenau" of the <a href="Austrian%20Army%20of%20Italy">Army of Italy</a>. After the war in 1815, Klenau was appointed commanding general in <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> and <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. He died in 1819.

Johann von Klenau was born into an old Bohemian nobile family at <a href="Ben%C3%A1tky%20nad%20Jizerou">Benatek Castle</a> in the Austrian province of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> on 13 April 1758. The family of Klenau dates to the fifteenth century, and the family of Janowitz to the fourteenth. The family name of Klenau regularly appears in records after the sixteenth century. The Klenau family was one of the oldest dynasties in Bohemia, and many of the noble families of Bohemia have sprung from marriages into the Klenau line. The original name of the family was Przibik, with the predicate "von Klenowa". The family was raised to the baronetcy in 1623 with the certificate granted to one Johann von Klenowa and, in 1629, to his son, Wilhelm. The Imperial councilor and judge in Regensburg, Wilhelm von Klenau, was raised to <a href="comital">comital</a> status in 1630, and to the status of "Reichsgraf", or imperial count, in 1633.

Johann Klenau entered the 47th Infantry Regiment "Ellrichshausen" in 1774, at the age of 17, and became a <a href="Leutnant">second lieutenant</a> in 1775. After transferring to a <a href="Light%20cavalry">"Chevauleger"</a> regiment as a "<a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a>", or captain of cavalry, Klenau fought in the short <a href="War%20of%20the%20Bavarian%20Succession">War of the Bavarian Succession</a>, also known as the Potato War. Most of this conflict occurred in Bohemia (part of the modern <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>) from 1778 to 1779, between the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a>, <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. The war had no battles, but was instead a series of skirmishes and raids, making it the ideal situation for a captain of light cavalry. In their raids, forces from both sides sought to confiscate or destroy the other's provisions, fodder, and materiel.

In the <a href="Austro%E2%80%93Turkish%20War%20%281787%E2%80%931791%29">Austro–Turkish War (1787–1791)</a>, one of the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">House of Habsburg</a>'s many 18th-century wars with the Ottoman Empire, Klenau served in the 26th <a href="Dragoon">Dragoon</a> Regiment "Toscana", and later transferred to the 1st Dragoon Regiment "Kaiser". His regiment repulsed an attack of superior numbers of Ottoman forces on 28 September 1788, at <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>, near Belgrade, for which he received a personal commendation and earned his promotion to <a href="major">major</a>. In his early military career Klenau demonstrated, not only at Zemun but also in the earlier skirmishing and raids of 1778 and 1779, the attributes required of a successful cavalry officer: the military acumen to evaluate a situation, the flexibility to adjust his plans on a moment's notice, and the personal courage to take the same risks he demanded of his men.

Initially, the rulers of Europe considered the 1789 <a href="French%20Revolution">revolution</a> in France as an affair between the French king and his subjects, and not a matter in which they should interfere. However, as the rhetoric grew more strident after 1790, the European monarchs began to view the French upheavals with alarm. Among the concerned monarchs were the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold II</a>, who feared for the life and well-being of his sister, the Queen of France, <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>. In August 1791, in consultation with French "<a href="%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">émigré</a>" nobles and <a href="Frederick%20William%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William II</a> of Prussia, he issued the <a href="Declaration%20of%20Pillnitz">Declaration of Pillnitz</a>, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of <a href="Louis%20XVI%20of%20France">Louis XVI</a> and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.

The French Republican position became increasingly difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French "émigrés" agitated for support of a counter-revolution. From their base in <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>, adjacent to the French–German border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the <a href="French%20National%20Convention">French National Convention</a> declared war on Austria and its allies. In this <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her. Portugal and the Ottoman Empire also joined the alliance against France.

On 12 February 1793, Klenau received his promotion to <a href="Oberstleutnant">lieutenant colonel</a> in a <a href="Uhlan">Lancer</a> regiment, and joined the Austrian force in the Rhineland, serving under General of Cavalry Count <a href="Dagobert%20Sigmund%20von%20Wurmser">Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser</a>. He was captured later in the spring near the town of <a href="Offenbach%20am%20Main">Offenbach</a>, but was freed unexpectedly by two Austrian Hussars from the 17th Regiment "Archduke Alexander Leopold", who came upon him and his captors. At the first <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Wissembourg%20%281793%29">Battle of Wissembourg</a>, Klenau commanded a brigade in <a href="Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Hotze">Friedrich, Baron von Hotze's</a> 3rd Column on 13 October 1793, during which the Habsburg force stormed the earthen ramparts held by the French.

By the terms of the <a href="Peace%20of%20Basel">Peace of Basel</a> (22 July 1795), the Prussian army was to leave the <a href="Rhine%20river">Rhine</a> and <a href="Main%20river">Main</a> river valleys; as it did so, the French quickly overran these territories. On 20 September, the fortress at <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> surrendered to the French without firing a shot. Mannheim had been garrisoned by a Bavarian commander, Lieutenant General Baron von Belderbusch, and several battalions of Bavarian grenadiers, fusiliers, and guard regiments, plus six companies of artillery. A small Austrian force augmented the Bavarian contingent. At the same time, further north, the fortified town of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, also garrisoned by Bavarians, capitulated to the French. With these capitulations, the French controlled the Rhine crossings at Düsseldorf and at the junction of the Rhine and the Main rivers. To maintain contact with the forces on their flanks, the Austrian commanders, outraged at this "<a href="wikt%3Afait%20accompli">fait accompli</a>", had to withdraw across the Main river.

The nearby city of <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>, further south of the Main on the <a href="Neckar">Neckar</a> River, appeared to be the next French target. Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Peter%20Quasdanovich">Peter Quasdanovich</a>, who had remained in the region between Mannheim and Heidelberg, used a hastily enhanced <a href="abatis">abatis</a> to establish a defensive line at the sleepy country village of <a href="Heidelberg%23City%20districts">Handschuhsheim</a>, east of the city of Heidelberg. The French force of two divisions—about 12,000 men—outnumbered the 8,000 defenders, and the position seemed untenable.

At Handschuhsheim, Klenau commanded a mounted brigade that included the six squadrons of the 4th Cuirassiers Regiment "Hohenzollern", two squadrons of the 3rd Dragoon Regiment "Kaiser", six squadrons of the 44th Hussar regiment "Szeckler", and four squadrons of the French "<a href="Army%20of%20Cond%C3%A9">émigré</a>" regiment "Allemand". On 24 September 1795, seeing the French, with five battalions and a regiment of Chasseurs overwhelming the troops of General <a href="Adam%20Bajalics%20von%20Bajahaza">Adam Bajalics von Bajahaza</a>, Klenau quickly organized his own brigade into three columns and attacked. In a battle-winning charge, Klenau's brigade (approximately 4,000 men) dispersed the French divisions of <a href="Charles%20Pichegru">Charles Pichegru</a>'s Army of the Upper Rhine, under the command of General of Division <a href="Georges%20Joseph%20Dufour">Georges Joseph Dufour</a>. His cavalry caught Dufour's entire division in the open, dispersed Dufour's six squadrons of Chasseurs, and cut down Dufour's infantry. With a loss of 193 men and 54 horses, the Austrians inflicted over 1,500 French casualties, including 1,000 killed; they also captured eight guns, nine ammunition caissons and their teams, and General Dufour himself. In the action, General of Brigade Dusirat was wounded, as was Dufour before his capture. Additional Austrian losses included 35 men and 58 horses killed, six officers, 144 men and 78 horses wounded, and two men and three horses missing. For his role in this exploit, Klenau was promoted to <a href="Oberst">colonel</a> and awarded the Knight's Cross of the <a href="Military%20Order%20of%20Maria%20Theresa">Military Order of Maria Theresa</a>. At Handschuhsheim, as he had earlier at Zemon, Klenau demonstrated his "higher military calling," establishing himself as an intrepid, tenacious, and quick-thinking field officer.

In 1796, Klenau commanded the advance guard of Peter Quasdanovich's right column in northern Italy. As the column descended from the Alps at the city of <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a>, reconnaissance found the local French garrison unprepared. At midnight, Klenau led two squadrons of the 8th Hussar Regiment "Wurmser" (named for its <a href="Proprietor%20%28Inhaber%29">Colonel-Proprietor</a> Dagobert von Wurmser), a battalion of the 37th Infantry Regiment "De Vins", and one company of the Mahony <a href="J%C3%A4ger%20%28military%29">Jäger</a>. With their approach masked by fog and darkness, the small force surprised the Brescia garrison on the morning of 30 July, capturing not only the 600–700 French soldiers stationed there, but also three officials of the <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a>: <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Jean Lannes</a>, <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20%C3%89tienne%20de%20Kellermann">François Étienne de Kellermann</a>. However, within two days, Klenau's force had to face <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> and 12,000 Frenchmen; his small advance guard was quickly pushed out of Brescia on 1 August. At the subsequent <a href="Battle%20of%20Lonato">Battle of Lonato</a> of 2–3 August 1796, the French forced Quasdanovich's column to withdraw into the mountains. This isolated Quasdanovich's force from Wurmser's main army by <a href="Lake%20Garda">Lake Garda</a>, and freed the French to concentrate on the main force at <a href="Castiglione%20delle%20Stiviere">Castiglione delle Stiviere</a>, further south; Bonaparte's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Castiglione">Battle of Castiglione</a> forced Wurmser across the <a href="Mincio%20River">Mincio River</a>, and allowed the French to return to the <a href="Siege%20of%20Mantua%20%281796-1797%29">siege of Mantua</a>.

By early September, Klenau's force had rejoined Wurmser's column and fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bassano">Battle of Bassano</a> on 8 September. Here, the Austrians were outnumbered almost two to one by the French. As the Austrian army retreated, Bonaparte ordered a pursuit that caused the Austrians to abandon their artillery and baggage. Most of the third battalion of the 59th "Jordis", and the first battalion of the Border Infantry Banat were captured and these units ceased to exist after this battle. The Austrians lost 600 killed and wounded, and 2,000 captured, plus lost 30 guns, eight colors, and 200 <a href="limbers">limbers</a> and ammunition waggons. Klenau was with Wurmser's column again as it fought its way to besieged <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> and he participated in the combat at <a href="La%20Favorita">La Favorita</a> near there on 15 September. This was the second attempt to relieve the fortress; as the Austrians withdrew from the battle, they retreated into Mantua itself, and from 15 September until 2 February 1797, Klenau was trapped in the fortress while the city was besieged. Following the Austrian loss at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rivoli">Battle of Rivoli</a>, north of Mantua, on 14–15 January 1797, when clearly there would be no Austrian relief for Mantua, Klenau negotiated conditions of surrender with French General <a href="Jean-Mathieu-Philibert%20S%C3%A9rurier">Jean Sérurier</a>, although additional evidence suggests that Bonaparte was present and dictated far more generous terms than Klenau expected. When the garrison capitulated in February, Klenau co-signed the document with Wurmser.

Although the Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—had achieved several victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun%20%281792%29">Verdun</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Kaiserslautern">Kaiserslautern</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Neerwinden%20%281793%29">Neerwinden</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Mainz">Mainz</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Amberg">Amberg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>, in Italy the Coalition's achievements were more limited. In northern Italy, despite the presence of the most experienced of the Austrian generals—Dagobert Wurmser—the Austrians could not lift the siege at Mantua, and the efforts of Napoleon in northern <a href="Italian%20campaigns%20of%20the%20French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">Italy</a> pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at <a href="Peace%20of%20Leoben">Leoben</a> on 17 April 1797, which led to the formal peace treaty, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Campo%20Formio">Treaty of Campo Formio</a>, which went into effect on 17 October 1797.

The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details. These were to be convened at a small town in the upper Rhine valley, <a href="Second%20Congress%20of%20Rastatt">Rastatt</a>, close to the French border. The primary combatants of the First Coalition, France and Austria, were highly suspicious of each other's motives, and the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory than originally agreed. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. The Rastatt delegates could not, or would not, orchestrate the transfer of agreed-upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Ferdinand of Naples</a> refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the <a href="Parthenopean%20Republic">Parthenopean Republic</a>. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the <a href="Swiss%20Confederation">Swiss Confederation</a> and the establishment of the <a href="Helvetic%20Republic">Helvetic Republic</a>.

Other factors contributed to the rising tensions. On his way to <a href="Napoleon%27s%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a> in 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the <a href="Malta%23History">Island of Malta</a> and forcibly removed the <a href="Knights%20Hospitaller">Hospitallers</a> from their possessions. This angered <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul, Tsar of Russia</a>, who was the honorary head of the Order. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English actually discussed this possibility.

<a href="Archduke%20Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Teschen">Archduke Charles of Austria</a>, arguably among the best commanders of the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg">House of Habsburg</a> in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, had taken command of the Austrian army in late January. Although Charles was unhappy with the strategy set by his brother, the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Francis II</a>, he had acquiesced to the less ambitious plan to which Francis and his advisers, the <a href="Aulic%20Council">Aulic Council</a>, had agreed: Austria would fight a defensive war and would maintain a continuous defensive line from the southern bank of the Danube, across the Swiss Cantons and into northern Italy. The archduke had stationed himself at <a href="Friedberg%2C%20Bavaria">Friedberg</a> for the winter, east-south-east of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>. His army settled into cantonments in the environs of Augsburg, extending south along the <a href="Lech%20%28river%29">Lech</a> river.

As winter broke in 1799, on 1 March, General <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Jourdan">Jean-Baptiste Jourdan</a> and his army of 25,000, the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Danube">Army of the Danube</a>, crossed the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> at <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a>. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Alexander Suvorov</a>. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, and use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.

The Army of the Danube advanced through the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a> and eventually established a line from <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a> to the south bank of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, centered at the <a href="Free%20imperial%20city">Imperial City</a> of <a href="Pfullendorf">Pfullendorf</a> in Upper <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>. At the same time, the Army of Switzerland, under command of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">André Masséna</a>, pushed toward the <a href="Grison%20Alps">Grisons</a>, intending to cut the Austrian lines of communication and relief at the mountain passes by Luziensteig and Feldkirch. The <a href="Army%20of%20Italy%20%28France%29">Army of Italy</a>, commanded by <a href="Barth%C3%A9lemy%20Louis%20Joseph%20Sch%C3%A9rer">Louis Joseph Schérer</a>, had already advanced into northern Italy, to deal with Ferdinand and the recalcitrant Neapolitans.

At the onset of the 1799 campaign in Italy, Klenau and his 4,500 troops incited and then assisted an uprising of 4,000 or more peasants in the Italian countryside, adjacent to the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a>, and the subsequent general insurgency pinned down the French on the river's east bank. Klenau's troops, especially some of his Italian-speaking officers, incited peasants against French authority, provided arms and suggested military targets of opportunity, and incorporated the Austrian-armed peasants into their military actions.

The <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> fortress had been constructed in the 16th century by <a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a>, built in the style of the <a href="Trace%20italienne">Trace italienne</a>, or a star, and it straddled the southwest corner of the town's fortifications. The fortress offered whoever possessed it a strategic point in the region: it was the lynch-pin of the French defense. In spring 1799, it was commanded by Chef-de-brigade Lapointe with a garrison of close to 2,500. On 15 April, Klenau approached the fortress and requested its capitulation. The commander refused. Klenau blockaded the city, leaving a small group of artillery and troops to continue the siege. For the next three days, Klenau patrolled the countryside, capturing the surrounding strategic points of <a href="Lagoscuro">Lagoscuro</a>, <a href="Borgoforte">Borgoforte</a> and the <a href="Mirandola">Mirandola</a> fortress. The besieged garrison made several sorties from the Saint Paul's Gate, which were repulsed by the insurgent peasants. The French attempted two rescues of the beleaguered fortress: In the first, on 24 April, a force of 400 Modenese was repulsed at Mirandola. In the second, General <a href="Montrichard">Montrichard</a> tried to raise the city blockade by advancing with a force of 4,000. Finally, at the end of the month, a column of <a href="Pierre-Augustin%20Hulin">Pierre-Augustin Hulin</a> reached and resupplied the fortress.

Klenau took possession of the town on 21 May, and garrisoned it with a light battalion. The Jewish residents of Ferrara paid 30,000 <a href="ducat">ducat</a>s to prevent the pillage of the city by Klenau's forces; this was used to pay the wages of Gardani's troops. Although Klenau held the town, the French still possessed the town's fortress. After making the standard request for surrender at 0800, which was refused, Klenau ordered a barrage from his mortars and howitzers. After two <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> caught fire, the commandant was summoned again to surrender; there was some delay, but a flag of truce was sent at 2100, and the capitulation was concluded at 0100 the next day. Upon taking possession of the fortress, Klenau found 75 new artillery pieces, plus ammunition and six months' worth of provisions. The peasant uprisings pinned down the French and, by capturing Ferrara, Klenau helped to isolate the other French-held fortresses from patrols, reconnaissance, and relief and supply forces. This made the fortresses and their garrisons vulnerable to <a href="Alexander%20Suvorov">Suvorov's</a> main force, operating in the <a href="Po%20River">Po River</a> valley. In the course of the summer, Suvorov's forces took a key position on the <a href="Tidone%20River">Tidone River</a> on 17 June 1799, west of <a href="Piacenza">Piacenza</a>, another at the junction of the <a href="Trebbia%20River">Trebbia River</a> and the Po, in northern Italy, on 17–20 June 1799, and the town of <a href="Novi%20Ligure">Novi Ligure</a> on 15 August 1799, southeast of <a href="Alessandria">Alessandria</a> on the <a href="Tanaro%20river">Tanaro river</a>.

In early 1800, Klenau transferred to the "K(aiserlich) und K(oeniglich)" (Imperial and Royal) army of Germany, in <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>, under the command of Feldzeugmeister <a href="P%C3%A1l%20Kray">Paul, Baron von Kray</a>. The 1800 campaign in southwest Germany began on 1 May 1800, at the village of Büsingen, east of Schaffhausen (Switzerland); there a small force of 6,000 men under command of General of Brigade <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Goullus">François Goullus</a> defeated 4,000 men, three battalions of the 7th Infantry Regiment "Schröder", commanded by Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Karl%20Eugen%2C%20Prince%20von%20Lothringen-Lambesc">Karl Eugen, Prince von Lothringen-Lambesc</a>. Following this clash, the impenetrable Württemberg fortress, <a href="Hohentwiel">Hohentwiel</a>, capitulated to the French, in what the Duke of Württemberg considered a scandalous lack of military courage.

After these encounters, the French army moved toward Stockach, less than northwest of Hohentwiel, where they engaged the Austrian force, under Kray, in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Stockach%20%281800%29">Engen and Stockach</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Messkirch">Messkirch</a> against the troops of the French <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Rhine%20%28France%29">Army of the Rhine</a>, under <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Moreau">Jean Victor Moreau</a>. Stockach, at the western tip of <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a>, covered east-west and north-south crossroads; it and near-by Engen, only west, had been the site of a French loss 14 months earlier. In 1800, a different general, Moreau, brought 84,000 troops against Kray's 72,000 men; this concentration of French force pushed the Austrian army eastward. Two days later, at Messkirch northeast of Stockach, Moreau brought 52,000 men, including <a href="Claude%20Lecourbe">Claude Lecourbe</a>'s and <a href="Dominique%20Vandamme">Dominique Vandamme</a>'s divisions, which had experienced the disappointing French loss in 1799, and <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Marie%20Antoine%20Champion%20de%20Nansouty">Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty</a>'s experienced cavalry against Kray's force of 48,000. Although the French lost more men, once again they drove the Austrians from the field.

Despite the Imperial losses at these battles, Klenau's solid field leadership led to his promotion to <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant field marshal</a>. That year he also married the widowed Maria Josephina Somsich de Sard, daughter of Tallian de Viseck. They had one daughter, Maria, born at the end of the year. From 1801 to 1805, during which Austria remained aloof from the ongoing friction between Britain and Napoleon's France, Klenau commanded a division in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, and was named as Colonel and <a href="Inhaber">Inhaber</a> of the 5th Dragoon Regiment.

In a series of conflicts from 1803 to 1815, known as the Napoleonic Wars, the alliances of the powers of Europe formed five coalitions against the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>. Like the wars sparked by the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789, these wars revolutionized the construction, organization, and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented militarization, mainly due to <a href="Lev%C3%A9e%20en%20masse">mass conscription</a>. French power rose quickly, conquering most of Europe, but collapsed rapidly after France's disastrous <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Russia">invasion of Russia</a> in 1812. Napoleon's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813–1814 campaigns, resulting in the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restoration of the Bourbon monarchy</a> in France. Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815, known as the <a href="Hundred%20Days">Hundred Days</a>, his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>, the pursuit of his army and himself, his abdication, and his banishment to the Island of <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a>, concluded the Napoleonic wars.

In the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Third%20Coalition">War of the Third Coalition</a>, 1803–1806, an alliance of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> and its <a href="French%20client%20republic">client states</a>. Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, the outcome of the war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the <a href="Ulm%20Campaign">Ulm campaign</a>, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a> over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition">War of the Fourth Coalition</a> in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.

Upon Austria's entrance into the war in summer 1805, Klenau joined the Habsburg army in southern Germany and became mired in a short campaign that exposed the worst of the Habsburg military organization. Archduke Charles was sick, and had retired to recuperate. <a href="Archduke%20Ferdinand%20Karl%20Joseph%20of%20Austria-Este">Archduke Ferdinand</a>, the brother-in-law of the Emperor Francis, was theoretically in command, but Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement, having neither experience, maturity, nor aptitude. Although Ferdinand retained nominal command, decisions were placed in the hands of <a href="Karl%20Mack%20von%20Leiberich">Karl Mack</a>, who was timid, indecisive, and ill-suited for such an important assignment. Furthermore, Mack had been wounded earlier in the campaign, and was unable to take full charge of the army. Consequently, command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Karl%20Philipp%2C%20Prince%20of%20Schwarzenberg">Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg</a>, an able military officer, but as yet inexperienced in the command of such a large army.

The campaign began in October, with several clashes in <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wertingen">first</a>, near the Bavarian town of <a href="Wertingen">Wertingen</a>, northwest of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, on 8 October, <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Murat</a>'s Cavalry Corps and grenadiers of <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Lannes</a>' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half their size. The Austrians had assembled in line, and the cavalry and grenadiers cut them down before the Austrians could form their <a href="Infantry%20square">defensive squares</a>. Nearly 3,000 were captured. A day later, at <a href="G%C3%BCnzburg">Günzburg</a> immediately south of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, the French again met an Austrian force; General Mack could not decide on a plan, and the French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the Danube, and, in a humiliating episode, chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm. In this action, the French secured an important bridgehead on the Danube River.

With the string of French victories, Lieutenant Field Marshal Klenau provided the only ray of hope in a campaign fraught with losses. At <a href="Ulm-Jungingen">Ulm-Jungingen</a>, Klenau had arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and, on 11 October, an over-confident General of Division <a href="Pierre%20Dupont%20de%20l%27%C3%89tang">Dupon de l'Étang</a> attacked Klenau's force with fewer than 8,000 men. The French lost 1,500 dead and wounded, 900 captured, 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons captured, but possibly of greater significance, the <a href="French%20Imperial%20Eagle">Imperial Eagles</a> and <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">guidons</a> of the 15th and 17th Dragoons were taken by the Austrians.

Despite Klenau's success at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Haslach-Jungingen">Battle of Haslach-Jungingen</a>, the Austrians could not sustain their positions around him, and the entire line retreated toward Ulm. Napoleon's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian weaknesses, particularly of indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus. The Austrians were low on ammunition and outgunned. The components of the army, division by division, were being separated from one another. Morale sank, "sapped by Mack's chaotic orders and their [the troops] growing lack of confidence in their nominal commander," Ferdinand. Following the Austrian capitulation at Memmingen, south of Ulm, the French achieved a morale boost over the Austrians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Elchingen">Battle of Elchingen</a>, outside of <a href="Biberach%20an%20der%20Riss">Biberach</a>, on 14 October. Here, northeast of Ulm, and slightly north of the Danube, Ney's VI Corps (20,000 men) captured half of the Austrian Reserve Artillery park at Thalfingen. In a further blow, Field Marshal <a href="Johann%20Sigismund%20Riesch">Riesch</a> was unable to destroy the Danube bridges, which Ney secured for the French. Ney received the <a href="victory%20title">victory title</a>, Duke of Elchingen.

At this point, the entire Austrian force, including Klenau's column, withdrew into <a href="Battle%20of%20Ulm">Ulm</a> and its environs and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, as he had been at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry. Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged, an agreement to which they held.

The Austrians abstained from the fighting in 1806–1808, and engaged in a military reorganization, directed by Archduke Charles. When they were ready to join the fight against France, in the spring and summer of 1809, it was a remodeled Austrian army that took the field. Despite their internal military reorganization, however, in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fifth%20Coalition">War of the Fifth Coalition</a>, the army retained much of its cumbersome command structure, which complicated the issuance of orders and the timely distribution of troops. When the Austrian army took the field in 1809, it battled for the "survival of the [Habsburg] dynasty," as Archduke Charles, the army's supreme commander, described the situation to his brother John.

On the Danubian plains north of Vienna, the summer battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Aspern-Essling">Aspern-Essling</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Wagram</a> shaped the outcome of the 1809 campaign. Klenau's forces played a critical role at both. At Aspern-Essling, Napoleon's army was decisively defeated for the first time in northern Europe, demonstrating that the master of Europe could himself be mastered. After their defeat at Wagram, the Austrians withdrew into <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>, leaving the French in control of that part of the Danube valley; Wagram was the largest European land-battle to date, engaging 262 battalions and 202 squadrons—153,000 men—for France and her allies, and 160 battalions and 150 squadrons—135,000 men—on the Austrian side.

For Klenau, the campaign started badly at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Eckm%C3%BChl">Battle of Eckmühl</a> (sometimes called Eggmühl), in southeastern Germany on 22 April 1809. Klenau commanded the Advance Guard, which included the 2nd "Archduke Charles" Legion, the Merveldt "Uhlanen" and a cavalry battery. Archduke Charles misread Napoleon's intentions and lost the advantage in the battle. Klenau's division suffered heavily and the "Archduke Charles" Legion was nearly wiped out in a charge by <a href="Louis%20Friant">Louis Friant</a>'s cavalry. Rosenberg's division on Klenau's flank was also badly mauled and suffered heavy casualties: 534 killed, 637 wounded, 865 missing, and 773 captured.

The disaster at Eckmühl was followed by another at <a href="Battle%20of%20Regensburg">Regensburg</a> (also called the Battle of Ratisbon) on 23 April, where Klenau, at the head of six squadrons of Merveldt's Uhlanen (lancers), was crushed and scattered by <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Marie%20Antoine%20Champion%20de%20Nansouty">Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty</a>'s heavy cavalry. Klenau and Major General <a href="Peter%20V%C3%A9csey">Peter Vécsey</a> stormed back at Nansouty's force with the "Klenau" chevauxlegers. Although their onslaught threw back the leading French squadrons, the French heavy cavalry returned, joined by Hussars and "Chasseurs". In the mêlee, it was difficult to distinguish French from Austrian, but eventually the French horse overwhelmed the Austrian flank and pushed them to the gates of Regensburg.

By May 1809, the Austrians were pushed to within visual distance of Vienna, and in a critical engagement on the banks of the Danube river, the French and their allies grappled for control of the <a href="Morava%20%28river%29">Marchfeld plain</a> with the Austrians. The French held <a href="Lobau">Lobau</a> island, a vital river crossing, and the Austrians held the heights further to the east. Between them lay several villages, two of which were central in the engagement and gave the battle its name: They lay so close to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> that the battle could be seen and heard from the city ramparts and <a href="Aspern">Aspern</a> and <a href="Essling">Essling</a> (also spelled in German as Eßling) are today part of the <a href="Donaustadt">Donaustadt</a>, a district of Austrian capital. At the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Klenau commanded a free-standing force of close to 6,000, including a battalion of the 1st "Jäger", three battalions of the 3rd Infantry Regiment "Archduke Charles", eight squadrons each of the "Stipcisc" Hussars and "Schwarzenburg" Uhlans, and a horse artillery battery of 64 guns. Typical confusion in the Austrian command structure meant he received his orders late, and Klenau's delay in deployment meant that his men approached the French III Corps at Essling in daylight and in close order; a two-gun French battery on the plain beyond the Essling, "mowed furrows" of <a href="enfilade">enfilade</a> fire in the Austrian ranks.

Despite the withering fire, Klenau's force reached Essling's edge, where his men set up 64 artillery pieces and bombarded the French for nearly an hour. Taking the village by storm, Austrian cavalry poured into the village from the north, and the French were pushed out in a methodical advance. Klenau's batteries were able to fire on the French-held bridges south of the village, over which the French had to retreat. In bitter house-to-house fighting, the Austrians entered the village. Combat at the granary was especially brutal, as Hungarian grenadiers battled unsuccessfully to dislodge the French from their positions in the second and third floors. The battle resumed at dawn of 22 April. Masséna cleared Aspern of Austrians, but while he did so, Rosenberg's force stormed <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Jean Lannes</a>' position at Essling. Lannes, reinforced by <a href="Louis%20Vincent%20Le%20Blond%20de%20Saint-Hilaire">Vincent Saint-Hilaire</a>'s division, subsequently drove Rosenberg out of Essling. At Aspern, Masséna was driven out by Hiller and Bellegarde's counter-attacks.

Meanwhile, Napoleon had launched an attack on the main army at the Austrian center. Klenau's force stood on the immediate right flank of the center, opposite the attacking force of Lannes. The French cavalry, in reserve, prepared to move at either flank, or to the center, depending on where the Austrian line broke first. The French nearly broke through at the center but, at the last minute, Charles arrived with his last reserve, leading his soldiers with a color in his hand. Lannes was checked, and the impetus of the attack died out all along the line. In the final hours of the battle, Lannes himself was cut down by a cannonball from Klenau's artillery. Aspern was lost to the French. The Danube bridges upon which the French relied had been cut again by heavy barges, which the Austrians had released on the river. When he lost his route across the river, Napoleon at once suspended the attack. For his leadership at Essling, Klenau received the Commander's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa.
Both sides lost close to 28,000 men, to wounds and death. For Napoleon, whose force was smaller, the losses were more costly. For Charles, the victory, which occurred within visual range of the Vienna ramparts, won him support from the hawks, or the pro-war party, in the <a href="Hofburg%20Imperial%20Palace">Hofburg</a>. The Austrian victory at Aspern-Essling proved that Napoleon could be beaten. His force had been divided (Davout's corps had never made it over the Danube), and Napoleon had underestimated the Austrian strength of force and, more importantly, the tenacity the Austrians showed in situations like that of Essling, when Klenau marched his force across open country under enemy fire. After Aspern-Essling, Napoleon revised his opinion of the Austrian soldier.

In the lull between the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wagram">Battle of Wagram</a> (5–6 July) Charles ordered the construction of a several-mile-long entrenchment, but did little else to shore up his force. Conversely, on the other side of the Danube, Napoleon brought in additional troops from Italy and Hungary. The day prior to the battle at Wagram, Klenau replaced General <a href="Johann%20von%20Hiller">Johann von Hiller</a>, who had fallen ill, to command the 13,740 soldiers of VI Corps, and <a href="Armand%20von%20Nordmann">Armand von Nordmann</a> replaced him as commander of the Advance Guard. Klenau's Corps stood about ahead of the main Austrian force. The Corps, about 8,000 men, were ordered to oppose any French advance on the Marchfeld plain. By mid-afternoon, Klenau could see Napoleon's massive force advancing toward them through the cornfields. Klenau managed a spirited, and gradual withdrawal to a position behind the Austrian line at the Russbach, and above the Wagram escarpment; this exposed several of the villages on the western edge of the Marchfield Plain, including Aspern and Essling, to French capture.

On the next day of battle, Klenau was ordered to a forward position, to complete a double-envelopment of Napoleon's force, envisioned by Charles as the best means of inducing panic among the French troops. At dawn, or so, at 0400, his cannonade rained havoc on Boudet's division of Massena's IV Corps; Massena sent another division under <a href="Claude%20Juste%20Alexandre%20Legrand">Claude Legrand</a> to support Boudet. Klenau's corps managed to retake both Essling and Aspern, without the same vigorous contest that had occurred two months earlier. Half the pincer movement was well underway, although Klenau's force could not move further ahead: The guns on the Island of Lobau prevented further advance. There was no support from Kollorat's forces on his flank, and for the closing prong of the pincer movement, Archduke John was no where in sight; he had not abandoned his baggage, and was plodding slowly, with his army, toward the battlefield, but still a good day's march away. Despite the mile-long gap in the French line, and the advance of Austrian cavalry, Klenau's men could not hold them against <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Mass%C3%A9na">André Masséna</a>'s prolonged mid-day assault. Charles watched from his command post at Wagram as Klenau's forces stubbornly clung to their positions, but were overwhelmed by the inexorable progress of Masséna's troops, what Klenau later called "Masséna's Infernal Column". Klenau organized the rear guard for the Army's retreat into <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a>, and lost 15 percent of his force. General <a href="Anne%20Jean%20Marie%20Ren%C3%A9%20Savary">René Savary</a>, who directed part of the French pursuit, wrote that the Klenau's soldiers had "fought in a manner calculated to instill a cautious conduct into any man disposed to deeds of rashness."

As a consequence, Austria withdrew from the Coalition. Although France had not completely defeated them, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Sch%C3%B6nbrunn">Treaty of Schönbrunn</a>, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received <a href="Duchy%20of%20Carinthia">Carinthia</a>, <a href="Carniola">Carniola</a>, and the Adriatic ports, while <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a> was given to France's ally Poland. The <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Salzburg">Salzburg</a> area went to the French ally, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million <a href="franc">franc</a>s, gave recognition to <a href="Joseph%20Bonaparte">Joseph Bonaparte</a> as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's <a href="Continental%20System">Continental System</a>. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, <a href="Marie%20Louise%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Parma">Marie Louise</a>, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria as a future threat.

Napoleon engaged in his disastrous <a href="French%20invasion%20of%20Russia">Russian campaign</a> in 1812; by 1813, the military landscape was dramatically different. Prussia was the first to defect from Napoleon's cause; possibly the arrival of the remnants of the <a href="Grande%20Arm%C3%A9e">Grande Armée</a> in Berlin convinced the Prussian leadership that it was not only safe, but expedient. The remains of Napoleon's invasion force staggered back from Russia in early 1813 in appalling condition. Of the I Corps, only 2,281 men of the original 70,000 could be mustered. The Imperial Guard strength fell from 50,000 to 1,533, and 200 of those were disabled by amputation, frostbite, or injuries. Some historians suggest that the nature of the opposition to Napoleon changed in these few months, from opposition by dynasties to opposition by whole peoples, giving the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">War of the Sixth Coalition</a> its nationalist character.

By the end of April, French forces gained control of Leipzig. At <a href="Battle%20of%20L%C3%BCtzen%20%281813%29">Lützen</a>, on 2 May Napoleon lured a combined Prussian and Russian force into a trap. The Russian commander, <a href="Peter%20Wittgenstein">Peter Wittgenstein</a>, ignored the primary directive of the Trachenberg plan, attempting to undo Napoleon's capture of <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. After a day of heavy fighting, the combined forces retreated. A few weeks later, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bautzen">Battle of Bautzen</a>, 20–21 May 1813, the combined Russian and Prussian force surprised Ney's corps in a confused assault, which narrowly escaped destruction when Napoleon appeared with reinforcements. The outwitted <a href="Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Blücher</a> and Wittgenstein escaped because <a href="Michel%20Ney">Michel Ney</a> failed to block the retreat. Despite his string of victories, Napoleon sought an armistice in early June, to allow a series of negotiations, to take place in Prague. The <a href="Armistice%20of%20Poischwitz">Armistice of Poischwitz</a>, signed 4 June 1813, established a cease-fire throughout central and eastern Europe that was intended to last until mid-July; the combatants had to give six days' notice of its termination. The various interested parties—Russian, Prussian, Austrian, Saxon, Swedish, Bavarian, British and others—explored the possibilities of new alliances.

While delegates bickered in Prague, similar to the situation in Rastatt in 1799, the diplomats negotiated throughout the war zone and in the capitals of Europe, to create a new set of alliances. The subsequent <a href="War%20of%20the%20Sixth%20Coalition">Sixth Coalition</a> (Russia, Prussia, Britain, Sweden and, eventually, Austria), differed significantly from the earlier coalitions. Unlike previous coalitions in which the participants had organized their armies independently of one another, the Allies of the Sixth Coalition created multi-national armies. This theoretically accomplished two goals: Napoleon could not defeat them piecemeal, and the presence of soldiers from several states within a single armed force limited "politically motivated acts of national self-interest." Klenau, promoted to "General der Kavallerie" (full general) on 26 July 1813, held command of an independent corps in the <a href="Army%20of%20Bohemia">Army of Bohemia</a>. This Army of Bohemia illustrated one of the biggest differences in the Sixth Coalition's organizational schema: it included 127,435 Austrians, 78,200 Russians, and 44,907 Prussians.

The Coalition also pursued a different operational plan. The Coalition's operational strategy brought its different forces closer and closer together in concentric circles, to a single point in Saxony. Known as the <a href="Trachenberg%20Plan">Trachenberg Plan</a>, the Sixth Coalition's operating plan established clear, concise and specific guidelines for commanders, from the Army through the basic company level: act offensively against an inferior foe; act defensively against a superior foe, underscoring to commanders at all levels the risk of underestimating the threat of Napoleon and his army. The new plan divided the Allied force into three armies: Silesia, Bohemia, and Northern Germany. The Silesian army, composed of Prussians and Russians, left 50,000 men in the Province of Silesia and moved the remaining 100,000 to join with 120,000 Austrians in Saxony. The Crown Prince of Sweden, <a href="Charles%20XIV%20John%20of%20Sweden">Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte</a>, a former <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal of France</a> and a favorite of Napoleon's, established an army of observation at <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a>, and another 70,000 concentrated southwest of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Using this plan, the Coalition pushed Napoleon and his allies into an increasingly smaller circle of operation. In theory, while this concentrated Napoleon's force, it also limited his maneuvering options. Furthermore, it concentrated the Coalition forces around the French and Allied armies, ultimately at the Saxon cities of <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, and then <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>.

Strategically, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dresden">Battle of Dresden</a> demonstrated the problems of the Coalition's strategy. On 25 August, the three monarchs—<a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>, <a href="Francis%20II%20of%20Austria">Francis II of Austria</a>, and <a href="Frederick%20William%20III%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William III of Prussia</a>—and their staffs assembled on an overlook of the city to discuss their strategy. The city's weak defenses were clear from this vantage point: the French and Saxon garrison of 20,000 men under Marshal <a href="Laurent%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">Saint-Cyr</a> could not hope to hold a city of that size. The Tsar and General <a href="Jean%20Victor%20Moreau%23Advisor%20to%20Napoleon%27s%20opponents%20and%20death">Jean Victor Moreau</a>, formerly a General of France and by 1813 an adviser to the Coalition, wanted to attack at once; Schwarzenberg wanted to wait until additional forces arrived.

By waiting one day, the Coalition lost the advantage. As the Coalition assaulted the southern suburbs of the city, Napoleon arrived from the north and west with the <a href="Imperial%20Guard%20%28Napoleon%20I%29">Guard</a> and Marmont's VI Corps, covering in forced marches over three days. The leading elements of Klenau's corps were placed on the army's left flank, separated from the main body by the <a href="Wei%C3%9Feritz">Weißeritz</a>, flooded after almost a week of rain. <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal</a> <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a> took advantage of this isolation and inflicted heavy losses on the Austrians. A French participant observed, separating Klenau's corps from the Austrian army, Murat "hurl[ed] himself upon it at the head of the <a href="Carabinier">carabineers</a> and <a href="cuirassier">cuirassier</a>s. His movement was decisive; Klenau could not resist that terrible charge. Nearly all his battalions were compelled to lay down their arms, and two other divisions of infantry shared their fate." Murat captured intact a division of five infantry regiments (15,000 men) under command of Lieutenant Field Marshal <a href="Joseph%2C%20Baron%20von%20Mesko%20de%20Fels%C3%B6-Kubiny">Joseph, Baron von Mesko de Felsö-Kubiny</a>, plus 15 of their regimental and company colors. As the left wing disintegrated, the French swarmed over the flank; the right wing was also driven back, and the entire force had to withdraw.

After the immediate defense of Dresden, though, Napoleon's situation deteriorated. Vandamme pursued the retreating Army of Bohemia, expecting to be supported by St. Cyr and General Marmont, who were still busy in Dresden. <a href="Dominique%20Vandamme">Vandamme</a> approached the Russian corps commanded by <a href="Ostermann-Tolstoy">Ostermann-Tolstoy</a>, but left a valley behind him unprotected as he descended out of the mountain into Bohemia. As he engaged Ostermann-Tolstoy, he saw some troops behind him, which soon attacked him; thus beset from two sides, his young troops were unable to defend themselves; at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kulm">Battle of Kulm</a>, Vandamme lost his entire artillery, and the Austrians acquired about 7,500 prisoners, including the general himself.

To the north of Dresden, as Napoleon appeared to be engaged, looking elsewhere, Blücher brought his troops south, toward the city. Realizing the danger, Napoleon directed his main army north again, to repel the Prussians; as he did so, the wiley Blücher withdrew. Other portions of the French army had comparable difficulties. Marshal <a href="Oudinot">Oudinot</a> was repelled by Bernadotte at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gro%C3%9Fbeeren">Battle of Großbeeren</a>, and MacDonald, near the Bober river. Furthermore, Napoleon began to suffer from illness, referred to variously as a colic or fatigue.

From 12 to 15 October, the days of skirmishing preliminary to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leipzig">Battle of Leipzig</a> (16–19 October), Klenau's force took the heavily defended village <a href="Battle%20of%20Leipzig%23Battle%20of%20Liebertwolkwitz">Liebertwolkwitz</a>, but were forced out in a French counter-attack. A contemporary witness later described finding dead Austrians at the church cemetery, pinned to the walls with bayonets. Klenau's primary objective was the village of Liebertwolkwitz. He took the Kolmberg, a nearby height also known as the "Schwedenschanze" (Swedish fortification), a defensive remnant of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> about east of the village, and established a battery there, but did not bring enough troops to support it. An attack by 4,000 of <a href="Jacques%20MacDonald">Jacques MacDonald</a>'s infantry secured the hill; although Klenau's cavalry managed to push the French back, they could not retake the hill. In the action, Klenau's own horse was shot and killed, and he was nearly captured, but he struggled back to his line, and reorganized his men.

Eventually, Klenau's corps took the village and the Kolmberg several times, to be pushed out by the French, to counter-attack, retreat, counter-attack and retreat and this see-sawing back and forth, the attacks, counter-attacks experienced by Klenau's force, were characteristic of the battle. On the critical first day of the battle, 16 October, a French 100-gun artillery barrage forced a hole in the line between the Russian and Prussian forces on Klenau's flank. When Murat's cavalry charged the hole, Klenau's corps, plus reserve cavalry, eventually forced the Murat's troops back to the cover of the French artillery. Klenau's force made a short retreat, leaving a detachment at the Kolmberg. By mid-afternoon, the Allied columns had been driven to their starting positions, but had maintained their line; as one part of the line was forced back, its flanks dropped back with it, maintaining a continuous line and preventing a French flanking operation. In this first-day action, Klenau's force played a vital role in preventing MacDonald from flanking <a href="Karl%20Philipp%2C%20Prince%20of%20Schwarzenberg">Prince Schwarzenberg's</a> main army. On the night of the 16th, the French controlled the Kolmberg that Klenau had fought over all day, and a Hessian soldier wrote: "it was the worst bivouac we had experienced on this campaign. The weather was wet and windy ... we had to use water from puddles in which lay the blood of men and horses ... and half the men remained under arms at all times."

After the battle, the allied high command assigned Klenau to blockade the large French garrison at <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. His IV Austrian Corps of the Army of Bohemia included the division of Lt. General <a href="Alexander%20Ivanovich%20Ostermann-Tolstoy">Alexander Ivanovich, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy</a>, and the militia of Major General <a href="Alexey%20Nikolayevich%20Titov">Alexey Nikolayevich Titov</a>, a total of approximately 41,000 troops. Klenau eventually negotiated a capitulation in which the French troops would return to France with their honors, on condition that they would not fight against the Allies for six months. Marshal <a href="Laurent%20de%20Gouvion%20Saint-Cyr">Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr</a> surrendered to Klenau on 11 November, but Schwarzenburg refused to agree to the capitulation and the French troops marched into captivity into Austria instead. The victors took 94 French field guns and 151 Saxon fortress guns, and wrested from the French complete control over the Kingdom of Saxony.

During the <a href="Campaign%20in%20north-east%20France%20%281814%29">1814 campaigns</a>, Klenau remained with the Army of Bohemia as it approached Paris slowly, from the south-east, via the <a href="Seine">Seine</a> river valley. The armies would be as many as apart. Their communications would be conducted through Wittgenstein's cavalry and some irregular cossacks, which was directly opposite to the Trachenberg plan. Schwarzenberg knew it was exactly what Napoleon would want them to do, but reluctantly agreed to it.
Afterward, Klenau commanded a corps in Italy, known as the "Korps Klenau". After the war ended again in 1815, Klenau was appointed commanding general in Moravia and Silesia. He held this office until his death on 6 October 1819 at <a href="Brno">Brno</a>, in the modern-day <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>.

Operation Hardboiled

Operation Hardboiled was a Second World War <a href="military%20deception">military deception</a>. Undertaken by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in 1942, it was the first attempt at deception by the <a href="London%20Controlling%20Section">London Controlling Section</a> (LCS) and was designed to convince the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> that the Allies would soon invade <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Norway">German-occupied Norway</a>. The LCS had recently been established to plan deception across all theatres, but had struggled for support from the unenthusiastic military establishment. The LCS had little guidance in strategic deception, an activity pioneered by <a href="Dudley%20Clarke">Dudley Clarke</a> the previous year, and was unaware of the extensive <a href="double%20agent">double agent</a> system controlled by <a href="MI5">MI5</a>. As a result, Hardboiled was planned as a real operation rather than a fictional one. Clarke had already found this approach to be wasteful in time and resources, preferring to present a "story" using agents and wireless traffic.

Resistance to the operation by the chosen units meant that much of the preparation was not completed. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ordered the reinforcement of Scandinavia in March and April 1942, before Hardboiled was shelved in May. It is unclear to what extent the operation contributed to his decision. Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.

Strategic deception was a new topic for the Allies, having been pioneered in 1941 in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> by Dudley Clarke and his <a href="Advanced%20Headquarters%20%27A%27%20Force">Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force</a>. Following a presentation in September by Clarke, the Joint Planning Staff of the British War Ministry decided that a special organisation should be set up to plan and execute deception operations. They recommended that a "controlling section" be set up to oversee strategic deception planning, which would then be put into practice at the operational level by the armed services. The idea was approved and Clarke was offered the role. After he declined, the Chiefs of Staff chose Colonel <a href="Oliver%20Stanley">Oliver Stanley</a>, the former <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20War">Secretary of State for War</a>, as the new Controlling Officer.

Stanley had great difficulty in convincing the Allied military establishment, which was sceptical of strategic deception and resistant to the idea of a central planning authority, to take part in an operation. Despite obtaining a few staff officers, the London Controlling Section (LCS) was, in the words of one member, in a state of "near impotence". In December 1941 Stanley received permission to plan the LCS's first operation, following several months of pressure on the Allied command.

Hardboiled had no specific goal for the Allies, other than to convince the Germans of an imminent invasion threat against Norway. Clarke had already established that deception operations should have a clear idea of what the enemy was supposed to do (rather than what they were expected to think). Stanley was unaware of this, not being in communication with Clarke's department in Cairo. As a result, the objective for Hardboiled was chosen because the resources existed and it would not affect real future operations (planners had already rejected Norway as a viable target), rather than for any strategic advantage it brought the Allies. Stanley was also unaware of the extensive double agent network under the control of the <a href="Double-Cross%20System">Twenty Committee</a>, having merely been told that <a href="MI5">MI5</a> had an avenue through which to pass information to the enemy.

Stanley at first proposed that the notional target should be <a href="Narvik">Narvik</a> or <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>. Allied commanders decided these were implausible targets because of their northern location and an amphibious landing at <a href="Stavanger">Stavanger</a> was chosen, based on planning for <a href="Operation%20Dynamite">Operation Dynamite</a> (a previously considered, and rejected, invasion of the country). The date of the fictional invasion was set for 1 May 1942. Hardboiled was planned as a real operation, involving actual training and troop movements, culminating in the embarkation of a fake invasion. The plan relied on German intelligence, rumour and leaks to convey the deception to the enemy. Clarke and 'A' Force had already discovered in previous operations that realistic training was wasteful, having found that much of the effort could be falsified using agents and wireless traffic. The LCS lacked guidance from Cairo and so made many of the same mistakes.

The LCS also lacked knowledge of MI5's <a href="Double-Cross%20System">Double-Cross System</a> and its double agents. The department were unaware that no uncontrolled German operatives were active in the UK, and so incorrectly believed any deception would have to be highly realistic to appear genuine.

Before the operation could go into action, Stanley had one final objection; he found the codename Hardboiled "silly". LCS member <a href="Dennis%20Wheatley">Dennis Wheatley</a> had picked it from a book of codewords, and explained to Stanley (who was unaware) that the name had been randomly selected so as to bear no relation to the operation's aims.

The <a href="Royal%20Marines%20Division">Royal Marines Division</a> were earmarked for Hardboiled, trained in mountain warfare, and given cold weather equipment. Realistic invasion plans were drawn up and Norwegian currency was stockpiled. These preparations met with considerable resistance from the armed forces, who considered the operation to be a waste of effort. The need for soldiers in real operations and training meant that, in the end, a lot of the preparation never occurred.

The LCS attempted passive deception as part of Hardboiled. Agents canvassed Norwegian refugees for information about Stavanger and for possible interpreters. The hope was that rumours would reach neutral countries and filter back to the German intelligence network. Some deception was also passed on via agents.

Hardboiled soon petered out as the Royal Marines were required for an amphibious operation in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in July 1942. It had appeared effective, as during April and May the Germans had reinforced the region. Historian Joshua Levine notes that Hitler had a "near-obsession with defence of Scandinavia" during this period and that it is unclear how much the operation had contributed to his strategy. <a href="Michael%20Howard%20%28historian%29">Michael Howard</a>, who wrote the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Second%20World%20War%23Intelligence">official British history of strategic deception</a>, attributes the lacklustre response to severe setbacks the Allies were then facing on every front, and writes that it is difficult to imagine the Germans believing that a major offensive operation was being planned.

The operation did not give the Allies any tactical or strategic advantage; Howard notes that it provided experience for the planners in handling deception and for the Twenty Committee in proving the worth of double agents. Terry Crowdy, writing in 2008, argued that any experience that the LCS attained was limited by the lack of guidance from Cairo and knowledge of double agents. Dudley Clarke had already shown that the most effective method of deception involved the use of agents and faked wireless traffic, rather than major training and troop movements. Hardboiled was the first deception plan aimed at Norway. It led into several others, including <a href="Operation%20Cockade%23Operation%20Tindall">Operation Tindall</a> and Operation Solo, culminating in the 1944 <a href="Operation%20Fortitude%23Fortitude%20North">Operation Fortitude North</a>, one of the Allies' largest and most successful deceptions.

In May 1942, <a href="John%20Bevan%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Bevan</a> replaced Stanley as head of the LCS, after the latter had asked <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> for permission to re-enter politics. At the same time, the committee was given much broader powers. Hardboiled was sidelined by the new regime, and had been dropped entirely from the LCS programme by the end of May.

Calvatia sculpta

Calvatia sculpta, commonly known as the sculpted puffball, the sculptured puffball, the pyramid puffball, and the Sierran puffball, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="puffball">puffball</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Agaricaceae">Agaricaceae</a>. Attaining dimensions of up to tall by wide, the pear- or egg-shaped puffball is readily recognizable because of the large pyramidal or polygonal warts covering its surface. It is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> when young, before the <a href="spore">spore</a>s inside the <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">fruit body</a> disintegrate into a brownish powder. The spores are roughly spherical, and have wart-like projections on their surfaces.

Originally described from the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a>, "C. sculpta" is found in mountainous areas in western North America, and was found in a Brazilian dune in 2008. It may be easily confused with "<a href="Calbovista%20subsculpta">Calbovista subsculpta</a>", a similar puffball that—in addition to differences observable only with a <a href="microscope">microscope</a>—is larger, and has slightly raised warts with a felt-like texture. Other similar species include "<a href="Calvatia%20arctica">Calvatia arctica</a>" and immature specimens of "<a href="Amanita%20magniverrucata">Amanita magniverrucata</a>".

The species was first described in 1885 by American mycologist <a href="Harvey%20Willson%20Harkness">Harvey Willson Harkness</a>, under the name "Lycoperdon sculptum". Harkness, who called it "a curious and strikingly beautiful species", found fruit bodies growing at elevations between in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although he noted that "in appearance it differs so much from any species known to us, as to be almost deemed worthy of generic rank", he thought that placement in the puffball genus "<a href="Lycoperdon">Lycoperdon</a>" was the most appropriate <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classification</a>, despite its unusual <a href="cortex%20%28botany%29">cortex</a>. Harkness's type collections were destroyed in the fires following the <a href="1906%20San%20Francisco%20earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a>. In 1904, <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> considered the species better placed in "<a href="Calvatia">Calvatia</a>", because of the resemblance of its deeply colored capillitial threads (coarse thick-walled cells found in the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>) to those of "Calvatia caelata"; he called the species "Calvatia sculptum". The mushroom is known by several <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s, including the "sculpted puffball", the "sculptured puffball", the "pyramid puffball", and the "Sierran puffball".

In 1992, German mycologist <a href="Hanns%20Kreisel">Hanns Kreisel</a>, in his survey of the genus "Calvatia", defined the <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Sculpta" to contain "C. sculpta" and "C. subcretacea". Two years later he merged the section "Cretacea" into "Sculpta" when it was shown that "C. subcretacea" was <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymous</a> with the arctic-alpine species "<a href="Calvatia%20arctica">C. arctica</a>".

The white pear- or egg-shaped <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungus%29">fruit body</a> of "C. sculpta" may be tall by wide. The outer layer of tissue, known as the exoperidium, is covered on the outer surface with distinctive long, pointed, pyramid-shaped warts, either erect or bent over and sometimes connected at the tip with other warts. The warts bear parallel horizontal lines towards the base. Mycologist <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> opined that "C. sculpta" resembled "a cross between a geodesic dome and a giant glob of meringue." In age, the <a href="peridium">peridium</a> sloughs off and exposes a brownish spore mass. The interior of the puffball, the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, is firm and yellowish-white when young, but gradually becomes powdery and deep olive-brown as it matures.

The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are roughly spherical, thick-walled, 3–6 <a href="micrometre">µm</a> in diameter (although some specimens collected in the US range from 7.2 to 9.5 µm), and are covered with minute spines or warts. The use of <a href="scanning%20electron%20microscopy">scanning electron microscopy</a> has revealed that these ornamentations on the spores are typically 0.95 µm long. Spore <a href="ultrastructure">ultrastructure</a> is distinctive among "Calvatia" species, and has been used to help verify taxonomic groupings and confirm the status of species within the genus. The capillitia (coarse, thick-walled <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e in the gleba) are <a href="septum">septate</a>, with branches that are narrowed towards the tips; they are 3–8 µm in diameter. When grown in <a href="pure%20culture">pure culture</a> in the laboratory, "C. sculpta" is, under certain conditions, able to grow structures called "mycelial strands". These are linear aggregates of hyphae whereby older "leading" hyphae become enclosed by coiled layers of newer "tendril" hyphae. Mycelial strands provide a conduit for transporting water and nutrients across non-nutrient material, allowing the fungus to reach new sources of food. They are also implicated in the formation of fruit bodies and <a href="sclerotia">sclerotia</a>. The mycelia of "C. sculpta" can be induced to form mycelial strands when there is a permeable physical barrier between it and the <a href="agar%20plate">agar</a> substrate. The wide hyphae in the center of the mycelial strands contain protein-dense structures on their cell walls that are shaped like a <a href="torus">torus</a>. Their function is unknown.

"Calvatia sculpta" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, and said to be "choice" by some authors. The taste is described as "mild" and the flesh has no distinguishable odor. Arora recommends eating the puffball only when it is firm and white inside, as older specimens may have a distasteful <a href="iodine">iodine</a>-like flavor. The puffball may be preserved by freezing fresh or partially cooked slices, but their flavor and texture will deteriorate unless cooked immediately after thawing. Recommended cooking techniques for puffball slices include <a href="saut%C3%A9ing">sautéing</a> and coating in <a href="batter%20%28cooking%29">batter</a> before frying. "C. sculpta" was used as a traditional food of the <a href="Plains%20and%20Sierra%20Miwok">Plains and Sierra Miwok</a> Indians of North America, who called the fungus "potokele" or "patapsi". Puffballs were prepared by drying them in the sun, grinding them with a mortar, and boiling them before eating with acorn soup.

The giant western puffball, "<a href="Calvatia%20booniana">Calvatia booniana</a>", is much larger than "C. sculpta"—up to in diameter and tall—and has a smoother surface. Mature specimens of "Calvatia arctica" (synonymous with "Calvatia subcretacea", "Gastropila subcretacea", and "Handkea subcretacea") can resemble immature specimens of "C. sculpta". It is distinguished from "C. sculpta" by its tough, thicker <a href="peridium">peridial</a> wall, and its scales are tipped with gray-brown. "<a href="Calbovista%20subsculpta">Calbovista subsculpta</a>" is similar in appearance, but has more flattened and less prominent pyramidal warts. Microscopically, its capillitia are thin-walled and frequently and irregularly branched, in contrast to the thick-walled infrequently branched capillitia of "C. sculpta". The "possibly toxic" "<a href="Amanita%20magniverrucata">Amanita magniverrucata</a>", in its <a href="Embryo%23Embryos%20of%20plants%20and%20animals">embryonic stage</a>, has a superficial resemblance as it also has pyramidal cap warts. However, it grows at different elevations and different seasons than "C. sculpta". Further, slicing the fruit body of "A. magniverrucata" in half will reveal internal structures of <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>, <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> and <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a> not present in puffballs.

The sculptured puffball grows solitarily or in small groups in <a href="forest%20floor">forest duff</a>. It is typically associated with <a href="Pinophyta">coniferous</a> forests at high elevations, greater than about , on western mountains like the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> and the <a href="Cascade%20Range">Cascade Range</a>. The United States distribution includes the states of <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a>, and <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>. An uncommon species, it fruits throughout spring, summer, and fall during wet weather.

Most commonly known from western North America, the species was reported growing on sandy soil in <a href="Natal%20Dunes%20State%20Park">Natal Dunes State Park</a> in the <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northeastern Brazilian</a> state of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Norte">Rio Grande do Norte</a> in 2008. The fruit bodies were associated with the roots of the native tree species "<a href="Eugenia%20brasiliensis">Eugenia brasiliensis</a>". Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunct distribution</a>: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations may represent a <a href="cryptic%20species%20complex">cryptic species complex</a>—appearing <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> similar but genetically distinct.

Mensa (constellation)

Mensa is a <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a> near the south <a href="celestial%20pole">celestial pole</a>, one of twelve constellations drawn up in the 18th century by French astronomer <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a>. Its name is Latin for table, though it originally commemorated <a href="Table%20Mountain">Table Mountain</a> and was known as Mons Mensae. One of the <a href="IAU%20designated%20constellations">eighty-eight constellations</a> designated by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU), it covers a <a href="Keystone%20%28architecture%29">keystone</a>-shaped wedge of sky 153.5 square degrees in area. Other than the south polar constellation of <a href="Octans">Octans</a>, it is the most southerly of constellations and is observable only south of the <a href="5th%20parallel%20north">5th parallel</a> of the <a href="Northern%20hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>.

One of the faintest constellations in the night sky, Mensa contains no apparently bright stars—the brightest, <a href="Alpha%20Mensae">Alpha Mensae</a>, is barely visible in suburban skies. At least three of its star systems have been found to have <a href="exoplanets">exoplanets</a>, and part of the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>, several <a href="star%20clusters">star clusters</a> and a <a href="quasar">quasar</a> lie in the area covered by the constellation.

Initially known as Mons Mensae, Mensa was created by <a href="Nicolas-Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille</a> out of dim Southern Hemisphere stars in honor of <a href="Table%20Mountain">Table Mountain</a>, a South African mountain overlooking <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, near the location of Lacaille's observatory. He recalled that the <a href="Magellanic%20Clouds">Magellanic Clouds</a> were sometimes known as Cape clouds, and that Table Mountain was often covered in clouds when a southeasterly stormy wind blew. Hence he made a "table" in the sky under the clouds. Lacaille had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. Mensa was the only constellation that did not honor an instrument symbolic of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Sir <a href="John%20Herschel">John Herschel</a> proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated some of his constellations thus.

Although the stars of Mensa do not feature in any ancient mythology, the mountain it is named after has a rich mythology. Called "Tafelberg" in Dutch and German, it has two neighboring mountains called "Devil's Peak" and "Lion's Head". Table Mountain features in the mythology of the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a>, notorious for its storms. Explorer <a href="Bartolomeu%20Dias">Bartolomeu Dias</a> saw the mountain as a mythical anvil for storms.

Mensa is bordered by <a href="Dorado">Dorado</a> to the north, <a href="Hydrus%20%28constellation%29">Hydrus</a> to the northwest and west, Octans to the south, <a href="Chamaeleon">Chamaeleon</a> to the east and <a href="Volans">Volans</a> to the northeast. Covering 153.5 square degrees and 0.372% of the night sky, it ranks 75th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is 'Men'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −69.75° and −85.26°. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude <a href="5th%20parallel%20north">5°N</a>.

Lacaille gave eleven stars in the constellation <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s, using the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> to label them Alpha through to Lambda Mensae (excluding Kappa). <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Gould</a> later added Kappa, Mu, Nu, Xi and Pi Mensae. Stars as dim as these were not generally given designations; however, Gould felt their closeness to the South Celestial Pole warranted their naming. <a href="Alpha%20Mensae">Alpha Mensae</a> is the brightest star with a barely visible <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of 5.09, making it the only constellation with no star above magnitude 5.0. Overall, there are 22 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 6.5.




The <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a> lies partially within Mensa's boundaries, although most of it lies in neighbouring Dorado. It is a <a href="satellite%20galaxy">satellite galaxy</a> of the Milky Way, located at a distance of 163,000 light-years. Among its stars within Mensa are <a href="W%20Mensae">W Mensae</a>, an unusual yellow-white supergiant that belongs to a rare class of star known as a <a href="R%20Coronae%20Borealis%20variable">R Coronae Borealis variable</a>, <a href="HD%20268835">HD 268835</a>, a blue <a href="hypergiant">hypergiant</a> that is girded by a vast circumstellar disk of dust, and <a href="R71%20%28star%29">R71</a>, a <a href="luminous%20blue%20variable">luminous blue variable</a> star that brightened in 2012 to over a million times as luminous as the Sun. Also within the galaxy is <a href="NGC%201987">NGC 1987</a>, a <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> estimated to be around 600 million years old that has a significant number of red ageing stars, and <a href="NGC%201848">NGC 1848</a>, a 27 million year old <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a>. Mensa contains several described open clusters, most of which can be only be clearly observed from large telescopes.

<a href="PKS%200637-752">PKS 0637-752</a> is a distant quasar with a calculated <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of z = 0.651. It was chosen as the first target of the then newly-operational <a href="Chandra%20X-Ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-Ray Observatory</a> in 1999. The resulting images revealed a gas jet approximately 330,000 light-years long. It is visible at <a href="Radio%20astronomy">radio</a>, optical and <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">x-ray</a> <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s.

Exsudoporus frostii

Exsudoporus frostii (formerly Boletus frostii), <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as Frost's bolete or the apple bolete, is a <a href="bolete">bolete</a> <a href="fungus">fungus</a> first described scientifically in 1874. A member of the family <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a>, the <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> on the underside of their <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">caps</a>. "Exsudoporus frostii" is distributed in the eastern United States from <a href="Maine">Maine</a> to <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, and in the southwest from <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> extending south to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. A <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l species, its <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> are typically found growing near <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> trees, especially <a href="oak">oak</a>.

"Exsudoporus frostii" mushrooms can be recognized by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a>, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the <a href="amber%20%28color%29">amber</a>-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. Although the mushrooms are considered <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>, they are generally not recommended for consumption because of the risk of confusion with other <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a> red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. "E. frostii" may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>.

The species was named by the <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister <a href="John%20Lewis%20Russell">John Lewis Russell</a> of <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>, based on specimens found in <a href="Brattleboro%2C%20Vermont">Brattleboro, Vermont</a>. He named the fungus after his friend, fellow amateur American mycologist <a href="Charles%20Christopher%20Frost">Charles Christopher Frost</a>, who published a <a href="species%20description">description</a> of the species in his 1874 survey of the <a href="bolete">bolete</a>s of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. When the name of a species is contributed by an individual, but the name is formally published by another, the contributor's name can be cited, separated from the publishing author as "apud"; for this reason, the name and authority are written "Boletus Frostii" Russell "apud" Frost in some older literature. <a href="Bernard%20Ogilvie%20Dodge">Bernard Ogilvie Dodge</a> made reference to "B. frostii" in 1950 during an address to the <a href="Mycological%20Society%20of%20America">Mycological Society of America</a>, in which he spoke about the role of the amateur in discovering new species: "They would have informed us all about the man Russell, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Frost, and about the man Frost, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Russell. "Boletus Frostii" and "Boletus Russellii" are mushrooms with "character", even though they were described by amateurs." However, in attempting to establish a <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> specimen, mycologist <a href="Roy%20Halling">Roy Halling</a> examined both Russell's original material and his accompanying notes; he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations, further suggesting that "there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected "B. frostii" or wrote a description of it."

<a href="William%20Murrill">William Murrill</a> in 1909 placed the species in the genus "Suillellus", while <a href="Sanshi%20Imai">Sanshi Imai</a> transferred it to "Tubiporus" in 1968. "Tubiporus" has since been synonymized with "Boletus". In 1945, <a href="Rolf%20Singer">Rolf Singer</a> described a bolete he found in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>; although he originally described it as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "B. frostii", he later considered the differences between the <a href="taxon">taxa</a> significant enough to warrant publishing "<a href="Boletus%20floridanus">Boletus floridanus</a>" as a unique species. Following recent <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> studies that outlined a new <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> framework for the Boletaceae, the bolete was transferred to the newly <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribed</a> genus "<a href="Exsudoporus">Exsudoporus</a>" in 2014.

"Exsudoporus frostii" is <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as "Frost's bolete" or the "apple bolete". In Mexico, its vernacular name is "panza agria", which translates to "sour belly".

The shape of the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of the young <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> ranges from a half sphere to convex, later becoming broadly convex to flat or shallowly depressed, with a diameter of . The edge of the cap is curved inward, although as it ages it can uncurl and turn upward. In moist conditions, the cap surface is sticky as a result of its <a href="pileipellis">cuticle</a>, which is made of gelatinized <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e. If the fruit body has dried out after a rain, the cap is especially shiny, sometimes appearing finely areolate (having a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked, dried mud). Young mushrooms have a whitish bloom on the cap surface.The color is bright red initially, but fades with age. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is up to thick, and ranges in color from pallid to pale yellow to lemon yellow. The flesh has a variable staining reaction in response to bruising, so some specimens may turn deep blue almost immediately, while others turn blue weakly and slowly.

The tubes comprising the pore surface (the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>) are 9–15 mm deep, yellow to olivaceous yellow (mustard yellow), turning dingy blue when bruised. The pores are small (2 to 3 per mm), circular, and until old age a deep red color that eventually becomes paler. The pore surface is often beaded with yellowish droplets when young (a distinguishing characteristic), and readily stains blue when bruised. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> is long, and thick at its apex. It is roughly equal in thickness throughout its length, though it may taper somewhat toward the top; some specimens may appear ventricose (swollen in the middle). The stipe surface is mostly red, or yellowish near the base; it is <a href="wiktionary%3Areticulate">reticulate</a>—characterized by ridges arranged in the form of a net-like pattern. <a href="Mycelia">Mycelia</a>, visible at the base of the stipe, are yellowish white to light yellow.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> of "E. frostii" is olive brown. The <a href="basidiospore">spores</a> are thick walled, smooth, and spindle shaped, with dimensions of 11–15 by 4–5 <a href="micrometre">µm</a>. Longer spores up to 18 µm long may also be present. The cap cuticle, or <a href="pileipellis">pileipellis</a>, is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6 µm wide. The spore-bearing cells, the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5 µm. <a href="Cystidia">Cystidia</a> are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of "E. frostii". These <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14 µm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like a spindle (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to "subampullaceous"—shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle.

In 1910, Murrill wrote of this mushroom's <a href="edible%20mushroom">edibility</a>: "Usually viewed with suspicion because of its red hymenium, but its properties are not accurately known." Since then, several authors have advised against consuming the species, due to its resemblance to other toxic red-capped boletes. In his "100 Edible Mushrooms" (2007), Michael Kuo notes that although the mushroom is apparently edible for some, it "affects others negatively". Despite these warnings, "Exsudoporus frostii" is edible, and <a href="David%20Arora">David Arora</a> mentions that it is commonly sold in rural markets in Mexico; a 1997 study suggests that it is only consumed in rural areas in <a href="Quer%C3%A9taro">Querétaro</a> state. Its taste and odor have been described as "pleasant" or "sweet" and somewhat like <a href="citrus">citrus</a>, although the cuticle of the cap may taste acidic.

<a href="Food%20chemistry">Chemical analysis</a> of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico showed them to have the following composition: <a href="moisture">moisture</a> 94.53%; <a href="Ash%20%28analytical%20chemistry%29">ash</a> 0.323%; <a href="dietary%20fiber">dietary fiber</a> 3.024%; <a href="fat">fat</a> 0.368%; and <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a> 1.581%. The <a href="free%20fatty%20acid">free fatty acid</a> content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common <a href="Agaricus%20bisporus">button mushroom</a> ("Agaricus bisporus"), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was <a href="oleic%20acid">oleic acid</a> (1.95%), followed by <a href="linoleic%20acid">linoleic acid</a> (1.68%) and <a href="palmitic%20acid">palmitic acid</a> (1.69%).

Other red-capped boletes include the poisonous "<a href="Boletus%20flammans">B. flammans</a>" and "<a href="Boletus%20rubroflammeus">B. rubroflammeus</a>"; the former grows most commonly under <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s, the latter in association with <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s in eastern North America and southern <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. Often confused with "E. frostii" are "<a href="Exsudoporus%20permagnificus">E. permagnificus</a>" and "<a href="Boletus%20siculus">B. siculus</a>", but the latter two species are known only from Europe and always grow in association with <a href="oak">oak</a>s. The fruit bodies of young specimens of "<a href="Boletus%20kermesinus">B. kermesinus</a>", newly described from Japan in 2011, are similar in appearance to "E. frostii". In addition to its distribution, "B. kermesinus" can be distinguished from "E. frostii" by having flesh that does not bruise blue and a stipe in which the reticulum is not as deep and coarse. "<a href="Boletus%20pseudofrostii">B. pseudofrostii</a>", found in <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, produces smaller caps that are in diameter. "<a href="Boletus%20russelli">Boletus russelli</a>", found in eastern North America, has a red to reddish-brown cap and reticulate stipe, but its pore surface is yellow, and the fruit body does not bruise blue.

"Exsudoporus floridanus" differs from "E. frostii" in having a lighter cap color and in the texture of the cap surface: it is <a href="tomentose">tomentose</a> (covered with dense, short, soft, matted hairs) or <a href="wikt%3Avelutinous">velutinous</a> (like <a href="velvet">velvet</a>), compared to the relatively smooth surface of "E. frostii". Singer notes that although the physical characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define, the area of origin can reliably distinguish them: "E. floridanus" is found on shaded lawns and <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> in open oak stands in non-<a href="tropical">tropical</a> regions of Florida, typically on grassy or sandy soil, where it fruits between May and October.

"Exsudoporus frostii" is a <a href="mycorrhizae">mycorrhizal</a> species, meaning that the fungus forms associations with the roots of various species of trees. These associations are <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistic</a>, because the fungus absorbs <a href="dietary%20mineral">mineral</a> nutrients from the soil and channels these into the plant, while the plant provides the fungus with sugars, a product of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza is the presence of a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal, nutrient-absorbing <a href="wiktionary%3Arootlet">rootlets</a> of the host plant. The fungus forms an extensive underground network of hyphae that radiate outward from the surface of the root sheath, effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The hyphae also invade between the root <a href="cortex%20%28botany%29">cortical cells</a> to form a <a href="Hartig%20net">Hartig net</a>. Using <a href="microbiological%20culture">pure culture</a> techniques, "Exsudoporus frostii" has been shown to form mycorrhizae with <a href="Virginia%20pine">Virginia pine</a> ("Pinus virginiana"), while a field study confirms a similar association with the oak "<a href="Quercus%20laurina">Quercus laurina</a>".

The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground under hardwood trees; the fungus fruits in summer to early autumn. William Murrill noted its preference for growing in "thin oak woods, where the light is sufficient to enable grass to grow", and <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> mentioned its preference for growing in "thin, sandy soil under scrub oak." In the United States, it is distributed from <a href="Maine">Maine</a> south to <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, extending west to <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, and in southern Arizona. In Mexico, it is often found under <a href="Madrone">Madrone</a>. It has also been collected in <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>, where it associates with the oak species "<a href="Quercus%20copeyensis">Quercus copeyensis</a>", "<a href="Quercus%20costaricensis">Q. costaricensis</a>", "<a href="Quercus%20rapurahuensis">Q. rapurahuensis</a>", and "<a href="Quercus%20seemanii">Q. seemanii</a>". A 1980 publication tentatively suggested that the fungus was also present in Italy, but the author later determined that the putative "E. frostii" was actually "<a href="Boletus%20siculus">Boletus siculus</a>".

Fruit bodies can be <a href="parasitism">parasitized</a> by the mold-like fungus "<a href="Sepedonium%20ampullosporum">Sepedonium ampullosporum</a>". Infection results in <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a> of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow color caused by the formation of large amounts of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ed aleurioconidia (single-celled <a href="conidia">conidia</a> produced by extrusion from the <a href="conidiophore">conidiophore</a>s).

Nelson's Pillar

Nelson's Pillar (also known as the Nelson Pillar or simply the Pillar) was a large granite column capped by a statue of <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>, built in the centre of what was then Sackville Street (later renamed <a href="O%27Connell%20Street">O'Connell Street</a>) in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Ireland. Completed in 1809 when Ireland was part of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, it survived until March 1966, when it was severely damaged by explosives planted by <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republicans</a>. Its remnants were later destroyed by the <a href="Irish%20Army">Irish Army</a>.

The decision to build the monument was taken by <a href="Dublin%20Corporation">Dublin Corporation</a> in the euphoria following Nelson's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a> in 1805. The original design by <a href="William%20Wilkins%20%28architect%29">William Wilkins</a> was greatly modified by <a href="Francis%20Johnston%20%28architect%29">Francis Johnston</a>, on grounds of cost. The statue was sculpted by <a href="Thomas%20Kirk%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Kirk</a>. From its opening on 29 October 1809 the Pillar was a popular tourist attraction, but provoked aesthetic and political controversy from the outset. A prominent city centre monument honouring an Englishman rankled as <a href="Irish%20nationalist">Irish nationalist</a> sentiment grew, and throughout the 19th century there were calls for it to be removed, or replaced with a memorial to an Irish hero.

During the Easter Rising an attempt was made to blow up the pillar but the explosives failed to ignite due to dampness. It remained in the city as most of Ireland became the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> in 1922, and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> in 1949. The chief legal barrier to its removal was the trust created at the Pillar's inception, the terms of which gave the trustees a duty in perpetuity to preserve the monument. Successive Irish governments failed to deliver legislation overriding the trust. Although influential literary figures such as <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a> and <a href="Oliver%20St.%20John%20Gogarty">Oliver St. John Gogarty</a> defended the Pillar on historical and cultural grounds, pressure for its removal intensified in the years preceding the 50th anniversary of the Rising, and its sudden demise was, on the whole, well-received by the public. Although it was widely believed that the action was the work of the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281922%E2%80%9369%29">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA), the police were unable to identify any of those responsible.

After years of debate and numerous proposals, the site was occupied in 2003 by the <a href="Spire%20of%20Dublin">Spire of Dublin</a>, a slim needle-like structure rising almost three times the height of the Pillar. In 2000, a former republican activist gave a radio interview in which he admitted planting the explosives in 1966, but, after questioning him, the Gardaí decided not to take action. Relics of the Pillar are found in Dublin museums and appear as decorative stonework elsewhere and its memory is preserved in numerous works of Irish literature.

The redevelopment of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> north of the <a href="River%20Liffey">River Liffey</a> began in the early 18th century, largely through the enterprise of the property speculator <a href="Luke%20Gardiner">Luke Gardiner</a>. His best-known work was the transformation in the 1740s of a narrow lane called Drogheda Street, which he demolished and turned into a broad thoroughfare lined with large and imposing town houses. He renamed it Sackville Street, in honour of <a href="Lionel%20Sackville%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Dorset">Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset</a>, who served as <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a> from 1731 to 1737 and from 1751 to 1755. After Gardiner's death in 1755 Dublin's growth continued, with many fine public buildings and grand squares, the city's status magnified by the presence of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Parliament of Ireland</a> for six months of the year. The <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">Acts of Union of 1800</a>, which united Ireland and <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> under a single <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Westminster polity</a>, ended the Irish parliament and presaged a period of decline for the city. The historian <a href="Tristram%20Hunt">Tristram Hunt</a> writes: "[T]he capital's dynamism vanished, absenteeism returned and the big houses lost their patrons".

The first monument in Sackville Street was built in 1759 in the location where the Nelson Pillar would eventually stand. The subject was <a href="William%20Blakeney%2C%201st%20Baron%20Blakeney">William Blakeney, 1st Baron Blakeney</a>, a <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a>-born army officer whose career extended over more than 60 years and ended with his surrender to the French after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Fort%20St%20Philip%20%281756%29">Siege of Minorca</a> in 1756. A brass statue sculpted by <a href="John%20van%20Nost%20the%20younger">John van Nost the younger</a> was unveiled on <a href="St%20Patrick%27s%20Day">St Patrick's Day</a>, 17 March 1759. Donal Fallon, in his history of the Pillar, states that almost from its inception the Blakeney statue was a target for vandalism. Its fate is uncertain; Fallon records that it might have been melted down for cannon, but it had certainly been removed by 1805.

On 21 October 1805, a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Naval</a> fleet commanded by <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Vice Admiral Lord Nelson</a> defeated the combined fleets of the French and Spanish navies in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>. At the height of the battle Nelson was mortally wounded on board his flagship, ; by the time he died later that day, victory was assured.

Nelson had been hailed in Dublin seven years earlier, after the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>, as defender of the Harp and Crown, the respective symbols of Ireland and Britain. When news of Trafalgar reached the city on 8 November, there were similar scenes of patriotic celebration, together with a desire that the fallen hero should be commemorated. The mercantile classes had particular reason to be grateful for a victory that restored the freedom of the high seas and removed the threat of a French invasion. Many of the city's population had relatives who had been involved in the battle: up to one-third of the sailors in Nelson's fleet were from Ireland, including around 400 from Dublin itself. In his short account of the Pillar, <a href="Dennis%20Campbell%20Kennedy">Dennis Kennedy</a> considers that Nelson would have been regarded in the city as a hero, not just among the <a href="Protestant%20Ascendancy">Protestant Ascendancy</a> but by many Catholics among the rising middle and professional classes.

The first step towards a permanent memorial to Nelson was taken on 18 November 1805 by the city <a href="aldermen">aldermen</a>, who after sending a message of congratulation to <a href="King%20George%20III">King George III</a>, agreed that the erection of a statue would form a suitable tribute to Nelson's memory. On 28 November, after a public meeting had supported this sentiment, a "Nelson committee" was established, chaired by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Dublin">Lord Mayor</a>. It contained four of the city's Westminster MPs, alongside other city notables including <a href="Arthur%20Guinness%20II">Arthur Guinness</a>, the son of the brewery founder. The committee's initial tasks were to decide precisely what form the monument should take and where it should be put. They had also to raise the funds to pay for it.

At its first meeting the Nelson committee established a public subscription, and early in 1806 invited artists and architects to submit design proposals for a monument. No specifications were provided, but the contemporary European vogue in commemorative architecture was for the classical form, typified by <a href="Trajan%27s%20Column">Trajan's Column</a> in Rome. <a href="Victory%20column">Monumental columns</a>, or "pillars of victory", were uncommon in Ireland at the time; the Cumberland Column in <a href="Birr%2C%20County%20Offaly">Birr, County Offaly</a>, erected in 1747, was a rare exception. From the entries submitted, the Nelson committee's choice was that of a young English architect, <a href="William%20Wilkins%20%28architect%29">William Wilkins</a>, then in the early stages of a distinguished career. Wilkins's proposals envisaged a tall <a href="Doric%20order">Doric column</a> on a plinth, surmounted by a sculpted Roman <a href="galley">galley</a>.

The choice of the Sackville Street site was not unanimous. The <a href="Wide%20Streets%20Commission">Wide Streets Commission</a>ers were worried about traffic congestion, and argued for a riverside location visible from the sea. Another suggestion was for a seaside position, perhaps <a href="Howth%20Head">Howth Head</a> at the entrance to <a href="Dublin%20Bay">Dublin Bay</a>. The recent presence of the Blakeney statue in Sackville Street, and a desire to arrest the street's decline in the post-parliamentary years, were factors that may have influenced the final selection of that site which, Kennedy says, was the preferred choice of the Lord Lieutenant.

By mid-1807, fundraising was proving difficult; sums raised at that point were well short of the likely cost of erecting Wilkins's column. The committee informed the architect with regret that "means were not placed in their hands to enable them to gratify him, as well as themselves, by executing his design precisely as he had given it". They employed <a href="Francis%20Johnston%20%28architect%29">Francis Johnston</a>, architect to the City Board of Works, to make cost-cutting adjustments to Wilkins's scheme. Johnston simplified the design, substituting a large functional block or pedestal for Wilkins's delicate plinth, and replacing the proposed galley with a statue of Nelson. <a href="Thomas%20Kirk%20%28sculptor%29">Thomas Kirk</a>, a sculptor from <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, was commissioned to provide the statue, to be fashioned from <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>.

By December 1807 the fund stood at £3,827, far short of the estimated £6,500 required to finance the project. Nevertheless, by the beginning of 1808 the committee felt confident enough to begin the work, and organised the laying of the foundation stone. This ceremony took place on 15 February 1808—the day following the anniversary of Nelson's victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St%20Vincent%20%281797%29">Battle of Cape St Vincent</a> in 1797—amid much pomp, in the presence of the new Lord Lieutenant, the <a href="Charles%20Lennox%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Richmond">Duke of Richmond</a>, along with various civic dignitaries and city notables. A memorial plaque eulogising Nelson's Trafalgar victory was attached to the stone. The committee continued to raise money as construction proceeded; when the project was complete in the autumn of 1809, costs totalled £6,856, but contributions had reached £7,138, providing the committee with a surplus of £282.

When finished, the monument complete with its statue rose to a height of . The four sides of the pedestal were engraved with the names and dates of Nelson's greatest victories. A spiral stairway of 168 steps ascended the hollow interior of the column, to a viewing platform immediately beneath the statue. According to the committee's published report, of black <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and of <a href="granite">granite</a> had been used to build the column and its pedestal. The Pillar opened to the public on 21 October 1809, on the fourth anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar; for ten <a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">pre-decimal</a> pence, visitors could climb to a viewing platform just below the statue, and enjoy what an early report describes as "a superb panoramic view of the city, the country and the fine bay".

The Pillar quickly became a popular tourist attraction; Kennedy writes that "for the next 157 years its ascent was a must on every visitor's list". Yet from the beginning there were criticisms, on both political and aesthetic grounds. The September 1809 issue of the "Irish Monthly Magazine", edited by the revolution-minded Walter "Watty" Cox, reported that "our independence has been wrested from us, not by the arms of France but by the gold of England. The statue of Nelson records the glory of a mistress and the transformation of our senate into a discount office". In an early (1818) history of the city of Dublin, the writers express awe at the scale of the monument, but are critical of several of its features: its proportions are described as "ponderous", the pedestal as "unsightly" and the column itself as "clumsy". However, the "Hibernian Magazine" thought the statue was a good likeness of its subject, and that the Pillar's position in the centre of the wide street gave the eye a focal point in what was otherwise "wastes of pavements".

By 1830, rising nationalist sentiment in Ireland made it likely that the Pillar was "the Ascendancy's last hurrah"—Kennedy observes that it probably could not have been built at any later date. Nevertheless, the monument often attracted favourable comment from visitors; in 1842 the writer <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a> noted Nelson "upon a stone-pillar" in the middle of the "exceedingly broad and handsome" Sackville Street: "The Post Office is on his right hand (only it is cut off); and on his left, 'Gresham's' and the 'Imperial Hotel' ". A few years later, the monument was a source of pride to some citizens, who dubbed it "Dublin's Glory" when <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> visited the city in 1849.

Between 1840 and 1843 <a href="Nelson%27s%20Column">Nelson's Column</a> was erected in London's <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>. With an overall height of it was taller than its Dublin equivalent and, at £47,000, much more costly to erect. It has no internal staircase or viewing platform. The London column was the subject of an attack during the <a href="Fenian%20dynamite%20campaign">Fenian dynamite campaign</a> in May 1884, when a quantity of explosives was placed at its base but failed to detonate.

In 1853 the queen attended the <a href="Great%20Industrial%20Exhibition%20%281853%29">Dublin Great Industrial Exhibition</a>, where a city plan was displayed that envisaged the removal of the Pillar. This proved impossible, as since 1811 legal responsibility for the Pillar had been vested in a trust, under the terms of which the trustees were required "to embellish and uphold the monument in perpetuation of the object for which it was subscribed". Any action to remove or resite the Pillar, or replace the statue, required the passage of an <a href="Acts%20of%20Parliament%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Act of Parliament</a> in London; <a href="Dublin%20Corporation">Dublin Corporation</a> (the city government) had no authority in the matter. No action followed the city plan suggestion, but the following years saw regular attempts to remove the monument. A proposal was made in 1876 by Alderman Peter McSwiney, a former Lord Mayor, to replace the "unsightly structure" with a memorial to the recently deceased <a href="John%20Gray%20%28Irish%20politician%29">Sir John Gray</a>, who had done much to provide Dublin with a clean water supply. The Corporation was unable to advance this idea.

In 1882 the Moore Street Market and Dublin City Improvement Act was passed by the Westminster parliament, overriding the trust and giving the Corporation authority to resite the Pillar, but subject to a strict timetable, within which the city authorities found it impossible to act. The Act lapsed and the Pillar remained; a similar attempt, with the same result, was made in 1891. Not all Dubliners favoured demolition; some businesses considered the Pillar to be the city's focal point, and the tramway company petitioned for its retention as it marked the central tram terminus. "In many ways", says Fallon, "the pillar had become part of the fabric of the city". Kennedy writes: "A familiar and very large if rather scruffy piece of the city's furniture, it was "The" Pillar, Dublin's Pillar rather than Nelson's Pillar ... it was also an outing, an experience". The Dublin sculptor <a href="John%20Hughes%20%28sculptor%29">John Hughes</a> invited students at the Metropolitan School of Art to "admire the elegance and dignity" of Kirk's statue, "and the beauty of the silhouette".

In 1894 there were some significant alterations to the Pillar's fabric. The original entry on the west side, whereby visitors entered the pedestal by a flight of steps taking them down below street level, was replaced by a new ground level entrance on the south side, with a grand porch. The whole monument was surrounded by heavy iron railings. In the new century, despite the growing nationalism within Dublin—80 per cent of the Corporation's councillors were nationalists of some description—the pillar was liberally decorated with flags and streamers to mark the 1905 Trafalgar centenary. The changing political atmosphere had long been signalled by the arrival in Sackville Street of further monuments, all celebrating distinctively Irish heroes, in what the historian Yvonne Whelan describes as defiance of the British Government, a "challenge in stone". Between the 1860s and 1911, Nelson was joined by monuments to <a href="Daniel%20O%27Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a>, <a href="William%20Smith%20O%27Brien">William Smith O'Brien</a> and <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20Parnell">Charles Stewart Parnell</a>, as well as Sir John Gray and the temperance campaigner <a href="Theobald%20Mathew%20%28temperance%20reformer%29">Father Mathew</a>. Meanwhile, in 1861, after decades of construction, the <a href="Wellington%20Monument%2C%20Dublin">Wellington Monument</a> in Dublin's <a href="Phoenix%20Park">Phoenix Park</a> was completed, the foundation stone having been laid in 1817. This vast obelisk, high and square at the base, honoured <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington</a>, Dublin-born and a former <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20for%20Ireland">Chief Secretary for Ireland</a>. Unlike the Pillar, Wellington's obelisk has attracted little controversy and has not been the subject of physical attacks.

On <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a>, 24 April 1916, units of the <a href="Irish%20Volunteers">Irish Volunteers</a> and the <a href="Irish%20Citizen%20Army">Irish Citizen Army</a> seized several prominent buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the <a href="General%20Post%20Office%2C%20Dublin">General Post Office</a> (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> occurred near the Pillar when <a href="lancer">lancer</a>s from the nearby <a href="Marlborough%20Street%2C%20Dublin">Marlborough Street</a> barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.

During the days that followed, Sackville Street and particularly the area around the Pillar became a battleground. According to some histories, insurgents attempted to blow up the Pillar. The accounts are unconfirmed and were disputed by many that fought in the Rising, on the grounds that the Pillar's large base provided them with useful cover as they moved to and from other rebel positions. By Thursday night, British artillery fire had set much of Sackville Street ablaze, but according to the writer Peter De Rosa's account: "On his pillar, Nelson surveyed it all serenely, as though he were lit up by a thousand lamps". The statue was visible against the fiery backdrop from as far as <a href="Killiney">Killiney</a>, away.

By Saturday, when the provisional government finally surrendered, many of the Sackville Street buildings between the Pillar and the Liffey had been destroyed or badly damaged, including the Imperial Hotel that Thackeray had admired. Of the GPO, only the façade remained; against the tide of opinion <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> said the demolition of the city's classical architecture scarcely mattered: "What does matter is the Liffey slums have not been demolished". An account in a New York newspaper reported that the Pillar had been lost in the destruction of the street, but it had sustained only minor damage, chiefly bullet marks on the column and statue itself—one shot is said to have taken off Nelson's nose.

After the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish war of Independence 1919–21</a> and the <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">treaty</a> that followed, Ireland was partitioned; Dublin became the capital of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>, a <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a> within the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth of Nations</a>. From December 1922, when the Free State was inaugurated, the Pillar became an issue for the Irish rather than the British government. In 1923, when Sackville Street was again in ruins during the <a href="Irish%20Civil%20War">Irish Civil War</a>, "The Irish Builder and Engineer" magazine called the original siting of the Pillar a "blunder" and asked for its removal, a view echoed by the Dublin Citizens Association. The poet <a href="William%20Butler%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats</a>, who had become a member of the <a href="Seanad%20%C3%89ireann%20%28Irish%20Free%20State%29">Irish Senate</a>, favoured its re-erection elsewhere, but thought it should not, as some wished, be destroyed, because "the life and work of the people who built it are part of our tradition."

Sackville Street was renamed O'Connell Street in 1924. The following year the <a href="Dublin%20Metropolitan%20Police">Dublin Metropolitan Police</a> and the Dublin Civic Survey demanded legislation to allow the Pillar's removal, without success. Pressure continued, and in 1926 "The Manchester Guardian" reported that the Pillar was to be taken down, "as it was a hindrance to modern traffic". Requests for action—removal, destruction or the replacement of the statue with that of an Irish hero—continued up to the Second World War and beyond; the main stumbling blocks remained the trustees' strict interpretation of the terms of the trust, and the unwillingness of successive Irish governments to take legislative action. In 1936 the magazine of the ultra-nationalist <a href="Blueshirts">Blueshirts</a> movement remarked that this inactivity showed a failure in the national spirit: "The conqueror is gone, but the scars which he left remain, and the victim will not even try to remove them".

By 1949 the Irish Free State had evolved into the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> and left the British Commonwealth, but not all Irish opinion favoured the removal of the Pillar. That year the architectural historian <a href="John%20Harvey%20%28historian%29">John Harvey</a> called it "a grand work", and argued that without it, "O'Connell Street would lose much of its vitality". Most of the pressure to get rid of it, he said, came from "traffic maniacs who ... fail to visualise the chaos which would result from creating a through current of traffic at this point". In a 1955 radio broadcast <a href="Thomas%20Bodkin">Thomas Bodkin</a>, former director of the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Ireland">National Gallery of Ireland</a>, praised not only the monument, but Nelson himself: "He was a man of extraordinary gallantry. He lost his eye fighting bravely, and his arm in a similar fashion".

On 29 October 1955, a group of nine students from <a href="University%20College%20Dublin">University College Dublin</a> obtained keys from the Pillar's custodian and locked themselves inside, with an assortment of equipment including <a href="flamethrower">flame thrower</a>s. From the gallery they hung a poster of <a href="Kevin%20Barry">Kevin Barry</a>, a Dublin <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army">Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) volunteer executed by the British during the War of Independence. A crowd gathered below, and began to sing the <a href="Irish%20rebel%20music">Irish rebel</a> song "<a href="Kevin%20Barry%20%28song%29">Kevin Barry</a>". Eventually members of the <a href="Garda%20S%C3%ADoch%C3%A1na">Gardaí</a> (Irish police) broke into the Pillar and ended the demonstration. No action was taken against the students, whose principal purpose, the Gardaí claimed, was publicity.

In 1956, members of the <a href="Fianna%20F%C3%A1il">Fianna Fáil</a> party, then in opposition, proposed that the statue be replaced by one of <a href="Robert%20Emmet">Robert Emmet</a>, Protestant leader of <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201803">an abortive rebellion in 1803</a>. They thought that such a gesture might inspire Protestants in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> to fight for a reunited Ireland. In the North the possibility of dismantling and re-erecting the monument in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a> was raised in the <a href="Executive%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council%20of%20Northern%20Ireland">Stormont parliament</a>, but the initiative failed to gain the support of the Northern Ireland government.

In 1959 a new Fianna Fáil government under <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20Lemass">Seán Lemass</a> deferred the question of the Pillar's removal on the grounds of cost; five years later Lemass agreed to "look at" the question of replacing Nelson's statue with one of <a href="Patrick%20Pearse">Patrick Pearse</a>, the leader of the Easter Rising, in time for the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966. An offer from the Irish-born American trade union leader <a href="Mike%20Quill">Mike Quill</a> to finance the removal of the Pillar was not taken up, and as the anniversary approached, Nelson remained in place.

8 March 1966, a powerful explosion destroyed the upper portion of the Pillar and brought Nelson's statue crashing to the ground amid hundreds of tons of rubble. O'Connell Street was almost deserted at the time, although a dance in the nearby <a href="Hotel%20Metropole%2C%20Dublin">Hotel Metropole</a>'s ballroom was about to end and bring crowds on to the street. There were no casualties—a taxi-driver parked close by had a narrow escape—and damage to property was relatively light given the strength of the blast. What was left of the Pillar was a jagged stump, high.

In the first government response to the action the <a href="Minister%20for%20Justice%20and%20Equality">Justice minister</a>, <a href="Brian%20Lenihan%20Snr">Brian Lenihan</a>, condemned what he described as "an outrage which was planned and committed without any regard to the lives of the citizens". This response was considered "tepid" by "The Irish Times", whose editorial deemed the attack "a direct blow to the prestige of the state and the authority of the government". Kennedy suggests that government anger was mainly directed at what they considered a distraction from the official 50th anniversary celebrations of the Rising.

The absence of the pillar was regretted by some who felt the city had lost one of its most prominent landmarks. The Irish Literary Association was anxious that, whatever future steps were taken, the lettering on the pedestal should be preserved; the "<a href="Irish%20Times">Irish Times</a>" reported that the <a href="Royal%20Irish%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Irish Academy of Music</a> was considering legal measures to prevent removal of the remaining stump. Reactions among the general public were relatively light-hearted, typified by the numerous songs inspired by the incident. These included the immensely popular "<a href="Up%20Went%20Nelson">Up Went Nelson</a>", set to the tune of "<a href="John%20Brown%27s%20Body">John Brown's Body</a>" and performed by a group of Belfast schoolteachers, which remained at the top of the Irish charts for eight weeks. An American newspaper reported that the mood in the city was one of gaiety, with shouts of "Nelson has lost his last battle!" Some accounts relate that the <a href="President%20of%20Ireland">Irish president</a>, <a href="%C3%89amon%20de%20Valera">Éamon de Valera</a>, phoned "<a href="The%20Irish%20Press">The Irish Press</a>" to suggest the headline: "British Admiral Leaves Dublin By Air"—according to the senator and presidential candidate <a href="David%20Norris%20%28politician%29">David Norris</a>, "the only recorded instance of humour in that lugubrious figure".
The Pillar's fate was sealed when Dublin Corporation issued a "dangerous building" notice. The trustees agreed that the stump should be removed. A last-minute request by the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20the%20Architects%20of%20Ireland">Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland</a> for an injunction to delay the demolition on planning grounds was rejected by Justice <a href="Thomas%20Teevan%20%28attorney%20general%29">Thomas Teevan</a>. On 14 March, the Army destroyed the stump by a controlled explosion, watched at a safe distance by a crowd who, the press reported, "raised a resounding cheer". There was a scramble for souvenirs, and many parts of the stonework were taken from the scene. Some of these relics, including Nelson's head, eventually found their way into museums; parts of the lettered stonework from the pedestal are displayed in the grounds of the <a href="Butler%20House%2C%20Kilkenny">Butler House</a> hotel in <a href="Kilkenny">Kilkenny</a>, while smaller remnants were used to decorate private gardens. Contemporary and subsequent accounts record that the army's explosion caused more damage than the first, but this, Fallon says, is a myth; damage claims arising from the second explosion amounted to less than a quarter of the sum claimed as a result of the original blast.

It was initially assumed that the monument was destroyed by the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281922%E2%80%9369%29">IRA</a>. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reported on 9 March that six men had been arrested and questioned, but their identities were not revealed and there were no charges. An IRA spokesman denied involvement, stating that they had no interest in demolishing mere symbols of foreign domination: "We are interested in the destruction of the domination itself". In the absence of any leads, rumours suggested that the <a href="ETA%20%28separatist%20group%29">Basque separatist movement ETA</a> might be responsible, perhaps as part of a training exercise with an Irish republican splinter group; in the mid-1960s the explosives expertise of ETA was generally acknowledged.

No further information was forthcoming until 2000, when during a <a href="Raidi%C3%B3%20Teilif%C3%ADs%20%C3%89ireann">Raidió Teilifís Éireann</a> interview a former IRA member, Liam Sutcliffe, claimed he had placed the bomb which detonated in the Pillar. In the 1950s Sutcliffe was associated with a group of dissident volunteers led by Joe Christle (1927–98), who had been expelled from the IRA in 1956 for "recklessness". In early 1966 Sutcliffe learned that Christle's group was planning "Operation Humpty Dumpty", an attack on the Pillar, and offered his services. According to Sutcliffe, on 28 February he placed a bomb within the Pillar, timed to go off in the early hours of the next morning. The explosive was a mixture of <a href="gelignite">gelignite</a> and <a href="ammonal">ammonal</a>. It failed to detonate; Sutcliffe says that he returned early the next morning, recovered the device and redesigned its timer. On 7 March, shortly before the Pillar closed for the day, he climbed the inner stairway and placed the refurbished bomb near to the top of the shaft before going home. He learned of the success of his mission the next day, he says, having slept undisturbed through the night. Following his revelations, Sutcliffe was questioned by An Garda Síochána (the Irish police) but not charged. He did not name others involved in the action, apart from Christle and his brother.

On 29 April 1969 the Irish parliament passed the Nelson Pillar Act, terminating the Pillar Trust and vesting ownership of the site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income. In the debate, Senator <a href="Owen%20Sheehy-Skeffington">Owen Sheehy-Skeffington</a> argued that the Pillar had been capable of repair and should have been re-assembled and rebuilt.

For more than twenty years the site stood empty, while various campaigns sought to fill the space. In 1970 the Arthur Griffith Society suggested a monument to <a href="Arthur%20Griffith">Arthur Griffith</a>, founder of <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, and Pearse, whose centenary would fall in 1979, was the subject of several proposals. None of these schemes were accepted by the Corporation. A request in 1987 by the Dublin Metropolitan Streets Commission that the Pillar be rebuilt—with a different statue—was likewise rejected. In 1988, as part of the city's 1,000th anniversary celebrations, the Smurfit Millennium Fountain was erected close to the site. This was commissioned by Dublin businessman Michael Smurfit in memory of his father; it incorporated a <a href="Anna%20Livia%20%28monument%29">bronze statue</a> of a woman, representing the nearby <a href="River%20Liffey">river Liffey</a>, and was sculpted by <a href="%C3%89amonn%20O%27Doherty%20%28sculptor%29">Éamonn O'Doherty</a>. The monument, known colloquially as "the Floozey in the Jacuzzi", was not universally appreciated; O'Doherty's fellow-sculptor <a href="Edward%20Delaney">Edward Delaney</a> called it an "atrocious eyesore".

1988 saw the launch of the Pillar Project, aimed at encouraging artists and architects to bring forward new ideas for an appropriate permanent memorial to replace Nelson. Suggestions included a flagpole, a triumphal arch modelled on the Paris <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a>, and a "Tower of Light" with a platform that would restore Nelson's view over the city. In 1997 Dublin Corporation announced a formal design competition for a monument to mark the new millennium in 2000. The winning entry was <a href="Ian%20Ritchie%20%28architect%29">Ian Ritchie</a>'s <a href="Spire%20of%20Dublin">Spire of Dublin</a>, a plain, needle-like structure rising from the street. The design was approved; on 22 January 2003 it was completed, despite some political and artistic opposition. During the excavations preceding the Spire's construction, the foundation stone of the Nelson Pillar was recovered. Press stories that a time capsule containing valuable coins had also been discovered fascinated the public for a while, but proved illusory.

The destruction of the Pillar brought a temporary glut of popular songs, including "<a href="Nelson%27s%20Farewell">Nelson's Farewell</a>", by <a href="The%20Dubliners">The Dubliners</a>, in which Nelson's airborne demise is presented as Ireland's contribution to the <a href="space%20race">space race</a>. During its more than 150 years, the Pillar was an integral if controversial part of Dublin life, and was often reflected in Irish literature of the period. <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>'s novel "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>" (1922) is a meticulous depiction of the city on a single day, 16 June 1904. At the base of the Pillar trams from all parts of the city come and go; meanwhile the character <a href="Stephen%20Dedalus">Stephen Dedalus</a> fantasises a scene involving two elderly spinsters, who climb the steps to the viewing gallery where they eat plums and spit the stones down on those below, while gazing up at "the one-handled adulterer".

Joyce shared Yeats's view that Ireland's association with England was an essential element in a shared history, and asked: "Tell me why you think I ought to change the conditions that gave Ireland and me a shape and a destiny?" <a href="Oliver%20St.%20John%20Gogarty">Oliver St. John Gogarty</a>, in his literary memoir "<a href="As%20I%20Was%20Going%20Down%20Sackville%20Street">As I Was Going Down Sackville Street</a>", considers the Pillar "the grandest thing we have in Dublin", where "the statue in whiter stone gazed forever south towards Trafalgar and the Nile". That Pillar, says Gogarty, "marks the end of a civilization, the culmination of the great period of eighteenth century Dublin". Yeats's 1927 poem "The Three Monuments" has Parnell, Nelson and O'Connell on their respective monuments, mocking Ireland's post-independence leaders for their rigid morality and lack of courage, the obverse of the qualities of the "three old rascals".<br>A later writer, <a href="Brendan%20Behan">Brendan Behan</a>, in his "Confessions of an Irish Rebel" (1965) wrote from a <a href="Fenian">Fenian</a> perspective that Ireland owed Nelson nothing and that Dublin's poor regarded the Pillar as "a gibe at their own helplessness in their own country". In his poem "Dublin" (1939), written as the remaining vestiges of British overlordship were being removed from Ireland, <a href="Louis%20MacNeice">Louis MacNeice</a> envisages "Nelson on his pillar/ Watching his world collapse".<br><a href="Austin%20Clarke%20%28poet%29">Austin Clarke</a>'s 1957 poem "Nelson's Pillar, Dublin" scorns the various schemes to remove the monument and concludes "Let him watch the sky/ With those who rule. Stone eye/ And telescopes can prove/ Our blessings are above".

<a href="John%20Boyne">John Boyne</a>'s 2017 novel "The Heart's Invisible Furies" includes a scene in the middle of the book that features the explosion at the plillar.

Manchester Mark 1

The Manchester Mark 1 was one of the earliest <a href="stored-program%20computer">stored-program computer</a>s, developed at the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Manchester">Victoria University of Manchester</a> from the <a href="Manchester%20Baby">Manchester Baby</a> (operational in June 1948). It was also called the Manchester Automatic Digital Machine, or MADM. Work began in August 1948, and the first version was operational by April 1949; a program written to search for <a href="Mersenne%20primes">Mersenne primes</a> ran error-free for nine hours on the night of 16/17 June 1949.

The machine's successful operation was widely reported in the British press, which used the phrase "electronic brain" in describing it to their readers. That description provoked a reaction from the head of the University of Manchester's Department of Neurosurgery, the start of a long-running debate as to whether an electronic computer could ever be truly creative.

The Mark 1 was to provide a computing resource within the university, to allow researchers to gain experience in the practical use of computers, but it very quickly also became a prototype on which the design of <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a>'s commercial version could be based. Development ceased at the end of 1949, and the machine was scrapped towards the end of 1950, replaced in February 1951 by a <a href="Ferranti%20Mark%201">Ferranti Mark 1</a>, the world's first commercially available general-purpose electronic computer.

The computer is especially historically significant because of its pioneering inclusion of <a href="index%20register">index register</a>s, an innovation which made it easier for a program to read sequentially through an array of <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">words</a> in memory. Thirty-four patents resulted from the machine's development, and many of the ideas behind its design were incorporated in subsequent commercial products such as the and <a href="IBM%20702">702</a> as well as the Ferranti Mark 1. The chief designers, <a href="Frederic%20Calland%20Williams">Frederic C. Williams</a> and <a href="Tom%20Kilburn">Tom Kilburn</a>, concluded from their experiences with the Mark 1 that computers would be used more in scientific roles than in pure mathematics. In 1951, they started development work on Meg, the Mark 1's successor, which would include a <a href="floating%20point%20unit">floating point unit</a>.

In 1936, mathematician <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> published a definition of a theoretical "universal computing machine", a computer which held its program on tape, along with the data being worked on. Turing proved that such a machine was capable of solving any conceivable mathematical problem for which an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> could be written. During the 1940s, Turing and others such as <a href="Konrad%20Zuse">Konrad Zuse</a> developed the idea of using the computer's own memory to hold both the program and data, instead of tape, but it was mathematician <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> who became widely credited with defining that <a href="Stored-program%20computer">stored-program computer architecture</a>, on which the Manchester Mark 1 was based.

The practical construction of a von Neumann computer depended on the availability of a suitable memory device. The <a href="University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>'s <a href="Manchester%20Baby">Baby</a>, the world's first electronic stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the <a href="Williams%20tube">Williams tube</a>, an early form of computer memory based on a standard <a href="cathode%20ray%20tube">cathode ray tube</a> (CRT), by running its first program on 21 June 1948. Early electronic computers were generally programmed by being rewired, or via <a href="patch%20panel">plugs and patch panels</a>; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>, for instance. Stored-program computers were also being developed by other researchers, notably the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Physical Laboratory</a>'s <a href="Pilot%20ACE">Pilot ACE</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>'s <a href="EDSAC">EDSAC</a>, and the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a>'s <a href="EDVAC">EDVAC</a>. The Baby and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of <a href="Williams%20tube">Williams tube</a>s as memory devices, instead of mercury <a href="delay%20line%20memory">delay line</a>s.

From about August 1948, the Baby was intensively developed as a prototype for the Manchester Mark 1, initially with the aim of providing the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948, UK Government Chief Scientist <a href="Ben%20Lockspeiser">Ben Lockspeiser</a> was given a demonstration of the prototype Mark 1 while on a visit to the University of Manchester. Lockspeiser was so impressed by what he saw that he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. In his letter to the company, dated 26 October 1948, Lockspeiser authorised the company to "proceed on the lines we discussed, namely, to construct an electronic calculating machine to the instructions of Professor F. C. Williams". From that point on, development of the Mark 1 had the additional purpose of supplying Ferranti with a design on which to base their commercial machine. The government's contract with Ferranti ran for five years from November 1948, and involved an estimated £35,000 per year (equivalent to £ per year in ).

The Baby had been designed by the team of <a href="Frederic%20Calland%20Williams">Frederic C. Williams</a>, <a href="Tom%20Kilburn">Tom Kilburn</a> and <a href="Geoff%20Tootill">Geoff Tootill</a>. To develop the Mark 1 they were joined by two research students, D. B. G. Edwards and G. E. Thomas; work began in earnest in August 1948. The project soon had the dual purpose of supplying Ferranti with a working design on which they could base a commercial machine, the Ferranti Mark 1, and of building a computer that would allow researchers to gain experience of how such a machine could be used in practice. The first of the two versions of the Manchester Mark 1 – known as the Intermediary Version – was operational by April 1949. However, this first version lacked features such as the instructions necessary to programmatically transfer data between the main store and its newly developed magnetic backing store, which had to be done by halting the machine and manually initiating the transfer. These missing features were incorporated in the Final Specification version, which was fully working by October 1949. The machine contained 4,050 <a href="vacuum%20tube">valve</a>s and had a power consumption of 25 <a href="watt">kilowatts</a>. To increase reliability, purpose-built CRTs made by <a href="General%20Electric%20Company%20plc">GEC</a> were used in the machine instead of the standard devices used in the Baby.

The Baby's 32-bit <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">word length</a> was increased to 40 <a href="bit">bit</a>s. Each word could hold either one 40-bit number or two 20-bit program instructions. The main store initially consisted of two double-density Williams tubes, each holding two arrays of 32 x 40-bit <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">words</a> – known as <a href="Page%20%28computing%29">pages</a> – backed up by a magnetic drum capable of storing an additional 32 pages. The capacity was increased in the Final Specification version to eight pages of main store on four Williams tubes and 128 magnetic drum pages of backing store. The diameter drum, initially known as a magnetic wheel, contained a series of parallel magnetic tracks around its surface, each with its own read/write head. Each track held 2,560 bits, corresponding to two pages (2×32×40 bits). One revolution of the drum took 30 <a href="milliseconds">milliseconds</a>, during which time both pages could be transferred to the <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT</a> main memory, although the actual data transfer time depended on the latency, the time it took for a page to arrive under the read/write head. Writing pages to the drum took about twice as long as reading. The drum's rotational speed was synchronised to the main central <a href="Clock%20rate">processor clock</a>, which allowed for additional drums to be added. Data was recorded onto the drum using a <a href="phase%20modulation">phase modulation</a> technique still known today as <a href="Manchester%20code">Manchester coding</a>.

The machine's <a href="instruction%20set">instruction set</a> was increased from the 7 of the Baby to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware. This increased to 30 instructions in the Final Specification version. Ten bits of each word were allocated to hold the <a href="instruction%20set">instruction code</a>. The standard instruction time was 1.8 milliseconds, but multiplication was much slower, depending on the size of the <a href="operand">operand</a>.

The machine's most significant innovation is generally considered to be its incorporation of <a href="index%20registers">index registers</a>, commonplace on modern computers. The Baby had included two registers, implemented as Williams tubes: the <a href="Accumulator%20%28computing%29">accumulator</a> (A) and the <a href="program%20counter">program counter</a> (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index registers, originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the registers could be used to modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the <a href="multiplication">multiplicand</a> and multiplier for a multiplication operation.

Of the 20 bits allocated for each program instruction, 10 were used to hold the <a href="instruction%20set">instruction code</a>, which allowed for 1,024 (2) different instructions. The machine had 26 initially, increasing to 30 when the function codes to programmatically control the data transfer between the magnetic drum and the cathode ray tube (CRT) main store were added. On the Intermediary Version programs were input by key switches, and the output was displayed as a series of dots and dashes on a cathode ray tube known as the output device, just as on the Baby from which the Mark 1 had been developed. However, the Final Specification machine, completed in October 1949, benefitted from the addition of a <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> with a 5-hole <a href="punched%20tape">paper-tape reader and punch</a>.

Mathematician <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>, who had been appointed to the nominal post of Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester in September 1948, devised a <a href="base%20%28exponentiation%29">base 32</a> encoding scheme based on the standard <a href="ITA2">ITA2</a> 5-bit teleprinter code, which allowed programs and data to be written to and read from paper tape. The ITA2 system maps each of the possible 32 binary values that can be represented in 5 bits (2) to a single character. Thus "10010" represents "D", "10001" represents "Z", and so forth. Turing changed only a few of the standard encodings; for instance, 00000 and 01000, which mean "no effect" and "linefeed" in the teleprinter code, were represented by the characters "/" and "@" respectively. Binary zero, represented by the forward slash, was the most common character in programs and data, leading to sequences written as "///////////////". One early user suggested that Turing's choice of a forward slash was a subconscious choice on his part, a representation of rain seen through a dirty window, reflecting Manchester's "famously dismal" weather.

Because the Mark 1 had a 40-bit word length, eight 5-bit teleprinter characters were required to encode each word. Thus for example the binary word:

10001 10010 10100 01001 10001 11001 01010 10110 would be represented on paper tape as ZDSLZWRF. The contents of any word in store could also be set via the teleprinter's keyboard, and output onto its printer. The machine worked internally in binary, but it was able to carry out the necessary decimal to binary and binary to decimal conversions for its input and output respectively.

There was no <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a> defined for the Mark 1. Programs had to be written and submitted in binary form, encoded as eight 5-bit characters for each 40-bit word; programmers were encouraged to memorize the modified ITA2 coding scheme to make their job easier. Data was read and written from the papertape punch under program control. The Mark 1 had no system of <a href="interrupt">hardware interrupt</a>s; the program continued after a read or write operation had been initiated until another input/output instruction was encountered, at which point the machine waited for the first to complete.

The Mark 1 had no <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>; its only system software was a few basic routines for input and output. As in the Baby from which it was developed, and in contrast to the established mathematical convention, the machine's storage was arranged with the least significant digits to the left; thus a one was represented in five bits as "10000", rather than the more conventional "00001". Negative numbers were represented using <a href="two%27s%20complement">two's complement</a>, as most computers still do today. In that representation, the value of the most significant bit denotes the sign of a number; positive numbers have a zero in that position and negative numbers a one. Thus the range of numbers that could be held in each 40-bit word was −2 to +2 − 1 (decimal: -549,755,813,888 to +549,755,813,887).

The first realistic program to be run on the Mark 1 was a search for <a href="Mersenne%20primes">Mersenne primes</a>, in early April 1949, which ran error free for nine hours on the night of 16/17 June 1949.

The algorithm was specified by <a href="Max%20Newman">Max Newman</a>, head of the Mathematics Department at the <a href="University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, and the program was written by Kilburn and Tootill. Alan Turing later wrote an optimised version of the program, dubbed the Mersenne Express.

The Manchester Mark 1 continued to do useful mathematical work until 1950, including an investigation of the <a href="Riemann%20hypothesis">Riemann hypothesis</a> and calculations in <a href="optics">optics</a>.

Tootill was temporarily transferred from the University of Manchester to Ferranti in August 1949, to continue work on the Ferranti Mark 1's design, and spent four months working with the company. The Manchester Mark 1 was dismantled and scrapped in August 1950, replaced a few months later by the first Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.

Between 1946 and 1949, the average size of the design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the Baby, had been about four people. During that time 34 patents were taken out based on the team's work, either by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Supply">Ministry of Supply</a> or by its successor, the <a href="National%20Research%20Development%20Corporation">National Research Development Corporation</a>. In July 1949, <a href="IBM">IBM</a> invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company subsequently licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the Williams tube, in the design of its own <a href="IBM%20701">701</a> and <a href="IBM%20702">702</a> computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names of Williams, Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman.

Kilburn and Williams concluded that computers would be used more in scientific roles than pure maths, and decided to develop a new machine that would include a <a href="floating%20point%20unit">floating point unit</a>. Work began in 1951, and the resulting machine, which ran its first program in May 1954, was known as Meg, or the megacycle machine. It was smaller and simpler than the Mark 1, and much faster for maths problems. <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> produced a version of Meg with the Williams tubes replaced by the more reliable <a href="core%20memory">core memory</a>, marketed as the <a href="Ferranti%20Mercury">Ferranti Mercury</a>.

The successful operation of the Manchester Mark 1 and its predecessor, the Baby, was widely reported in the British press, which used the phrase "electronic brain" to describe the machines. Lord <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Louis Mountbatten</a> had earlier introduced that term in a speech delivered to the British Institution of Radio Engineers on 31 October 1946, in which he speculated about how the primitive computers then available might evolve. The excitement surrounding the reporting in 1949 of what was the first recognisably modern computer provoked a reaction unexpected by its developers; Sir <a href="Geoffrey%20Jefferson">Geoffrey Jefferson</a>, professor of neurosurgery at the University of Manchester, on being asked to deliver the <a href="Lister%20Medal">Lister Oration</a> on 9 June 1949 chose "The Mind of Mechanical Man" as his subject. His purpose was to "debunk" the Manchester project. In his address he said:

"<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" reported on Jefferson's speech the following day, adding that Jefferson forecast that "the day would never dawn when the gracious rooms of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> would be converted into garages to house these new fellows". This was interpreted as a deliberate slight to Newman, who had secured a grant from the society to continue the work of the Manchester team. In response Newman wrote a follow-up article for "The Times", in which he claimed that there was a close analogy between the structure of the Mark 1 and the human brain. His article included an interview with Turing, who added:

Ellis Wackett

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> Ellis Charles Wackett, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">CB</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> (13 August 1901 – 3 August 1984) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Its chief engineer from 1935 to 1959, he served on the RAAF's controlling body, the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, for a record seventeen years, and has been credited with infusing operations with new standards of <a href="airworthiness">airworthiness</a>. Commencing his service career as a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> cadet during World War I, Wackett transferred to the Air Force in 1923 while on an engineering course in Britain. He qualified as a pilot before completing his studies and returning to Australia, where he inaugurated parachute instruction within the RAAF and made the country's first freefall descent from a military aircraft in 1926. The following year, he led a three-month survey flight to <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>.

Wackett became the RAAF's senior engineer with his appointment as Director of Technical Services in 1935. A <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> at the outbreak of World War II, he rose to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> by 1942 and assumed the role of Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance. He established the Technical Branch as a separate department of the RAAF in 1948, and was promoted to air vice marshal the same year. Wackett served as Air Member for Technical Services until leaving the military in 1959, having been appointed <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> and <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>. From 1960 to 1968, he was a member of the Australian National Airlines Commission, parent of <a href="Trans%20Australia%20Airlines">Trans Australia Airlines</a>. Generally known as "Wack", or "EC" (to distinguish him from his elder brother, aircraft designer <a href="Lawrence%20Wackett">Lawrence James Wackett</a> or "LJ"), his prominent chin and nose also earned him the nickname "<a href="Punch%20and%20Judy">Punch</a>". He died in 1984 at the age of 83.

Born on 13 August 1901 in <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, Ellis Wackett was the third and youngest child of James, an English-born storekeeper, and Alice Wackett (née Lawrence). Following schooling in Townsville, he entered the <a href="HMAS%20Creswell">Royal Australian Naval College</a> at <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a>, New South Wales, in 1914, aged thirteen. Graduating in 1918, he served as a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> aboard the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> battleship <a href="HMS%20Monarch%20%281911%29">HMS "Monarch"</a> and battlecruiser , and later the RAN light cruiser <a href="HMAS%20Brisbane%20%281915%29">HMAS "Brisbane"</a> and battlecruiser <a href="HMAS%20Australia%20%281911%29">HMAS "Australia"</a>. He was commissioned a <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a> in January 1921, and posted to England for study in July. Wackett was at the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Engineering%20College">Royal Naval Engineering College</a>, <a href="Keyham%2C%20Devon">Keyham</a>, when he applied to join the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1922. Accepted by the Air Force the following year, he finished at Keyham in August and trained as a pilot on <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a>. He then took a one-year <a href="Postgraduate%20education">post-graduate</a> course in <a href="aeronautics">aeronautics</a> at the <a href="Imperial%20College%20London">Imperial College of Science and Technology, London</a>, before returning to Australia to take up his service as a <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> with the RAAF.

Wackett's first role was to establish parachute instruction within the Air Force. His trip home from England had been postponed at the last minute to enable him to be trained; he began instructing volunteers in 1926 at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, and made Australia's first freefall descent from a military aircraft—an <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>—on 26 May. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Group Captain <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, himself made a successful jump on 5 August, to set "a good example" prior to making the wearing of parachutes compulsory for all aircrew. On 21 August, Wackett piloted the DH.9 from which Flying Officer <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a> made the first public display of parachuting in Australia, at <a href="Essendon%2C%20Victoria">Essendon</a>, Victoria.
By August 1927, Wackett had been promoted <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> and given command of the Papuan Survey Flight formed at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria. Consisting of two <a href="Supermarine%20Seagull%20%281921%29">Supermarine Seagull III</a> single-engined amphibious biplanes and six aircrew, the flight was to examine and photograph the <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papuan</a> and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>n coasts as far north as <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a> and, if possible, <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a>. Stripped of all equipment considered non-essential—including radio sets—to increase range, the aircraft departed on 27 September and journeyed some , covering almost of country and taking 350 photos. Wackett's machine (serial A9-5) returned to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 26 December and the other (A9–6) on 19 January 1928. Inclement weather prevented the expedition from reaching Bougainville, and thick jungle cover limited the usefulness of its photographic record. Nevertheless, the Air Force learned valuable lessons concerning the Seagull's capabilities in a potential wartime role, as it was found to be unsuited to operations in the tropics.

On 14 August 1928, Wackett married Doreen Dove; the couple would have two sons and a daughter. In 1933, Wackett was posted to England to attend <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>. Returning to Australia, he was promoted <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> and became Director of Technical Services, an organisation within the RAAF's Supply Branch, in May 1935; the appointment made Wackett the Air Force's senior engineer. The same year, he took charge of the Resources Committee for Electrical Equipment, Scientific and Optical Instruments, one of several subcommittees on the federal government's Defence Resources Board set up to investigate and report on the readiness of Australian industry to provide munitions for defence in the event of international conflict.

Ranked <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> at the outbreak of World War II, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges in his role as Director of Technical Services. Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment. He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's technical services organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the <a href="Commonwealth%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, <a href="motion%20sickness">motion sickness</a>, <a href="decompression%20sickness">decompression</a> and <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a>.

Wackett was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1941 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. In June, he became the RAAF's representative on the federal Aircraft Advisory Committee, set up to assist the Director-General of Aircraft Production. As well as members from governmental and scientific bodies, the committee included delegates from aircraft manufacturers such as <a href="de%20Havilland%20Australia">de Havilland Australia</a> and CAC, with Lawrence Wackett acting as Chief Technical Advisor. Later that year, the two brothers joined various academics on the newly formed Australian Council for Aeronautics, established by Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a> to advise government, educational and scientific organisations on technical developments in the aircraft industry.

Raised to <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a>, Wackett was appointed Air Member for Engineering and Maintenance (AME) on 4 June 1942. As AME, he sat on the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a>, the RAAF's controlling body, which consisted of its most senior officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff. His new position had been created to replace that of the Director-General of Supply and Production, a civilian post. Wackett would serve on the Air Board for the next seventeen years, a record tenure for the RAAF, his experience and intellect making him, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "singularly adept at bringing a committee around to his point of view". During the war, the Air Board oversaw expansion from a complement in 1939 of 246 obsolescent machines such as <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>s, <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s and <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>s, to a strength in 1945 of 5,620 sophisticated aircraft including <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s, <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a>s, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">de Havilland Mosquito</a>es and <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a>s; to support this force, the RAAF had provided all-through training for 18,000 technical staff, and further education for 35,000 more schooled initially outside the service.

Following the end of the war, Wackett contributed to "Plan D", the blueprint for restructuring the RAAF sponsored by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>. A major facet of Plan D, adopted in June 1947, was its encouragement of local industry to design and build military trainers and produce more sophisticated combat aircraft under licence from overseas manufacturers. This policy eventually led to the <a href="CAC%20Winjeel">CAC Winjeel</a> basic trainer and Australian co-partnership in production of the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> jet fighter and <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">GAF Canberra</a> jet bomber. Wackett also supported Air Vice Marshal <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>, the <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a>, in fostering apprenticeships as part of the "education revolution" that took place in the RAAF during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The Apprentice Training Scheme, designed to raise the standard of technical roles in the Air Force, opened early in 1948 at the Ground Training School in <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Wagga">RAAF Station Wagga</a>, New South Wales, to provide education and technical training for youths aged fifteen to seventeen. By 1952, it had been renamed the RAAF School of Technical Training.
Wackett played a key role in establishing technical services as a distinct department within the RAAF, rather than forming part of the Supply Branch as in previous years. Mindful of the increasing responsibility that was being placed on scientific and technical resources in the modern Air Force, he had raised the question of a specialist engineering branch immediately after the war, and in March 1946 gained broad approval for its establishment. After eighteen months of work defining its scope and responsibilities, the Technical Branch was formed under Wackett's leadership on 23 September 1948, his goals being "to support the operational power of the RAAF by providing the most efficient technical organisation possible" and "to increase the effectiveness of air power through technical development". This in turn led to a separate "list" of engineering personnel, as opposed to the earlier Technical List subgroup under the General Duties Branch.

For flexibility, and to ensure that the flying and engineering branches had a better appreciation of their respective operations, Wackett supported the practice of some general duties officers continuing to perform engineering work, and as many technical officers as possible receiving secondary training as aircrew. He was disappointed, however, by the limits imposed by the Air Board on career advancement for his personnel. While the General Duties Branch in the late 1940s was permitted to maintain thirty-seven officer positions of group captain and above, the Technical Branch was only allowed fourteen such slots, though both departments had an almost identical overall strength of just under 400 staff. This anomaly led Wackett to submit a dissenting report on the subject to the Air Board, one of the few occasions a board member exercised his right to such a protest. His new organisation caused some other tensions in the RAAF: new <a href="airworthiness">airworthiness</a> considerations frustrated pilots who found their flying time restricted by the introduction of more rigorous maintenance procedures; supply officers feared being "outshone" by the new status accorded to engineers; and so-called "black handers"—old-school technical officers who had risen through the ranks—regarded with disdain the prospect of an influx of "silly young blokes with degrees".
Wackett had been promoted temporary <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> on 1 January 1947; this rank was made substantive following the formation of the Technical Branch. On 31 October 1949, his title was changed from Air Member for Equipment and Maintenance to Air Member for Technical Services (AMTS), in which capacity he would serve until his retirement from the RAAF in 1959. Appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1951 <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a>, Wackett again worked closely with Air Vice Marshal Hewitt, now the Air Member for Supply and Equipment, to introduce the concept of acquiring spare parts based on "life-of-type", whereby the forecast number and type of spares necessary for an aircraft's projected service life would be ordered when it was first deployed, to reduce costs and delivery time.

In 1953, Wackett established advanced diploma training for twenty-five airmen annually at <a href="RMIT%20University">Melbourne Technical College</a>, the graduates receiving commissions as <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a>s. He also began recruiting university-qualified engineers to the Technical Branch, and put in place formal relationships with such bodies as <a href="Commonwealth%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20Organisation">CSIRO</a>, the Council of Aeronautics (of which he was a member), Aeronautical Research Laboratories, and local aircraft manufacturers de Havilland Australia, <a href="Government%20Aircraft%20Factories">Government Aircraft Factories</a>, and CAC. He further initiated RAAF sponsorship of a chair of aeronautics at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. Wackett was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the 1957 New Years Honours. Two years later, his wife Doreen was appointed a <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> for her service as Vice President and, from 1948, President of the RAAF Women's Association.

When Wackett left the Air Force on 31 December 1959, he was its longest-serving officer. The next year he joined the Australian National Airlines Commission (ANAC), the controlling body of the federal government's domestic carrier, <a href="Trans%20Australia%20Airlines">Trans Australia Airlines</a> (TAA). He rose to the Vice Chairmanship of ANAC before retiring in 1968. During his term on the commission, Wackett witnessed the arrival of the <a href="Jet%20Age">Jet Age</a> on domestic air routes; TAA took delivery of its first <a href="Boeing%20727">Boeing 727</a> in 1964, and its first <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-9">Douglas DC-9</a> in 1967. He was also elected a fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Aeronautical%20Society">Royal Aeronautical Society</a>. Like his brother Lawrence, who wrote two books on the subject, Ellis Wackett's chief hobby was <a href="angling">angling</a>. He died in <a href="Warracknabeal%2C%20Victoria">Warracknabeal</a>, Victoria, on 3 August 1984; his wife predeceased him in 1975.

For his commitment to the concept of airworthiness, as an attitude to quality and professionalism that went beyond simply whether aircraft were fit to fly or not, Wackett has been described as one of the "outstanding officers of the post-war era". The establishment of a dedicated Technical Branch, which he founded in 1948, was a key factor in the Air Force developing the ability to successfully manage the maintenance and upgrade of such highly sophisticated aircraft as the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111">General Dynamics F-111</a>. Wackett's 17-year tenure on the Air Board, which was dissolved in 1976, remained the longest of any officer in the RAAF. He was followed by a series of leaders of the Technical Branch (renamed Engineering Branch in 1966) who shared his vision, including Air Vice Marshals <a href="Ernie%20Hey">Ernie Hey</a> (1960–1972) and <a href="James%20Rowland%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">James Rowland</a> (1972–75). Wackett was among those considered as possible successors to Air Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) when the latter was retired in 1952, but Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>' federal government chose an RAF officer for the role, Air Marshal <a href="Donald%20Hardman">Sir Donald Hardman</a>. In any case, Air Force regulations at that time stipulated that appointees had to belong to the RAAF's General Duties (Aircrew) Branch. In 1975, Air Marshal Rowland was appointed as CAS, though he had to transfer from Engineering to General Duties before this could be formalised. The following year, the requirement for CAS to be a member of the General Duties Branch was removed.

Seven other species of "Thomasomys" live in the same areas. First collected in 1903, "T. ucucha" was formally described as a new species in 2003 and most closely resembles "<a href="Thomasomys%20hylophilus">T. hylophilus</a>", which occurs further to the north. The species is listed as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>" in the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> as a result of <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>.

Medium-sized, dark-furred, and long-tailed, "T. ucucha" can be distinguished from all other species of "Thomasomys" by its large, broad, <a href="wikt%3Aprocumbent">procumbent</a> upper <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s. Head and body length is and body mass is . The tail is scarcely furred. The front part of the skull is flat, short, and broad. The <a href="incisive%20foramina">incisive foramina</a>, openings at the front of the <a href="palate">palate</a>, are short, and the palate itself is broad and smooth. The root of the lower incisor is contained in a prominent <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a>.

The first three specimens of "Thomasomys ucucha" were collected in 1903 at <a href="Tabl%C3%B3n">Tablón</a> in <a href="Pichincha%20Province">Pichincha Province</a>, Ecuador, by L. Söderström. It was not found again until Robert S. Voss of the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> collected a total of forty-three specimens at nearby <a href="Papallacta">Papallacta</a>, <a href="Napo%20Province">Napo Province</a>, in 1978 and 1980 (the type locality is described as the valley of the Rio Papallacta). Papallacta is in a remote area that is difficult to access, and the mammal fauna of the region remains poorly known. In 2003, he formally described the animal as a new species, "Thomasomys ucucha", in a publication in "<a href="American%20Museum%20Novitates">American Museum Novitates</a>" in which he also reviewed the mammal fauna of Papallacta. The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a>, "<a href="Thomasomys">Thomasomys</a>", honors English zoologist <a href="Oldfield%20Thomas">Oldfield Thomas</a>, who named about 2,900 <a href="taxon">taxa</a> of mammals, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a>, "ucucha", is the local <a href="Quechua%20languages">Quechua</a> word for "mouse". "T. ucucha" most closely resembles "<a href="Thomasomys%20hylophilus">T. hylophilus</a>", which is found further north in Colombia and Venezuela. A comparison of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> found that "T. ucucha" was closest to specimens identified as "<a href="Thomasomys%20caudivarius">T. caudivarius</a>" and "<a href="Thomasomys%20silvestris">T. silvestris</a>", but "T. hylophilus" was not included in this study. All are members of "Thomasomys", a diverse genus that occurs in the northern Andes, from Bolivia to Venezuela. Together with "<a href="Rhipidomys">Rhipidomys</a>" and a few other, smaller genera, "Thomasomys" forms the tribe <a href="Thomasomyini">Thomasomyini</a>, which includes over fifty species found in South America and Panama. Thomasomyini in turn is part of the subfamily <a href="Sigmodontinae">Sigmodontinae</a> of the family <a href="Cricetidae">Cricetidae</a>, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.

"Thomasomys ucucha" is a medium-sized "Thomasomys" with a relatively long tail. The dense, fine, and soft fur is dark brown on the upperparts, changing gradually into the grey underparts. The mystacial <a href="vibrissae">vibrissae</a> (whiskers above the mouth) are long and extend beyond the ears when laid back against the head. Sparse short, dark hairs are present on the ears. The digits and <a href="metapodial">metapodial</a>s (bones of the centers of the hand and feet) of the hands and feet are covered with dark hairs, but the <a href="ungual%20tufts">ungual tufts</a> at the bases of the claws consist of longer, gray hairs. The fifth digit of the foot is long, with the tip of its claw almost reaching the base of the claw of the fourth digit. The tail is dark and hardly furred, except for a pencil of long hairs at the end; some animals have a white tail tip. Females have six <a href="mammae">mammae</a>. In thirty-six specimens, head and body length is , averaging ; tail length is , averaging ; hindfoot length is , averaging ; ear length is , averaging ; and weight is , averaging .

The front (rostral) part of the <a href="skull">skull</a> is short—shorter and broader than in "T. hylophilus"—and flat and the notches in the <a href="zygomatic%20plate">zygomatic plate</a>s at the sides are poorly developed. The plates themselves are broad. The <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape. The narrow <a href="interorbital%20region">interorbital region</a> (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is robust.

The <a href="incisive%20foramen">incisive foramina</a>, which perforate the <a href="palate">palate</a> between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, are short and do not reach near the first molars; they are longer in "T. hylophilus". They are widest where the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>ry and <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>ry bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple <a href="posterolateral%20palatal%20pits">posterolateral palatal pits</a> at the back of the palate, near the third molars. The <a href="mesopterygoid%20fossa">mesopterygoid fossa</a>, an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small <a href="sphenopalatine%20vacuities">sphenopalatine vacuities</a> where the <a href="sphenoid%20bone">presphenoid</a> and <a href="basisphenoid">basisphenoid</a> bones meet. An <a href="alisphenoid%20strut">alisphenoid strut</a> separates two <a href="foramen">foramina</a> (openings) at the base of the skull, the <a href="buccinator-masticatory%20foramen">buccinator-masticatory foramen</a> and the <a href="foramen%20ovale%20accessorium">foramen ovale accessorium</a>. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of "T. ucucha" follows the primitive pattern. The <a href="tegmen%20tympani">tegmen tympani</a>, the roof of the <a href="tympanic%20cavity">tympanic cavity</a>, overlaps the suspensory <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> of the <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>. At the back of the <a href="mandible">mandible</a> (lower jaw), there is a <a href="capsular%20process">capsular process</a> to receive the root of the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>, which is absent in "T. hylophilus".

The large upper incisors are <a href="orthodont">orthodont</a>, with their cutting edge at about a right angle to the upper molars, and heavily pigmented with orange. Those of "T. hylophilus" are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented. The orthodont upper incisors suffice to distinguish "T. ucucha" from all other members of the genus but "<a href="Thomasomys%20australis">T. australis</a>" and "<a href="Thomasomys%20daphne">T. daphne</a>", which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more <a href="hypsodont">hypsodont</a> (high-crowned) than in other "Thomasomys". The <a href="anterocone">anterocone</a>, the cusp at the front of the first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an <a href="anteromedian%20flexus">anteromedian flexus</a>. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the <a href="anteroloph">anteroloph</a>s and <a href="mesoloph">mesoloph</a>s, are less well-developed than in "T. hylophilus". The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in "T. hylophilus". The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the <a href="anteroconid">anteroconid</a> (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.

The <a href="glans%20penis">glans penis</a> is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough at the top and a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with <a href="penile%20spines">penile spines</a>, except for an area near the tip.

"Thomasomys ucucha" occurs only in the <a href="Cordillera%20Oriental%20%28Ecuador%29">Cordillera Oriental</a> of Ecuador in the provinces of Pichincha, Napo, and <a href="Carchi">Carchi</a>. At Papallacta, "Thomasomys ucucha" was collected in a variety of habitats at altitude, including "<a href="p%C3%A1ramo">páramo</a>" (high-mountain grassland with shrubs and forest patches) and <a href="Yungas">subalpine rainforest</a>. Most were taken in runways (paths through vegetation made by animals) and a few alongside small streams or on a low tree. At <a href="Guandera%20Biological%20Reserve">Guandera Biological Reserve</a> in Carchi, the species has been found at a slightly lower elevation, . Other <a href="muroid">muroid</a> rodents found at the same places as "T. ucucha" include two <a href="akodontines">akodontines</a> (grass mice), "<a href="Akodon%20latebricola">Akodon latebricola</a>" and "<a href="Akodon%20mollis">Akodon mollis</a>"; two <a href="ichthyomyines">ichthyomyines</a> (water rats), "<a href="Anotomys%20leander">Anotomys leander</a>" and "<a href="Neusticomys%20monticolus">Neusticomys monticolus</a>"; two <a href="oryzomyines">oryzomyines</a> (rice rats), "<a href="Microryzomys%20altissimus">Microryzomys altissimus</a>" and "<a href="Microryzomys%20minutus">M. minutus</a>"; the thomasomyine "<a href="Chilomys%20instans">Chilomys instans</a>"; and five other species of "Thomasomys", "<a href="Thomasomys%20aureus">T. aureus</a>", "<a href="Thomasomys%20baeops">T. baeops</a>", "<a href="Thomasomys%20cinnameus">T. cinnameus</a>", "<a href="Thomasomys%20erro">T. erro</a>", and "<a href="Thomasomys%20paramorum">T. paramorum</a>". Other species have been recorded nearby, and Voss wrote that "T. ucucha" may occur <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a>ally with seven other species of "Thomasomys". With "Akodon latebricola" and "Thomasomys erro", "T. ucucha" is one of three species that are known only from the northeastern Andes of Ecuador.

"Thomasomys ucucha" is locally common, but has a very limited known distribution. Its conservation status has been assessed as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>" by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> because of its highly localized distribution; it may be threatened by the destruction of its habitat for <a href="Economy%20of%20South%20America%23Agriculture">agricultural</a> purposes, but occurs near or in several <a href="protected%20area">protected area</a>s.

Danie Mellor

Danie Mellor (born 13 April 1971) is an Australian artist who was the winner of the 2009 <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a>. Born in <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay, Queensland</a>, Mellor grew up in Scotland, Australia, and South Africa before undertaking tertiary studies at <a href="Adelaide%20Centre%20for%20the%20Arts">North Adelaide School of Art</a>, the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> (ANU) and <a href="Birmingham%20Institute%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">Birmingham Institute of Art and Design</a>. He then took up a post lecturing at <a href="Sydney%20College%20of%20the%20Arts">Sydney College of the Arts</a>. He works in different media including <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a>, drawing, painting, and sculpture. Considered a key figure in <a href="contemporary%20Indigenous%20Australian%20art">contemporary Indigenous Australian art</a>, the dominant theme in Mellor's art is the relationship between <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous</a> and non-Indigenous Australian cultures.

Since 2000, Mellor's works have been included regularly in National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award exhibitions; in 2003 he was awarded a "highly commended", for his print "Cyathea cooperi", and in 2009 he won the principal prize, for a mixed media work "From Rite to Ritual". His other major exhibitions have included the "Primavera 2005" show at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Sydney">Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney</a>, and the National Indigenous Art Triennial at the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a> in 2007. In 2012, his work was included in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum of Australia</a>'s exhibition "Menagerie: Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture" as well as in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial, while international recognition came in 2013 with representation in the National Gallery of Canada's exhibition of international indigenous art.

Mellor was born in <a href="Mackay%2C%20Queensland">Mackay, Queensland</a>, in 1971. His father was of American and Australian descent; his mother had Irish, <a href="Mamu">Mamu</a>, <a href="Ngagen">Ngagen</a>, and <a href="Ngajan">Ngajan</a> heritage. Mellor's maternal great-great-grandmother, Eleanor Kelly, and great-grandmother, May Kelly, were <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australian</a> people from the rainforest country around <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a>. The family was <a href="wiktionary%3Aperipatetic">peripatetic</a>: in his first twenty years, Mellor lived in Mackay, Queensland; Scotland; <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, Queensland; <a href="Sutton%20Grange%2C%20Victoria">Sutton Grange, Victoria</a>; <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, South Australia; and <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa, as well as in the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a>. Mellor went to school at <a href="Waldorf%20education">Steiner Schools</a> in South Australia and South Africa; in high school he was taught art by his mother. Looking back at the influence of his schooling upon his art, he remarked how, despite the Eurocentric origins of <a href="Rudolf%20Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a>'s approach to education, "there are comparable elements and themes inherent in [Steiner's] philosophical narrative that parallel an Indigenous outlook, which is holistic in the way it approaches deeper and more intuitive readings of the environment and landscape."

After completing a Certificate in Art at the <a href="Adelaide%20College%20of%20the%20Arts">North Adelaide School of Art</a> in 1991, Mellor undertook a Bachelor of Arts with Honours at the ANU in 1992–1994, and a Masters in Fine Art at <a href="Birmingham%20Institute%20of%20Art%20and%20Design">Birmingham Institute of Art and Design</a>, part of the <a href="Birmingham%20City%20University">Birmingham City University</a>, in 1995–1996. In the early 2000s, he entered a doctorate at the ANU, where he also taught print-media and drawing. He completed his PhD in 2004. As of 2013, Mellor is a lecturer at Sydney College of the Arts, within the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. Mellor is married to artist Joanne Kennedy.

In the early 1990s, Mellor won drawing prizes at the ANU's Canberra School of Art and the <a href="Grafton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Grafton</a> Regional Gallery in New South Wales. Through the mid-1990s, while studying in Canberra and Birmingham, he was represented in numerous student and other exhibitions, in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Korea and the United Kingdom. These included exhibitions titled "Passage", at <a href="Kyoto%20Seika%20University">Kyoto Seika University</a> in Japan in 1994, and "Fragile Objects" at the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library of Australia</a> in 1996.

Mellor's works have been included in the <a href="National%20Aboriginal%20%26amp%3B%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Art%20Award">National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award</a> on several occasions, in 2000, 2001, and every year from 2003 to 2010. In 2003, his <a href="mezzotint">mezzotint</a> print "Cyathea cooperi", portraying <a href="Cyathea%20cooperi">tree ferns native to the Queensland rainforest</a>, was highly commended. Subsequent entries have included "Of fragile dreams the heart which nevermore" in 2005, "Untitled (Ernie Grant in Blackman Street)" in 2006, "Exotic lies and sacred ties (the heart that conceals, the tongue that never reveals)" in 2008, and "A Transcendent Vision (of life, death and resurrection)" in 2010. Reviewing the 2008 exhibition, academic Sarah Scott expressed surprise that Mellor's 2008 piece had neither attracted an award nor been purchased for the Northern Territory's public collection.

"Primavera 2005", an annual exhibition of young artists' work held at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Sydney">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> in Sydney, included Mellor's work "Fig 1-100 (This particular collection made sense)", a mixed media composition that included specimens of <a href="Ulysses%20butterfly">Ulysses butterflies</a>. He has had numerous other exhibitions, both individually and as part of group shows, at galleries including the Queensland Art Gallery in 2003, the Canberra Museum and Art Gallery in 2006, and the Indigenous Ceramic Art Awards, at Shepparton Gallery in Victoria in 2007.

Mellor's work was represented in the first National Indigenous Art Triennial in 2007, with the elaborate (and elaborately named) sculpture "The contrivance of a vintage Wonderland (A magnificent flight of curious fancy for science buffs, a china ark of seductive whimsy, a divinely ordered special attraction, upheld in multifariousness)" featuring a <a href="diorama">diorama</a> that included sculpted <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s made with blue and white crockery fragments (evoking <a href="Spode">Spode</a> <a href="bone%20china">bone china</a>), real kangaroo skin (used for the ears and paws), and <a href="Ocular%20prosthesis">synthetic eyeballs</a>; <a href="Taxidermy">stuffed birds</a> sat in a life-sized mixed-media tree overhead. The work featured in media reports of the exhibition, including by "<a href="The%20Adelaide%20Advertiser">The Adelaide Advertiser</a>", "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>", "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>" and the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>.

Since graduating, Mellor has won several awards, including the Canberra Critic's Choice Award in 2006, and the $15,000 John Tallis National Works on Paper Acquisitive Award in 2008. The following year, he won the Victorian Indigenous Ceramic Art Award, held at Shepparton Art Gallery in <a href="Shepparton%2C%20Victoria">Shepparton, Victoria</a>. In August 2009, Mellor won the AU$40,000 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, for his mixed media work "From Rite to Ritual". It was only the third time in the award's 26 years that an urban Aboriginal artist had been the winner. Earlier that year his solo show at Brisbane's Jan Murphy Gallery had sold out. Also in that year, Mellor's work was featured alongside that of <a href="Patricia%20Piccinini">Patricia Piccinini</a> and <a href="Cherry%20Hood">Cherry Hood</a> in the Newcastle Region Art Gallery's show "Animal Attraction". Though Mellor has not had a painting hung in the <a href="Archibald%20Prize">Archibald Prize</a>, he was the subject of Paul Ryan's portrait that was a 2010 finalist in that competition. In 2012, his work was included in the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Australia">National Museum of Australia</a>'s exhibition "Menagerie: Contemporary Indigenous Sculpture", and in the second National Indigenous Art Triennial. He was also selected for inclusion in that year's <a href="Blake%20Prize">Blake Prize</a>, with his work "Bulluru Storywater". Mellor received international recognition in 2013, when he was included in "Sakahàn", the National Gallery of Canada's "most ambitious contemporary art exhibition in its history".

Among the national collections containing Mellor's work are the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Australia">National Gallery of Australia</a>, which owns his prize-winning "From Rite to Ritual", and the <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House</a> Art Collection. Most other major Australian art collections have holdings, including the <a href="Queensland%20Art%20Gallery">state gallery</a> of his birth state, Queensland, and the main public gallery of the city where he completed much of his tertiary study, the <a href="Canberra%20Museum%20and%20Gallery">Canberra Museum and Gallery</a>. Other state and territory galleries in which he is represented include the <a href="Art%20Gallery%20of%20South%20Australia">Art Gallery of South Australia</a>, the <a href="Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery%20of%20the%20Northern%20Territory">Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory</a> and the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Victoria">National Gallery of Victoria</a>. Public regional galleries that have collected Mellor's creations include Newcastle Regional Art Gallery in New South Wales, and Warrnambool Art Gallery in Victoria. He is also represented in the Australian government's collection, Artbank, as well as in large, private collections such as the Kerry Stokes.

In the 2010s, Mellor became involved in administrative and leadership roles in the arts community. In 2010, he became a member of the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council for the Arts. In 2011, Mellor was not an entrant in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award, as he instead became one of its judges. Appointed to the Visual Arts Board for a further term, Mellor in 2013 became its Chair. At the same time, Mellor continued to exhibit works. In 2014, a survey of his works opened at the <a href="University%20of%20Queensland%20Art%20Museum">University of Queensland Art Museum</a>, and was scheduled to travel to the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory later in the year. The exhibition was favourably reviewed in <a href="theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a>, with art critic Sharne Wolff drawing attention to Mellor's newest sculpture, "Anima", which she said "marks a dramatic change" for the artist, bearing "no resemblance to Mellor’s more glamorous output". His work featured as part of the <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Festival">Edinburgh International Festival</a>, with a show titled "Primordial: SuperNaturalBayiMinyjirral" displayed at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Scotland">National Museum of Scotland</a>.

A large work of Mellor’s, "Entelekheia" (2016), consisting of photographic images of plants etched in concrete, can be found on the exterior walls of the <a href="International%20Convention%20Centre%20Sydney">International Convention Centre</a> in Sydney.

Mellor's extensive scholarly art education has led to his art having a strong theoretical base. In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists, including Indigenous painter <a href="Rover%20Thomas">Rover Thomas</a>, Australian <a href="Sir%20John%20Sulman%20Prize">Sulman Prize</a> winner <a href="Tim%20Storrier">Tim Storrier</a>, <a href="German%20Romanticism">Romantic</a> painters including Germany's <a href="Caspar%20David%20Friedrich">Caspar David Friedrich</a>, and contemporary German artists <a href="Joseph%20Beuys">Joseph Beuys</a>, and Beuys' student <a href="Anselm%20Kiefer">Anselm Kiefer</a>. He has harnessed a wide range of media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics, as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, "<a href="Artlink%20Magazine">Artlink Magazine</a>"'s reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified "how colonisers always get things wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority".

When Sarah Scott considered the 2008 work "Exotic Lies and Sacred Ties", which, like "From Rite to Ritual", drew on evocations of Spode china, she highlighted its exploration of the history of cross-cultural relations. Noting the landscape that forms the central element of the painting, she observed:
"From Rite to Ritual" examined relationships between Indigenous and settler cultures, including differences in spiritual practices. Mellor, in an artist's statement for the awards, described the work as showing "what is a moment of contact, a conversation and interaction between two cultures; it speaks of the challenges of settlement, and the differences in spiritual enactment and belief". Commenting on the work, the judges of the prize remarked that the "surprising scale and layering of imagery, with its understated political and historical references" made the work "outstanding" and of "great complexity and grace". Art writer <a href="Nicolas%20Rothwell">Nicolas Rothwell</a> described the work as drawing a parallel "between Aboriginal initiation rituals and the ceremonies inside a Masonic lodge." 

Mellor's earlier works examined the relationships between cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed "images of native and introduced flora and fauna—for example, a kangaroo with a bull—to symbolise two different peoples and cultures". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition "Native Titled Now", shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, it was important to be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, "so you can talk about their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him "an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history".

For Mellor, Indigenous identity is a theme highlighted both in his work and (not necessarily by his own choice) in public life. As a fair-skinned man with blue eyes and caucasian features, his appearance has occasionally raised questions of "authenticity". Mellor found himself the target of columnist <a href="Andrew%20Bolt">Andrew Bolt</a>, who took issue with Mellor entering and winning the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award. Bolt wrote "This white university lecturer, with his nice Canberra studio, has by winning pushed aside real draw-in-the-dirt Aboriginal artists such as Dorothy Napangardi, Mitjili Napanangka Gibson and Walangkura Napanangka, who had also entered and could really have used that cash and recognition." Commentator Ellie Savage, criticising Bolt, wondered why someone who "neither draws in the dirt nor lives in it" should therefore have "no right to enter competitions for Indigenous artists". Bolt two years later lost a case brought by nine Indigenous Australians—not including Mellor—for racial discrimination over articles that criticised fair-skinned Indigenous people, including the post that had lambasted Mellor. Art writer Maurice O'Riordan, reviewing the 2009 Award, noted the Bolt controversy, but pointed out that Mellor, while in early works acknowledging his own Indigenous heritage, is not concerned with the definition of Aboriginality, but with historical interaction between cultures and the re-imagining of history.

Directed by Greg Colton and written by <a href="Wellesley%20Wild">Wellesley Wild</a>, the episode originally aired on <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> in the United States on September 27, 2009, along with the <a href="Pilot%20%28The%20Cleveland%20Show%29">series premiere</a> of "<a href="The%20Cleveland%20Show">The Cleveland Show</a>". In "Road to the Multiverse", two of the show's main characters, baby genius <a href="Stewie%20Griffin">Stewie</a> and <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> dog <a href="Brian%20Griffin">Brian</a>, both voiced by series creator <a href="Seth%20MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>, use an "out-of-this-world" <a href="remote%20control">remote control</a> to travel through a series of various <a href="Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">parallel universes</a>. They eventually end up in a world where dogs rule and humans obey. Brian becomes reluctant to return to his own universe, and he ultimately ends up breaking the remote, much to the dismay of Stewie, who soon seeks a replacement. The "<a href="Road%20to...%20%28Family%20Guy%29">Road to</a>" episodes which have aired throughout various seasons of "Family Guy" were inspired by the "<a href="Road%20to%20...">Road to ...</a>" comedy films starring <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a>, though this episode was not originally conceived as a "Road to" show.

During the <a href="Family%20Guy%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a>, episodes of "Family Guy" were delayed from regular broadcast due to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike</a>. MacFarlane, the series creator and executive producer, sided with the Writers Guild and participated in the strike until its conclusion. As a result, the <a href="Family%20Guy%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> consisted entirely of hold-overs. "Road to the Multiverse" was the first episode to be produced and aired after the strike ended. It was first announced at the 2008 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>.

Responses to the episode were highly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and use of various animation styles. According to <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>, it was watched by 10.17 million people during its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by Kei Ogawa, Kotaro Watanabe and Jamison Yang, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Greg Colton won a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for Individual Achievement in Animation, for storyboarding the episode, at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. "Road to the Multiverse" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010.

As the <a href="Griffin%20family">Griffin family</a> attend the county fair, <a href="Stewie%20Griffin">Stewie</a> announces that he has bred a winning pedigree pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to <a href="Brian%20Griffin">Brian</a> that he got the pig from a <a href="Multiverse">parallel universe</a>, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog in the same time and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed, so the <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">Dark Ages</a> never occurred and thus humanity is 1000 years more technologically advanced (despite the existence of the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a> in that universe). This leads an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the <a href="Griffin%20family">Griffin family</a>. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.

Continuing their explorations, they reach a universe where humans are subservient to dogs. Stewie finally figures out how to modify the remote device so that they can return home; but Brian, overwhelmed by the thought of a world run by dogs like himself, is reluctant to leave and steals the remote. Stewie and Brian fight over the device, ultimately breaking it, which traps them in the alternative universe. In desperation, the two go to the universe's version of the Griffin family – who are all dogs except for their pet Brian, who is human – hoping to find a solution. The dog version of Stewie quickly confronts the two, revealing that he has also developed a universe-traveling device that would allow them to return to their own universe. Before Dog Stewie can fetch them his remote control, Human Stewie bites the dog version of his father, <a href="Peter%20Griffin">Peter</a>, and is sent to the pound where he is to be <a href="Animal%20euthanasia">euthanized</a> later that day. The two Brians and Dog Stewie go to the human pound to free him, and both Stewie and Brian are sent back to their original universe. As they are being transported, human Brian, dreaming of a better life in a world of intelligent inhabitants, leaps into the inter-universe portal at the last moment and successfully makes it to the original universe with the other two. Excited about his new prospects in life, human Brian begins his optimistic adventure in a brand new universe but is quickly struck by a car.

The episode was first announced at the 2008 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a> in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California, on July 26, 2008. It was written by series regular <a href="Wellesley%20Wild">Wellesley Wild</a> and directed by Greg Colton shortly after the conclusion of the <a href="Family%20Guy%20%28season%207%29">seventh production season</a>, which consisted entirely of held-over episodes due to the <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike</a>. "Road to the Multiverse" is the fifth episode of the "Road to" hallmarks of the series, which have aired in various seasons of the show, and the second to be directed by Colton. The episodes are a parody of the seven "<a href="Road%20to...">Road to...</a>" comedy films starring <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a>. Though it was not originally intended to be a "Road to" episode, Greg Colton convinced series creator and executive producer <a href="Seth%20MacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> and "<a href="Spies%20Reminiscent%20of%20Us">Spies Reminiscent of Us</a>" director <a href="Cyndi%20Tang">Cyndi Tang</a> to change the episode's title from "Sliders", parodying the science fiction television series "<a href="Sliders">Sliders</a>". Colton's suggestion of the new title "Road to the Multiverse" was accepted, as was altering the premise of "Spies Reminiscent of Us", the season's original "Road to" episode. Executive producer and former "" writer <a href="David%20A.%20Goodman">David A. Goodman</a>, a fan of science fiction and the series "Sliders", played a key role in the episode's original development. The production staff of "Family Guy", including Wellesley Wild, watched an episode of "Sliders" before writing the show. Series regulars <a href="Peter%20Shin">Peter Shin</a> and <a href="James%20Purdum">James Purdum</a> served as supervising directors, with <a href="Andrew%20Goldberg%20%28writer%29">Andrew Goldberg</a> and Alex Carter working as <a href="staff%20writer">staff writer</a>s for the episode. Composer <a href="Walter%20Murphy">Walter Murphy</a>, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for "Road to the Multiverse". <a href="Ron%20Jones%20%28composer%29">Ron Jones</a> and MacFarlane also contributed to the music and lyrics featured in the episode.

The episode features several examples of animation styles that differ greatly from the series' customary appearance. One such example involves the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> universe, where the characters are drawn in the style of classic <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> animated films. The sequence was animated entirely in Los Angeles by Main Street Productions, which were approached and recruited by series producer <a href="Kara%20Vallow">Kara Vallow</a> to create the sequence, rather than in South Korea where the show is normally <a href="Korean%20animation">animated</a>. MacFarlane described the scene as "a bit of challenge" and "kind of an experiment" since every character had to be completely redesigned based on the style of such films as ""<a href="Pinocchio%20%281940%20film%29">Pinocchio</a>", "<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%20%281991%20film%29">Beauty and the Beast</a>" and "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Seven%20Dwarfs%20%281937%20film%29">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>"." Another difference occurs in the dog universe, where the human characters are redrawn as dogs and Brian is redrawn as a human. MacFarlane found redesigning Brian easiest, simply giving him "a big nose and a collar." In addition to traditional animation, the episode included a parody by <a href="Sarah%20de%20Gaudemar">Sarah E. Meyer</a>, Eileen Kohlhepp, Kelly Mazurowskiof of "<a href="Robot%20Chicken">Robot Chicken</a>", a <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> series created by "Family Guy" cast member <a href="Seth%20Green">Seth Green</a> for the <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> animation block <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a>. Green did not take part in the making of the parody; it was instead animated by the Los Angeles company <a href="Screen%20Novelties">Screen Novelties</a>, which had worked on the early seasons of "Robot Chicken".

"Road to the Multiverse", along with the seven other episodes from "Family Guy"s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The DVDs included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane, various crew and cast members from several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature that discussed the process behind animating "Road to the Multiverse" and a mini-feature entitled "Family Guy Karaoke". The set also includes a reprint of the script for the episode.

In addition to the regular cast, Japanese actors Kei Ogawa, Kotaro Watanabe and Jamison Yang guest starred in the episode as Japanese-inspired versions of the Griffin family and <a href="Glenn%20Quagmire">Glenn Quagmire</a>. Recurring guest voice actor <a href="John%20G.%20Brennan">John G. Brennan</a> reprised his recurring role as <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20Family%20Guy%23The%20Goldmans">Mort Goldman</a> and <a href="Adam%20West">Adam West</a> reprised his role as <a href="Adam%20West%20%28Family%20Guy%29">Mayor Adam West</a>, who appears as an <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> mouse in the Disney universe. Minor appearances were made by writer and showrunner <a href="Steve%20Callaghan">Steve Callaghan</a>, actor <a href="Ralph%20Garman">Ralph Garman</a>, writer and showrunner <a href="Mark%20Hentemann">Mark Hentemann</a> and writers <a href="Patrick%20Meighan%20%28writer%29">Patrick Meighan</a>, <a href="Danny%20Smith%20%28writer%29">Danny Smith</a>, <a href="Alec%20Sulkin">Alec Sulkin</a> and John Viener.

The episode opens with Stewie revealing his ability to travel across parallel universes to Brian. The first universe that they decide to visit, after having questioned the origin of Stewie's pedigree pig, is said to exist in a world where <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> is absent. In this universe, everything is seemingly years in advance of the 21st century; Quagmire is able to take a single pill and be instantly cured of the <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> virus, and flying cars and buildings surround them. As the two travel through the universe, they come upon Stewie's older sister Meg, who has become significantly more attractive. While they watch her walk down the street, the 1984 single "Drop Dead Legs" by <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a> plays. Playing on the nonexistence of Christianity, Brian and Stewie visit the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a> and discover that a large collection of photos of American actress <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a> has been substituted for "<a href="The%20Creation%20of%20Adam">The Creation of Adam</a>" painting by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, who was fired and replaced by <a href="John%20Hinckley%2C%20Jr.">John Hinckley</a>.
Seeking to explore more alternative realities, Stewie takes Brian to a universe resembling the 1960 animated sitcom "<a href="The%20Flintstones">The Flintstones</a>". Peter and his wife Lois are shown dressed in a manner similar to <a href="Fred%20Flintstone">Fred Flintstone</a> and <a href="Wilma%20Flintstone">Wilma Flintstone</a> respectively. Becoming tired of this universe, the two then transport themselves to a universe where the atomic bombing of Japan never occurred, allowing Japan to conquer the United States in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Another universe references many works by <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>. Meg appears as Ursula from the 1989 film "<a href="The%20Little%20Mermaid%20%281989%20film%29">The Little Mermaid</a>" and <a href="Herbert%20%28Family%20Guy%29">Herbert</a> appears as the <a href="Queen%20%28Snow%20White%29">Queen</a> from the 1937 film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". The rumor about <a href="Walt%20Disney%23Personality%20and%20reputation">Walt Disney being an anti-Semite</a> is also referenced by having the universe's occupants attack the Disney version of Mort Goldman when he enters a room, brutally beating him to death off-screen. Discouraged, Brian and Stewie transport themselves to a universe resembling the Adult Swim series "Robot Chicken", a show executive-produced by "Family Guy" cast member <a href="Seth%20Green">Seth Green</a>. The sequence reveals several action figures of cartoon characters: <a href="He-Man">He-Man</a>, <a href="Optimus%20Prime">Optimus Prime</a>, <a href="ThunderCats">Lion-O</a> and <a href="Duke%20%28G.I.%20Joe%29">Duke</a> from <a href="G.I.%20Joe">G.I. Joe</a>.

Continuing their travels, the two come across a universe where singer and performer <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> was never born, resulting in the loss of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201960">1960 presidential election</a> by President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> to then-Vice President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, which causes <a href="World%20War%20III">World War III</a>. Brian questions whether <a href="Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> shot Kennedy, and Stewie responds that he shot <a href="McDonaldland%23Characters">Mayor McCheese</a> instead. A sequence similar to the <a href="Zapruder%20film">Zapruder film</a>, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy</a> also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a <a href="editorial%20cartoon">political cartoon</a>. The next reference occurs in the dog universe when Stewie says, "Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty dog!" which is a reference to the famous quote "Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty ape!" from the first "Planet of the Apes" movie. The final reference of the episode also occurs in the dog universe when Stewie mentions, "Gosh, Brian, I sure hope this next leap, will be the leap home," a nod to the opening narration of the time travel series "<a href="Quantum%20Leap%20%28TV%20series%29">Quantum Leap</a>".

"Road to the Multiverse" was broadcast on September 27, 2009, as a part of the Animation Domination block on Fox, and was preceded by an episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" and <a href="Pilot%20%28The%20Cleveland%20Show%29">the pilot episode</a> of MacFarlane's new show "<a href="The%20Cleveland%20Show">The Cleveland Show</a>". It was followed by the season premiere of MacFarlane's other show "<a href="American%20Dad%21">American Dad!</a>". It was watched by 10.17 million viewers in its original airing, according to <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>, despite being aired simultaneously with the season premiere of "<a href="Desperate%20Housewives">Desperate Housewives</a>" on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, the season premiere of "<a href="The%20Amazing%20Race%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Amazing Race</a>" on <a href="CBS">CBS</a> and "<a href="NBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football">Sunday Night Football</a>" on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. The episode also acquired a 5.2 rating in the 18–49 demographic, beating "The Simpsons", "The Cleveland Show" and "American Dad!", in addition to edging out all three shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings were "Family Guy"s highest since the airing of the season six episode "<a href="McStroke">McStroke</a>". The episode's first broadcast in Canada, on <a href="Global%20Television%20Network">Global TV</a>, was watched by 1.29 million viewers, making it first for its timeslot in the week it was broadcast.

"Road to the Multiverse" received critical acclaim, with one calling the storyline "right up there with the best of the early episodes we've seen on the series." In a simultaneous review of the episodes of "The Simpsons" and "American Dad!" that preceded and followed the episode respectively and "The Cleveland Show" pilot, "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>"s Todd VanDerWerff commented that he felt "essentially predisposed to like" the episode, adding that he enjoyed the entire theme of the show, in addition the fact that it was more than just science fiction. In the conclusion of his review VanDerWerff called the episode a "solid start to the eighth season" and rated it as a B+, the best rating between "The Simpsons" episode "<a href="Homer%20the%20Whopper">Homer the Whopper</a>", the "American Dad!" episode "<a href="In%20Country...Club">In Country...Club</a>" and "The Cleveland Show"s series premiere. Ahsan Haque of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10, saying that the episode featured "plenty of memorable lines, some truly stunning animation and a relentless non-stop barrage of witty jokes." In a subsequent review in January 2010 of "Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures", Haque called the episode "creative, visually impressive, and features some of the best random gags we've seen on the show in a long time." In 2014, to celebrate the show's 15th anniversary, IGN published a list of the 15 best "Family Guy" episodes, with "Road to the Multiverse" ranked the fifth best. Television critic Alex Rocha of "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" also found the episode to have "great laughs," saying that the show is "definitely off to a great start" to a new season. Tom Eames of entertainment website "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>" placed the episode at number one on his listing of the best "Family Guy" episodes in order of "yukyukyuks" and described the episode as "another crazy Brian and Stewie adventure". He noted that the story did not have "the most interesting plot", but got "more and more entertaining and so much fun" with every new world they featured in. He concluded that "coupled with Brian and Stewie front and centre, it made for the best Family Guy episode ever." The director of "Road to the Multiverse", Greg Colton, was awarded the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation, for storyboarding the episode, on August 21, 2010, at the <a href="62nd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">62nd Primetime Emmy Awards</a>'s <a href="Creative%20Arts%20Emmy%20Award">Creative Arts Awards</a>.

Although the <a href="Parents%20Television%20Council">Parents Television Council</a>, a frequent <a href="criticism%20of%20Family%20Guy">"Family Guy" critic</a>, did not name "Family Guy" its "Worst TV Show of the Week" for "Road to the Multiverse", it did refer to this episode in its negative review of the following episode, "<a href="Family%20Goy">Family Goy</a>". The review noted that the appearance of the Griffin family's Jewish neighbor, <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20Family%20Guy%23The%20Goldmans">Mort Goldman</a>, in "Multiverse" was notable since, in the Disney parody, Mort was beaten to a bloody pulp by Disney-inspired versions of the cast – a reference to <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s purported antisemitism. The review goes on to state, "apparently, in Seth MacFarlane's mind, the best way to fight anti-Semitism is with more anti-Semitism. One must wonder what young, angry, disaffected bigots tuning into the show must think. All they see is a nebbish stereotype getting his teeth knocked out of his skull and a blood-soaked <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> tumbling to the floor."

In a 2012 interview, Seth MacFarlane stated: "As far as the all-around best episode, "Road to the Multiverse" would have to be up there."

A video game sequel called "" was made. It is also a continuation of the <a href="Family%20Guy%20%28season%209%29">season 9</a> episode "<a href="The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory%20%28Family%20Guy%29">The Big Bang Theory</a>".
