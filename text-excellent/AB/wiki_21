Meteorological history of Hurricane Patricia

<a href="Hurricane%20Patricia">Hurricane Patricia</a> was the most intense <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> ever recorded in the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a> and the second-most intense worldwide in terms of <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a>. It also featured the highest one-minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tehuantepec">Gulf of Tehuantepec</a> in mid-October 2015, Patricia was first classified a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> on October 20. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the <a href="2015%20Pacific%20hurricane%20season">annual hurricane season</a>. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled <a href="rapid%20intensification">explosive intensification</a> on October 22. A well-defined <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> developed within an intense <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a <a href="SSHS%23Category%205">Category 5 hurricane</a> in just 24 hours—a near-record pace. The magnitude of intensification was poorly forecast and both <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model">forecast models</a> and meteorologists suffered from record-high prediction errors.

On October 23, two <a href="53d%20Weather%20Reconnaissance%20Squadron">Hurricane Hunter</a> missions both revealed the storm to have acquired maximum sustained winds of 205 mph (335 km/h) and a pressure of 879 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 25.96 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>). Since the peak intensity was assessed to have occurred between the missions, the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> ultimately estimated Patricia to have acquired winds of 215 mph (345 km/h) and pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg). This ranked it just below <a href="Typhoon%20Tip">Typhoon Tip</a> of 1979 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record. Patricia's exceptional intensity prompted the <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Pacific%20hurricane%20names">retirement of its name</a> in April 2016. Late on October 23, Patricia made <a href="landfall">landfall</a> in a significantly weakened state near <a href="Cuixmala">Cuixmala</a>, <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>. Despite weakening greatly, it was the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico with winds estimated at 150 mph (240 km/h). Interaction with the mountainous terrain of Mexico induced dramatic weakening, faster than the storm had intensified. Within 24 hours of moving ashore, Patricia degraded into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter late on October 24.

On October 11, 2015, an area of disturbed weather traversed <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> and emerged over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly over the next few days, and coalesced into a Central American gyre—a broad <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>al circulation. A <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> crossed the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> and eventually reached Central America on October 15; the two systems merged the following day near the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tehuantepec">Gulf of Tehuantepec</a>. A concurrent <a href="Tehuantepecer">Tehuantepec gap wind event</a> on the western side of the gyre, complimented by anticyclonic flow behind a <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a>, enhanced <a href="vorticity">vorticity</a> and spurred the formation of an elongated <a href="Low-pressure%20area">area of low pressure</a> on October 17. The broad system spanned several hundred miles from the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a> into the eastern Pacific. A large, disorganized area of <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a>—showers and thunderstorms—accompanied the system, increasing in coverage substantially throughout the day. A strong pulse in the <a href="Madden%E2%80%93Julian%20oscillation">Madden–Julian oscillation</a>—a propagating <a href="Climate%20pattern%23Modes%20of%20variability">climate pattern</a> associated with increased <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">tropical cyclogenesis</a>—may have aided in creating favorable conditions for further development.

Moving south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec on October 18, the system consolidated and developed a small, defined circulation. Associated convection became more concentrated around its center. Another gap wind event soon impacted the system, temporarily delaying development of the disturbance into a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a>. The low soon relocated to the northeast, aligning itself east of the gap wind event which aided in development. A small, well-defined circulation formed by early on October 20 within a broader cyclonic circulation. With increasing deep convection, the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression, assigned the identifier "Twenty-E", by 06:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>. Upon its designation, the depression was situated roughly 205 mi (335 km) south-southeast of <a href="Salina%20Cruz">Salina Cruz</a>, Mexico.

Located south of a <a href="Ridge%20%28meteorology%29">mid-level ridge</a> and the continuing gap wind event, the nascent depression moved slowly west-southwest on October 20. Initial environmental conditions were modestly favorable, allowing for steady intensification. The depression achieved <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a> status by 00:00 UTC on October 21; the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">assigned it the name</a> "Patricia" accordingly. Throughout much of October 21, Patricia moved through a region of drier, more stable air and over relatively cool <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s. Both of these factors served to delay intensification of the cyclone. The system unraveled substantially, with <a href="Rainband">banding features</a> dissipating and the low-level circulation becoming poorly defined. Once clear of the hindering factors, convection blossomed over Patricia late on October 21 and a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a> formed over the center. Simultaneously, the storm accelerated west-northwest.

Exceptionally favorable atmospheric conditions, consisting of little <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, anomalously high <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s of , and high moisture levels yielded an environment highly conducive to <a href="rapid%20intensification">rapid intensification</a>. Consequently, Patricia commenced explosive intensification late on October 21. Patricia reached <a href="SSHS%23Category%201">hurricane strength</a> shortly after 00:00 UTC on October 22, featuring prominent <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>, well-defined banding features, and a developing <a href="Eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>. Upon becoming a hurricane, Patricia was located 230 mi (370 km) south of <a href="Acapulco">Acapulco</a>, Mexico. In the following 12 hours, a well-defined wide eye formed within a ring of intense convection—with cloud tops of —forming "an almost perfectly symmetric [central dense overcast]". Data from <a href="NOAA%20Hurricane%20Hunters">NOAA Hurricane Hunters</a> investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached <a href="SSHS%23Category%204">Category 4 status</a> on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a> by 18:00 UTC; <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s were estimated at 130 mph (215 km/h) alongside a <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 957 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 28.26 <a href="Inches%20of%20Mercury">inHg</a>) at this time.

The rapid intensification of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC indicated the possibility of such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. They noted the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just before the onset of rapid intensification, the agency was unable to utilize the <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20forecast%20model%23Statistical%20guidance">Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme</a> rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway.

At 03:00 UTC on October 22, the NHC forecast Patricia to achieve major hurricane status in 36 hours; less than 15 hours later, the system exceeded their forecast peak. Strengthening into a Category 5 hurricane was not forecast at all until Patricia had already reached such intensity, although in the intermediate advisory immediately before Patricia's upgrade to Category 5, the NHC noted that "Patricia could become a category 5 hurricane overnight", and in the preceding tropical weather discussion, noted that "Patricia could ... reach Category 5 intensity". This trend continued throughout the rapid intensification period, resulting in some of the largest errors on record through 48 hours; they were the worst-ever for the Eastern Pacific since the NHC took over operations for the basin in 1988. All forecast models saw enormous errors, most of which performed worse than the official NHC forecasts. No model accurately prognosticated the magnitude nor rate of the intensification. The EMXI—an output from the <a href="European%20Centre%20for%20Medium-Range%20Weather%20Forecasts">European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts</a>—saw the largest average error with at 48 hours.

During the overnight hours of October 22–23, Patricia turned northwest and decelerated slightly as it reached the western edge of the mid-level ridge. Rapid development continued into October 23, and the hurricane reached <a href="SSHS%23Category%205">Category 5 status</a> by 00:00 UTC, with winds estimated at 175 mph (280 km/h). Convection cooled even further, with cloud tops colder than surrounding an wide eye by 03:00 UTC. In a 24-hour span, Patricia's winds increased by 120 mph (195 km/h) and its central pressure fell by 95 mbar (hPa; 2.81 inHg). Around 06:00 UTC, an <a href="53d%20Weather%20Reconnaissance%20Squadron">Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft</a> measured flight-level winds of and the aircraft's <a href="Microwave%20radiometer">stepped frequency microwave radiometer</a> (SFMR) observed surface winds of . Furthermore, the final dropsonde observation from that mission at about 06:45 UTC indicated a central pressure of 879 mbar (hPa; 25.96 inHg). Rapid development continued after the aircraft left the hurricane, as the three pressure readings during the mission indicated that the pressure fell at a rate of more than 7 mbar (hPa; 0.21 inHg) per hour. Their findings also revealed an extraordinarily tight <a href="pressure%20gradient">pressure gradient</a> of 24 mbar (hPa; 0.71 inHg) per <a href="nautical%20mile">nautical mile</a>, among the steepest gradients on record.

Based on continued improvement of the hurricane's satellite appearance, Patricia is assessed to have achieved its peak intensity around 12:00 UTC on October 23; the storm was situated about 150 mi (240 km) southwest of <a href="Manzanillo%2C%20Colima">Manzanillo</a>, Mexico. Maximum winds are estimated at 215 mph (345 km/h) alongside a pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg), making Patricia the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever observed. It is possible that Patricia surpassed the all-time record of 870 mbar (hPa; 25.69 inHg) set by <a href="Typhoon%20Tip">Typhoon Tip</a> in 1979 given the rate of deepening observed during the early morning mission; due to a lack of direct observation at the time of Patricia's peak, no concrete determination of such could be made. The violent, compact core of Patricia was roughly wide with the <a href="radius%20of%20maximum%20wind">radius of maximum wind</a>s extending only .

Little change in strength took place for the next six hours; a <a href="Shortwave%20%28meteorology%29">shortwave trough</a> crossing the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a> turned Patricia to the northeast and induced acceleration. Another reconnaissance mission around 18:00 UTC recorded a central pressure of 879 mbar (hPa; 25.96 inHg). The aircraft was battered by severe <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a> (the result of <a href="Vertical%20draft">updrafts and downdrafts</a>) and the crew experienced maximum <a href="g-forces">g-forces</a> of +3.0 and -1.5.

Late on October 23, <a href="weather%20radar">radar imagery</a> depicted the formation of a secondary outer eyewall, indicative of an <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">eyewall replacement cycle</a>. By 20:30 UTC, the final pass by reconnaissance, the hurricane's flight-level winds fell by 60 mph (95 km/h) and its central pressure rose at 8 mbar (hPa; 0.24 inHg) per hour. Coinciding with the eyewall replacement cycle was an increase in southwesterly wind shear, a factor that further accelerated Patricia's degradation. The hurricane's eye soon became cloud-filled and rapid weakening ensued at an unprecedented pace.

At 23:00 UTC, the cyclone made <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> at <a href="Cuixmala">Cuixmala</a> in the municipality of <a href="La%20Huerta%2C%20Jalisco">La Huerta</a>, Jalisco—about 55 mi (85 km) west-northwest of <a href="Manzanillo%2C%20Colima">Manzanillo</a>—with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and an estimated pressure of 932 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg). This made Patricia the strongest hurricane to strike Mexico's Pacific coast, exceeding <a href="1959%20Mexico%20hurricane">an unnamed storm</a> in 1959 and <a href="Hurricane%20Madeline%20%281976%29">Madeline</a> in 1976 (the latter of which has not been <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20reanalysis%20project%23Future%20efforts%20in%20other%20basins">reanalyzed</a>). Although Patricia was operationally thought to have made landfall as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) and a pressure of 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg), reanalysis of available data suggested that the hurricane weakened more rapidly than originally thought: an automated station in Cuixmala measured a pressure of 934.2 mbar (hpa; 27.54 inHg), while storm chasers in <a href="Emiliano%20Zapata%2C%20Jalisco">Emiliano Zapata</a>, just inside the eye of Patricia, measured a pressure of 937.8 mbar (hPa; 27.70 inHg). Their observations also indicated a pressure gradient of 11 mbar (hPa; 0.32 inHg) per nautical mile. 

Patricia's winds at landfall are relatively uncertain, and the 150 mph (240 km/h) value is based upon the Knaff-Zehr-Courtney pressure-wind relationship and an extrapolation of a 54 mbar (hPa; 1.59 inHg) filling using the <a href="Dvorak%20Technique">Dvorak Technique</a>. An additional equation stemming from work by Willoughby (1993) yielded a landfall intensity of . A <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> automated weather station at the <a href="Chamela-Cuixmala%20Biosphere%20Reserve">Chamela-Cuixmala Biosphere Reserve</a>, at an elevation of , recorded sustained winds of and a maximum gust of . Further raw data from this station indicated unrealistically high sustained winds of and a maximum gust of . Based on the station's distance from Patricia's eye, outside the radius of maximum winds, the observations from this station are considered unreliable. The highest reliably measured winds of occurred in <a href="Pista%2C%20Mexico">Pista</a> between 22:30 and 23:00 UTC on October 23 before the anemometer failed.
Even faster weakening ensued through October 24 as the hurricane traversed the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Occidental">Sierra Madre mountains</a>; its eye disappeared from satellite imagery within hours of moving ashore. The system weakened below hurricane strength by 03:00 UTC as it passed west of <a href="Guadalajara">Guadalajara</a>. Patricia accelerated inland between a <a href="Trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> over Northwestern Mexico and the ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. Convection dramatically decreased in organization and the low- and mid- to upper-level circulation centers of the cyclone soon decoupled. The system degraded into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC as little organized convection remained, and the storm dissipated shortly thereafter over central Mexico. Unimpeded by the mountains of Mexico, the mid- to upper-level circulation of Patricia, accompanied by considerable moisture, continued northeast and interacted with a <a href="cold%20front">cold front</a> over the western Gulf of Mexico. The new system produced flooding rains across large areas of <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, and <a href="Texas">Texas</a>.

With maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg), Hurricane Patricia is the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever observed, just shy of <a href="Typhoon%20Tip">Typhoon Tip</a> in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870 mbar (hPa; 25.69 inHg). It is also the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. It exceeded the previous sustained wind record of 190 mph (305 km/h) set by <a href="Hurricane%20Allen">Hurricane Allen</a> in 1980 and the pressure record of 882 mbar (hPa; 26.05 inHg) set by <a href="Hurricane%20Wilma">Hurricane Wilma</a> in 2005, both in the <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane">Atlantic basin</a>. In the Eastern Pacific basin, north of the equator and east of the <a href="International%20Dateline">International Dateline</a>, the previous basin record-holder was <a href="Hurricane%20Linda%20%281997%29">Hurricane Linda</a> in 1997 with winds of 185 mph (295 km/h) and a pressure of 902 mbar (hPa; 26.64 inHg). Reconnaissance also found a pressure gradient of 24 mbar (hPa; 0.71 inHg) per nautical mile early on October 23, among the steepest gradients ever observed in a tropical cyclone.
On a global scale, Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds rank as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated globally in a tropical cyclone, surpassing <a href="Typhoon%20Haiyan">Typhoon Haiyan</a> of 2013, although the intensity of Haiyan was only estimated via satellite imagery (T8.0, the highest rating on the <a href="Dvorak%20technique">Dvorak scale</a>). Since no aircraft reconnaissance was available for Haiyan, the record set by Patricia is uncertain and comparing the intensities of the two storms is problematic. According to the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a>, <a href="Typhoon%20Nancy%20%281961%29">Typhoon Nancy</a> of 1961 also produced 215 mph (345 km/h) sustained winds; however, it is widely accepted that <a href="Pacific%20typhoon">Western Pacific</a> reconnaissance during the 1940s to 1960s overestimated cyclone intensity and Nancy's record is considered questionable. The most powerful wind gust produced by a tropical cyclone, as well as the highest non-tornadic winds ever recorded, is still retained by <a href="Cyclone%20Olivia">Cyclone Olivia</a> in 1996: was observed on <a href="Barrow%20Island%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Barrow Island, Western Australia</a>.

The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00–06:00 UTC October 22–23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85 mph (140 km/h) to 205 mph (335 km/h). This represents a record increase of 120 mph (195 km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95 mbar (hPa; 2.81 inHg). This fell just short of the world-record intensification set by <a href="Typhoon%20Forrest%20%281983%29">Typhoon Forrest</a> in 1983, which featured a pressure drop of 100 mbar (hPa; 2.95 inHg) in just under 24 hours. With a pressure of 932 mbar (hPa; 27.52 inHg), Patricia is the strongest landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. The previous record was 941 mbar (hPa; 27.73 inHg) set by <a href="Hurricane%20Odile">Hurricane Odile</a> in 2014. Similarly, the hurricane featured the fastest weakening while still over water in NHC's area of responsibility, with a pressure rise of 54 mbar (hPa; 1.59 inHg) in the five hours before it made landfall. Furthermore, a dropsonde observed a 700 mbar <a href="Geopotential%20height">height</a> temperature of in the eye of Patricia. This is one of the warmest temperatures ever observed in a tropical cyclone's eye worldwide.

Norwich War Memorial

Norwich War Memorial (also known as Norwich City War Memorial or Norwich Cenotaph) is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a> in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a> in Eastern England. It was designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, the last of his eight <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>s to be erected in England. Prior to Lutyens' involvement, several abandoned proposals had been made for commemorating Norwich's war dead, and by 1926 the newly elected lord mayor was determined to see the construction of a memorial before he left office. He established an appeal to raise funds for local hospitals in memory of the dead as well as a physical monument. He commissioned Lutyens, who designed an empty tomb (cenotaph) atop a low screen wall from which protrudes a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a>. Bronze <a href="torch">flambeaux</a> at either end can burn gas to emit a flame. Lutyens also designed a roll of honour, on which the names of the city's dead are listed, which was installed in <a href="Norwich%20Castle">Norwich Castle</a> in 1931.

A local disabled veteran unveiled the memorial on 9 October 1927. It was moved from its original location to become the centrepiece of a memorial garden between <a href="Norwich%20Market">the market</a> and the <a href="City%20Hall%2C%20Norwich">City Hall</a> in 1938. The structure on which the garden is built was found to be unstable in 2004 and the memorial was closed off pending repairs which began in 2008. The work was completed in 2011, during which time the memorial was restored, having fallen into disrepair while it was closed off, and rotated to face the city hall rather than the market place. It was rededicated on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> 2011 and is today a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>. In 2015, it became part of a "national collection" of Lutyens' war memorials.

The <a href="Norfolk%20Regiment">Norfolk Regiment</a> was one of the first to enter combat after the declaration of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. The 1st battalion was stationed in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, from where they were dispatched to France as part of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>. The 1st Norfolks participated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons">Battle of Mons</a>, one of the first major engagements of the war, in late August 1914. The 2nd battalion, based in India, sailed for the Middle East to fight against the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in Mesopotamia (Iraq). The Norfolks had a third battalion, part of the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>, which was first deployed for home defence around eastern England, and raised three more <a href="pals%20battalions">pals battalions</a>. Norwich, the <a href="county%20town">county town</a>, raised another three companies of <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a>. Approximately 33,000 men served overseas with the Norfolks, though many more Norfolk men joined other regiments.

In the aftermath of the war and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Among the most prominent designers of memorials was <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens designed <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations; the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a>, the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world; and the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a>, which appears in all large <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic memorials, including Norwich's.

Norwich was among the last of Lutyens' memorials to be built. Many towns and cities built memorials soon after the end of the First World War, but early attempts in Norwich proved abortive, each mired in controversy. A scheme to build an agricultural college to serve as a memorial reached the point of soliciting donations, but these had to be returned when the scheme was abandoned as being too ambitious and not appealing to all social classes. When Charles Bignold was elected <a href="List%20of%20Lord%20Mayors%20of%20Norwich">Lord Mayor of Norwich</a> in 1926, he was determined that the city would have a war memorial before he left office. He took the initiative and commissioned Lutyens and the two men selected a site to the east of <a href="Norwich%20Guildhall">the Guildhall</a> when the architect visited the city on 13 June 1927. Adamant that the project should benefit the living as well as provide a monument to the dead, Bignold established the Joint Hospitals and War Memorial Appeal to raise funds for the <a href="Norfolk%20and%20Norwich%20Hospital">Norfolk and Norwich Hospital</a> and the Jenny Lind Children's Hospital, as well as a physical monument. The target was £35,000, of which £4,000 was to be allocated to a memorial. The memorial would not have space for the names of Norwich's 3,544 war dead, so Lutyens was also commissioned to design the Norwich Roll of Honour. A further £800–£1,000 was allocated and Lutyens produced a set of oak panels which fold out to reveal the names painted on the inside.

The monument was completed swiftly once the location was agreed; the total cost was £2,700 (1927), of which 10% was Lutyens' fee. The design and the proposed location continued to be a source of controversy in the local community. Some residents felt that the memorial would not be in keeping with the city's existing architecture, but Bignold felt sure that he had the backing of the ex-service community. He noted that the Guildhall was in a central location and as one of Norwich's most famous buildings was a significant attraction for visitors, and thus that siting the memorial there would display Norwich's pride in its contribution to the war. In response to criticisms of the design, he wrote that "the form of any war memorial depends entirely on the sum of money available for its construction. Knowing this sum, we consulted Sir Edwin Lutyens as to the best means of expending it. [...] We felt that all reasonable persons would be satisfied by the expert opinion of the man who gave London its Cenotaph".

The memorial is of <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> construction. It consists of a low screen wall on top of which is a tomb chest (<a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>) topped with a carved wreath, the last of eight cenotaphs by Lutyens to be built in England—the first being <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Southampton">Southampton's</a> and the most famous being <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">that on Whitehall</a> in London. The city's coat of arms is carved and painted into the tomb, supported by two <a href="relief">relief</a> figures of angels. The memorial is flanked by pedestals, which are topped with bronze flambeaux (flaming <a href="torch">torch</a>es) gilded with <a href="gold%20leaf">gold leaf</a>. Protruding from the screen wall, beneath the coat of arms, is a Stone of Remembrance, the only one he designed to be integrated into a larger structure. Built into the structure were two metal caskets, one of which contained a list of Norwich's dead from the war and the contents of the second is unknown; the council decided that it would have been inappropriate to open it during restoration work. The memorial is designed so that gas can be burnt inside it, with the smoke and flames emitted through the flambeaux at either end. Lutyens proposed similar designs for several memorials, including the Cenotaph on Whitehall, but Norwich was the only place where the proposal was accepted and is thus the only one of his memorials capable of emitting a flame. The inscriptions read (above the stone) and (on the stone itself). A further inscription in smaller font on the base of the stone reads . This was added at a later date, along with the dates of the two world wars which are inscribed on the screen wall, either side of the stone.

The roll of honour was not completed as quickly. After a series of budget reductions, it was delivered in June 1929 but was of poor quality, and in the meantime the trustees of the castle museum had decided that the castle was not an appropriate place for the roll to be kept. It had also exceeded the reduced budget of £500, though Lutyens waived his fee and offered to pay the difference. The trustees changed their minds after improvements were made to the quality, and the roll of honour was installed in the castle on 13 January 1931 without ceremony as a result of embarrassment over the delay.

General <a href="Ian%20Standish%20Monteith%20Hamilton">Sir Ian Hamilton</a> presided over the memorial's unveiling on Sunday, 9 October 1927, at a ceremony attended by Lutyens. The unveiling itself was performed by a local veteran, Bertie Withers. Withers was selected at random after candidates were solicited from the city's ex-servicemen who met four criteria: that they were natives of Norwich; had enlisted prior to the implementation of conscription in 1916; had served overseas; and had been permanently disabled as a result of their service. Withers enlisted on 1 September 1914 and fought in the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> in 1915; after a bout of illness he rejoined his unit to fight in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">First Battle of Gaza</a>, where his battalion suffered heavy casualties. Withers himself was injured and, after his evacuation, his left leg was amputated below the knee. Upon his return to England he spent a year in the Norwich and Norfolk Hospital.

As part of civic redevelopment of the market area and surrounding buildings in 1938, the cenotaph was moved to a site on Market Place, between the new <a href="City%20Hall%2C%20Norwich">City Hall</a> and the castle. There it formed the centrepiece of a dedicated memorial garden by C.H. James and S.R. Pierce. The garden was opened by <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a> on 29 October 1938. The whole monument now stands on a terrace which runs parallel to the city hall, sloping towards Market Place with steps accommodating the gradient. A row of eight ornamental lamp-posts stands along either side of the memorial itself, one of which is a later replacement. Two flagpoles stand at the corners, at the bases of which are low relief brass carvings of allegorical figures of Peace and Plenty.
Structural problems with the <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> of the garden were discovered in the early 21st century and the garden was closed and fenced off in 2004. The memorial remained fenced off for seven years and fell into disrepair as the city council lacked the funds to carry out the necessary repairs, though access was granted to representatives of <a href="the%20Royal%20British%20Legion">the Royal British Legion</a> to lay wreaths during <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> services. The journalist <a href="Martin%20Bell">Martin Bell</a> remarked on the condition of the memorial in 2007: "to find a war memorial in a state like that you would have to go to Iraq". 

Repair work commenced on the garden and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration and work on the memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the repair work the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: "Breath" by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>, 11 November 2011; the repair work had cost £2.6 million.

The roll of honour suffered structural damage, and in 2016 was moved from the castle keep to the city hall. It was restored with the aid of grant funding from the <a href="War%20Memorials%20Trust">War Memorials Trust</a> and several local charities.

Two commemorative stones were laid in front of the memorial in August 2017 in honour of two men from Norwich who received the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (the highest award for gallantry in the British armed forces) in the First World War—Corporal <a href="Sidney%20James%20Day">Sidney James Day</a> and Major <a href="Wilfred%20Edwards">Wilfred Edwards</a>, who both earned their medals in August 1917. A third stone is planned to be laid in 2018 for Lance Corporal <a href="Ernest%20Seaman">Ernest Seaman</a>, the third and final Norwich-born recipient of the Victoria Cross, a century after the action for which he was decorated. 

Norwich War Memorial was designated a Grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 30 September 1983; it was upgraded to Grade II* in 2014. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> recognised it as part of a "national collection" of Lutyens' war memorials. At the same time, all 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed, and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries were updated and expanded.

Mells War Memorial

Mells War Memorial is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a> by <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> in the village of <a href="Mells%2C%20Somerset">Mells</a> in the <a href="Mendip%20Hills">Mendip Hills</a> of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, south-western England. Unveiled in 1921, the memorial is one of multiple buildings and structures Lutyens designed in Mells. His friendship with two prominent families in the area, the Horners and the Asquiths, led to a series of commissions; among his other works in the village are memorials to two sons—one from each family—killed in the war. Lutyens toured the village with local dignitaries in search of a suitable site for the war memorial, after which he was prompted to remark "all their young men were killed".

The memorial takes the form of a marble column topped by a sculpture of <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> slaying a dragon, an image Lutyens used on two other public war memorials. At the base of the column, the names of the village's war dead are inscribed on stone panels. The memorial is flanked by identical rubble walls in local stone, on top of which grows a yew hedge. Low stone benches protrude from the walls to allow wreaths to be laid. Additional panels were fixed to the wall after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> to commemorate that conflict. The memorial was unveiled on 26 June 1921 by Brigadier-General <a href="Arthur%20Asquith">Arthur Asquith</a>, whose brother is among those commemorated on it. It is a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> and since 2015 has been part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Before the war, Lutyens established his reputation designing <a href="English%20country%20house">country houses</a> for wealthy patrons, but from 1917 onwards, he dedicated much of his time to memorialising the casualties of the war. He went on to design <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations and the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a> of the Somme in France, among many other memorials and cemeteries.

According to Tim Skelton, author of "Lutyens and Great War", "if there was one village above all others that would have a war memorial designed by Lutyens, it would be the village of Mells". The war memorial is one of multiple buildings and structures by Lutyens in the village. He was a friend of two prominent local families, the Horners and the Asquiths, through his collaborations with <a href="Gertrude%20Jekyll">Gertrude Jekyll</a> on country houses and gardens early in his career. Gertrude's sister-in-law was Dame <a href="Agnes%20Jekyll">Agnes Jekyll</a>, the sister of Lady <a href="Frances%20Horner">Frances Horner</a>, who was the incumbent owner (with her husband, <a href="John%20Francis%20Fortescue%20Horner">Sir John</a>) of <a href="Mells%20Manor">Mells Manor</a>, a manor house in the centre of the village dating originally from the 16th century. Shortly after their first meeting, Sir John commissioned Lutyens for renovations to the Horners' London town house. Lutyens first visited Mells in 1896 at the request of Lady Horner (with whom he became close friends), who commissioned him to rebuild the house, and later for several other works related to the manor.

The Horners' son, Edward, was killed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a> on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> in November 1917 and is among those named on the war memorial. The family separately commissioned Lutyens to design <a href="Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Edward%20Horner">a memorial to him</a> in <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Church%2C%20Mells">St Andrew's Church</a>—a large statue of a mounted cavalry officer (by <a href="Alfred%20Munnings">Alfred Munnings</a>), which stands on a plinth by Lutyens based on the Cenotaph. In the same church is a memorial to <a href="Raymond%20Asquith">Raymond Asquith</a> (the Horners' son-in-law and the eldest son of the prime minister, <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">Herbert "H.H." Asquith</a>), designed by Lutyens and executed by <a href="Eric%20Gill">Eric Gill</a>. Raymond was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> in 1916. Both men are listed on the village war memorial.

By 1916, seventy-four men from Mells had left to fight, and several women, including Lady Horner, were working as nurses in France. By the end of the war, 21 men had been killed and multiple others wounded. Among the returned was the curate of St Andrew's Church, who earned the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> for saving a wounded soldier.

Mells' war dead were first commemorated by a stone tablet on a wall in St Andrew's Church, designed by the <a href="Kensington%20School%20of%20Art">Kensington School of Art</a> and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something to be looked at and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be on the road in a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.

As with most of his war memorial commissions, Lutyens walked around the village in August 1919 to examine possible sites for the memorial. He was accompanied by Katherine Asquith (Sir John and Lady Frances Horner's daughter and Raymond Asquith's widow) and a group of representatives from the village. Lutyens was moved by the villagers' personal loss and wrote in a letter to his wife, Emily: "My weekend was a spring day, fun and tears. All their young men were killed". He told Emily he had "found a perfect site in the middle of the village, which no-one else found, or thought of, and with a little tact and patience it was carried by the villagers with acclaim".

The memorial takes the form of a <a href="Tuscan%20column">Tuscan column</a> of <a href="Purbeck%20Marble">Purbeck Marble</a> construction, on which stands a statue of <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> slaying a dragon. Lady Horner first hoped to have an original sculpture and approached several artists but all quotes she received would have exceeded the village's budget, so she instead commissioned a copy of a statue in the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Chapel">Henry VII Chapel</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The column stands on a tall, narrow pedestal in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> that bears the inscription: , a verse suggested by <a href="Robert%20Bridges">Robert Bridges</a>, the <a href="Poet%20Laureate%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">poet laureate</a>, in correspondence with Lady Horner. A cross is engraved immediately above.

To either side of the pedestal are matching panels onto which are inscribed the names of the village's war dead. At the same height are flanking walls of coarsed, squared rubble from the nearby <a href="Doulting%20Stone%20Quarry">Doulting Stone Quarry</a>, set back at the ends and topped with a yew hedge. In front of each wall is a small stone bench that protrudes across the base of the column, and above the benches, fixed to the wall, are round plaques bearing the dates of the Second World War and the names of the village's dead from that conflict. The statue and the inscriptions are both the work of Eric Gill, who also carved the memorial to Raymond Asquith. Colin Amery, who chaired an exhibition of Lutyens' works after his death, describes the memorials at Mells as among Lutyens' finest.

Lutyens was profoundly affected by the war and sought a new form of architecture to memorialise the <a href="Lost%20Generation">Lost Generation</a>. He generally preferred abstract designs for his war memorials, of which he designed dozens, over allegorical or figurative sculpture or the overt religious imagery that was present in many First World War memorials. Mells is one of the few monuments in which he used such allegory (in this case, the statue of Saint George). It is the most intricate of Lutyens' civic memorials to feature a statue of Saint George, though his memorial inside <a href="Wellington%20College%2C%20Berkshire">Wellington College</a>'s chapel features a similar sculpture of George and the Dragon. <a href="Fordham%20War%20Memorial">Fordham War Memorial</a> in Cambridgeshire and <a href="Hove%20War%20Memorial">Hove War Memorial</a> in East Sussex both feature less intricate bronze statues of George with a sword and shield.

The memorial was unveiled at a ceremony on 26 June 1921. It cost £400 to build, which was raised by public subscription. The unveiling was performed by Brigadier-General <a href="Arthur%20Asquith">Arthur Asquith</a>, brother of Raymond Asquith, who is commemorated on the memorial. General Asquith was later instrumental in the creation of Lutyens' <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Division%20War%20Memorial">Royal Naval Division War Memorial</a> outside the Admiralty building in London.

Mells War Memorial was designated a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 1 January 1969 and noted for its setting with the <a href="Mells%20Village%20Hall">village hall</a> (which is also listed at grade II*) and the various other historic buildings in the village, including several by Lutyens. Listed building status offers statutory protection from demolition or modification; grade II* is reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applied to about 5.5% of listings. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Historic England recognised Lutyens' war memorials as a "national collection".

York City War Memorial

The York City War Memorial is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a> designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> and located in <a href="York">York</a> in the north of England. Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial. Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose. Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument. The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">North Eastern Railway</a> (NER) to design <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20War%20Memorial">their own war memorial</a>, also to be sited in York. Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials. Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient <a href="York%20city%20walls">city walls</a>, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's. Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location. This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds.

<a href="George%20VI">Prince Albert</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a> (later King George VI), unveiled the memorial on 25 June 1925, six years after the memorial fund was opened. It consists of a stone cross high on three stone blocks and a stone base, beneath which are two further blocks and two shallow steps. It sits in a memorial garden, with an entrance designed by Lutyens using the remaining funds for the memorial. The memorial itself is a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, having been upgraded when Lutyens' war memorials were designated a "national collection" in 2015. The piers and gate at the entrance to the garden are listed separately at grade II.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens designed <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations; the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a>, the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world; and the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a>, which appears in all large <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' civic memorials. The York City Memorial was the fifteenth and final War Cross designed by Lutyens, all to a broadly similar design. Most were commissioned for villages—the <a href="Devon%20County%20War%20Memorial">Devon County War Memorial</a> in <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> is the only other example of a War Cross serving as a civic memorial in a city.

Proposals for a war memorial in York were mired in controversy from the outset. A war memorial committee was established after a council meeting in May 1919 and the committee opened a memorial fund for donations in August, but six years elapsed before the City War Memorial was unveiled. The first point of contention was one that arose in many communities when considering a war memorial. Some felt that the war dead should be commemorated through a building with some community purpose rather than a purely decorative monument. Multiple ideas were put forward and the council tasked the war memorial committee with considering several proposals, including a new city hall and a convalescent home. The committee generated several ideas of its own including a new bridge over the <a href="River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire">River Ouse</a>, homes for war widows, a maternity hospital, and several ideas for an educational institution. A series of public meetings produced still further ideas until a meeting on 14 January 1920, where a consensus was established in favour of a monument rather than any utilitarian proposal. 

The committee requested that the city engineer produce a design for a memorial garden with an archway and a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>. The city engineer reported back with a design which he estimated would cost around £7,000 and the war memorial committee appointed Lutyens to oversee the project. Lutyens had recently been commissioned to design <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20War%20Memorial">a memorial</a> for the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">North Eastern Railway Company</a> (NER) which was based in York and planned to erect its own memorial in the city dedicated to those of its staff who fought and died in the war.

The committee gave Lutyens a budget of £2,000 (1920). The architect visited York on 12 August 1920. Accompanied by the lord mayor and the city engineer, he reviewed nine potential sites for the memorial. His preference was for a former cholera burial ground just outside the city walls, but the committee opted for his second choice of a site inside the walls in the moat by <a href="Lendal%20Bridge">Lendal Bridge</a>, from the proposed location for the NER's memorial. The committee asked Lutyens to submit a formal proposal, which they received eleven weeks later. The design consisted of Lutyens' Stone of Remembrance, complete with its characteristic base of three shallow steps, raised on a large podium taking it off the ground. It was the only design for the Stone of Remembrance to treat it as an object of veneration—in all of Lutyens' other designs for the stone it functioned as an altar, albeit more symbolic than practical—and one of the most ambitious of all his war memorial projects. The committee endorsed the proposal on 24 June 1920, after which it was published in the local newspapers as part of a public consultation. It was eventually approved at a further public meeting on 25 November 1920.

Nonetheless, objections were raised after the approval. The York Archaeological Society (YAS) and the Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society (YAYAS) felt that the scheme was not in keeping with the existing architecture in the area, particularly York's ancient <a href="York%20city%20walls">city walls</a>, and that it would obstruct views for pedestrians coming into the city from the railway station. Other members of the community, including a local councillor, were concerned that the city's memorial in its proposed location would be overshadowed by the railway company's, given that the NER had granted Lutyens a budget of £20,000—ten times that allocated by the city—for which he had proposed a obelisk and large screen wall. Given the proximity to the city walls (Lutyens' initial proposal for the NER abutted the walls) both the city's scheme and the NER's required the consent of the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20Board">Ancient Monuments Board</a> (later <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> and then Historic England). <a href="Charles%20Reed%20Peers">Charles Reed Peers</a>, the board's chief inspector of ancient monuments, attended a meeting at the NER's offices on 8 July 1922 to hear representations for and against both schemes. He requested Lutyens make modification to the NER's memorial, but approved the city's, noting that the proposed site was not part of the walls' <a href="Rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a> and had been created when Lendal Bridge was built in the mid 19th century.

Public opposition to the proposed site mounted, even after the Ancient Monuments Board's approval, and the YAYAS continued to apply pressure, calling another public meeting—which it scheduled for 3 May 1923—forcing the war memorial committee to reconsider. The committee revisited a site on Leeman Road, outside the city walls, which had originally been proposed in 1921. Lutyens sent his assistant Albert J Thomas (an architect in his own right) to examine the site on 8 August 1923 and all parties agreed to it. By coincidence, the site was owned by the NER, which donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between the company and the city, the NER having recently been amalgamated into the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>. Lutyens submitted a revised design to account for the new location—a War Cross and a Stone of Remembrance—which would have cost almost £2,500. The scheme was scaled back to just the cross and the council undertook to conduct the work using its own staff in order to keep within the £1,100 that had been raised by public subscription.

The memorial was unveiled a year after the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20War%20Memorial">North Eastern Railway War Memorial</a>, at a ceremony on 25 June 1925, which was attended by large crowds. <a href="George%20VI">Prince Albert</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a> (later King George VI), performed the unveiling and the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> <a href="Cosmo%20Gordon%20Lang">Cosmo Gordon Lang</a> gave a dedication. <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">The Duchess of York</a> had earlier that day unveiled the Five Sisters Window in <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>, dedicated to "women of the Empire" killed in the First World War.

Of <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> construction, the memorial is in the form of a high, lozenge-shaped shaft with short, <a href="chamfer">chamfer</a>ed arms, <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">moulded</a> where they meet the shaft to form a cross. The cross stands on a base of four uneven rectangular blocks, below which is an undercut square platform, which itself stands on two square blocks. At the very bottom are two wide, shallow steps. The largest block of the base bears the only inscription on the memorial: "TO THE CITIZENS OF YORK 1914 – 1918, 1939 – 1945" on the south face, and "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE" on the north; the dates of the Second World War were added later. As a memento, a bottle, several coins, and a newspaper were placed inside the structure. The memorial stands in a war memorial garden on the south bank of the River Ouse; it overlooks the river and the ruins of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Abbey%2C%20York">St Mary's Abbey</a> on the opposite bank.

When the accounts were reconciled in April 1926, there remained £400 in the memorial fund after Lutyens' fee of £122 and expenses of £20, so the committee commissioned Lutyens to design a set of entrance gates and a pair of supporting piers at the entrance to the memorial garden. The tall, rectangular piers are of limestone construction with <a href="cornice">cornice</a>s and <a href="finial">finial</a>s in the shape of balls. The gates themselves are iron, painted black and gold, with iron panels linking them to the piers and an <a href="Overthrow%20%28structure%29">overthrow</a> above, in the centre of which is the <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20York">City of York's coat of arms</a>. The gates open towards the memorial and are aligned with it. To wind up the memorial fund, the committee spent the remaining £17 on three wooden benches for the memorial garden. 

The York City War Memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> (a status which offers statutory protection from demolition or modification, applied to structures of "special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them") on 10 September 1970 and the gates and piers were separately listed at grade II on 24 June 1983. The nearby NER memorial, just the other side of the city walls, was listed at grade II* (defined as "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applied to about 5.5% of listed buildings) on 10 September 1970. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a "national collection" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed; their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> list entries were also updated and expanded. As part of this process, the York City memorial was upgraded from grade II to grade II*.

North Eastern Railway War Memorial

The North Eastern Railway War Memorial is a <a href="First%20World%20War%20memorial">First World War memorial</a> in <a href="York">York</a> in northern England. It was designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> to commemorate employees of the <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">North Eastern Railway</a> (NER) who left to fight in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and were killed while serving. The NER board voted in early 1920 to allocate £20,000 for a memorial and commissioned Lutyens. The committee for the <a href="York%20City%20War%20Memorial">York City War Memorial</a> followed suit and also appointed Lutyens, but both schemes became embroiled in controversy. Concerns were raised from within the community about the effect of the NER memorial on the <a href="York%20city%20walls">city walls</a> and its impact on the proposed scheme for the city's war memorial, given that the two memorials were planned to be apart and the city's budget was a tenth of the NER's. The controversy was resolved after Lutyens modified his plans for the NER memorial to move it away from the walls and the city opted for a revised scheme on land just outside the walls; coincidentally the land was owned by the NER, whose board donated it to the city.

The NER memorial was unveiled on 14 June 1924 by Field Marshal <a href="Herbert%20Plumer%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Plumer">Lord Plumer</a>. It consists of a high obelisk which rises from the rear portion of a three-sided screen wall. The wall forms a recess in which stands Lutyens' characteristic <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a>. The wall itself is decorated with several carved <a href="Festoon">swags</a> and wreaths, including a wreath surrounding the NER's coat of arms at the base of the obelisk. The memorial is a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>, and is part of a "national collection" of Lutyens' war memorials.

The <a href="North%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">North Eastern Railway</a> (NER), one of the largest employers in the north of England, released over 18,000 of its employees to serve in the armed forces during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, many of them joining the <a href="List_of_Northumberland_Fusiliers_battalions_in_World_War_I%2317th%20%28Service%29%20Battalion%20%28N.E.R.%20Pioneers%29">17th (North Eastern Railway) Battalion</a> of the <a href="Northumberland%20Fusiliers">Northumberland Fusiliers</a>. By the end of the war, 2,236 men from the company had died on military service overseas; others were killed at home by bombardments of east coast ports, such as the <a href="raid%20on%20Scarborough%2C%20Hartlepool%20and%20Whitby">raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby</a>, and in the three <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> raids on <a href="York">York</a>.

After the war, thousands of memorials were built across Britain. Among the most prominent designers of memorials was architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens designed <a href="The%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became the focus for the national <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a> commemorations, as well as the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial%20to%20the%20Missing">Thiepval Memorial to the Missing</a>—the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world—and the <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> which appears in all large <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemeteries and in several of Lutyens' war memorials in Britain, including the North Eastern Railway's.

The war memorial is one of several buildings and structures in the centre of York related to the NER, including the company's headquarters and <a href="York%20old%20railway%20station">the city's original railway station</a>. The site—chosen as being immediately adjacent to the company's head office—was originally a coal depot and carriage sidings.

At a meeting in February 1920 the NER's board voted to allocate £20,000 to the memorial project rather than seek donations from the company's workforce, and commissioned Lutyens to design it. Lutyens' commission was confirmed in October 1921, for a fee of £700 plus out-of-pocket expenses. The NER's deputy general manager explained that Lutyens had been chosen because he was "the fashionable architect and therefore could do no wrong".

The project became embroiled in a controversy surrounding its size and location, which grew to envelop the proposed <a href="York%20City%20War%20Memorial">York City War Memorial</a>. Following the railway company's lead, the City War Memorial Committee also appointed Lutyens, and endorsed his plan for a Stone of Remembrance elevated on a large plinth in the moat by <a href="Lendal%20Bridge">Lendal Bridge</a>, from the proposed site of the NER's memorial. The controversy revolved partly around the relationship between the two memorials—Lutyens felt that the two designs would complement one another, but the city had given Lutyens a budget of £2,000, a tenth of that allocated to him by the NER, and some members of the local community were concerned that the railway company's memorial would be much larger and would overshadow the city's. Another concern, raised by a city councillor, was that visitors walking into the city centre from the railway station would see the NER's memorial first. Lutyens responded that he felt the two memorials would show a common purpose, and thus that their proximity was not an issue.

The issue was further complicated by the proximity of both proposed schemes to York's ancient <a href="York%20city%20walls">city walls</a>; both schemes required the consent of the <a href="Ancient%20Monuments%20Board">Ancient Monuments Board</a> (later <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> and now Historic England), particularly as Lutyens' design for the NER involved the memorial abutting the city walls and would have required excavation of part of the <a href="rampart%20%28fortification%29">rampart</a>s, to which the Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society (YAYAS) strenuously objected. The NER's in-house architect suggested moving the memorial to the east, away from the wall; Lutyens, in India at the time, dismissed the idea in a <a href="cablegram">cable</a>. In February 1922, the secretary of the YAYAS, Dr <a href="William%20Arthur%20Evelyn">William Evelyn</a>, gave a lecture in which he was severely critical of the NER's proposed memorial. He told his audience "I think it is an enormous pity that they cannot find room in which to place a sacred emblem commemorative of the patriotism, bravery, and self-sacrifice of our own soldiers of the twentieth century and that it should be considered necessary to deface and despoil another sacred emblem". The City War Memorial Committee and representatives of the NER met with <a href="Charles%20Reed%20Peers">Charles Reed Peers</a>, the Ancient Monuments Board's chief inspector, at the NER's offices on 8 July 1922, in preparation for which the NER erected a full-size wooden model of their proposed memorial. Peers approved the city's scheme, noting that its proposed location was in fact a newer structure and not part of the walls' ramparts, but requested that Lutyens submit a revised design for the NER's memorial to move it away from the wall. Lutyens acquiesced but observed that the modifications would require a reduction in the size of the screen wall and thus in the size of the names to be listed on it, which he felt was detrimental to the scheme. He submitted the revised designs and they were approved in October 1922.

The remaining issues were largely resolved after the city relented to public pressure and opted to site its memorial on a plot of land off Leeman Road, just outside the city walls, and for a reduced scheme in the form of a cross due to a shortage of funds. Coincidentally, the land was owned by the railway company and the NER board donated it to the city in a mark of gratitude for the good relations between the company and the city; the NER had by that time been amalgamated into the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (LNER) as a result of the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Railways Act 1921</a>.

Built from <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, the memorial is sited against the ramparts of the city walls. It consists of a single, obelisk rising from a three-tiered pedestal set into the rear portion of a three-sided screen wall. The wall creates a recess, sheltering a Stone of Remembrance. The two flanking sides terminate with urn-shaped <a href="finial">finial</a>s; the ends of each wall are decorated with a <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurel wreath</a> in relief carving; the inside of the walls is further decorated with laurel <a href="Festoon">swags</a> below the urns. The rear wall bears further relief swags to either side of the obelisk; the North Eastern Railway Company's coat of arms is engraved on the pedestal of the obelisk, just above the level of the screen wall, which is surrounded by another laurel wreath. The obelisk rises above the screen wall to a total height of . The Stone of Remembrance is a <a href="monolith">monolith</a> in the shape of an altar, long and curved so slightly as to barely be visible to the naked eye; it is deliberately devoid of any decoration besides the inscription "THEIR NAME LIVETH FOR EVERMORE".

The dedication is inscribed in the centre of the rear part of the screen wall: "IN REMEMBRANCE OF THOSE MEN OF THE NORTH EASTERN RAILWAY WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY THE COMPANY PLACES THIS MONUMENT"; the dates of the First World War are inscribed to either side. The 2,236 names were inscribed on panels affixed to the wall. Behind the Stone of Remembrance are 15 slates set into the floor of the memorial in 1984, bearing the names of the LNER's 551 dead from the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.

The North Eastern Railway War Memorial was finally constructed once the ancient Monuments Board approved Lutyens' modified design; it was unveiled by Field Marshal <a href="Herbert%20Plumer%2C%201st%20Baron%20Plumer">Herbert Plumer, 1st Baron Plumer</a> (later 1st Viscount Plumer) at a ceremony on 14 June 1924, and dedicated by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> <a href="Cosmo%20Gordon%20Lang">Cosmo Gordon Lang</a>. A crowd of five to six thousand people gathered for the ceremony, among them multiple civic officials and officers of the LNER and former NER, including <a href="Sir%20Ralph%20Wedgwood%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Ralph Wedgwood</a>, chief officer of the LNER; the Sheriff of York; and the lord mayors of Bradford, Hull, and York. Sentries from the <a href="Durham%20Light%20Infantry">Durham Light Infantry</a> stood at the four corners of the Stone of Remembrance. Among those to give speeches was <a href="Edward%20Grey%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Grey%20of%20Fallodon">Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon</a>, a member of the NER's board and the former foreign secretary famous for his remark "<a href="the%20lamps%20are%20going%20out">the lamps are going out</a>". Grey spoke of the losses caused by the war: "the old North Eastern board and its general manager numbered some twenty persons. Out of those twenty, four lost sons in the war; three lost only sons. There is no reason to suppose that proportion is exceptional". At the conclusion of the service, the "<a href="Last%20Post">Last Post</a>" was sounded and the crowd observed two minutes' silence. The city's war memorial was unveiled a year later.

The inscriptions, particularly the names of those killed, suffered from exposure to the elements. Restoration work, including re-carving, was carried out in the 1980s, funded by donations from the British Railways Engineers Ex-Servicemen's Association match-funded by <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>. Erosion continued in the years following and in lieu of re-carving them and causing further damage to the memorial, the names were recorded in a book which is held by the <a href="National%20Railway%20Museum">National Railway Museum</a>.

The memorial was designated a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> (a status which offers statutory protection from demolition or modification, defined as "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applied to about 5.5% of listed buildings) on 10 September 1970. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a "national collection" and all 44 of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their <a href="National%20Heritage%20List%20for%20England">National Heritage List for England</a> entries updated and expanded. As part of this process, the York City memorial was upgraded to grade II* to match the NER's memorial.

More Hall Annex

The More Hall Annex, formerly the Nuclear Reactor Building, was a building on the campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> (UW) in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington, United States, that once housed a functional <a href="nuclear%20research%20reactor">nuclear research reactor</a>. It was inaugurated in 1961 and shut down in 1988, operating at a peak of 100 <a href="kilowatt">kilowatt</a>s thermal (kWt), and was officially decommissioned in 2007.

The reactor was housed in a <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced concrete</a> building designed in the <a href="Brutalist%20architecture">Brutalist architectural style</a> by UW faculty members. They designed the reactor room with large windows that allowed observation from the outside, in an attempt to demonstrate the safety of nuclear energy.

The Nuclear Reactor Building was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2009, after a campaign led by an architecture student in response to the proposed demolition of the building. A later demolition plan prompted a lawsuit from preservation groups, which ended with a court ruling exempting the building from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance. While this decision was eventually overturned, the university demolished the building in July 2016 and will replace it with a new <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> building that opened in February 2019.

The building housed an <a href="Argonaut%20class%20reactor">Argonaut class reactor</a> with an initial output of 10 <a href="kilowatt">kilowatt</a>s thermal (kWt), later increased to 100 kWt in 1967. It used <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> as fuel and was cooled by water. The reactor's chamber, placed on the lower floor of the facility, was high, long, and wide. During its 27-year lifespan, the reactor operated for the equivalent of 140 days, running for some days at half power and for as little as 10 minutes.

The More Hall Annex was a two-story, reinforced concrete structure designed in the <a href="Brutalist%20architecture">Brutalist style</a>, similar to other buildings on the university campus built during the post-war era. It occupied a footprint of from north to south and from east to west, with a total of of interior space. The building was designed by a consortium of UW faculty members, known as The Architect Artist Group (TAAG), with input from nuclear engineering department chair <a href="Albert%20L.%20Babb">Albert L. Babb</a>. Babb requested a building that would "show the world what nuclear power looked like", desiring a prominent structure on the campus that would serve as a crown jewel for the department. The large glass walls enabled public viewing of the reactor room's interior, showcasing the activity inside.

The first floor, partly covered by the outdoor <a href="plaza">plaza</a>, housed the reactor, laboratory, crystal <a href="spectrometer">spectrometer</a>, counting room with a <a href="nuclear%20densometer">nuclear densometer</a>, classrooms, restrooms, and offices. The second floor contained the control room, an observatory, and a lecture room overlooking the reactor; it was open to the outdoor plaza on three sides, with large glass windows allowing for public observation of experiments. The reactor was placed on the lower side of the building, downhill of the plaza, to allow the ground to absorb accidental <a href="radiation">radiation</a> leaks. The structure's roof rested on a series of perpendicular beams that also supported a three-<a href="short%20ton">ton</a> ( kg) crane used to lift the reactor shield between experiments.

During the late 1950s and 1960s, the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> (AEC) provided universities and colleges with grants to acquire small <a href="nuclear%20reactors">nuclear reactors</a> for research programs. The <a href="University%20of%20Washington">University of Washington</a> began <a href="nuclear%20engineering">nuclear engineering</a> classes as part of the College of Engineering in 1953 and formed a Department of Nuclear Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> and the nearby <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a> as its first students. The Nuclear Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, the first of its kind in the United States.

The proposed 10 kW reactor was approved by the university's Board of Regents in April 1959, to be housed in a two-story reinforced concrete building with offices, workshops, a control room, and class and seminar spaces. The building was designed by TAAG architects <a href="Wendell%20Lovett">Wendell Lovett</a>, Gene Zema and Daniel Streissguth, all members of the UW faculty. In December, the regents awarded the construction contract to Jentoft & Forbes, paying $308,082 (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the project. A site at the eastern edge of the campus was chosen for its proximity to various academic engineering buildings and its visibility to the public.

The AEC granted an operating license for the reactor to the university in April 1961, and the reactor began operating with a self-sustained nuclear reaction on April 10. It was officially dedicated on June 1, in a ceremony attended by <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a> director <a href="Norman%20Hilberry">Norman Hilberry</a>, a physicist who worked on <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>, the world's first nuclear reactor to achieve <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">criticality</a>. During the <a href="1962%20World%27s%20Fair">1962 World's Fair</a>, hosted by the city at the <a href="Seattle%20Center">Seattle Center</a>, the reactor became the subject of group tours from professional organizations.

Throughout the 1960s, the reactor was used for medical research by the university's School of Medicine and local hospitals, with a staff of six full-time employees and four part-time staff (most of whom were students who worked for the <a href="Nuclear%20navy%23United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy's nuclear programs</a>). In 1966, the university and local law enforcement agencies proposed converting the reactor into a part-time laboratory for <a href="forensic%20science">forensic science</a>. By 1975, the reactor had only used of its of uranium-235 fuel.

On June 13, 1972, during an experiment that used a <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> sample, three lab workers were exposed to radiation after a capsule holding the sample spilled, requiring a full investigation of the nuclear reactor. One of the workers, graduate student W. Robert Sloan, was exposed to of plutonium dust and drove to a laboratory in <a href="Richland%2C%20Washington">Richland</a> to be tested for radiation, but was later cleared of any contamination. The spill was later linked to vibrations in the capsule holding the sample, and workers credited good design and careful handling in avoiding a larger incident. A visiting class of schoolchildren from <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, observing the reactor from the outside, were unaffected by the accident. After an inspection by teams from the Hanford Site, the lab was cleaned and wiped down while periodic radiation checks were performed. Contaminated materials were sanitized with a liquid <a href="freon">freon</a> solution and disposed of; the
clean-up cost a total of $30,000 in emergency funds (equivalent to $ in dollars).

The university was cited by the AEC for violations of its reactor-operating license in connection with the incident, but none in direct connection to the immediate cause. The incident resulted in an investigation by the <a href="Nuclear%20Reactor%20Advisory%20Committee">Nuclear Reactor Advisory Committee</a> into its review processes for reactor experiments, after the AEC determined there was inadequate review of the UW experiment. The staff members were praised by the AEC for protecting the public by sealing the materials and evacuating the building for six hours.

In the late 1970s, development of <a href="nuclear%20power%20in%20the%20United%20States">nuclear power in the United States</a> slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the <a href="Washington%20Public%20Power%20Supply%20System">Washington Public Power Supply System</a>, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the <a href="Three%20Mile%20Island%20accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> of 1979 both contributed to a decline in interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program had shrunk to 23 students, and the program was cancelled entirely in 1992.

The reactor was shut down on June 30, 1988, following a <a href="Nuclear%20Regulatory%20Commission">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (NRC) mandate to convert research reactors to lower-grade fuel, or shut them down entirely, after fears of possible terrorist access. The remaining of enriched uranium fuel rods were transported to <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> for processing and disposal. The building provided offices and storage space for various UW departments, including the College of Engineering's robotics laboratory. The University of Washington applied to the NRC to dismantle the reactor on August 2, 1994.

In the wake of the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, the Nuclear Reactor Building was renamed to the More Hall Annex to deter burglary, after a request from the NRC. Formal decommissioning of the site, including a $4 million cleanup (equivalent to $ in dollars), began in April 2006, amid student protests over the contractor hired for the work. The NRC formally terminated the university's license to operate the reactor in May 2007.

Prior to the removal of the reactor in October 2008, the university proposed demolishing the structure and redeveloping the site for other uses. The plan was stopped after the reactor building was placed on the <a href="Washington%20Heritage%20Register">Washington Heritage Register</a>, the state's list of historic buildings, a designation that was contested by the University of Washington. Preservationists suggested re-using the building as a museum dedicated to the state's nuclear history and continuing research. The structure was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 2009, based on an application submitted by Abby Inpanbutr (née Martin), a UW architecture student, in spring 2008.

The university again proposed demolition of the structure in 2015, to clear the space for a new <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> building adjacent to the existing <a href="Paul%20G.%20Allen%20School%20of%20Computer%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Engineering">Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering</a>. In May 2015, the More Hall Annex was named one of Washington's "most endangered historic properties" by the Washington Trust for Historic Preservation, which cited its place as an early Brutalist work to justify its preservation.

The university released a draft supplemental <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> (SEIS) for the project in October 2015, recommending the demolition of the More Hall Annex in their preferred alternative. In response to the SEIS, building conservation group <a href="Docomomo%20International">Docomomo WEWA</a> nominated the More Hall Annex for <a href="List%20of%20Seattle%20landmarks">city landmark status</a> on December 2. The University of Washington filed a lawsuit against the City of Seattle and Docomomo on December 18 over the landmark nomination and whether the city could enforce its landmark preservation laws on state-owned property.

The <a href="King%20County%20Superior%20Court">King County Superior Court</a> ruled in April that the university was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a <a href="stay%20of%20proceedings">stay</a> that would leave them responsible for <a href="damages">damages</a> compensation. The decision was appealed to the <a href="Washington%20Supreme%20Court">Washington Supreme Court</a>, which ruled in the city's favor and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.

On February 11, 2016, the UW Board of Regents approved a site plan that would demolish the More Hall Annex to allow for the construction of the new computer science center, to open in 2019. An attempt to incorporate elements of the nuclear reactor into the new computer science building was rejected because of the impact of potential <a href="seismic%20retrofit">seismic retrofit</a>s that would be required to meet modern standards. The computer science department instead plans to make a <a href="virtual%20tour">virtual tour</a> of the building available online in a digital archive.

After the decision by the King County Superior Court to exempt the building from city preservation ordinances, the university applied for a demolition permit in May 2016. Demolition of the More Hall Annex began on July 19, and preservationists held a mock funeral for the building with Daniel Streissguth, one of the project's original architects.

The More Hall Annex was replaced by the <a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Center%20for%20Computer%20Science%20%26amp%3B%20Engineering">Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science & Engineering</a>, which houses part of the university's computer science program. The building includes a 250-person lecture hall, classrooms, and lab spaces for robotics and other technologies. In January 2017, the Board of Regents approved its construction, which began later in the year. The building was <a href="topping%20out">topped out</a> in December 2017, roughly marking the halfway point in construction. The Bill & Melinda Gates Center was opened to students on February 28, 2019.

Kahne moved back into the first position on lap 96, with Raines reclaiming the lead on the 123rd lap. Kahne passed Raines to move back into the lead 15 laps later. Johnson moved into the lead on lap 168 and held the position for a total of 72 laps. At the race's final restart on lap 307 Johnson led until he was passed two laps later by Kahne who maintained it to win the race. There was a total of ten <a href="Caution%20flag">cautions</a> and 34 lead changes by thirteen different drivers.

The victory was Kahne's sixth of the season, and the seventh of his career, since he debuted in <a href="2004%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2004</a>. After the race Burton maintained his lead in the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a>, which increased to 45 points over nearest rival <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a>. Kahne's victory moved him from ninth to eighth, while <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a> dropped to tenth because he failed to score enough points due to an engine failure in the race's closing laps. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> maintained its lead in the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20champions">Manufacturers' Championship</a>, 48 points in front of <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> and 54 ahead of <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> with five races left in the season.

The Bank of America 500 was the 31st of 36 scheduled <a href="Stock%20car%20racing">stock car races</a> of the <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series</a>, and the fifth in the ten-race season-ending <a href="2006%20Chase%20for%20the%20Nextel%20Cup">Chase for the Nextel Cup</a>. It was held on October 14, 2006, in <a href="Concord%2C%20North%20Carolina">Concord, North Carolina</a>, at <a href="Charlotte%20Motor%20Speedway">Lowe's Motor Speedway</a> (now called Charlotte Motor Speedway), one of ten <a href="Oval%20track%20racing%23Intermediate%20tracks">intermediate tracks</a> to hold <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> races; the others are <a href="Atlanta%20Motor%20Speedway">Atlanta Motor Speedway</a>, <a href="Kansas%20Speedway">Kansas Speedway</a>, <a href="Chicagoland%20Speedway">Chicagoland Speedway</a>, <a href="Darlington%20Raceway">Darlington Raceway</a>, <a href="Homestead-Miami%20Speedway">Homestead-Miami Speedway</a>, <a href="New%20Hampshire%20Motor%20Speedway">New Hampshire Motor Speedway</a>, <a href="Kentucky%20Speedway">Kentucky Speedway</a>, <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Motor%20Speedway">Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a>, and <a href="Texas%20Motor%20Speedway">Texas Motor Speedway</a>. The standard track at Lowe's Motor Speedway is a four-turn, -long, <a href="Oval%20track%23Quad-oval">quad-oval</a> track. The track's turns are <a href="Banked%20turn">banked</a> at twenty-four degrees; both the front stretch (the location of the finish line) and the <a href="Straight%20%28racing%29">back stretch</a> (opposite the front) have a five-degree banking.

Before the race, <a href="Jeff%20Burton">Jeff Burton</a> led the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Sprint%20Cup%20Series%20champions">Drivers' Championship</a> with 5,598 <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20points%20scoring%20systems%231975%E2%80%932010">points</a>, with <a href="Matt%20Kenseth">Matt Kenseth</a> sixth points behind in second, and <a href="Mark%20Martin">Mark Martin</a> was a further four adrift in third. <a href="Kevin%20Harvick">Kevin Harvick</a> and <a href="Denny%20Hamlin">Denny Hamlin</a> were fourth and fifth. <a href="Dale%20Earnhardt%20Jr.">Dale Earnhardt Jr.</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Gordon">Jeff Gordon</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Johnson">Jimmie Johnson</a>, <a href="Kasey%20Kahne">Kasey Kahne</a>, and <a href="Kyle%20Busch">Kyle Busch</a> rounded out the top ten drivers competing in the 2006 Chase for the Nextel Cup. Johnson was the race's defending champion. <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> was leading the <a href="List%20of%20NASCAR%20Manufacturers%27%20champions">Manufacturers' Championship</a> with 231 points; <a href="Dodge">Dodge</a> was second with 170, and <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> was a close third with 169. NASCAR mandated that teams use a <a href="Racing%20fuel%20cell">fuel cell</a> for the second time in the season so there would be fewer laps between pit stops and more tire changes could occur. Tire supplier <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear</a> brought a supply of new right-hand tires, which were tested at the track on August 29 with drivers <a href="Joe%20Nemechek">Joe Nemechek</a> and <a href="Kurt%20Busch">Kurt Busch</a>. The duo believed Goodyear had rectified problems with harder-compound tires that were raised at the previous round at Charlotte (the <a href="2006%20Coca-Cola%20600">Coca-Cola 600</a>).

After he was rammed by his teammate <a href="Brian%20Vickers">Brian Vickers</a> in the preceding <a href="2006%20UAW-Ford%20500">UAW-Ford 500</a>, Johnson said the expectations for him to succeed at Lowe's Motor Speedway were high and hoped the track's surface would be more predictable than the last race at Charlotte. Martin said he was in the best position that he had been in for several years to win the championship, and spoke of his waning interest in looking at race results. Having secured one top-ten finish in the season's first four Chase for the Nextel Cup races, Earnhardt stated he need to secure a top-five finishing position, and was determined to get his team more involved in the championship battle. Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although Kahne had a poor start in the Chase, he rectified this by finishing second at <a href="Talladega%20Superspeedway">Talladega Superspeedway</a>. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.

One team made its début at the race. <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing%20Team">Red Bull Racing Team</a> elected to start operations early as part of a warm-up exercise to running a full-time schedule in <a href="2007%20NASCAR%20Nextel%20Cup%20Series">2007</a> with the <a href="1988%20NASCAR%20Winston%20Cup%20Series">1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series</a> champion <a href="Bill%20Elliott">Bill Elliott</a> driving the 83 car. Elliott would attempt to qualify the car at three races towards the end of the year. He said that his decision to join Red Bull was because of the organization's willingness to become competitive. Elliott stated that he was required to qualify the car for the race and move up the field, and provide input that would allow the team to be prepared for the <a href="2007%20Daytona%20500">2007 Daytona 500</a>.

Three practice sessions were held before the Sunday race, one each on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The first practice session lasted 90 minutes, the second 60 minutes, and the third 50 minutes. Kahne set the fastest time in the first practice session with a lap of 28.834 seconds; <a href="Scott%20Riggs">Scott Riggs</a> was second, and Kurt Busch third. <a href="Elliott%20Sadler">Elliott Sadler</a> took fourth position, and Martin placed fifth. Johnson, Nemechek, <a href="Martin%20Truex%20Jr.">Martin Truex Jr.</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Green%20%28racing%20driver%29">Jeff Green</a>, and Hamlin rounded out the session's top-ten fastest drivers.

Although 52 cars were entered in the qualifier, according to NASCAR's <a href="NASCAR%20rules%20and%20regulations%23Qualifying%20procedure">qualifying procedure</a>, only 43 could race. Each driver was limited to two timed laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Riggs clinched the third <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> of his career, and his third consecutive at Lowe's Motor Speedway, with a fastest time of 28.203 seconds. He was joined on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">grid</a>'s front row by Kahne, his <a href="Richard%20Petty%20Motorsports">Evernham Motorsports</a> teammate, who held the pole position until Riggs' lap. Kurt Busch originally qualified in third, but his car's right-rear <a href="shock%20absorber">shock absorber</a> was found to have violated NASCAR regulations during the post-qualifying inspection because it did not bounce back. Busch was required to start from 42nd position after using a <a href="NASCAR%20rules%20and%20regulations%23Provisional%20rule">provisional</a>. Hence, <a href="Casey%20Mears">Casey Mears</a> inherited third, Sadler fourth, and Harvick fifth. Burton, Martin, <a href="Clint%20Bowyer">Clint Bowyer</a>, <a href="Reed%20Sorenson">Reed Sorenson</a> and Johnson rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Kenseth, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified eleventh, while Earnhardt took 16th and Kyle Busch 18th. The nine drivers who failed to qualify were Elliott, <a href="Kevin%20Lepage">Kevin Lepage</a>, <a href="Derrike%20Cope">Derrike Cope</a>, <a href="Chad%20Chaffin">Chad Chaffin</a>, <a href="Hermie%20Sadler">Hermie Sadler</a>, <a href="Kirk%20Shelmerdine">Kirk Shelmerdine</a>, <a href="Kenny%20Wallace">Kenny Wallace</a> (who crashed on his first timed lap), <a href="Morgan%20Shepherd">Morgan Shepherd</a> (who withdrew due to a lack of preparation), and <a href="Carl%20Long">Carl Long</a> (who crashed while attempting to record a timed lap). After the qualifier Riggs said that his team knew his car was decent, and revealed that his team wanted to get back into a rhythm of starting and finishing in a top position.

On Friday afternoon Kyle Busch was fastest in the second practice session with a time of 29.378 seconds, ahead of Kahne and <a href="Robby%20Gordon">Robby Gordon</a>. Bowyer was fourth-fastest; Johnson was fifth and Truex sixth. <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a>, Kurt Busch, Burton, and Martin followed in the top ten. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was eleventh-fastest, Hamlin set the twelfth-fastest time, and Harvick was fifteenth. <a href="Ryan%20Newman%20%28racing%20driver%29">Ryan Newman</a> crashed and switched to a back-up car. Later, on Saturday afternoon, Earnhardt paced the final practice session with a time of 29.357; Kyle Busch was second and Hamlin third. Kahne was fourth-fastest, ahead of Johnson and Bowyer. Biffle was seventh-fastest, Truex eighth, Riggs ninth, and Robby Gordon tenth. Other Chase drivers included Jeff Gordon in thirteenth and Burton in fifteenth; all were within three-tenths of a second of Earnhardt's time.

Live television coverage of the race on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> began at 7:04 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern Daylight Time</a>. Around the start of the race, weather conditions were sunny with an air temperature of which was forecast to drop as the event progressed. Dr. <a href="William%20K.%20Thierfelder">William K. Thierfelder</a>, president of <a href="Belmont%20Abbey%20College">Belmont Abbey College</a> in <a href="Belmont%2C%20North%20Carolina">Belmont, North Carolina</a>, began pre-race ceremonies with an <a href="invocation">invocation</a>. <a href="American%20Idol">American Idol</a> contestant and country music singer <a href="Kellie%20Pickler">Kellie Pickler</a> performed the <a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">national anthem</a>, and Mickey Jackson, the winner of a sponsored Grand Marshal contest, along with his five-year-old son Kalob, commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the <a href="Parade%20lap">pace laps</a>, Ryan Newman moved to the rear of the field because he switched to a back-up car.

The race started at 7:21 pm. Kahne accelerated faster than teammate Riggs off the line, and was ahead of him by the second turn. The first <a href="Caution%20flag">caution</a> of the race was given one lap later when <a href="Todd%20Bodine">Todd Bodine</a> collided with Robby Gordon in the <a href="tri-oval">tri-oval</a>. Gordon slid but regained control of his car with Bodine slowing. This triggered a <a href="The%20Big%20One%20%28NASCAR%29">multi-car accident</a> that involved <a href="Mike%20Bliss">Mike Bliss</a> hitting the rear of Hamlin's car sending him spinning down the front stretch which then involved <a href="Mike%20Skinner%20%28racing%20driver%29">Mike Skinner</a>, Truex, Jeff Gordon, <a href="Jamie%20McMurray">Jamie McMurray</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Petty">Kyle Petty</a>, <a href="J.%20J.%20Yeley">J. J. Yeley</a>, <a href="Travis%20Kvapil">Travis Kvapil</a>, <a href="David%20Gilliland">David Gilliland</a>, <a href="Tony%20Stewart">Tony Stewart</a>, Kurt Busch, Newman, and Nemechek. The incident blocked the track temporarily. Hamlin drove back to his garage where his team repaired his car. Kahne led the field at the lap-nine <a href="Rolling%20start">restart</a>, followed by Riggs and Mears. As the field drove through the first turn, a caution was issued immediately, because three safety vehicles were on the track as crew members did not hear there would be another lap added before racing resumed. All laps were counted towards the first caution.

Several cars elected to make <a href="pit%20stop">pit stop</a>s under caution. Stewart made repairs to his car's body which had been damaged in the lap two crash. Kahne maintained the top position at the lap twelve restart, with teammate Riggs in second. Riggs reclaimed the first position from Kahne on the 13th lap; after starting from 41st, Jeff Gordon moved up to 22nd position by lap 15. Two laps later, <a href="Dave%20Blaney">Dave Blaney</a> spun after leaving turn four and hit the outside <a href="SAFER%20barrier">barrier</a> with his car's left-rear quarter, triggering the second caution. Most of the field, including Riggs, chose to make pit stops for fuel and tires. <a href="Tony%20Raines">Tony Raines</a> decided not to make a pit stop and led the field back up to speed at the lap-22 restart, ahead of Newman, McMurray, <a href="Terry%20Labonte">Terry Labonte</a>, and Riggs. On the 23rd lap, Riggs and Kahne got ahead of Labonte for fourth and fifth positions. Riggs passed McMurray for third one lap later, and Kahne got ahead of McMurray for fourth on lap 25. Newman fell to fourth place when Riggs and Kahne passed him two laps later. Riggs passed Raines for the lead on the 30th lap, while Kahne moved into second place. Truex hit the wall on the same lap but no caution was shown.

On lap 33, Sorenson ran into the rear of <a href="Dale%20Jarrett">Dale Jarrett</a>'s car, which spun backwards into the turn four wall, prompting the third caution. Jarrett retired from the race when he drove into his garage. All drivers elected to make pit stops for fuel under caution. Riggs maintained his lead at the lap-39 restart, followed by Kahne and Bowyer. Johnson got ahead of Sadler to move into eighth on lap 44. On lap 46, a fourth caution was given; after leaving turn two, <a href="Todd%20Kluever">Todd Kluever</a> was hit by teammate <a href="Greg%20Biffle">Greg Biffle</a> and spun on the backstretch, causing <a href="Ken%20Schrader">Ken Schrader</a> and Petty to collide with Kluever. <a href="Michael%20Waltrip">Michael Waltrip</a> hit the wall in avoidance. Most drivers (including Riggs) chose to make pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt led at the lap-53 restart with the non-stopping cars of Edwards, Newman, Biffle and Sorenson following him. Riggs moved back into third place on lap 59 after passing Biffle and Newman. By lap 66, Earnhardt held a 1.78-second advantage over Edwards. Two laps later, Riggs passed Edwards to take over second place. Riggs closed the gap to Earnhardt, and was 1.5 seconds behind by lap 75. <a href="Racing%20flags%23Green%20flag">Green-flag</a> pit stops began three laps later, with Earnhardt stopping on lap 79, giving the lead back to Riggs. Kahne and Riggs made pit stops on the 85th lap for scuffed right-hand tires.

After the pit stops, which concluded on lap 91, Riggs reclaimed the first position. Kahne closed the gap to teammate Riggs, who was holding a lead of four-tenths of a second, by lap 95. One lap later, Kahne passed Riggs (who complained his car had too much <a href="Understeer%20and%20oversteer">understeer</a>) for first place. Earnhardt moved into second when he passed Riggs on the 100th lap. Lap 105 saw the fifth caution; Waltrip lost control of his car and hit the turn four outside wall, causing him to spin while attempting to make a pit stop for fuel. During the caution, all drivers again made pit stops. Kahne maintained the lead at the lap-110 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Bowyer. Gordon passed Bowyer to claim third position one lap later. Bowyer lost two further positions when Burton and Johnson overtook him on the 115th lap. A sixth caution was prompted on the following lap when Kurt Busch spun leaving turn two and hit the inside wall on the backstretch; while attempting to avoid Busch, Sorenson lost control in turn two, and went towards the inside backstretch wall. Most of the leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops for fuel. Harvick and Kahne avoided a collision on pit road. Sadler led the field at the lap-121 restart, followed by Raines and Robby Gordon. Raines passed Sadler to reclaim the lead two laps later, while Sadler drove back to pit road with engine problems on lap 125.

Kahne moved up into second place by lap 132 after passing Jeff Gordon, Earnhardt, and Robby Gordon. Johnson got ahead of Robby Gordon for fourth place one lap later. Kahne moved back into the lead after passing Raines on the backstretch on lap 138, while Johnson moved into second on the following lap. The second round of green-flag pit stops commenced on lap 143, when Robby Gordon made a pit stop for right-side tires and car adjustments. Kahne and Riggs stopped on lap 154. Jeff Gordon and Johnson made similar stops over the next three laps. Following the pit stops, Kahne reclaimed the lead after battling with Raines. A seventh caution was given three laps later when Gilliland spun in turn two and contacted the inside wall heavily. He drove to his garage to retire. Most of the leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops. <a href="Sterling%20Marlin">Sterling Marlin</a> stayed out and led at the lap-168 restart, ahead of Johnson. That same lap, Marlin lost the lead when Johnson passed him on the backstretch, and Kahne moved ahead of Marlin for second on lap 169. Martin got ahead of Earnhardt for fifth position ten laps later. By lap 180, Johnson held a 1.4-second lead over Kahne. Gordon passed Martin for third on lap 182, while Edwards overtook Kyle Busch for seventh two laps later. Upfront, Kahne closed the gap to be six-tenths of a second behind Johnson by the 188th lap.

The third round of green-flag pit stops began on lap 199; Johnson stopped on lap 203, while Earnhardt made a pit stop on the following lap. After the pit stops, Kahne retook the lead. Johnson drove to the track's inside at turn three and passed Kahne for the lead on lap 211 and started to pull away from the rest of the field. Bowyer drove to his garage on lap 216 for a transmission change because he had lost the use of third gear. Jeff Gordon had closed the gap to Kahne by lap 229. Green-flag pit stops again started six laps later when Kahne made a pit stop from second place. Johnson took on four tires at his stop on lap 239, handing the lead to Jeff Gordon, who ceded it to Earnhardt two laps later. Martin's pit crew dropped a <a href="lug%20nut">lug nut</a> which resulted him remaining stationary for 21.7 seconds. Burton <a href="Stall%20%28engine%29">stalled</a> his car which required his crew to push him to the end of pit road. An eighth caution was triggered on lap 242 when Yeley attempted to drive down pit road, and Martin was approaching him. Martin tried to avoid Yeley by steering left onto the turn four <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23A">apron</a> but made contact with him. Martin then spun and went hard into the tri-oval wall; his car went airborne. Robby Gordon could not avoid the melee and hit Yeley. Gordon consequently spun into the front stretch grass but continued.

Earnhardt made a pit stop on lap 244, followed by Kahne on the following lap. Edwards gained the lead and maintained it at the lap-252 restart, followed by Earnhardt and Kahne. Five laps later, Kahne passed Edwards to reclaim the lead as they came across slower cars and began to pull away. Debris was located on the track on lap 276, necessitating the race's ninth caution. The leaders elected to make pit stops during the caution. Kahne maintained his lead at the lap-281 restart and pulled away from Earnhardt. Jeff Gordon passed Nemechek to move into fourth place on the following lap. Jeff Gordon's engine failed after he crossed the start-finish line on lap 302, triggering the race's final caution. The leaders, including Kahne, made pit stops for fuel under caution. Johnson led the field at the lap-307 restart, ahead of Kahne, Earnhardt and Burton. Kahne turned right to the track's outside and passed Johnson around the <a href="Racing%20line">inside</a> in turn one for the lead on the 309th lap. Burton (who felt a vibration from his car) passed Earnhardt to take over third position seven laps later. Kahne increased his advantage over Johnson in the remaining seventeen laps to win the race and became the eighth driver to win both points races at Lowe's Motor Speedway in a calendar year. Johnson finished second, ahead of Burton in third, Earnhardt was fourth and <a href="Bobby%20Labonte">Bobby Labonte</a> fifth. Kyle Busch, Raines, Edwards, Nemechek, and Vickers rounded out the top ten. The race had a total of ten cautions and thirty-four lead changes by thirteen different drivers. Kahne led eight times for a total of 134 laps, more than any other competitor. The win was the seventh of Kahne's Cup Series career and the last of a series-high six victories he posted in 2006.

Kahne appeared in <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23V">victory lane</a> in front of the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season, which earned him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear: "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: "I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points." Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, we do not have a wheel loose, we know we got them tight."

Shortly after leaving his car, Martin stated his belief that it was not possible for him to clinch the championship: "They tell me a lot of people are having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away." He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I put myself back there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was "extra special" to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of "Frontstretch" opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history."

Johnson and Burton stated it was difficult to achieve a rhythm because of the small fuel cells mandated for the race and the hard-compound tires. Temperatures had been warmer than the previous day's <a href="2006%20NASCAR%20Busch%20Series">Busch Series</a> race and this gave the drivers more <a href="Grip%20%28auto%20racing%29">grip</a> although sliding was observed during both events. McMurray noted it was difficult to drive alongside other cars and that other competitors drove cautiously. <a href="Kenny%20Francis">Kenny Francis</a>, Kahne's crew chief, stated that he preferred to see longer runs but was aware that safety had to be taken into consideration. Four days after the race, Penske Racing South was given penalties for Kurt Busch's car. The penalties, for "actions detrimental to stock car racing"; "car, car parts, components and/or equipment that do not conform to NASCAR rules"; and a right rear shock absorber that did not compress, included a $25,000 fine and a two race suspension for crew chief <a href="Roy%20McCauley">Roy McCauley</a> who was placed on probation until December 31, 2006. Crew chief Matt Gimbel took over McCauley's role at the next race weekend. Team owner <a href="Roger%20Penske">Roger Penske</a> and Kurt Busch were penalized 50 points in the Owners' and Drivers' Championships. The following day, Penske Racing South announced it would not appeal the penalties.

The result kept Burton in the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 5,763 points, ahead of Kenseth, who had 5,718. Harvick moved into third with 5,674, thirteen points ahead of Martin who fell to fourth. Earnhardt moved in front of Hamlin for fifth, and Johnson, Kahne and Kyle Busch filled positions seven to nine. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who fell to tenth) said he would try to win races to return to contention for the championship. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Chevrolet maintained the lead with 237 points. Dodge remained in second with 179, six points ahead of Ford. The race took three hours, forty-seven minutes and twenty-nine seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.624 seconds.

Revival (comics)

Revival is a <a href="horror%20fiction">horror</a>-<a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> comics series created by writer <a href="Tim%20Seeley">Tim Seeley</a> and artist <a href="Mike%20Norton">Mike Norton</a>. The pair worked with colorist Mark Englert and cover artist <a href="Jenny%20Frison">Jenny Frison</a> to produce the series, which was published by <a href="Image%20Comics">Image Comics</a> as 47 monthly issues released between July 2012 and February 2017. It has since been reprinted in both paperback and hardcover editions that contain multiple issues. 

Set in central <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, "Revival" follows the aftermath of the dead coming back to life. The story is centered on detective Dana Cypress and her revived sister Em as it touches on religious, moral and social themes. As they investigate, they find Em's murder to be closely linked to the revival. Although the creators always knew how the central mystery would conclude, the exact length of the series was determined by sales. 

The series has received mostly positive reviews and sold through multiple printings. "Revival" was nominated for three <a href="Harvey%20Award">Harvey Award</a>s in 2013, and Frison was nominated in the Best Cover Artist category in 2013 and 2015 in part because of her work on the series. Critics praised the series for being distinct from other zombie comics, but later faulted the story's pace and sprawling cast. By the end of the series, sales of individual monthly issues had fallen nearly 78% from the first-issue peak.

In late 2012, Seeley and Norton were approached by major networks to develop "Revival" into a television series. While similar projects were produced at that time, none were based on "Revival". A film adaptation was announced in early 2017, to be co-written by Seeley and produced by <a href="Shatterglass%20Films">Shatterglass Films</a>. <a href="Diamond%20Select%20Toys">Diamond Select Toys</a> has released a <a href="minimate">minimate</a> toy of Em Cypress.

In what becomes known as Revival Day, everyone who died within a few miles of <a href="Wausau%2C%20Wisconsin">Wausau, Wisconsin</a>, on January 1 returns to life on January 2. The <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control</a> (CDC) quarantines the area to study the phenomenon and search for a cause. A partnership between the local sheriff’s office and the CDC creates a task force to process any crime that involves one of the twenty-three known "revivers". It is led by detective Dana Cypress and CDC doctor Ibrahim Ramin. Dana learns her college-aged sister, Em, is also a reviver. Em was murdered, but cannot remember the events leading to her death. Dana agrees to keep Em's status a secret while they investigate her death. Meanwhile, various townspeople begin to see glowing ghost-like figures in the surrounding woods (referred to as "creeps" in writer <a href="Tim%20Seeley">Tim Seeley</a>’s scripts).
The revivers are immortal and heal from all wounds. Some of them begin to take physical and non-physical risks because they do not fear physical or emotional harm to themselves or others. When they experience strong negative emotions, they cry blood and become violent. As a result, Dana and Ramin investigate several murders in the weeks following Revival Day. Meanwhile, some people outside the quarantine area believe the government is covering up a religious miracle. Others believe they can absorb the revivers' immortality by ingesting their flesh, leading to an active smuggling business that moves body parts of revivers and other recently dead individuals.

Some CDC researchers discover high levels of <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> in creeks surrounding Wausau. As a precaution, they confiscate and slaughter all the local livestock. Edmund Holt, a local man paranoid about government overreach, organizes a group to resist what he believes are unlawful actions. At the same time, he oversees an underground tunnel that smuggles sick Christians who believe being baptized in the water will heal their ailments. Meanwhile, Em discovers she is pregnant.

Secretly, the CDC uses a former dairy farm to detain revivers who have been reported as dangerous. When its existence is discovered, it causes a rift between the CDC and sheriff's office generally, and between Dana and Ramin specifically. The Wausau mayor organizes a meeting to reconcile the issues and invites some revivers to participate. Holt uses a suicidal reviver to smuggle a bomb into the meeting. It kills the mayor and several other people. General Louise Cale is installed as a temporary governor and uses her power to move all known revivers to the dairy farm facility. She and the military experiment on the revivers and captured creeps. They learn the ghost figures are the disembodied souls of the revivers, and that reuniting them causes permanent death.

During the response to the bombing, Em's reviver status is discovered and she is confined to the dairy farm. Following a lead, Dana learns that Em's murderer has bribed a guard at the facility to abduct Em to prevent a formal investigation into her death. Dana arrives in time to save Em and escape. Because they are unable to leave the quarantine, they go into hiding.

As tensions mount between the military and the people of Wausau, a riot is started at a picket line. The revivers and the creeps escape the dairy farm and attack the military. Creeps are able to possess bodies, prompting a shoot-on-sight response from panicked soldiers.

Dana discovers Em was killed by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a physical trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.

Two years later, life in Wausau has returned to normal. Dana is now sheriff and is in a relationship with Ramin. They are raising Dana's niece.

Seeley and artist <a href="Mike%20Norton">Mike Norton</a> first met in 2001, when they were both hired by <a href="Devil%27s%20Due%20Publishing">Devil's Due Publishing</a> to work on a "<a href="G.I.%20Joe%20%28comics%29%23Devil%27s%20Due%20Publishing">G.I. Joe</a>" comic book. The two became friends and collaborated on other works, including some released through the Double Feature app in 2011. They subsequently shared work space at <a href="Four%20Star%20Studios">Four Star Studios</a> in <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>.

Following the success of Seeley's series "<a href="Hack/Slash">Hack/Slash</a>" through <a href="Image%20Comics">Image Comics</a>, publisher <a href="Eric%20Stephenson%20%28comics%29">Eric Stephenson</a> suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley knew he wanted to work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested in setting a story in a small town so he could write about the kind of crimes that happen in a place where people prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt "<a href="The%20Walking%20Dead%20%28comic%20book%29">The Walking Dead</a>" had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for "Revival". They pitched the series as "<a href="Fargo%20%28film%29">Fargo</a>" meets "The Walking Dead", using the terms "Rural Noir" and "Farm Noir" to describe the <a href="hardboiled">hardboiled</a> detective story set in a small town.

The series was formally announced March 31, 2012, at <a href="Emerald%20City%20Comicon">Emerald City Comicon</a>. In the week leading up to the series announcement, Image teased the release in the form of fake newspaper articles and ads.

Seeley and Norton both had heavy workloads when they began "Revival", and the complexity of the story meant they needed to cut back on other projects. Because Seeley was excited to write about "real people" instead of typical heroes or archetypes, "Revival" is set in Seeley's boyhood home of Wausau, Wisconsin. Several of the unusual crimes in the first arc are based on actual events from the town, including the killing of the <a href="Zebroid">zebra-horse</a> in the first issue. This setting meant religion would need to play a significant role in the plot because Wausau is a "very religious ... predominantly Christian" place. Seeley deliberately references Biblical events throughout the comic, but tries to do so with subtlety because it's "easy to do it way overdone".

Both Seeley and Norton are writers as well as artists, so each contributed to character designs and plot ideas. When promoting the series prior to release, Norton described "Revival" as the closest collaboration he had ever worked on. One character in particular, Em Cypress, had been a work in progress for nearly 20 years. She began as a sketch Seeley did in 1996 and was heavily influenced by "<a href="The%20Crow">The Crow</a>". He continued to tweak the character over the years, and a version of her was pitched to <a href="Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a> for an Original English Language manga in 2005. He also considered using her in "Hack/Slash", but the initial concept underwent significant changes and eventually became the character Acid Angel.

The conclusion of the series was determined from the outset, but the path to the finale was adaptable and there were enough ideas to keep the comic going for as long as sales would support it. Only a few of the characters had predetermined storylines, and the supporting cast provided further subplots along the way. When issue 17 was published, the plot was "loosely" planned through 55 or 60 issues. By late 2015, they had decided to end "Revival" at issue 48.

Although most modern comics are told in three to six issue "arcs" that form a nearly complete story, Seeley feels that when several plot points climax at once, it provides readers an easy opportunity to quit reading without feeling dissatisfied about missing the true conclusion. For "Revival", he and Norton decided to have new mysteries develop constantly. They had several discussions on the right point to begin the story. Early drafts of the first issue included scenes showing the worldwide response to Revival Day, but they were cut to focus on the people of Wausau. The creators decided to start the story after Revival Day partly because they wanted readers to relate to the cast's confusion, and partly as an homage to old superhero comics that told origin stories as quickly as possible to get to the action. They were inspired by <a href="Don%20DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>'s novel "<a href="White%20Noise%20%28novel%29">White Noise</a>", which follows people trying to escape an approaching cloud but no one knows what it actually is.

During the series, Norton and Seeley worked with <a href="colorist">colorist</a> Mark Englert, letterer Christopher Crank (credited as "Crank!"), and <a href="cover%20artist">cover artist</a> and fellow studio partner <a href="Jenny%20Frison">Jenny Frison</a>. Although the team planned for Frison to create the covers from the beginning, Norton provided the design for the cover of the first issue. At Seeley's suggestion, Norton drew the covers for the collected paperback editions. When the script for issue twelve called for a young character to draw his own comic within the story, five of the pages featured art by <a href="Art%20Baltazar">Art Baltazar</a> and the cover was drawn by <a href="Skottie%20Young">Skottie Young</a>. Both artists are known for their cartoon-like style.

A <a href="One-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> <a href="Crossover%20%28fiction%29">crossover</a> between "Revival" and "<a href="Chew%20%28comics%29">Chew</a>" was announced on February 12, 2014, and released on May 28, 2014. The idea was proposed by "Chew" writer <a href="John%20Layman">John Layman</a>, but was initially opposed by all the other creators. Layman continued to push the concept, and eventually wrote the story anyway. He emailed it to Seeley, Norton, and "Chew" artist <a href="Rob%20Guillory">Rob Guillory</a>, and after reading it they all agreed to participate. It was constructed as a double-sided book with two stories, one by each creative team.

Previews of the first issue were included in "The Walking Dead" #99 and alongside five other upcoming comics in Image's 2012 <a href="Free%20Comic%20Book%20Day">Free Comic Book Day</a> sampler before the first issue was released on July 11, 2012. It had an initial print run of about 18,000 copies and was available with two covers: the standard version by Frison and a 1-in-10 <a href="variant%20cover">alternate cover</a> by <a href="Craig%20Thompson">Craig Thompson</a>. As an added incentive to retailers who normally order on a <a href="direct%20market">non-returnable basis</a>, unsold copies of qualifying orders could be returned to Image in exchange for a credit to their account. It quickly sold out at the distributor level and went through at least four printings by December 2012, including one as part of the "Image Firsts" line of $1 reprints in November. By the end of the year, the first issue had sold an estimated 29,100 copies.
Subsequent issues also performed well, requiring additional printings to satisfy demand. The series took a planned one-month hiatus after the fifth issue, which also needed a reprint, to release the first <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">paperback collection</a>. During the break, Image offered an extra 10% discount to retailers who increased their orders by 125% in an effort to bring orders in line with demand and eliminate the costs associated with additional printings. In January 2013, the Phantom group, retailers who commission exclusive covers to provide further attention to series they believe deserve more support, selected "Revival" to be part of the project. Under the Phantom label, the first ten issues were reprinted with new interlocking cover art by Frison. They were only available at stores operated by the retail group. When asked about the book's success in a January 2014 interview, Seeley said "We live and die by word-of-mouth, and so far, the readers and the comic press have been great about spreading the word about our very unusual and unique comic book."

Sales fell to just under 14,000 by issue 12, and continued to fall during the series' second year until the 24th issue sold just more than 9,000 copies. In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According to Dave Carter, a writer for <a href="Comics%20Beat">Comics Beat</a>, this sales pattern was typical for comics at the time. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300. Because of the decline in "Revival"s sales, Seeley expressed skepticism about doing another project of similar length in the future.

During publication, some "Revival" merchandise was offered by third-parties. On October 25, 2014, Screen Panel released four <a href="Printmaking">art prints</a> based on the series created by Angela An, Randy Ortiz, and Frison. In 2016, an Em Cypress <a href="minimate">minimate</a> figure was included in the first wave of the Comic Book Heroes series from <a href="Diamond%20Select%20Toys">Diamond Select Toys</a>. The figure was available in a two pack with <a href="Cassie%20Hack">Cassie Hack</a>, another Tim Seeley creation.

The series was collected into eight paperback volumes and four larger-sized hardcover editions. Seeley described the sales of the collections as "steady", with new monthly orders for the first paperback near 500 as late as 2015. Print translations of "Revival" were available in French and Polish, and a digital edition was released in German by <a href="Cross%20Cult">Cross Cult</a> in 2016.

On release, "Revival" was part of a resurgence in genre comics and was highlighted for standing out among the large number of zombie comics being published at the time. <a href="Rich%20Johnston">Rich Johnston</a> went further, saying it distinguished itself from traditional horror stories in general with "compelling psychological themes, undercurrents of religious fervour, and a slick medical detective veneer". Writing for <a href="Newsarama">Newsarama</a>, Ernie Estrella said Norton's artwork set "Revival" apart because it did not rely on distressed visuals and shadows to set the atmosphere. In a review of <a href="2012%20in%20comics">2012 in comics</a> for "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", Brian Truitt called "Revival" the year's best horror comic.

In early reviews, both the art and writing were praised. The series' specific focus on non-white people, such as the <a href="Hmong%20people">Hmong</a> and <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> who live in the area, was appreciated by reviewer Ginnis Tonic. "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" columnist Dan Kois described the series as "grounded in the economic and familial realities of small-town life". Truitt found the mood and themes to be a mix of <a href="Elmore%20Leonard">Elmore Leonard</a> and the <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a>, while Kois described Norton's art as "wonderfully specific and evocative of the rural Midwest". Englert's contributions were singled out by <a href="Comic%20Book%20Resources">Comic Book Resources</a>' Doug Zawisza, who thought the colors added an "edginess" to the story. Zawiza also liked the way Norton used a variety of body shapes and sizes for the cast. Norton included subtle background details, such as music posters and the cleanliness of bedrooms, which was noted by reviewers. Tonic found they added to her understanding of the characters, and James Fulton said touches like these excited him "like few have in comics in the last few years."

As the series progressed, some critics began to express frustration with the comic. Joey Smith, also with "Inside Pulse", found the large cast was difficult to track by the fourth issue. In a review of issue 33, Fulton found the series entertaining, but sometimes thought the plot felt directionless. Not all agreed; "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" included the comic book in its list of favorite horror comics in late 2016.

The conclusion of the series received mostly positive reviews. Kat Calamia found the series had a "bittersweet ending that brings ... great closure to character arcs" and called it "a satisfying conclusion for longtime readers" in her review of the final issue for Newsarama. James Ferguson agreed in his review for "<a href="Horror%20Talk">Horror Talk</a>", emphasizing the creators' success at ending "every <a href="Narrative%20thread">plot thread</a> that has been hanging out there in a satisfying manner". William Kulesa, writing for <a href="NJ.com">NJ.com</a>, said that while he had enjoyed the series from the beginning, the conclusion made the whole story worth reading.

"Revival" was nominated for three <a href="Harvey%20Awards">Harvey Awards</a> in 2013: Best New Series, Best Writer, and Best Artist. Jenny Frison, who has been called the underappreciated star of the series, was nominated for Best Cover Artist in 2013 and 2015 in part because of her work on "Revival".

In October 2012, Seeley and Norton said major networks had approached them about developing a "Revival" television series, and later mentioned <a href="NBC">NBC</a> specifically. Around this same time, <a href="ABC%20Studios">ABC Studios</a> was involved in a bidding war for the rights to "The Returned", an unpublished novel by Jason Mott that dealt with similar themes. ABC announced they were moving forward with "The Returned" in January 2013, although it was later retitled "<a href="Resurrection%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Resurrection</a>". Although some fans suspected Seeley and Norton's idea had been stolen, Seeley said "these things just happen sometimes". He said the announcement was "unfortunate" because they had been working with talented people to adapt "Revival", but the television developments would have limited Seeley and Norton's creative input.

In September 2013, <a href="A%26amp%3BE%20%28TV%20network%29">A&E</a> bought the rights for an American remake of the French television series "<a href="Les%20Revenants%20%28TV%20series%29">Les Revenants</a>" ("The Returned"), which is also about dead people coming back to life as they were before. "Les Revenants", in turn, was inspired by a 2004 film of the same name directed by <a href="Robin%20Campillo">Robin Campillo</a> and translated into English as "<a href="They%20Came%20Back">They Came Back</a>". When Seeley started working on "Revival", a friend recommended he watch "They Came Back" to avoid similarities. Since "The Returned" is inspired by the film, he and Norton watched it and became fans of the show.

At the April 2017 <a href="Chicago%20Comic%20%26amp%3B%20Entertainment%20Expo">Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo</a>, a film adaptation was announced. It will be co-written by Seeley and Sarah Fischer, directed by Luke Boyce and produced by <a href="Shatterglass%20Films">Shatterglass Films</a>, an independent film company based in Champaign, Illinois. Larger production firms also expressed interest, but Seeley would have had less input into the film if it were made by them. Boyce said he had enjoyed "Revival" since its debut, and had been thinking about adapting it long before he met the creators. A two-minute <a href="proof%20of%20concept">proof of concept</a> <a href="Teaser%20campaign">teaser</a> was shown at the expo.

Waiting (2015 film)

Waiting is a 2015 Indian <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> directed by Anu Menon. Produced by Priti Gupta and Manish Mundra under the banner of Ishka Films and <a href="Drishyam%20Films">Drishyam Films</a> respectively, the film was co-written by Menon and James Ruzicka, and stars <a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a> and <a href="Kalki%20Koechlin">Kalki Koechlin</a> in lead roles. "Waiting" focuses on the relationship between two people from different walks of life who befriend each other in a hospital, while nursing their respective <a href="coma">coma</a>tose spouses. <a href="Rajat%20Kapoor">Rajat Kapoor</a>, <a href="Suhasini%20Maniratnam">Suhasini Maniratnam</a>, <a href="Arjun%20Mathur">Arjun Mathur</a>, Ratnabali Bhattacharjee and Rajeev Ravindranathan play supporting roles in the film.

The development of the film began in June 2014, when Menon signed Koechlin and Shah for an untitled project. Principal photography started in November 2014 in the South Indian coastal city of <a href="Kochi">Kochi</a>; Neha Parti served as the <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> for the film. New Zealand-based singer-songwriter <a href="Mikey%20McCleary">Mikey McCleary</a> composed the film's score. Nitin Baid and Apurva Asrani <a href="film%20editing">edited</a> the film, and Atika Chohan wrote the dialogue. "Waiting" also marked the <a href="Bollywood">Hindi film</a> debut of the prominent South Indian actress-director Suhasini Maniratnam. Koechlin also made her debut as a <a href="lyricist">lyricist</a> with the film's soundtrack, writing the song "Waiting on You".

"Waiting" had its world premiere at the <a href="Dubai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Dubai International Film Festival</a> on 11 December 2015 to positive reviews from critics. It was also screened at the closing gala of the <a href="London%20Asian%20Film%20Festival">London Asian Film Festival</a>, where Menon won the Best Director Award. The film was released theatrically in India on 27 May 2016. Upon release in India, "Waiting" was well received by critics, with particular praise for the performances of Koechlin and Shah, and Menon's direction. The film had a below average run at the box office, collecting a total of during its theatrical run.

Shiv Natraj (<a href="Naseeruddin%20Shah">Naseeruddin Shah</a>), an elderly psychology professor, arrives at a hospital in <a href="Kochi">Kochi</a> to visit his comatose wife Pankaja (<a href="Suhasini%20Maniratnam">Suhasini Maniratnam</a>). Tara Kapoor Desphande (<a href="Kalki%20Koechlin">Kalki Koechlin</a>), a young advertising agent, also arrives at the hospital during the night after being delivered news of a car accident involving her husband, Rajat Deshpande (<a href="Arjun%20Mathur">Arjun Mathur</a>). She is consoled by Rajat's eccentric co-worker Girish (Rajeev Ravindranathan), but dismisses him abruptly. Tara is deeply disturbed to see Rajat breathing on a ventilator, and leaves immediately.

In the waiting lounge, Tara approaches Shiv, believing him to be a doctor, and asks for his advice. He reveals that his wife had a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> eight months ago while he was out watching a cricket match, and has been in a coma ever since. The two bond over their similar situations. Later, Girish drops Tara off at a hotel and gives her Rajat's bag. Tara finds his watch in it and puts it on. The next day she is angered after reading an intimate message on Rajat's phone from a colleague Sheetal, who is later revealed to be a man. Shiv witnesses the whole misunderstanding, and the two share a light moment. He later visits her at the hotel, and she shares her disappointment with her friends and followers on social media for having abandoned her. She commends Shiv for his composure, as he explains the <a href="K%C3%BCbler-Ross%20model">five stages of grief</a> to her.

Tara finds her strength in Shiv, a wiser and more experienced counterpart. The two start spending most of their spare time together coping with their grief, despite being completely opposite in nature. Shiv takes Tara to the temple, and she takes him shopping. Rajat's doctor, Nirupam Malhotra (<a href="Rajat%20Kapoor">Rajat Kapoor</a>), tells Tara that Rajat has a <a href="hematoma">hematoma</a> in his brain and an operation might help him recover, but it carries the risk of partial paralysis. Tara is torn, as she believes Rajat would not want to take the risk, and seeks advice from Shiv. He is already at loggerheads with Dr. Malhotra, dismissing him as a pawn of the hospital board and the insurance companies who only care about making money and not the patients. Tara and Shiv get into a heated argument. Shiv lashes out angrily at Tara for not giving Rajat a chance at life. Tara retorts that she is a realist, and dismisses Shiv for being selfish and making his wife go through pain for his own sake.

Tara's best friend Ishita (Ratnabali Bhattacharjee) arrives at Kochi and advises her to start chanting prayers and to inform Rajat's estranged parents of his situation. Despite being an <a href="atheism">atheist</a>, Tara chants <a href="Namu%20My%C5%8Dh%C5%8D%20Renge%20Ky%C5%8D">Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō</a> when she is alone with Rajat. Shiv desperately attempts to convince Malhotra to perform a <a href="spinal%20decompression">spinal decompression</a> on his wife, but he disregards Shiv's research and refuses to proceed with surgery. Tara discusses Rajat's surgery with Ishita and decides not to go ahead with it, which further angers Malhotra. Ishita leaves to aid her ailing son. Tara realises that she is no longer Ishita's top priority, now that Ishita is married. Shiv and Tara make up and later that night dance together at Shiv's house, much to the amusement of his neighbours. They get upset thinking about their spouses and discuss what they meant to them, before falling asleep in the living room.

The next morning, Tara leaves early and decides to inform Rajat's mother. After Girish brings Tara the required insurance papers, she thanks him for always being there for her and apologises for being rude. She decides to go ahead with the surgery after all. Rajat is taken to surgery, and she holds his hand until they arrive at the operating room. Shiv, on the other hand, decides to take Pankaja off the ventilator and let his wife herself make the final call. Pankaja tries to breathe on her own as the viewers are treated with flashbacks of the heyday of both couples. Tara takes a seat in the waiting lounge, and is joined by Shiv as the camera pans out.


Made on a modest budget, "Waiting" was produced by Priti Gupta of Ishka Films and Manish Mundra of <a href="Drishyam%20Films">Drishyam Films</a>. The film was directed by Anu Menon, her second directorial work after the romantic comedy "<a href="London%2C%20Paris%2C%20New%20York">London, Paris, New York</a>" (2012). She also co-wrote the script with fellow <a href="London%20Film%20School">London Film School</a> alumnus and former <a href="anesthesiologist">anesthesiologist</a> James Ruzicka. Menon, inspired by her own personal experience, started working on the film's script with Ruzicka. She called the writing process extremely difficult as they had to figure out "what it means to be associated with a comatose patient, both emotionally and medically". She said later that Ruzicka's experience as a medical practitioner proved really helpful in developing a logical understanding of the situation. Menon revealed that she had begun writing the story years before the actual production for the film began, and that it took her several years to complete it.

Pre-production work began in July 2014, when Mundra, a <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>-based film producer, agreed to produce. Menon wanted an entirely different setting for the film, away from "fast paced city life", and decided to set the story in the South Indian state of <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>. The film's director of photography was cinematographer Neha Parti Martyani, who had been previously associated with films including "<a href="My%20Name%20Is%20Khan">My Name Is Khan</a>" (2010) and "<a href="Yamla%20Pagla%20Deewana">Yamla Pagla Deewana</a>" (2011). The film's dialogue was written by Atika Chohan. Prajakta Ghate was the film's <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a>.

Entertainment website <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> reported that Kalki Koechlin was set to star in Menon's upcoming film. The published reports revealed that Koechlin would be playing the role of the young, brash, and social-media-savvy Tara Deshpande. Koechlin's co-star from "<a href="That%20Girl%20in%20Yellow%20Boots">That Girl in Yellow Boots</a>" (2011) and "<a href="Zindagi%20Na%20Milegi%20Dobara">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</a>" (2011), Naseeruddin Shah, joined the cast after he was approached by Menon, who sent him the film's script in an e-mail. Shah, who did not have any prior knowledge of Menon's work, accepted the male lead role in the film. To prepare for the role, Koechlin worked on the dialect in which her character spoke, an <a href="Hinglish">amalgamation of Hindi and English</a>. She also dyed her hair black for the role, as Menon wanted her to look more "earthy". In an interview with "<a href="Gulf%20News">Gulf News</a>", Koechlin said she loved the film's vibe and compared it to the American drama "<a href="Lost%20in%20Translation%20%28film%29">Lost In Translation</a>" (2003). In a separate e-mail interview with Arti Daniel of "<a href="Khaleej%20Times">The Khaleej Times</a>", Shah said that "Waiting" was his way of making up to the audience for the spate of "ghastly movies" that he did in 2014.

<a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian</a> actress and director Suhasini Maniratnam made her debut in Hindi cinema with "Waiting"; she was cast in the role of Pankaja, Shah's character's wife. Menon talked about her experience working with Suhasini saying, "With her experience, she also helped me with a few difficult scenes behind the camera." Arjun Mathur played the role of Rajat Deshpande, Tara's husband, who is involved in a car accident; Rajat Kapoor played Nirupam Malhotra, a doctor at the Kochi Hospital. Ratnabali Bhatachajee, Rajeev Ravindranathan and Marin Babu played supporting roles in the film. The rest of the film's supporting cast consisted mainly of <a href="Malayali">Malayali</a> actors, including Dinesh Nair and Krishna Sankar, who were signed up with assistance from Gautam Pisharody, a local casting agent.

Principal photography began in November 2014 in the coastal city of <a href="Kochi">Kochi</a>, Kerala. The shoot for the entire film was completed on schedule in around 30 days. Of the shooting experience, Menon said, "The experience was beautiful though there were many challenges as we were predominantly an all-woman crew." In an interview with "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", Koechlin revealed that throughout the production process, she questioned Menon several times as she wanted to better understand her character's background. She said that she would have lengthy discussions regarding particular scenes with Menon, who would then redraft the part. She also enjoyed working with Shah, describing the experience as "gratifying".

The team of editors for "Waiting" was headed by Apurva Asrani and Nitin Baid. The <a href="audio%20mixing">sound mixing</a> was done by London-based sound engineer Roland Heap, with assistance from Mandar Kamalapurkar and Udit Daseja. Shiji Pattna was the film's <a href="art%20director">art director</a>, and the marketing department was headed by Parull Gosain. The editing process for the film took place in March 2015. The film's <a href="final%20cut%20%28film%20editing%29">final cut</a> ran for a total of 98 minutes.

Menon talked to "<a href="The%20National%20%28Abu%20Dhabi%29">The National</a>" about the film prior to its release, saying that the story was close to her heart as it was inspired by her own personal experience. On working with Koechlin and Shah she said, "He (Shah) was punctual and always prepared, he gave his best performance in the first take. Kalki allows herself to be vulnerable. She is more porous and chilled out." Menon acknowledged the chemistry of the leading duo and said that they were committed to the project and non-demanding. She described "Waiting" as a "gentle and poignant film" and said, "It would make the audiences want to reach out to the leading characters and help them find their answers."

The film's music was composed by <a href="Mikey%20McCleary">Mikey McCleary</a>, with <a href="Kavita%20Seth">Kavita Seth</a>, Nikhil D'Souza, <a href="Anushka%20Manchanda">Anushka Manchanda</a>, <a href="Vishal%20Dadlani">Vishal Dadlani</a> and McCleary serving as vocalists for the album. The tracks' lyrics were written by McCleary, Koechlin <a href="Manoj%20Muntashir">Manoj Muntashir</a>, and Ankur Tewari. The first song on the album, "Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon", a pop ballad by Manchanda and D'Souza, was released on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> on 4 May 2016. The album consisted of three other songs; McCleary's "Got My Eyes For You", Manchanda's "Waiting For You", and Seth and Daldani's "Zara Zara". The complete soundtrack for "Waiting" was released on 16 May 2016, under the <a href="Zee%20Entertainment%20Enterprises">Zee Music Company</a> label.

The film's soundtrack was well received by critics. The tracks "Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon" and "Zara Zara" garnered positive response from critics and audiences alike; Manavi Kapoor of "<a href="Business%20Standard">Business Standard</a>" remarked, "Zara Zara' and 'Tu Hai Toh Main Hun' are haunting and perfectly capture the poignant tone of the film." Ushnota Paul writing for "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" was also laudatory of both the songs, as each "lingers with you for long". In another soundtrack review for "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>", Mohar Basu praised McCleary's "trademark effervescence", which made the soundtrack of "Waiting" "oh-so-charming." She summed up by writing that the album had, "a few pleasant songs and even though they all sound fairly similar, it has a satisfying effect". Manish Gaekwad of <a href="Scroll.in">Scroll.in</a> gave a mixed review; he was analogous in the praise of the "pleasent" nature of the tracks, but was critical of the lyrics that didn't go beyond the "greeting-card sentiment".

"Waiting" had its world premiere on 11 December 2015 at the 12th edition of the <a href="Dubai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Dubai International Film Festival</a>. There the film's executive producer Priti Gupta, founder of Ishka Films, emphasised the universality of the film and said, "It is an endearing and beautiful movie for not just Indian[s], but the world audience, as it is essentially about the universal human circumstances, which are deftly portrayed in a tender yet humorous way."
Manish Mundra, founder of <a href="Drishyam%20Films">Drishyam Films</a>, expressed his delight at the screening of the film, acknowledging that Dubai was one of the biggest overseas markets for Indian films. The film was also screened at the closing gala of the <a href="London%20Asian%20Film%20Festival">London Asian Film Festival</a>, and at the <a href="Indian%20Film%20Festival%20of%20Los%20Angeles">Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles</a>.

The official trailer for "Waiting" was released on 22 April 2016 to positive response from both critics and audience alike. Rajani Chandel of "The Times of India" asserted that it "will move you to tears", while "The Huffington Post India" editor Ankur Pathak noted the leading duo's "effortlessly comfortable vibe", and dubbed the trailer "lovely". Menon talked about the challenges of promoting an <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a> and attracting viewers saying, "The distribution is first weekend collection driven [...] Those depending on a buzz created by word of mouth are at a disadvantage." The film had a special screening prior to its theatrical release which was attended by the cast and crew and other Bollywood celebrities including: <a href="Gulshan%20Devaiah">Gulshan Devaiah</a>, <a href="Radhika%20Apte">Radhika Apte</a>, <a href="Huma%20Qureshi%20%28actress%29">Huma Qureshi</a>, <a href="Rajkummar%20Rao">Rajkummar Rao</a> and <a href="Adil%20Hussain">Adil Hussain</a>. It had its theatrical release on 27 May 2016 in India.

The film had a poor opening at the box office as the morning vacancy varied from 2 to 3 per cent in multiplexes. The film managed to collect a mere on its opening day. It was released alongside other indie films including "<a href="Veerappan%20%28film%29">Veerappan</a>" and "<a href="Phobia%20%282016%20film%29">Phobia</a>", both of which also had a relatively poor opening. However, "Waiting" showed good growth over the day with the best occupancy among the aforementioned films. The numbers grew as the film collected and on its second and third day respectively, bringing the first weekend gross to a total of . It carried on with steady numbers through the first and the second week collecting . "Waiting" grossed a total of around in its entire run at the box office.

The film opened to largely positive reviews in India. Saibal Chatterjee of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a> gave the film the highest praise and deemed it "a well-chiselled marvel" saying: "Waiting is at once heart-wrenching and uplifting ... marked by deep philosophical undertones, but it is never unduly ponderous." A reviewer for "<a href="The%20New%20Indian%20Express">The New Indian Express</a>" also spoke highly of the film saying, "Not since Ritesh Batra's "<a href="The%20Lunchbox">The Lunchbox</a>" have I seen an indie film addressing itself to the ageless issue of human desolation and individual grief with such warmth, dignity, grace, honesty and humour." For <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", the script was "dignified [and] without any false notes", and the film managed "to stand on its own emotional ground ... The people, situations, relationships, feelings are layered, warm and humourous, ringing true in their complexities." Mohar Basu of "The Times of India" called the film "thought-provoking" writing: "Menon has whipped up a warm tale about love, loss and surviving life's catastrophic blows, with such simplicity."

Kunal Guha of the "<a href="Mumbai%20Mirror">Mumbai Mirror</a>" lauded the film's direction and cinematography saying, "Menon has the tenacity of a <a href="Sofia%20Coppola">Sofia Coppola</a> to produce frames where not much happens but one is unable to look away", and concluded, "The film deserves a watch for being one that doesn't try too hard and for its approach to an extreme situation." Rohit Bhatnagar of "<a href="Deccan%20Chronicle">Deccan Chronicle</a>", while also praising the technical expertise, said, "Neha Parti Matiyani beautifully captures the beautiful city of Kochi" and called the film "unmissable" saying, "'Waiting' is a refreshing subject that is engaging enough right up till its open ended climax." Shubhra Gupta writing for "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" thought that the film was "too explanatory, too talky", and that "the most effective moments in the film occur when the two leads are allowed to fall silent, to just be in that moment, to loosen up". While lauding the film's treatment of the subject matter, Gupta described "Waiting" as "a film about life, lasting love and impending loss which explores a zone Bollywood doesn't bother with".

The performances of the leading pair of Koechlin and Shah were chiefly praised by several critics. Guha in his review remarked "this film belongs to Kalki, who impresses by managing to wordlessly convey her character's state of mind in every scene". Chatterjee, offering a similar observation, wrote that Koechlin "provides the ideal foil, adding immensely to the emotional depth of the tale and heightening the conflict between two unlike poles". The latter thought that the lead performances empowered the film. In her review for <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> Sukanya Verma called the film "absolutely riveting", and wrote of Koechlin that "[t]here's something stunningly unhindered about Kalki and her aura. She uses this quality in the most mesmeric fashion to create a woman we sympathise with and wish well for."

In her review for "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>", <a href="Anna%20M.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BM.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> wrote that the leading pair "shine in a lovely film" noting that chemistry between them was "unmistakable". She concluded by saying, "[Waiting] is both sad and amusing, believable, well acted and very well told". Sweta Kaushal of "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" summed up her review by writing, "Packaged with Naseeruddin as the adorable old man ... and Kalki as the charming young, energetic woman, "Waiting" is a delight." While acknowledging the "underdeveloped and overwritten" parts of the plot, Gupta was nonetheless appreciative of Koechlin and Shah, calling them good fits for their roles. <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> writing for <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a> offered similar observations; he criticized the "weak" plotting, but talked well of the characters: "you yearn for them to just shut up and soak in the silence. Each time they do, the film soars." Also lauding Shah's "real" and Koechlin's "endearing" performances, he wrote that "Waiting", "raises important questions about life, love, and letting go. Plus there are those two splendid performances. That's plenty to merit a viewing."

The film received positive reviews from critics at the <a href="Dubai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Dubai International Film Festival</a> who praised the story's narrative, Menon's direction, and the performances of the lead pairing of Koechlin and Shah. Gautaman Bhaskaran of "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" called the film a "tragic, witty affair" and praised the humour of presenting the contrast between Shiv and Tara. Fionnuala Halligan of "<a href="Screen%20International">Screen International</a>" lauded the cinematography and Neha Parti Mtiyani's "dignified lenswork" and wrote further, "Waiting' simmers in its locales without being brash or boastful; the colours of India are there, glowing at the sidelines." She also lauded Koechlin's and Shah's performances saying that the film "benefits greatly from Koechlin's appeal ... she has an expressive face to match her talent" and added that Shah's presence "lends the film its grace-notes". Deborah Young of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" also gave it a positive review calling the film: "A tender, often humorous tale with sparkling performances." In her opinion, "Koechlin does an exceptional job navigating the shoals of this as a kooky drama queen" while "Shah brings great feeling and complexity to the role of the wise, tolerant Shiv."

Donald Trump (Last Week Tonight)

"Donald Trump" is a segment of the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> news satire television series "<a href="Last%20Week%20Tonight%20with%20John%20Oliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>" that is devoted to <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, who later became the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. It first aired on February 28, 2016, as part of the third episode of "Last Week Tonight" third season, when Trump was the frontrunner for the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> nomination for the presidency. During the 22-minute segment, comedian <a href="John%20Oliver">John Oliver</a> discusses <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">Trump's 2016 presidential campaign</a> and his career in business. Oliver outlines Trump's campaign rhetoric, varying political positions, and failed business ventures. The comedian also criticizes Trump for making bigoted and untrue statements, and says that the <a href="Trump%20%28surname%29">Trump family name</a> was changed at one point from the ancestral name "Drumpf."

The segment went <a href="viral%20video">viral</a> on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> and <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>. By <a href="Super%20Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a> on March 1, two days after broadcast, <a href="Google%20Search">Google searches</a> for "Donald Drumpf" had surpassed those for both <a href="Ted%20Cruz">Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="Marco%20Rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, who were then competing against Trump for the Republican Party nomination. In eight days, the segment accumulated 19 million views on YouTube, making it "Last Week Tonight" most popular segment there. By the end of March, it had received a combined 85 million views on YouTube and Facebook.

The segment popularized the term "Donald Drumpf," a name for Trump that Oliver uses toward the end of the segment. Oliver intended the term to uncouple the grandeur of the Trump name so the latter's supporters could acknowledge his political and entrepreneurial flaws. The comedian promoted a campaign urging viewers to "Make Donald Drumpf Again," a play on Trump's "<a href="Make%20America%20Great%20Again">Make America Great Again</a>" campaign slogan. Oliver coined a <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a> and registered a <a href="web%20domain">web domain</a> to promote the term; the website offered a <a href="Google%20Chrome%20extension">Google Chrome extension</a> to change instances of "Trump" to "Drumpf" and sold baseball caps with the slogan "Make Donald Drumpf Again."

The segment started a public debate on when the Trump family renamed themselves from "Drumpf.". Commentators debated whether the family changed their name in the 17th or 19th century but agreed that neither Donald Trump nor his father <a href="Fred%20Trump">Fred</a> ever carried the surname "Drumpf." Reviews of the segment itself were mixed: some praised the segment for being funny and informational, but others criticized Oliver for the possible <a href="Xenophobia">xenophobic</a> undertones attached to the "Drumpf" surname. Oliver stopped using the name "Drumpf" in subsequent segments, stating that the joke "went out of hand."

The 22-minute segment about <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> was delivered by <a href="John%20Oliver">John Oliver</a> on February 28, 2016, during the third episode of the third season of "<a href="Last%20Week%20Tonight%20with%20John%20Oliver">Last Week Tonight</a>", and the 62nd episode overall. At the start of the episode's main segment, Oliver introduces the topic of <a href="Donald%20Trump%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202016">Trump's presidential campaign</a>. He refers to it, and his <a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a> popularity among Republican voters and those who did not usually vote in presidential elections, as "America's back <a href="Nevus">mole</a>." Oliver says, "It may have seemed harmless a year ago, but now that it's become frighteningly bigger, it's no longer wise to ignore it."

After summarizing his "unpredictable and entertaining" style and acknowledging his appeal to voters disenchanted with the American political <a href="The%20Establishment">establishment</a>, Oliver criticizes Trump as a "serial liar." The comedian outlines that Trump had made dubious and unsubstantiated claims regarding his <a href="net%20worth">net worth</a>, then lists several of Trump's failed businesses and investments, including some of his real estate properties. Oliver mentions that Trump claimed to have declined to appear on "Last Week Tonight" but had never been invited; that Trump was not self-funding his 2016 presidential campaign, despite saying otherwise; and that in an interview in the 2003 documentary "<a href="Born%20Rich%20%28film%29">Born Rich</a>" Trump's daughter <a href="Ivanka%20Trump">Ivanka</a> had said that her father once portrayed himself as poorer than a <a href="Homelessness">homeless person</a>.

Oliver states that Trump had frequently threatened to file <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a>s against various people, but had never actually filed these lawsuits, and has settled lawsuits filed against him about his never-completed condominium developments despite Trump's claim that he never settles any of his legal disputes. He says that Trump was also sensitive about the size of his fingers due to a 1988 "<a href="Spy%20%28magazine%29">Spy</a>" feature piece that criticized him as a "short-fingered vulgarian." The now-defunct magazine's editor, <a href="E.%20Graydon%20Carter">E. Graydon Carter</a>—who discussed the story in a November 2015 "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" article—said that after the article was published, Trump would send envelopes enclosed with photos of himself at various times, with all of the pictures highlighting his fingers with a circular gold <a href="Sharpie%20%28marker%29">Sharpie</a> to dispute the claims.
Oliver next calls Trump inconsistent in the political views that he expressed during and prior to his campaign, saying that "he's been <a href="United%20States%20pro-choice%20movement">pro choice</a> "and" <a href="United%20States%20pro-life%20movement">pro life</a>; he's been for "and" against <a href="Assault%20weapons%20legislation%20in%20the%20United%20States">assault weapon bans</a>; in favor of both bringing in <a href="Syrian%20refugees">Syrian refugees</a> "and" deporting them out of the country." Oliver states that during a phone-in interview on "<a href="Fox%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Fox & Friends</a>," Trump had advocated killing families of suspected terrorists as part of his strategy to defeat ISIS, which would constitute a <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a> under the laws of the <a href="Geneva%20Convention">Geneva Convention</a>.

Afterward, Oliver says that former <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> Grand Wizard <a href="David%20Duke">David Duke</a> was one of the Trump campaign's backers, and that Trump had publicly denounced Duke in 2000 but then claimed to not know who Duke was in 2016. The comedian also mentions that Trump had failed to repudiate Duke in interviews with various <a href="Sunday%20morning%20talk%20shows">Sunday morning talk shows</a> on the day of the episode's broadcast, after Duke advocated his <a href="white%20supremacist">white supremacist</a> supporters the previous week to endorse Trump due to the Republican candidate's campaign rhetoric. Up to that point, Trump had promoted <a href="Racism">bigotry against several ethnicities</a> during his campaign, including <a href="Hispanophobia">Hispanophobia</a> and <a href="Islamophobia">Islamophobia</a>. The comedian criticizes Trump's claim not to know who Duke was, citing a 2000 <a href="NBC%20News">NBC News</a> interview in which Trump called Duke "a bigot [and] a racist"; Oliver notes that, having given such an answer despite the contradiction, Trump "is either racist or [is] pretending to be, and at some point, there's no difference there." In total, Trump was lying about three-fourths of the time, according to Oliver, who cited a <a href="PolitiFact.com">PolitiFact</a> study of the statements made by Trump since the launch of his presidential campaign.

In the final portion of the segment, Oliver urges viewers to refer to Donald Trump by the Trump family's ancestral name of "Drumpf." Oliver pointed out earlier in the piece that Trump had repeatedly mocked Jewish-American comedian <a href="Jon%20Stewart">Jon Stewart</a> by referring to him as "Jonathan Leibowitz," the comedian's birth name. Oliver, an alumnus of Stewart's "<a href="The%20Daily%20Show">Daily Show</a>", justified the "Drumpf" epithet by insisting that "[Trump] should be proud of his heritage!", parodying Trump's mockery of Stewart in a May 2013 Twitter post that Trump later denied having written. Oliver opines that this name is much more reflective of Trump's true nature, and says that if viewers wanted to vote for "the charismatic guy promising to make America great again," they should "stop and take a moment to imagine how [they] would feel if [they] just met a guy named Donald Drumpf."

After noting the "powerful" and "almost onomatopoeic" connotation that the Trump surname has with some people, Oliver says of the ancestral name, "Drumpf is much less magical. It's the sound produced when a morbidly obese <a href="pigeon">pigeon</a> flies into the window of a foreclosed <a href="Old%20Navy">Old Navy</a>. [...] It's the sound of a bottle of store-brand <a href="root%20beer">root beer</a> falling off the shelf in a <a href="Filling%20station">gas station</a> minimart." The segment closes with Oliver walking toward a lighted "DRUMPF" sign, informing those watching the segment who are considering voting for Trump, "Don't vote for him because he tells it like it is. He's a bullshit artist. Don't vote for him because he's tough. He's a baby, with even smaller fingers. Don't vote for him because he's a builder. He's more of a shitty lifestyle brand." Oliver then challenges Trump to sue him over the segment.

A trademark application for the word "Drumpf" was filed with the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> by a company called Drumpf Industries, a <a href="limited%20liability%20company">limited liability company</a> based in Delaware. The request was rejected in May 2016 on the grounds that the proposed trademark would be based on a living person, i.e. Donald Trump, but that Trump had not given his written consent to trademark his name. After the segment, Oliver released a <a href="Google%20Chrome%20extension">Google Chrome extension</a> dubbed the "Drumpfinator," which changes all instances of "Trump" to "Drumpf" on webpages. He coined and displayed the <a href="hashtag">hashtag</a> "#MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain" during the segment. Oliver also registered the web domain "donaldjdrumpf.com" to provide free downloads of the "Drumpfinator" Chrome extension and sell red baseball caps branded with the slogan "Make Donald Drumpf Again." The "Make Donald Drumpf Again" caps, manufactured by <a href="Unionwear">Unionwear</a>, were modeled after Trump's red "<a href="Make%20America%20Great%20Again">Make America Great Again</a>" caps.

Immediately after the segment aired, <a href="Web%20search%20engine">web searches</a> for "Donald Drumpf" went <a href="Viral%20phenomenon">viral</a>. By March 1, the date on which the "<a href="Super%20Tuesday">Super Tuesday</a>" primaries were held, <a href="Google%20Search">Google Search</a>es for "Donald Drumpf" had surpassed those for both <a href="Ted%20Cruz">Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="Marco%20Rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, two of Trump's rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. Other media also started reporting on Trump's "short fingers" shortly after the episode's broadcast, prompting Trump to write a Twitter post on March 1 in which he stated that he was not aware of any mockery of his "short fingers." 

By March 4, six days after the segment's air date, the "Drumpfinator" <a href="Google%20Chrome%20extension">Chrome extension</a> had received over 333,800 downloads and 5,800 reviews. The Drumpfinator and similar extensions resulted in multiple outlets accidentally replacing Trump's name. The <a href="American%20Jewish%20Congress">American Jewish Congress</a> announced the results of a poll of their members that referred to the candidate as "Donald Drumpf," which they later acknowledged was an accident caused by someone's use of the extension. "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" magazine published multiple articles replacing Trump's name with the phrase "Someone with Tiny Hands" in reference to the "Short-Fingered Vulgarian" <a href="Internet%20meme">meme</a>, a result of another Chrome extension.

Reviewing the segment, Daniel Victor of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said "Donald Drumpf" was "a funny label," but stated that the Trump family had changed its name in the 17th century, so the surname change could not be attributed to the presidential candidate. He also pointed out that many American entertainers and politicians, including Presidents <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> and rival presidential candidate <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, had changed their names. <a href="CNET">CNET</a>'s Chris Matyszczyk called the segment a "lengthy excoriation" of Trump and commented that Oliver's intents extended past "mere satire," influencing Americans to care enough to vote against Trump.

After the segment, a <a href="Twitterbot">Twitterbot</a> named "DeepDrumpf" was created at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>. Named after the "Last Week Tonight" segment, the bot uses <a href="neural%20network">neural network</a> technology to post tweets in an imitation of Trump. The bot's creator stated that DeepDrumpf collects fragments of Trump's statements, noting their grammatical structure using <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), and outputs the resulting sentences based on what it learned about Trump's grammar style. He also said that if there were more data available, or even all the data that Facebook's AI system can analyze, then the neural network would be better able to mimic Trump.

Within eight days of the original broadcast, the <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> video of the segment surpassed 19 million views, making it Oliver's most watched segment. By comparison, the previous episode's main segment had a little over four million views on YouTube by that date. By the end of March, the segment had been viewed 23.3 million times on YouTube and 62 million times on Facebook, for a total of 85 million times on the two social media platforms, making its viewership "a record for any piece of HBO content."

By March 8, ten days after the episode's broadcast, the donaldjdrumpf.com website had sold over 35,000 "Make Donald Drumpf Again" hats, comprising all of the inventory on hand. The Chrome extension had also been downloaded 433,000 times. (In November, shortly after Trump's election, Drumpf-cap manufacturer Unionwear filed for bankruptcy, though this had nothing to do directly with the manufacturing of these specific hats.)

Freelance journalist S. I. Rosenbaum, writing for the "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>", criticized Oliver's "Donald Drumpf" appellation as derisive of <a href="German%20Americans">German Americans</a> and other immigrant groups who <a href="Anglicisation">anglicized</a> their names upon immigration. Rosenbaum wrote that the phrase was reminiscent of Trump's own <a href="Xenophobia">xenophobic</a> statements in that it was part of a long-running trend of "bestowing foreign-sounding names to imply that the target isn't really an American." Oliver later said that the joke "got out of hand" and never used it on the show again. In an interview with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine, he said, "That joke became old for us very quickly. There's a reason we didn't use it again. It really is the song I skip past. It's '<a href="Creep%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">Creep</a>.' It's a good song, <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a>! It was a good song when he wrote it." Alluding to the fact that the segment aired on the same night as the <a href="88th%20Academy%20Awards">Oscars</a>, the comedian also stated, "We were not doing [the episode] with the sense that it would become bigger than our show normally is," but the "Drumpf" appellation's later popularity "kind of slightly ruins the memory." 

While there was agreement among commentators that Drumpf was the Trumps' ancestral name, and that neither Donald Trump nor his father were named Drumpf, they disagreed on whether the family name was changed in the 17th century or well into the 19th century, when Trump's grandfather <a href="Frederick%20Trump">Frederick Trump</a> immigrated to the United States. In their 2017 book "<a href="Trump%20Revealed">Trump Revealed</a>", <a href="Michael%20Kranish">Michael Kranish</a> and <a href="Marc%20Fisher">Marc Fisher</a> write that it is unknown when the "Trump" name was finalized. They further state that Trump family headstones in <a href="Kallstadt">Kallstadt</a>—the German village where Trump's grandfather was born—show various spellings of the family name "including Dromb, Drumb, Drumpf, Trum, Tromb, Tromp, Trumpf, and Trumpff." 

Some commentators stated that the name change happened sometime during Frederick Trump's lifetime, and that he was born as Friedrich Drumpf. <a href="Gwenda%20Blair">Gwenda Blair</a>, Trump's longtime biographer, appeared in an interview with "<a href="Deutsche%20Welle">Deutsche Welle</a>" in 2015, where she stated, "[Donald's] grandfather Friedrich Drumpf came to the United States in 1885" when he was 16 years old and Germans were immigrating to America in large numbers. In September 2015, after the genealogical website <a href="Ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> released the lineages of several famous families—including the Trump and <a href="Astor%20family">Astor</a> families—the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" reported that Frederick Trump had been given the name "Friedrich Drumpf" upon his birth in Germany in 1869. In U.S. immigration records from 1885, Friedrich's name is transcribed as "Friedr. Trumpf." the name under which he was processed when he entered the United States that year.

Other published sources said that the name change occurred in the 17th century. In the 2015 book "The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate", an excerpt from which the program used to cite the ancestral name disclosure for the segment, biographer Gwenda Blair wrote that the Trumps' family name was changed during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. She cited that one ancestor, named John Philip Trump, lived in the 17th century. Blair also wrote that Frederick Trump's original name was Friedrich Trump, and his father, born in the 19th century, was Johannes Trump. This position was endorsed by "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>", as well as by Daniel Victor, the "New York Times" reporter, who wrote, "Despite mistaken impressions, Mr. Trump and his recent relatives had nothing to do with the surname change. Mr. Oliver himself was careful to refer to a 'prescient ancestor'." Kate Connolly of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>," who visited Kallstadt, referred to Frederick as "Friedrich Trump". She said that the town church's <a href="parish%20register">parish register</a> contained multiple versions of the Trump name spanning 500 years, but did not mention the name "Drumpf." 

Several sources reported that Friedrich, his father, and his aunt were all named Trump, thus placing the name change before the 18th century. Genealogy organization <a href="FamilySearch">FamilySearch</a> provided information on Friedrich Trump, listing his father as Johann Ii Trump. A genealogist at <a href="Dotdash">Dotdash</a>, which was then called About.com, listed Donald Trump's grandfather as Friederich Trump and great-grandfather as Christian Johannes Trump. In his 2013 book "America's Obsessives: The Compulsive Energy That Built a Nation", Joshua Kendall wrote that Frederick's father and aunt, and by extension Donald Trump's great-grandfather and great-grandaunt, were called John Trump and Charlotte Luise Trump, respectively.

Seri Rambai

The Seri Rambai is a 17th-century Dutch cannon displayed at <a href="Fort%20Cornwallis">Fort Cornwallis</a> in <a href="George%20Town%2C%20Penang">George Town</a>, the capital city of the <a href="States%20and%20federal%20territories%20of%20Malaysia">Malaysian state</a> of <a href="Penang">Penang</a> and a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>. It is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia, a fertility symbol and the subject of legends and prophecy.

The cannon's history in the <a href="Malacca%20Straits">Malacca Straits</a> began in the early 1600s, when <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a> officers gave it to the <a href="Sultan%20of%20Johor">Sultan of Johor</a> in return for trading concessions. Less than a decade later <a href="Johor%20Sultanate">Johor</a> was destroyed, the sultan captured and the "Seri Rambai" taken to <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Aceh">Aceh</a>. Near the end of the eighteenth century the cannon was sent to <a href="Selangor">Selangor</a> and mounted next to one of the town's hilltop forts. In 1871 pirates seized a Penang <a href="junk%20%28ship%29">junk</a>, murdered its passengers and crew, and took the stolen vessel to Selangor. The <a href="Straits%20Settlements">British colonial government</a> responded by burning the town, destroying its forts and confiscating the "Seri Rambai".

The gun was originally displayed at George Town's <a href="Esplanade%2C%20Penang">Esplanade</a>; in the 1950s it was moved to Fort Cornwallis.

Southeast Asia abounds with tales of historic cannon: many are said to be imbued with supernatural powers; some are revered for their cultural and spiritual significance; others are notable for having been present at defining moments in the region's history. Burma's "<a href="Hmannan%20Yazawin">Glass Palace Chronicle</a>" recounts a story about the <a href="Burmese%E2%80%93Siamese%20War%20%281765%E2%80%931767%29">Burmese-Siamese war</a> (1765–1767) that illustrates the divine properties ascribed to certain cannon. After attempts to repel Burmese attacks on the <a href="Ayutthaya%20Kingdom">Siamese capital</a> had proved unsuccessful, the King of Siam ordered that the city's guardian spirit, a great cannon called "Dwarawadi", be used to halt the advance. The gun was ceremoniously hoisted and aimed at the enemy's camp, but the powder failed to ignite. Fearing the guardian of the city had abandoned them, the king's officials implored their sovereign to surrender.

One of <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>'s best known fertility symbols is the "Si Jagur", a Portuguese cannon exhibited next to the city's <a href="Jakarta%20History%20Museum">History Museum</a>. The writer <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> described the gun as a "prostrate God" that women caressed, sat astride and prayed to for children. Near the entrance to Thailand's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20headquarters%20%28Thailand%29">Ministry of Defence building</a> in <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> is a cannon known as the "<a href="Phaya%20Tani">Phaya Tani</a>", an enormous gun captured from the <a href="Pattani%20Kingdom">Sultanate of Pattani</a> in 1785. The cannon is a symbol of cultural identity in Pattani and the profound sense of loss caused by its seizure is still felt today: when Bangkok refused to return the gun and in 2013 sent a replica instead, suspected insurgents bombed the replica nine days later.

The "Seri Rambai" is a Dutch cannon displayed on the ramparts of <a href="Fort%20Cornwallis">Fort Cornwallis</a> in <a href="George%20Town%2C%20Penang">George Town</a>, the capital city of <a href="Penang">Penang</a> and a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>. Two articles about the cannon have been published in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20the%20Malaysian%20Branch%20of%20the%20Royal%20Asiatic%20Society">Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society</a>". The first was a brief summary of the gun's history in the <a href="Malacca%20Straits">Malacca Straits</a>; the second a detailed study researched by <a href="Carl%20Alexander%20Gibson-Hill">Carl Alexander Gibson-Hill</a>, a former director of <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Singapore">Singapore's National Museum</a> and president of the city-state's Photographic Society. Newspapers have also discussed the cannon: in 2013 the "<a href="Sunday%20Times">Sunday Times</a>" began a feature about Penang with the comment "Cannons don't often have names, but the Seri Rambai, on the walls of Fort Cornwallis, is something rather special".

The "Seri Rambai" is a <a href="Caliber%23Pounds%20as%20a%20measure%20of%20cannon%20bore">28-pounder</a>, 127.5 inches (3.25 m) long with a calibre of 6.1 inches; (15 cm); the barrel measures 118.75 inches; (3.02 m). It was cast in 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of <a href="Lion%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic lions</a> with long, spiralling tails. Each pair faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20India%20Company">Dutch East India Company</a>'s seal is a <a href="Jawi%20alphabet">Javi</a> inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.

The Dutch bid to control southeast Asia's spice trade hinged on two principal strategies: the first: the first was to directly attack Iberian assets in the region, including Portugal's stronghold at <a href="Portuguese%20Malacca">Malacca</a> and Spanish shipping between <a href="Manila%20Galleon">Manila and Acapulco</a>; the second was to forge alliances with local rulers and offer protection in exchange for trading concessions. An important alliance was consolidated in 1603 when Dutch East India Company ships joined forces with the <a href="Johor%20Sultanate">Sultanate of Johor</a> to capture the "<a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28ship%29">Santa Catarina</a>", a Portuguese <a href="carrack">carrack</a> transiting the <a href="Singapore%20Strait">Singapore Strait</a>. The vessel's pillaged cargo was later sold in Europe for approximately 3.5 million <a href="florin">florin</a>s, equivalent to half the Dutch East India Company's paid capital and double that of the <a href="East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a>. Soon after this triumph, possibly in 1605, Dutch officers presented the "Seri Rambai" to <a href="Sultan%20of%20Johor">Johor's sultan</a>.

One of Johor's main rivals at the time was the <a href="Aceh%20Sultanate">Sultanate of Aceh</a>, a cosmopolitan entrepòt and centre for religious and ideological learning. Aceh's rise to power began in the early 1500s: during the following decades the sultanate expanded its territories in <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and sought military assistance from <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> in a quest to banish the Portuguese from Malacca. In 1613 Aceh launched an attack of Johor, destroying its capital and taking as prisoners the sultan, his family and entourage. The "Seri Rambai" was captured during the assault: a Javi inscription on the gun's barrel records the event and the senior <a href="Acehnese%20people">Acehnese</a> officers involved.
There is no recorded history of the cannon between 1613 and 1795, when the Acehnese sent the "Seri Rambai" to <a href="Sultan%20of%20Selangor">Sultan Ibrahim</a> of <a href="Selangor">Selangor</a> in return for his brother's services in a military campaign. The Selangor incident began in June 1871 when pirates commandeered a Penang <a href="junk%20%28ship%29">junk</a>, killing its thirty-four passengers and crew, and taking the vessel to Selangor. The <a href="Straits%20Settlements">British colonial government</a> responded swiftly: a steamer and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> warship were dispatched to Selangor with instructions to arrest the pirates and recover the stolen junk. After a series of skirmishes and the arrival of support troops and artillery, the town was burned, the forts demolished and the "Seri Rambai" taken to Penang. The loss of the cannon was deeply felt in Selangor: a local prophecy maintains that only when the gun is returned will the town regain its former eminence.

According to legend the "Seri Rambai" was not formally unloaded in Penang but cast into shallow waters off George Town and left for almost a decade. The story describes how it was eventually retrieved by a Selangor nobleman who tied a length of thread to the gun and ordered it to float ashore. Until the 1950s the cannon was exhibited at the <a href="Esplanade%2C%20Penang">Esplanade</a> in the heart of George Town, adjacent to Fort Cornwallis. It was here that the gun acquired its Malay name, "Seri Rambai", and reputation as a fertility symbol. The cannon was removed during the <a href="History%20of%20Penang%23World%20War%20II">Japanese occupation</a> in World War II, but restored to the Esplanade once hostilities had ceased. In 1953 an article in the "<a href="The%20Straits%20Times">Straits Times</a>" discussed plans to find old cannon for display at Fort Cornwallis, adding that the cannon then nearest to the fort was on the Esplanade, 200 yards away. By 1970 the "Seri Rambai" was mounted on the ramparts of Fort Cornwallis, albeit missing a wheel for its carriage.

Near the ferry terminal in <a href="Butterworth%2C%20Penang">Butterworth</a> is an old, rusted cannon that according to a local Chinese tradition was once the "Seri Rambai's" female partner. The story tells how it abandoned its "mate" and floated across the channel from Penang to Butterworth. A Malay tradition ascribes a different history to the Butterworth cannon, but believes the "Seri Rambai" is one of a pair. The possibility that the "Seri Rambai" might have a twin or "relative" is not without precedent. A researcher studying Jakarta's "Si Jagur" found a similar gun in Lisbon's Military Museum and surmised that both had been cast by Manuel Tavares Bocarro, a Portuguese founder in <a href="Macau">Macau</a>. An oft-told story holds that Pattani's "Phaya Tani" had a twin, the "Seri Negara". Both were captured during Siam's conquest of the sultanate and ordered to be taken to Bangkok. One version of the tale describes how the "Seri Negara" fell into Pattani Bay while being ferried to the ship; another claims it was lost at sea when the Siamese vessel foundered and sank.

Heffernan v. City of Paterson

Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. ___ (2016), was a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case in 2016 concerning the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> rights of public employees. By a 6–2 margin, the Court held that a public employee's constitutional rights might be violated when an employer, believing that the employee was engaging in what would be <a href="Freedom%20of%20speech%20in%20the%20United%20States">protected speech</a>, disciplines them because of that belief, even if the employee did not exercise such a constitutional right.

The case was brought after Jeffrey Heffernan, a detective with the <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a> police force, went to a distribution center and picked up a <a href="lawn%20sign">lawn sign</a> for the candidate challenging the city's incumbent mayor in the 2005 election (Heffernan's mother had wanted a sign, so he was getting one for her). While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to <a href="beat%20%28police%29">beat</a> patrol work as a uniformed officer.

Heffernan brought suit alleging that his demotion violated his First Amendment rights. The case took a decade to reach the Supreme Court. For most of that time it was in federal <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20New%20Jersey">district court</a>, where it was heard by three different judges. A jury verdict in Heffernan's favor was <a href="Motion%20to%20set%20aside%20judgment">set aside</a>. A later <a href="summary%20judgment">summary judgment</a> in the city's favor was overturned on <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Third%20Circuit">appeal</a> before being granted again in the third trial.

Writing for a majority of the Supreme Court, <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Justice</a> <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a> stated that the department's belief was all that mattered, since the Court's <a href="legal%20precedent">precedent</a> in this area holds it is unconstitutional for a government agency to discipline an employee (who does not work under a contract that explicitly permits such discipline) for engaging in partisan political activity, as long as that activity is not disruptive to the agency's operations. Even if Heffernan was not engaging in protected speech, he wrote, the discipline against him sent a message to others to avoid exercising their rights. Justice <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> wrote a <a href="dissenting%20opinion">dissenting opinion</a> in which he was joined by Justice <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Samuel Alito</a>, in which he agreed that Heffernan had been harmed, but his constitutional rights had not been violated.

The First Amendment guarantees the rights of <a href="Freedom%20of%20speech%20in%20the%20United%20States">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="Freedom%20of%20assembly">peaceable assembly</a>, among others. While not explicitly mentioned, the Supreme Court has held that the right to assembly includes the <a href="freedom%20of%20association">freedom of association</a>, particularly political association. These protections not only prohibit the government from passing laws which infringe upon these rights, but also from taking actions which would violate them. While the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>—which includes the First Amendment—applied originally only to the federal government, the ratification of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> allowed for the application of the Bill of Rights to the states under the <a href="incorporation%20doctrine">incorporation doctrine</a>.

In order to better protect these rights in the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a>, Congress passed the <a href="Second%20Enforcement%20Act%20of%201871">Second Enforcement Act of 1871</a> at the request of President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> to better counter <a href="white%20supremacy">white supremacist</a> organizations such as the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> that were intimidating and suppressing voting by black citizens. The act provided a remedy for those citizens who were deprived of their constitutional rights under the "color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia" and is currently codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1983. With its decision in "<a href="Monroe%20v.%20Pape">Monroe v. Pape</a>" (1961), the Court expanded the reach of section 1983 such that it is now used as a method of checking abuse by state officials who infringe upon constitutionally protected rights.

The First Amendment protects <a href="Government%20employees%20in%20the%20United%20States">public employees</a> from retaliation by their employer when speaking on matters of public concern. In "<a href="Pickering%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Pickering v. Board of Education</a>" (1968), the Court first articulated the right of public employees to be protected from dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in "<a href="Elrod%20v.%20Burns">Elrod v. Burns</a>".

But the Court has recognized that the "government as employer" has wider constitutional latitude in its decisions than the "government as sovereign". In order to adequately delineate the limits of the government-as-employer's discretion, the Court developed a framework in "<a href="Connick%20v.%20Myers">Connick v. Myers</a>" (1983) known as the "Connick" test. It consists of two elements. The first is the threshold a plaintiff must pass to state a claim: the plaintiff must show that they were speaking on a matter of public concern. The second falls to the employer: they must show that the harm to workplace efficiency outweighs the harm caused by infringing upon the right to free speech.

In "<a href="Waters%20v.%20Churchill">Waters v. Churchill</a>" (1994), the Court was faced with two differing accounts of the speech at issue. The question presented to the Court was whether the "Connick" test ought be applied to what the employer thought was said or what was actually said. The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice <a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a>, joined by a <a href="plurality%20opinion">plurality of justices</a>, opined that the "Connick" test must be applied to the speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the <a href="finder%20of%20fact">finder of fact</a> determines did occur.

In 2005, Jeffrey Heffernan was a detective with the <a href="Paterson%2C%20New%20Jersey">Paterson, New Jersey</a> police. His supervisor and the chief of police were both appointed by the city's incumbent mayor, <a href="Joey%20Torres">Jose Torres</a>, who was being challenged by <a href="city%20council">city council</a>man Lawrence Spagnola in that year's election. Heffernan was friendly with Spagnola, a former police chief, and informally supported his campaign. He could not vote in the election as he did not live in the city. At the request of his sick mother, who did live in the city, Heffernan while off-duty picked up a Spagnola <a href="lawn%20sign">lawn sign</a> for her after her previous sign was stolen. Other officers saw him at the distribution location holding a sign and talking to Spagnola campaign staff. They soon notified superiors, and the next day officials demoted Heffernan from detective to patrol officer for his perceived "overt involvement" with the Spagnola campaign.

Heffernan sued the city, the mayor, and his superior officers under <a href="Second%20Enforcement%20Act%20of%201871%23As%20later%20amended%20and%20codified%20as%20section%201983">42 U.S.C. §1983</a> in the federal <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20New%20Jersey">District Court for New Jersey</a>, claiming that his rights of freedom of speech as well as <a href="freedom%20of%20association">freedom of association</a> had been violated. Heffernan contended that while he had not actually engaged in any protected speech, the department acted on the belief that he had, and the department should not have demoted him on the basis of that erroneous belief.

In 2009, a jury found for Heffernan and awarded him damages from the police officials and the city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge <a href="Peter%20G.%20Sheridan">Peter G. Sheridan</a> had not allowed him to pursue the freedom of speech claim; the defense did so as well because Judge Sheridan had allowed the freedom of association claim. While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> through a former law firm and <a href="Motion%20to%20set%20aside%20judgment">set aside</a> the verdict, setting a new date for trial before Judge <a href="Dennis%20M.%20Cavanaugh">Dennis M. Cavanaugh</a>.

Judge Cavanaugh granted <a href="summary%20judgment">summary judgment</a> to the defendants on the freedom of speech claim based on their earlier motions, holding that Heffernan had not engaged in protected speech so his rights could not have been violated. In 2012, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Third%20Circuit">Third Circuit Court of Appeals</a> reversed Judge Cavanaugh's ruling and <a href="remand%20%28court%20procedure%29">remanded</a> the case to him with instructions that he was to allow Heffernan to present his freedom of association claim and consider the facts from the jury trial when reconsidering the summary-judgment motions.

Judge <a href="Kevin%20McNulty%20%28judge%29">Kevin McNulty</a> heard the case on remand. After considering the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had not engaged in any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per "Ambrose v. Robinson Township," a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that "Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission," a case in which the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Sixth%20Circuit">Sixth Circuit</a> had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since "Dye" itself explicitly rejected "Ambrose," and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.

On appeal to the Third Circuit, a <a href="three-judge%20panel">three-judge panel</a> of Judge <a href="Robert%20Cowen">Robert Cowen</a>, Judge <a href="Morton%20Ira%20Greenberg">Morton Ira Greenberg</a> and Judge <a href="Thomas%20I.%20Vanaskie">Thomas I. Vanaskie</a> unanimously held for the city. In a decision issued in 2015, Judge Vanaskie, writing for the Court, reiterated Judge McNulty's finding that Heffernan's actions in picking up the sign for his mother did not constitute protected speech or association. He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in "Dye" by noting that in that case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.

Judge Vanaskie instead found guidance from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in "<a href="Waters%20v.%20Churchill">Waters v. Churchill</a>", in which it had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor to a colleague, despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.

Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan petitioned the Supreme Court for "<a href="certiorari">certiorari</a>," requesting they hear the case. After the Court considered both Heffernan's petition and the city's reply, it granted the petition on the first day of the 2015 term. Both parties consented to the filing of "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Government%20Employees">National Association of Government Employees</a>, <a href="Becket%20Fund%20for%20Religious%20Liberty">Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20Center%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Free%20Expression">Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression</a> filed "amicus" briefs in support of Heffernan, while the <a href="New%20Jersey%20State%20League%20of%20Municipalities">New Jersey State League of Municipalities</a> and the <a href="National%20Conference%20of%20State%20Legislatures">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an "amicus" brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at oral argument, which the Court granted, meaning the <a href="United%20States%20Solicitor%20General">Solicitor General</a>'s office would be appearing at <a href="oral%20argument">oral argument</a>s, held on January 19, 2016.

Mark Frost, arguing for petitioner Jeffrey Heffernan, was immediately met with questions from the justices: <a href="Anthony%20Kennedy">Anthony Kennedy</a> asked for clarification on the particular right to be protected, and <a href="Antonin%20Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Samuel Alito</a> and <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Roberts">John Roberts</a> all questioned him about whether his rights could be infringed if he was not actually engaged in any speech. Justice Scalia (who died before the decision was announced) argued that there was "no constitutional right not to be fired for the wrong reason." 

Frost responded that the motives of the government, rather than the actions of the individual, were important in this case. <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Assistant to the Solicitor General</a> Ginger Anders, arguing on behalf of the United States as "amicus curiae" in favor of Heffernan, continued this argument, stating that there is "a First Amendment right not to have adverse action taken against him by his employer for the unconstitutional purpose of suppressing disfavored political beliefs."

Arguing for respondents, <a href="Tom%20Goldstein">Thomas Goldstein</a> distinguished between political neutrality and political apathy. He argued that the First Amendment protects political neutrality, the conscious choice to not take a position, but does not protect political apathy, when a person simply does not care and makes no particular choice to be neutral. As Heffernan claimed that he had no affiliation with Spagnola, the respondents argued that Heffernan's actions constitute unprotected apathy rather than a conscious choice of neutrality. Justice <a href="Elena%20Kagan">Elena Kagan</a> questioned Goldstein as to the purpose of the First Amendment saying, "the idea has to do with why the government acted" to which he responded, "It's called an individual right, not a government wrong." Frost took a rebuttal to respond to Goldstein's distinction between political neutrality and apathy, arguing that there is little distinction as the government is acting for impermissible reasons in both cases.

In a 6–2 decision authored by Justice <a href="Stephen%20Breyer">Stephen Breyer</a>, the Court reversed the ruling of the lower court and ruled that the employer's motive is material to First Amendment challenges. Citing "Waters v. Churchill," Justice Breyer wrote, 
[W]e conclude that, as in "Waters," the government's reason for demoting Heffernan is what counts here. When an employer demotes an employee out of a desire to prevent the employee from engaging in political activity that the First Amendment protects, the employee is entitled to challenge that unlawful action under the First Amendment ... —even if, as here, the employer makes a factual mistake about the employee's behavior.The Court remanded the case to the Third Circuit and made clear in its opinion that, while it is impermissible to retaliate based upon perceived protected speech, the lower courts should take into consideration whether Heffernan was disciplined for violating any different and neutral policies. The majority provided three main arguments in support of its reasoning: that their interpretation is more in line with the text of the First Amendment, that it better served the First Amendment's purpose of limiting political patronage, and that such an interpretation will not significantly burden employers.

Justice Breyer argued that unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, which focuses on the rights of the people, the First Amendment focuses on the actions of the government when it says, "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech." As the text of the amendment focuses on the government's abilities to make laws, it is the government's actions and motives, not the actual actions of citizens, which are proscribed by the Amendment. While the policy at issue was not a <a href="Act%20of%20Congress">law of Congress</a>, the actions were still that of a government official that infringed upon rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.

The Court supported this interpretation by recognizing that the First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing "<a href="Branti%20v.%20Finkel">Branti v. Finkel</a>," the Court pointed out that precedent never required plaintiffs in political affiliation cases to show change in allegiance to be successful, and similarly extended that logic to this case: the potential chilling effect on constitutionally protected speech still exists, regardless of the factual basis of the employer's reasoning. Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings should be considered in violation of the First Amendment.

Respondents argued that finding employers liable for factual mistakes would place substantial costs upon employers. The Court rejected this argument, saying that an employee would still need to prove the employer acted out of an improper motive. Referring to Heffernan's case and those like it, the Court said that "the employee will, if anything, find it more difficult to prove that motive, for the employee will have to point to more than his own conduct to show an employer's intent".

Justice <a href="Clarence%20Thomas">Clarence Thomas</a> authored the dissent, in which Justice <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Samuel Alito</a> joined. Justice Thomas argued that the previous ruling should have been upheld "because federal law does not provide a cause of action to plaintiffs whose constitutional rights have not been violated". The dissent focused on the text of the statute Heffernan was suing under: 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The statute provides a cause of action only for those whose rights have actually been violated by the government. Because Heffernan maintained that he had not been exercising his First Amendment rights, the dissent argued that those rights could not have been violated, and that a section 1983 claim requires that the employee engage in protected activity and that the employer retaliate against that activity.

The dissent argued that, for a section 1983 claim to be valid, "harm alone is not enough; it has to be the right kind of harm." Thomas provided an example of a law allowing police to pull over any driver without cause. This would obviously violate the <a href="Fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourth Amendment</a> rights of anyone stopped, but people stuck in traffic who were injured by the collateral damage of unconstitutional actions would not be able to sue because none of their rights was violated. Similarly, it is not enough for Heffernan to have shown injury but violation of an actual right as well. For the dissent, even if the dismissal was for the wrong reason and harm was suffered, the dismissal cannot infringe upon rights he never exercised.

Further supporting their argument, the dissent cited "<a href="Monterey%20v.%20Del%20Monte%20Dunes%20at%20Monterey%2C%20Ltd.">Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.</a>" to argue that a Section 1983 claim falls under <a href="tort%20law">tort law</a>, in order to draw a distinction between how attempts are handled under tort and criminal law. Under criminal law, a factually impossible attempt to commit a crime, such as trying to steal from an empty pocket or defraud someone with no money, can still be tried as an attempt. No such doctrine exists in tort law. Because Heffernan was not engaged in protected activity, the police department could only have attempted to deprive him of his right, so his suit must fail because "there are no attempted torts."

The day after oral arguments, writer Gilad Edelman criticized the Court's assumption that Heffernan never exercised his First Amendment rights, saying, "the Supreme Court may miss an opportunity to make sure that cases like his really are rare." Edelman interpreted Heffernan's actions as being well within the existing First Amendment precedent. Though Heffernan was not necessarily supporting the candidate, he was talking and associating with people connected to the candidate, actions already protected under existing precedent. Edelman suggested that, regardless of whether or not Heffernan intended to be identified as supporting the campaign, he was still punished by the city for associating.

Soon after the ruling was announced, the decision was largely praised. Jonathan Stahl, a writer at the "<a href="Constitution%20Daily">Constitution Daily</a>," said that "[t]he potential impact of this case on our understanding of the First Amendment is notable." Similarly, "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" called it "good law" and a "significant development" for expanding the existing jurisprudence to perceived speech, not just actual speech.

Subsequent to the Supreme Court's ruling, the City of Paterson approved a $1.6 million settlement payout to Heffernan. The final payment of the settlement was due on September 30, 2017.

Sabrina Sidney

Sabrina Bicknell (1757 – 8 September 1843), better known as Sabrina Sidney, was a British <a href="child%20abandonment">foundling</a> girl taken in when she was 12 by author <a href="Thomas%20Day">Thomas Day</a>, who wanted to <a href="Child%20grooming">mould her into his perfect wife</a>. Day had been struggling to find a wife who would share his ideology and had been rejected by several women. Inspired by <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s book "<a href="Emile%2C%20or%20On%20Education">Emile, or On Education</a>", he decided to educate two girls without any frivolities, using his own concepts.

In 1769, Day and his barrister friend, <a href="John%20Bicknell">John Bicknell</a>, chose Sidney and another girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared they would be <a href="indentured%20servitude">indentured</a> to Day's friend <a href="Richard%20Lovell%20Edgeworth">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</a>. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a> with only Sidney, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing <a href="blank%20%28cartridge%29">blanks</a> at her skirts, dripping hot wax on her arms, and having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water.

When Sidney reached her teenage years, Day was persuaded by Edgeworth that his ideal wife experiment had failed and he should send her away, as it was inappropriate for Day to live with her unchaperoned. He then arranged for Sidney to undergo experimental vocational and residential changes—first attending a boarding school, then becoming an apprentice to a dressmaker family, and eventually being employed as Day's housekeeper. Having seen changes in Sidney, Day proposed marriage, though he soon called this off when she did not follow his strict instructions; he again sent her away, this time to a boarding house, where she later found work as a <a href="lady%27s%20companion">lady's companion</a>.

In 1783, Bicknell sought out Sidney and proposed marriage, telling her the truth about Day's experiment. Horrified, she confronted Day in a series of letters; he admitted the truth but refused to apologise. Sidney married Bicknell, and the couple had two children before his death in 1787. Sidney went on to work with schoolmaster <a href="Charles%20Burney%20%28schoolmaster%29">Charles Burney</a>, managing his schools.

In 1804, <a href="Anna%20Seward">Anna Seward</a> published a book about Sidney's upbringing. Edgeworth followed up with his memoirs, in which he claimed Sidney loved Day. Sidney herself, on the other hand, said she was miserable with Day and that he treated her as a slave.

Sidney was born in 1757 in <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more commonly known as the <a href="Foundling%20Hospital">Foundling Hospital</a>) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in <a href="St%20James%27s%20Church%2C%20Clerkenwell">St James's Church, Clerkenwell</a>. Her name was likely a misspelling of <a href="Monimia">Monimia</a> but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish.

One of the requirements of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sidney became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a <a href="wet%20nurse">wet nurse</a>, Mary Penfold, who brought her to <a href="Wotton%2C%20Surrey">Wotton, Surrey</a>, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sidney, to the <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a> branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sidney and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.

<a href="Thomas%20Day">Thomas Day</a> was a bachelor who had inherited his fortune from his father when he was an infant. Described as having a face pockmarked from <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, a brooding personality, and a short temper, Day attended <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Oxford">Corpus Christi College, Oxford</a>, to study philosophy. It was there that he decided to dedicate his life to becoming a virtuous man, shunning luxury and focusing on <a href="altruism">altruism</a>. Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, that she should be subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities. These high standards, combined with his generally unlikeable personality, meant that his advances were rejected by several women while he was at university.

Day was introduced to the work of <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a> by his friend <a href="Richard%20Lovell%20Edgeworth">Richard Lovell Edgeworth</a>; the pair shared a particular affinity for Rousseau's work on education in the book "<a href="Emile%2C%20or%20On%20Education">Emile, or On Education</a>". On leaving Oxford, Edgeworth and Day attempted to teach Edgeworth's first son, Dick, in the style of "Emile", a <a href="experiential%20learning">learning-by-doing</a> approach. Accompanying Edgeworth to Ireland as Dick's tutor, Day fell in love and was spurned first by Edgeworth's sister, and then by at least three other women in quick succession.

Day came to the conclusion that he would not be able to find a wife who would meet his high standards and largely blamed women's education for this. Inspired by the character of Sophie in Rousseau's "Emile", he resolved to "create" his ideal wife by raising her from adolescence, using the techniques laid out in the book. Day was approaching financial independence, when he would have full access to the money left to him, and conspired with his barrister friend, <a href="John%20Bicknell">John Bicknell</a>, to find two girls who could be taken into his care to be <a href="child%20grooming">groomed</a> as a perfect wife.

Just after Day's 21st birthday in June 1769, he and John Bicknell travelled to the Shrewsbury Orphan Hospital to choose the first girl for his experiment. Sidney was 12 years old at the time, described as "a clear auburn brunette, with darker eyes more glowing bloom and chestnut tresses". She was slender, and had long eyelashes and a pleasant voice. Day was struggling to choose a girl for the experiment, and Bicknell quickly picked her out. The pair did not tell the orphanage secretary, Samuel Magee, about the planned experiment. Instead they told him that she was to be indentured as a servant at Edgeworth's country house in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, waiving the £4 () fee they would have received for the apprenticeship. In line with the orphanage's requirements that responsibility be held by a married man, Edgeworth would be legally accountable for Sidney, despite him not being present nor even aware of the arrangement.

The apprenticeship was approved by the governors of the orphanage on 30 June 1769; Day and Bicknell collected Sidney on 17 August. She was brought to lodgings in London, where she met Edgeworth for the first time. Day changed her name to Sabrina Sidney: Sabrina, the Latin name for the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a>, which her orphanage overlooked; and Sidney after <a href="Algernon%20Sidney">Algernon Sidney</a>, one of Day's heroes. Day became a benefactor, and subsequently governor, of the Foundling Hospital, and on 20 September 1769 he chose another girl for his experiment, renaming her Lucretia after the <a href="Lucretia">Roman matron</a>.

Day had Bicknell draw up a contract to define the terms of the girls' indenture. Within one year, he would choose which girl he intended to marry, and the other would be given as an apprentice to a woman in a trade, along with a fee of £100 (). He would give a further £400 () upon the girl's marriage or if she were to start her own business. He would marry his intended bride or, if he decided not to, would gift her the sum of £500 (). Bicknell acted as guarantor for the contract.

Day wished for the girls to be isolated from external influences while he educated them so, at the beginning of November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a>, renting a house in "le quartier des fusteries". The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.

Day focussed on the girls' education, in the style of "Emile". He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he wanted to be able to debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury.

During his stay in France, Day regularly corresponded with Edgeworth. He said that both girls were passionate about their studies, Sidney more so. Day also related anecdotes, one concerning a trip on the <a href="Rhone">Rhone</a> where the boat overturned and he rescued both girls single-handedly as neither could swim. He described an incident in which he challenged a French Army officer to a <a href="duel">duel</a>, even producing a set of dueling pistols, simply as a manner of engaging or encouraging conversation with his young students; the officer apologised and explained he did not mean any offence, calming the situation.

Accounts by 19th-century historians suggest that Day grew impatient with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been <a href="smallpox%20vaccine%23Early%20vaccination">inoculated</a> against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant they would not have rebelled excessively.

While in France, Day struggled over which girl to choose to take forward with the experiment. Both were beautiful; Lucretia was more cheerful, Sidney more reserved and studious. The trio returned to England in spring 1770, by which time Day had finally decided that he would carry on with Sidney's training. Edgeworth explained that each of Day's projects with Sabrina had been successful, but he had come to the conclusion that Lucretia was "invincibly stupid". Day apprenticed Lucretia to a <a href="milliner">milliner</a> in <a href="Ludgate%20Hill">Ludgate Hill</a>, and took Sidney to Stowe House in <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, where her training could continue. The household would have had no more than a couple of servants, leaving Sidney to maintain the four floors of the house. Her tutoring continued at the same time, with one-on-one lessons from Day on a variety of subjects.
Day extended his tutoring to fortify Sidney against hardship, again based upon his interpretation of Rousseau's "Emile". The book explains the concept of "negative education", protecting a person from vices rather than teaching them virtues. Day interpreted this to mean that submitting Sidney to tests of endurance would help to create a woman with hardened nerves. One example given by Rousseau was helping Emile become accustomed to explosions such as fireworks by firing pistols with small amounts of powder near him, gradually increasing the amount of powder. Day, on the other hand, fired a pistol loaded with powder directly at Sidney's petticoat, not telling her that there was no shot in it.

In an attempt to increase her resistance to pain he would drop hot <a href="sealing%20wax">sealing wax</a> on her back and arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sidney to wade into <a href="Stowe%20Pool">Stowe Pool</a> until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sidney became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her.

During their time at Stowe House, Day introduced Sidney to members of the local intellectual circle, including the priest at <a href="Lichfield%20Cathedral">Lichfield Cathedral</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Seward">Thomas Seward</a>. Seward and his wife hoped that Day might be a suitor for their daughter, <a href="Anna%20Seward">Anna</a>, and Anna's writings of the time show her interest in Day. Anna was also enchanted by Sidney, who became the link between Day and the Seward family. Anna took a keen interest in Sidney's story, as her father had taken in <a href="Honora%20Sneyd">Honora Sneyd</a> when Sneyd's mother had died.

By 1770, Sidney began to question Day's techniques and to complain about the chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sidney was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sidney was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sidney to attend <a href="Sutton%20Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a> boarding school in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a> early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on <a href="finishing%20school">preparing</a> high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.

In 1774, Day visited Sidney to inform her that she would be apprenticed to the Parkinsons, a family of <a href="dressmaker">dressmaker</a>s, as Day believed the profession would not expose her to temptation. She was delivered to the family with the stipulation that she should work hard at chores and be denied luxuries. The Parkinsons, however, treated Sidney well, to the extent that Day later chastised them for not instilling "industry and frugality" in her. Less than a year later the Parkinsons' business went bankrupt, leaving Sidney without an apprenticeship and nowhere to live. Day arranged for her to stay with his friends, the Keir family, and implied that she could take on the role of housekeeper at his own home. Day again considered Sidney, who was now 18, a potential wife, but did not let her know of his intentions, nor that her upbringing was part of his experiment.

Over the next few months, Day returned to moulding Sidney to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sidney took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sidney, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends let her know that he hoped to marry her. Sidney confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.

Sidney did not refuse the proposal, so Day planned the wedding while she considered it further and eventually agreed. During the preparations, Day left Sidney with friends for a few days, giving her strict instructions on what she should wear. When he returned to find her in an outfit that did not meet his requirements, he flew into a rage and Sidney fled for a few hours, so Day called off the engagement. Sidney was sent to a boarding house in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and given a stipend of £50 per annum (). Day resolved never to see her again.

After her engagement to Day ended, Sidney spent eight years at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met and went on to marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sidney met an <a href="apothecary">apothecary</a>, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an <a href="acrostic">acrostic</a> poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a <a href="lady%27s%20companion">lady's companion</a> in <a href="Newport%2C%20Shropshire">Newport, Shropshire</a>. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sidney since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.

Sidney again consulted Day on the prospective engagement. Day did not approve, claiming the age difference was too great, although Bicknell was only two years older than Day. Bicknell decided to tell Sidney the truth about the experiment, that she was hand-picked to be Day's wife from childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sidney wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her.
Bicknell and Sidney married on 16 April 1784 at <a href="St%20Philip%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Birmingham">St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham</a>. The same day, Day paid the £500 wedding dowry he had stipulated in the contract he had set up with Bicknell, ending his £50 () per year stipend. The couple bought a house in <a href="Shenfield">Shenfield</a> and had two children, <a href="John%20Laurens%20Bicknell">John Laurens Bicknell</a> and Henry Edgeworth Bicknell. Bicknell carried on with his gambling habits, squandering the remaining money over the following three years. On 27 March 1787, after three years of marriage, John Bicknell died of a paralytic stroke.

Sidney and her two children were now left without an income. Day sent her a new stipend of £30 per year, () which was matched by Edgeworth. Her husband's barrister friends raised £800 () for the widow and her children. Sidney found a role as housekeeper for <a href="Charles%20Burney%20%28schoolmaster%29">Charles Burney</a>, as well as general manager of his schools in <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a>, <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, and <a href="Greenwich">Greenwich</a>. It was at his Greenwich school that her own children were educated.

Day's widow, Esther, continued paying Sidney's allowance after his death in 1789, and Sidney carried on her work with Burney until she was 68. By this time she was living in a four-storey house in Gloucester Circus, Greenwich, with her own servants. On 8 September 1843, Sidney died at her home of a severe <a href="asthma">asthma</a> attack. She was buried at <a href="Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>.

Sidney asked her friends not to discuss her past as she believed her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sidney's upbringing in her 1804 work "Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin". As Seward publicly identified Sidney in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sidney's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sidney and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sidney disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, and that she had effectively been a slave.

Sidney's education has been compared to George Bernard Shaw's "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>", which may have been inspired by her story. Strong parallels have also been drawn between Sidney's upbringing and two novels of 1871: <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>'s "<a href="Watch%20and%20Ward">Watch and Ward</a>", and <a href="Anthony%20Trollope">Anthony Trollope</a>'s "<a href="Orley%20Farm%20%28novel%29">Orley Farm</a>". The story of her life has been told in <a href="Wendy%20Moore">Wendy Moore</a>'s 2013 book "How to Create the Perfect Wife" and dramatised in the 2015 <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> play "<a href="The%20Imperfect%20Education%20of%20Sabrina%20Sidney">The Imperfect Education of Sabrina Sidney</a>".

The Astronomica ( or ]), also known as the Astronomicon, is a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="didacticism">didactic</a> poem about celestial phenomena, written in <a href="hexameter">hexameter</a>s and divided into five books. The "Astronomica" was penned c. AD 1020 by a Roman poet whose name was likely <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Marcus Manilius</a>; little is known of Manilius, and although there is evidence that the "Astronomica" was probably read by many other Roman writers, no surviving works explicitly quote him.

The earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly intact, the "Astronomica" describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> and <a href="astrology">astrology</a>. The poemwhich seems to have been inspired by <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>'s <a href="Epicurean">Epicurean</a> poem "<a href="De%20rerum%20natura">De rerum natura</a>"espouses a <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a>, <a href="Determinism">deterministic</a> understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the "Astronomica" features a <a href="Lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacuna</a>, which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.

The poem was rediscovered 14161417 by the Italian <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanist</a> and scholar <a href="Poggio%20Bracciolini">Poggio Bracciolini</a>, who had a copy made from which the modern text derives. Upon its discovery, the "Astronomica" was read, commented upon, and edited by a number of scholars. Nevertheless, it failed to become as popular as other classical Latin poems and was neglected for centuries. This started to change during the early 20th century when, between 1903 and 1930, the classicist <a href="A.%20E.%20Housman">A. E. Housman</a> published a critically acclaimed edition of the poem in five books. Housman's work was followed by the Latinist G. P. Goold's lauded English translation in 1977. Today, scholars consider the "Astronomica" to be highly technical, complicated, and occasionally contradictory. At the same time, many have praised Manilius's ability to translate highly technical astronomical concepts and complex mathematical computations into poetry.

Because no contemporary Roman sources mention his name, the exact identity of the "Astronomica"s author is a tantalizing question, but his name was probably <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Marcus Manilius</a>. This uncertainty has led to Marcus Manilius being confused over the years with Manilius Antiochus (fl.c.100BC, mentioned by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> in his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Naturalis Historia</a>"); <a href="Flavius%20Manlius%20Theodorus">Flavius Manlius Theodorus</a> (fl.c.AD376409, a <a href="consul">consul</a> in AD399) and <a href="Boethius">Boëthius</a> (the sixth-century Roman senator and author of "<a href="Consolation%20of%20Philosophy">De consolatione philosophiae</a>", whose full name was Anicius Manlius Severinus Boëthius). Although the poem suggests that the writer was a citizen and resident of Rome, some have contended that Manilius was a non-Roman; according to Katharina Volk, a <a href="Latinist">Latinist</a> who specializes in Manilius, this belief is generally based on either "the poet's supposedly inferior Latinity" or "the wish to see Manilius as the member of a Greek intellectual milieu at Rome". The 19th-century classicist <a href="Christian%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Jacobs">Fridericus Jacobs</a> and the 19th- and 20th-century historian <a href="Paul%20Monceaux">Paul Monceaux</a> have argued that he was an African, based largely on his writing style, which they say resembles that of other African authors. Volk counters this view, arguing that Manilius writes "from ... a conventional Roman perspective" and "takes recourse to Roman history to illustrate the <a href="astrology">astrological</a> facts he discusses".

The work's date has been debated. The only clear reference to an historical event is a reference to the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Teutoburg%20Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a>a decisive loss for Rome, forcing it to withdraw from <a href="Magna%20Germania">Magna Germania</a>in AD9. In considering the poem's date, scholars have proposed three hypotheses: that it was written entirely under <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> (who ruled from 27 BC until AD 14), under the reigns of both Augustus and <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> (who ruled from AD 1437), or entirely under Tiberius. The first conjecture was favored primarily from the <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> until the 19th century, when <a href="Karl%20Lachmann">Karl Lachmann</a> argued that references to the emperor in the poem made more sense if they were referring to Tiberius. At the turn of the 20th century, scholars such as <a href="A.%20E.%20Housman">A. E. Housman</a> began favoring the idea that the first two books were written under Augustus, the last two under Tiberius, and that the third was "undatable". This debate has not been settled, although Volk has argued that the poem should be dated to c. AD 1020.

According to Volk, Manilius's "Astronomica" is the earliest work on astrology that is extensive, comprehensible, and mostly extant. Volk wrote that since he dedicates the poem to stellar phenomena, it is "indicative of the great fascination ... that the stars held for the Romans of Manilius' period".

The "Astronomica", which is written in <a href="hexameters">hexameters</a>, opens with Manilius contending that he is the "first to sing of astrology". He also claims that the god <a href="Mercury%20%28god%29">Mercury</a> engendered his interest in celestial bodies.

In the first book he ponders the origin of the universe, considering theories by <a href="Xenophanes">Xenophanes</a>, <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>, <a href="Leucippus">Leucippus</a>, <a href="Heraclitus">Heraclitus</a>, <a href="Thales">Thales</a>, and <a href="Empedocles">Empedocles</a> before arguing that the universe was created from <a href="Classical%20element%23Greece">the four elements</a> and is governed by a divine spirit. According to Manilius, the universe is composed of two spheres: one—the Earth—is solid and the other—the "sphere of stars", often called the <a href="firmament">firmament</a>— is hollow. The constellations are fixed in the firmament; the Earth is stationary and the firmament revolves around it, explaining the movements of the stars. The planets, the moon, and the Sun also revolve around the Earth in the vast space between its surface and the edge of the firmament. Because the Earth is in the center of the universe, it is equidistant from the firmament and is thus not compelled to "fall" in any specific direction. According to Manilius, the universe is ruled by a god ("conspirat deus") and is governed by reason ("ratione gubernat"). Manilius next discusses the constellations and stars and the <a href="Celestial%20spheres">celestial circles</a>. In this section, the poet spends considerable time contemplating the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> band, which, after exploring several hypotheses as to its existence, he concludes is likely the celestial abode for dead heroes. The first book ends with an exploration of comets, which Manilius sees as harbingers of calamity or great disaster.

According to Volk, books two and three deal mainly with the finer details of the zodiac. Book two opens with a preface in which Manilius presents a brief history of hexameter poetry, singling out <a href="Homer">Homer</a> and Hesiod. His purpose, he argues, is to emphasize the uniqueness of his poem in comparison to others rather than to insert himself into this poetic tradition. According to Manilius, "Every path that leads to <a href="Mount%20Helicon">Helicon</a> has been trodden" ("omnis ad accessus Heliconos semita trita est"; all other topics have been covered) and he must find "untouched meadows and water" ("integra" ... "prata" ... "undamque") for his poetry: astrology. Manilius ends the book's preface by saying "that the divine cosmos is voluntarily revealing itself both to mankind as a whole and to the poet in particular", and that he is set apart from the crowd because his poetic mission has been sanctioned by fate. The poet then begins his explanation of the first astrologically significant circle: the zodiac itself. He first considers the <a href="Astrological%20sign">signs of the zodiac</a> (viz. <a href="Aries%20%28astrology%29">Aries</a>, <a href="Taurus%20%28astrology%29">Taurus</a>, <a href="Gemini%20%28astrology%29">Gemini</a>, <a href="Cancer%20%28astrology%29">Cancer</a>, <a href="Leo%20%28astrology%29">Leo</a>, <a href="Virgo%20%28astrology%29">Virgo</a>, <a href="Libra%20%28astrology%29">Libra</a>, <a href="Scorpio%20%28astrology%29">Scorpio</a>, <a href="Sagittarius%20%28astrology%29">Sagittarius</a>, <a href="Capricorn%20%28astrology%29">Capricorn</a>, <a href="Aquarius%20%28astrology%29">Aquarius</a>, and <a href="Pisces%20%28astrology%29">Pisces</a>), before discussing the aspects and relationships between the signs and other objects. In this section, the poet briefly discusses the zodiac signs, the Olympian gods who serve as their protectors, and the relationship between the <a href="Zodiac%20man">signs and the parts of the human body</a>. The "Astronomica" then considers "<a href="dodecatemoria">dodecatemoria</a>" before he deviates from the zodiac and begins to discuss the <a href="didactic%20method">didactic method</a>. The book concludes with a consideration of the second astrologically significant circle, that of the fixed circle of the observer. The last few lines are dedicated to an overview of the <a href="House%20%28astrology%29">"dodecatropos"</a>.

The third book—which focuses mainly on "determin[ing] the degree of the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> which is rising about the horizon at the moment" of a person's birth—opens with Manilius's reiteration that his work is original. Because his topic is complex and difficult, the poet tells his audience they can "expect truth but not beauty". He then discusses the third astrologically significant circle, the <a href="Arabic%20parts">lots</a>, which are points on a birth chart that carry special significance. Subsequent verses explain how to calculate the <a href="ascendant">ascendant</a>, the <a href="horoscope">horoscope</a>, and chronocrators; and how to determine the projected length of one's life. The third book concludes with a discussion about the tropic signs, which, while not particularly pertinent to the astrological content of the book, allows Manilius to end the book on a "poetic note". Most scholars consider the third book to be highly technical; according to Goold it "is the least poetical of the five, exemplifying for the most part Manilius's skill in rendering numbers and arithmetical calculations in hexameters". A similar but less favorable sentiment is expressed by Green, who writes that in this book, "the disjuncture between instruction and medium is most obviously felt [because] complex mathematical calculations are confined to hexameter and obscured behind poetic periphrasis".

Books four and five are largely about "the effects of particular celestial phenomena on the native". Book four covers many topics that originated in Egypt, leading Goold to write that Manilius based his work on an Egyptian source. Much of the first portion of this book deals with <a href="decans">decans</a> and the "partes damnandae", both of which allow Manilius another chance to convert mathematical and astrological tables into poetic verse. A short description of the rising of individual zodiacal degrees is followed by a more comprehensive survey of zodiacal geography. Near the end of the book, Manilius writes about the ecliptic signs. The book is punctuated at lines 4.387407 and 4.866935 by "exhortation[s] of the frustrated student", where complaints that astrology is difficult and nature is hidden are countered by statements that "the object of study is nothing less than (union with) god" and "the universe (microcosm) wishes to reveal itself to man".

Most of the fifth (and final) book is a discussion of "<a href="Stars%20in%20astrology%23Use">paranatellonta</a>" via the myth of <a href="Andromeda%20%28mythology%29">Andromeda</a> and <a href="Perseus">Perseus</a>. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents; <a href="Cepheus%2C%20King%20of%20Aethiopia">Cepheus</a> and <a href="Cassiopeia%20%28mythology%29">Cassiopeia</a>. Andromeda was chained to a cliff but before the creature could consume her, Perseus (who had just vanquished <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a>) arrived. He instantly fell in love with Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, "is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time; Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monster—strictly, <a href="Cetus">Cetus</a> (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as "belua" (5.544, 608) and "monstrum" (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia". Green says the story is perfect for Manilius; he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360. Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s version of the story and called Manilius's retelling "a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple" ("purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus pannus"). A similar sentiment was expressed by the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> classicist <a href="Arthur%20Woollgar%20Verrall">Arthur Woollgar Verrall</a>, who wrote that while the episode was meant to be a "show piece", it comes across as "a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace". Between lines 5.709–10, there is a large <a href="Lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacuna</a>, meaning that at least some of the work is missing, and then the last few lines of the book concern stars and other stellar phenomena. The book ends with a simile about the ""res publica" of stars". This section—in which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized system, defined by a hierarchy that prevents "cosmic disaster"—seems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.

According to Volk, "The basic tenet of what we might call Manilius' natural philosophy is the idea that the universe is divine". She writes that Manilius is inconsistent about the location of this divinity. For instance, in his first book, Manilius claims the perfectly regular movement of the sun, moon, planets, and stars is proof that the universe is <a href="Teleological%20argument%23Roman%20era">the product of a god</a>; he also says the universe itself is a god ("mundum ... ipsum esse deum"). Later in the same book, Manilius again says the universe is the "work of a great divinity" ("magni ... numinis ordo"). Concerning this vacillation, Volk writes; "It is clear that there is a certain elasticity to Manilius' concept of the divinity of the universe ... Is the world simply ruled by a "diuinum numen" (cf. 1.484) or is it a "deus" (cf 1.485) itself?" Volk answers that in the cosmology of the "Astronomica", "God can be understood as the soul or breath ... present within the world [and] since this divine entity completely pervades the cosmos, it makes equally much sense to call the cosmos itself a god". According to Volk, this interpretation of the universe, which states that it has a sense of intellect and that it operates in an orderly way, thus allows Manilius to contend both that there is an unbroken chain of cause and effect affecting everything within the cosmos and that fate rules all.

Volk points out the poem borrows or alludes to a number of philosophical traditions, including <a href="Hermeticism">Hermeticism</a>, <a href="Platonism">Platonism</a>, and <a href="Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreanism</a> but the prevailing belief of commentators is that Manilius espouses a <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a> worldview in the "Astronomica". A comparison between Manilius's beliefs and those of other Stoics reveals parallels that according to Volk "are immediately obvious". For instance, Stoics and Manilius agree on the divinity of the universe, the argument from design, the assumption that the supreme god is both the creator of the universe and the active force within it, the interconnectedness of everything, the understanding that humans are intimately connected to the cosmos, the importance of considering the heavens, and the belief in an inescapable fate that rules over all. The agreement on this latter point is of special importance because, according to Volk, belief in fate is "one of the most notorious aspects of the Stoic system".

The identification of the poem as Stoic, however, is not unanimous. In 1887, against the common opinion of contemporaneous scholars, <a href="Gustave%20Lanson">Gustave Lanson</a> contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. In 2005, Alexander MacGregor said that while contemporary scholars such as Goold and Volk read Manilius as a Stoic, the "Astronomica" actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places. Manilius exalts <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God, denies the <a href="ekpyrosis">ekpyrosis</a> (a key Stoic belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every <a href="Great%20Year">Great Year</a> followed by a cosmic <a href="Palingenesis">recreation</a>), never discusses the <a href="Paradoxa%20Stoicorum">six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero</a>, and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of Pythagorean tenets; the Pythagorean order of the planets, the importance of geometry and numbers, and the significance of <a href="tetraktys">tetraktys</a> (<a href="triangular%20number">triangular figure</a>s made up of ten points arranged in four rows). In key places, Manilius also makes use of non-Stoics like <a href="Eudoxus%20of%20Cnidus">Eudoxus of Cnidus</a> and Cicero. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an <a href="idealism">idealistic</a> Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.

Many consider the "Astronomica" to be a work of erudition, elegance, and passion. Scaliger and Bentley praised Manilius's handling of numbers in verse, and the <a href="Harvard%20University%20Press">Harvard University Press</a> later echoed this commendation, writing that Manilius "exhibit[s] great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form", and that the poet "writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars". Housman, however, calls Manilius "facile and frivolous" but also describes him as "the one Latin poet who excelled even Ovid in verbal point and smartness". The poem, while metrically correct, has been noted for its technical language and unusual word choices. The classicist <a href="Arthur%20Woollgar%20Verrall">Arthur Woollgar Verrall</a> argues that while "at his best, Manilius may remind us of <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>", the "metre [that he uses] has the regular and monotonous flow of the age". Jacobs, Monceaux, and others have attributed the "Astronomica" idiosyncrasies to Manilius's reported African origin; they argue he wrote and spoke a form of "<a href="Africitas">Africitas</a>"—a putative African dialect of Latin "with strongly marked peculiarities of vocabulary, syntax, sentence-structure, and style"—thus explaining the poem's quirks. Aside from the dubiously hypothesized presence of "Africitas" in the poem, however, <a href="Dorothy%20Brock">M. Dorothy Brock</a> argues there is very little evidence that Manilius was from Africa.

In addition to its stylistic oddities, the "Astronomica" includes some internal inconsistencies. According to Green, the poem is "riddled with confusion and contradiction"; he cites its "presentation of incompatible systems of astrological calculation, information overload, deferral of meaning and contradictory instruction". At the same time, Green notes that similar issues exist in other first-to-third-century astrological works. According to Caroline Stark, Manilius paradoxically claims astrological knowledge may be acquired by individuals and that it is only granted by divine favor. T. Barton says Manilius may have included these contradictions and complexities so he would be regarded as "a figure of unreachable knowledge for the novice student-reader". Green, while not ruling out this hypothesis, says Manilius was probably not motivated by a "desire to carve out for himself a position of power in the new imperial world of experts" as Barton says. Rather, Green says Manilius—due to his "pride in poetic innovation" and his "deference ... to the Emperor"—sought to present "himself as a compliant imperial agent, intent on producing a creative poetic enterprise that plots its own way through the levels of acceptable stellar discourse in the early empire". <a href="David%20Pingree">David Pingree</a> concludes that the poem's "principal purpose seems to have been to delight its audience with poetry and to arouse admiration for the poet by its cleverness".

It is unknown whether the "Astronomica" is a finished work; a large lacuna (i.e. a gap) between lines 5.709 and 5.710 presents a problem with this discussion. According to Housman, based strictly on the contents of the "Astronomica", one cannot cast a full horoscope because necessary information—such as an in-depth survey of the planets and the effects constellations both inside and outside the zodiac produce upon their setting—is missing. According to Volk, the lack of a lengthy consideration of the planets is rather puzzling because Manilius claims several times that he will examine their zodiacal nature. Goold writes that "a didactic poem is seldom an exhaustive treatise" and argues that Manilius likely gave a "perfunctory account of the planets' natures in the great lacuna [and then] considered his obligations duly discharged".

Others have argued the work was originally longer and some hypothesize it comprised eight books. These writers base their assertion on a letter sent in AD 983 by <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20II">Gerbertus Aureliacensis</a> (later Pope SylvesterII) to the Archbishop of Rheims, in which the former reports he had recently located "eight volumes about astrology by Boethius" ("viii volumina Boetii de astrologia") at the abbey at <a href="Bobbio">Bobbio</a>. Boethius was often confused with Manilius because one of the former's names was "Manlius". Those who favor the idea the poem was once longer argue the manuscript at Bobbio was a misattributed eight-book version of the "Astronomica". Goold repudiates this hypothesis, noting the catalogue at Bobbio lists the work Gerbertus was likely referring to as composed of "three books by Boethius about arithmetic, and the rest [i.e. five] about astronomy" ("libros Boetii iii de aritmetica et alterum de astronomia"). This, according to Goold, is evidence Gerbertus found one manuscript that contained both Boethius's "De arithmetica" and Manilius's "Astronomica" rather than an eight-book version of the latter.

Volk, when considering the problem of completeness, proposed several hypotheses: the work is mostly complete but internally inconsistent about which topics it will and will not consider; the lacuna in book five may have originally contained the missing information; the lacuna may be relatively small and the work is unfinished; or entire books may have originally existed but were lost over time through the "hazardous process of textual transmission".

Manilius frequently imitates Lucretius, who wrote the didactic poem "<a href="De%20rerum%20natura">De rerum natura</a>". Some classicists have suggested that Manilius may have sought to emulate Lucretius by writing six books, but evidence for this hypothesis is scarce, and it remains mostly speculative. While Lucretius's work espouses <a href="Epicurean">Epicurean</a>ism (a philosophy that emphasizes <a href="materialism">materialism</a> and <a href="Religious%20skepticism">skepticism of superstition and divine intervention</a>), Manilius's work is largely Stoic, and promotes a Greco-Roman understanding of creationism as well as <a href="fatalism">fatalistic</a> <a href="determinism">determinism</a>. Both Volk and the Lucretian scholar David Butterfield have argued that Manilius is in many ways, an "anti-Lucretius", with the former arguing that "his presentation in the "Astronomica" of an orderly cosmos ruled by fate is a direct attack on the random universe depicted by his predecessor". Manilius sometimes conveys his philosophical stance via <a href="Voice%20%28grammar%29">grammatical voice</a>: unlike Lucretius, who often uses a <a href="passive%20voice">passive</a> construction to convey his understanding of nature, Manilius uses <a href="active%20voice">active</a> grammatical constructions to convey the intentionality he sees in creation (e.g. "God and reason, which rules all things, guide earthly animals by heavenly signs", "deus et ratio quae cuncta gubernat ducit ab aeternis terrena animalia signis"). Furthermore, while Lucretius used "De rerum natura" to present a non-theistic account of creation, Manilius "was a creationist rather than a materialistic evolutionist", and he consequently refers to "one spirit" ("unus spiritus", 2.64), a "divine power" ("divina potentia", 3.90), a "creator" ("auctor", 3.681), and a "god" ("deus", 2.475) throughout his poem.

The "Astronomica" is influenced by Ovid's "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", <a href="Ennius">Ennius</a>'s "<a href="Annales%20%28Ennius%29">Annales</a>", and the Greek didactic poet <a href="Aratus">Aratus</a>. The latter's influence on Manilius is especially noticeable, and it seems likely that Manilius based much of his first book on portions of Aratus's "Phaenomena". Despite his debt to the poet, Manilius diverges from his understanding of the cosmos; Aratus focuses on mythology and "graphic description", whereas Manilius emphasizes the scientific aspects of his work. It is uncertain if Manilius had direct knowledge of Aratus's poem or if he used a translation by <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, Ovid, or <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a>. The latter position is favored by several 21st-century scholars, such as D. Liuzzi and Emma Gee. In regards to the poet's relationship with Germanicus, Wolfgang Hübner writes: "The few echoes of Germanicus' translation of Aratus are insufficient for us to establish which of the two drew on the other, or whether the two were composed independently of each other."

The "Astronomica" directly references Homer (as the "greatest poet", "maximus vates") as well as Hesiod (calling him "nearest to [Homer]", "proximus illi"), and alludes to numerous other Greek poets and writers such as <a href="Apollonius%20Rhodius">Apollonius Rhodius</a>, <a href="Choerilus%20of%20Iasus">Choerilus of Iasus</a>, <a href="Choerilus%20of%20Samos">Choerilus of Samos</a>, and <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>. The poem also contains a direct allusion to Ennius's "Annales", which, according to Goold, is the "Astronomica"s "one solitary notice of Latin literature."

Although there are over thirty existing manuscript copies of the "Astronomica", the text as it is known today is derived from three key manuscripts: "Codex Gemblacensis" (G), "Codex Lipsiensis" (L), and "Codex Matritensis" (M). These in turn belong to two separate manuscript families: "α" (which includes G and L), and "β" (which includes M). Of the two families, Robinson Ellis wrote: "[α] represents a text more correct, but worse <a href="Interpolation%20%28manuscripts%29">interpolated</a>; [β], a text which is fuller of copyists' errors, but less interpolated."

The first family, "α", takes its name from a now-lost source and includes manuscripts G and L. G, dating from the late 10th to the 11th century, was found at the monastery of <a href="Gembloux%20Abbey">Gembloux</a> in <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brabant">Brabant</a>, in modern-day Belgium; L, from the library of <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, was probably written around the mid-11th century and has many corrections made by a scribe. Housman argues that L is the superior of the two, as it was probably copied straight from α, whereas G was probably derived from a copy of a copy.

The second family, "β", takes its name from the now-lost <a href="Archetype%20%28textual%20criticism%29">archetype</a> and includes manuscript M, which itself is a direct descendant of the manuscript that <a href="Poggio%20Bracciolini">Poggio Bracciolini</a> rediscovered (i.e. the aforementioned manuscript β) near <a href="Constance">Constance</a> during a break in the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a> c.141617. M had been transcribed by a German <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a> on Bracciolini's request, but due to the scribe's incompetence the resultant manuscript was riddled with mistakes, prompting Bracciolini to sarcastically remark that the new copy had to be "divined rather than read" ("divinare oportet non legere"). Although poorly written, M has been singled out as possibly the most important surviving manuscript, because it was a direct copy of the archetype (β), whereas G and L are derived from a less "faithful" copy (that is, α) of the archetype.

Following the invention of the printing press, the "<a href="editio%20princeps">editio princeps</a>" of the "Astronomica" was published in <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> around 1473 by the astronomer <a href="Regiomontanus">Regiomontanus</a> from an error-riddled Italian copy. The text was then <a href="textual%20criticism">critically edited</a> by <a href="Joseph%20Justus%20Scaliger">Joseph Justus Scaliger</a>, whose first edition was published in Paris in 1579; a second and improved edition, collated at least partially from the "Codex Gemblacensis", was published in Leiden in 15991600, and a third edition was published in 1655 after Scaliger's death by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Boeckler">Johann Heinrich Boeckler</a>. An updated edition was published by <a href="Richard%20Bentley">Richard Bentley</a> in 1739. Then, in five volumes between 1903 and 1930, Housman published what is considered by many scholars the authoritative edition of the poem (with an additional "editio minor" in 1932). According to Volk, "[Housman's] work is famoussome might say notoriousfor its bold handling of the text, its incisive commentary, and its merciless ... invective against other scholars." In 1977, G. P. Goold published a <a href="Loeb%20Classical%20Library">Loeb</a> English translation, collated both from manuscript M and from photographs of various manuscripts which had once belonged to Housman; this release marked the first time that the poem had been translated into English prose (the first book of the "Astronomica" had previously been translated into English by <a href="Edward%20Sherburne">Edward Sherburne</a> in 1674, and <a href="Thomas%20Creech">Thomas Creech</a> had translated the entire poem into English verse in 1697). Goold's translation (complete with substantial introductory notes and diagrams) was called "masterly" by Volk and Steven Green, both of whom argued that it "marked a significant development in the accessibility of Manilius to a larger audience". Goold later issued a second edition of his translation in 1992, as well as a corrected edition in 1997 that included information from W. S. Watt's article "Maniliana".

While Manilius is not quoted by any extant Roman author, many scholars argue that he is alluded to by a number of authors, including: <a href="Ausonius">Ausonius</a>, <a href="Claudian">Claudian</a>, <a href="Commodian">Commodian</a>, <a href="Dracontius">Dracontius</a>, <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>, <a href="Lucan">Lucan</a>, <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>, <a href="Martianus%20Capella">Martianus Capella</a>, <a href="Nemesianus">Nemesianus</a>, <a href="Orientius">Orientius</a>, <a href="Pseudepigrapha">Pseudo-</a>Empedocles, <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>, <a href="Sidonius%20Apollinaris">Sidonius Apollinaris</a>, <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>, <a href="Titus%20Calpurnius%20Siculus">Titus Calpurnius Siculus</a>, and <a href="Venantius%20Fortunatus">Venantius Fortunatus</a>. With this said, Hübner cautions that such assumptions should be considered carefully (or downright rejected, in the cases of Manetho and Pseudo-Empedocles), as the similarities may be due to a lost ancient epic precursor that Manilius and the others were all alluding to or borrowing from. The work of <a href="Julius%20Firmicus%20Maternus">Julius Firmicus Maternus</a> (who wrote in the time of <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">Constantine</a> about astrology and other subjects) resembles Manilius's work in many ways; for instance, in his "Matheseos libri octo" (composed c.33437), Firmicus follows Manilius's method of instruction closely and analyzes the poet's astrological fundamentals. This suggests that Firmicus almost certainly used Manilius (or someone inspired by him) as a guide. But despite the similarity between Firmicus's work and Manilius's, Firmicus neither mentions Manilius by name nor lists him as among the few Romans (viz. Germanicus, Cicero, and <a href="Marcus%20Cornelius%20Fronto">Fronto</a>) who wrote about astrology.

Volk notes that the earliest references to "Astronomica"aside from literary allusionsmay be found in two Roman funerary inscriptions, both of which bear the line, "We are born to die, and our end hangs from the beginning" ("nascentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet") from the poem's fourth book. This theory is not without its detractors, and scholars such as A. Maranini and Gómez Pallarès have suggested that these two inscriptions are forgeries dating from the Renaissance.

Few copies of the "Astronomica" survived into the medieval period, and consequently Manilius seems to have been little read during this period. However, there are a few exceptions to this dearth of attention. Hübner, for instance, writes that Manilius may have inspired some of the writings of <a href="Columbanus">Columbanus</a>. Additionally, an AD 988 letter from Gerbertus Aureliacensis to the abbey at Bobbio in which a request is made for a work "by M.Manilius (or possibly Manlius) about astrology" ("M.Manilius" ("<a href="%3Awikt%3Avaria%20lectio%23English">v.l.</a> Manlius") "de astrologica") is evidence that a copy of the "Astronomica" was probably kept in the <a href="Bobbio%20Abbey%23Library">library at Bobbio</a>.

Although it was largely ignored during <a href="Ancient%20history">antiquity</a> and the Middle Ages, the poem generated scholarly interest upon its 15th-century rediscovery. The Italian humanist Lorenzo Bonincontri delivered lectures on the "Astronomica" to large audiences and compiled his lecture notes into the work's first commentary. Bonincontri was apparently interested in Manilius's treatment of the nature of comets in the first book of the "Astronomica", and, according to Stephan Heilen, portions of Bonincontri's "De rebus naturalibus et divinis" are based on Manilius's work.

Despite the attention it received after its rediscovery, the "Astronomica" has never been as widely studied as other classical Latin poems. With that said, interest in the poem developed in the second half of the 20th century when scholars began to study Manilius's philosophical and scientific ideas. The first full-length English <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on Manilius and the "Astronomica" was Volk's "Manilius and His Intellectual Background", which was published in 2009. Two years later, Volk and Green edited "Forgotten Stars: Rediscovering Manilius' Astronomica" with essays from scholars worldwide. The book's purpose was to "encourage readers to discover Manilius" and expand scholarly interest in the "Astronomica", since previous research of the work's poetic, scientific, and philosophical themes had been primarily limited to Germany, France, and Italy. And while Manilius and his poem have been analyzed by scholars, many lay readers find the "Astronomica" confusing and overly technical. According to Kristine Louise Haugen, "The ambiguous phrases and extravagant circumlocutions necessitated by Manilius's hexameter verse must often have made the "Astronomica" seem, as it does today, rather like a <a href="trigonometry">trigonometry</a> textbook rendered as a Saturday "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" <a href="crossword%20puzzle">crossword</a>."

Scholars have noted the irony of Manilius's relative obscurity, because he wrote the "Astronomica" in the hope of attaining literary immortality. Housman voiced this sentiment in a dedicatory Latin poem written for the first volume of his edition that contrasted the movement of celestial objects with <a href="Death">mortality</a> and the fate of Manilius's work. He compared the "Astronomica" to a shipwreck ("carmina" ... "naufraga"), arguing that it was incomplete and imperfect, having barely survived textual transmission; Housman mused that because Manilius's ambitions of literary fame and immortality had been almost entirely dashed, his work should serve as an example of why "no man ever ought to trust the gods" ("ne quis forte deis fidere vellet homo").

Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar

The Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar or Pilgrim half dollar was a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> fifty-cent coin struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1920 and 1921 to mark the 300th anniversary (<a href="tercentenary">tercentenary</a>) of the arrival of the <a href="Pilgrim%20Fathers">Pilgrims</a> in North America. It was designed by <a href="Cyrus%20E.%20Dallin">Cyrus E. Dallin</a>.

Massachusetts Congressman <a href="Joseph%20Walsh%20%28Massachusetts%29">Joseph Walsh</a> was involved in joint federal and state efforts to mark the anniversary. He saw a reference to a proposed <a href="Maine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Maine Centennial half dollar</a> and realized that a coin could be issued for the Pilgrim anniversary in support of the observances at <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Plymouth, Massachusetts</a>. The bill moved quickly through the legislative process and became the Act of May 12, 1920 with the signature of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>.

Sculptor <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> criticized some aspects of the design, but the Treasury approved it anyway. After a promising start, sales tailed off, and tens of thousands of coins from each year were returned to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> for melting. <a href="Numismatics">Numismatist</a> <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> has cited the fact that the coins were struck in a second year as the start of a trend to force collectors to buy more than one piece in order to have a complete set.

The <a href="Pilgrim%20Fathers">Pilgrims</a> were <a href="Brownist">Brownist</a> <a href="English%20Dissenters">English Dissenters</a>; they sought a version of the Christian religion without things they deemed nonessential, such as bishops or Christmas. They differed from the <a href="Puritans">Puritans</a>; the Pilgrims were stricter, and instead of seeking to reform the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> from within, sought to <a href="Definitions%20of%20Puritanism%23Separatist%20groups">separate themselves from it</a>. They had left England for the Netherlands because in 1608, King <a href="James%20I%20of%20England">James I</a> began to persecute Separatists. Among those who fled then was <a href="William%20Bradford%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20governor%29">William Bradford</a>.

Things became more difficult for the Separatists in the Netherlands in the late 1610s as the Dutch government moved towards alliance with England. They had few opportunities in the Netherlands as they were limited to manual labor by the <a href="guild">guild</a>s' refusal to accept them, and they feared that their children were straying from their language and religion. Investors led by <a href="Thomas%20Weston%20%28merchant%20adventurer%29">Thomas Weston</a> agreed to finance an expedition to North America, and the ship <a href="Speedwell%20%281577%20ship%29">"Speedwell"</a> was sent to fetch Separatists from the Netherlands, then join the larger "<a href="Mayflower">Mayflower</a>" to form a two-ship expedition. After transporting the Separatists, the "Speedwell" proved unseaworthy for the ocean voyage. The "Mayflower"'s passenger list was formed from some Separatists who had gone to the Netherlands and some who had stayed in England, as well as a scattering of others. Some would-be pioneers had to be left behind because of the problems with the "Speedwell". The "Mayflower" sailed from <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a>, on September 6, 1620, with 102 passengers and a crew of 47.

The expedition sighted <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> on November 9, 1620, and landed at what is now <a href="Provincetown%2C%20Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a>. Two days later, the men signed the <a href="Mayflower%20Compact">"Mayflower" Compact</a>, wherein all agreed to submit themselves to the will of the majority—one of the foundation documents of American democracy. They established a settlement at <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a> (today <a href="Plymouth%2C%20Massachusetts">Plymouth, Massachusetts</a>), but they had expected to land further south and were ill-equipped for a Massachusetts winter. Half died before spring came. There had been few Native Americans in the area, but in 1621, the settlers were approached by a group, including two, <a href="Samoset">Samoset</a> and <a href="Squanto">Squanto</a>, who spoke some English. Squanto taught the Pilgrims indigenous methods for cultivating <a href="corn">corn</a> (maize), a plant native to the New World with which the emigrants were unfamiliar. This knowledge helped the Pilgrims gradually become established. The Pilgrims grew in population relatively slowly over the first generations in America, and became a minority among settlers in the area. In 1691, <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a> became part of the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a>. Bradford's wife had died while the ship was in <a href="Provincetown%20Harbor">Provincetown Harbor</a>; after Governor <a href="John%20Carver%20%28Plymouth%20Colony%20governor%29">John Carver</a> perished during the first winter, Bradford was elected in his place, and served fifteen two-year terms. He guided the colony from the communal economy necessary at first, to privatization, greatly increasing the harvest in the process. His diaries were published as "<a href="Of%20Plymouth%20Plantation">Of Plymouth Plantation</a>" and constitute the major source of information concerning the Pilgrims' daily lives.

In 1920, the government did not sell commemorative coins. Congress, during the <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">early years of commemorative coinage</a>, usually designated a specific organization allowed to buy them at face value and to vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar, the enabling legislation did not name an organization, but it was the Pilgrim Tercentenary Commission; profits from the coin were to go towards financing the observances in honor of the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims' arrival.

Legislation for a Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar was introduced in the House of Representatives by Massachusetts' <a href="Joseph%20Walsh%20%28Massachusetts%29">Joseph Walsh</a> on March 23, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 13227. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, of which Indiana Congressman <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a> was the chairman. That committee held hearings on the bill on March 26, 1920, as well as on the coinage proposal that would become the <a href="Alabama%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Alabama Centennial half dollar</a>, which was the first order of business. Once the committee voted to favorably recommend the Alabama bill, which provided for 100,000 half dollars, it proceeded to consider the Pilgrim proposal. Vestal had two days previously written to <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="David%20F.%20Houston">David F. Houston</a>, and Houston responded that while his department had not opposed the Maine Centennial (previously approved by the committee) or Alabama coinage bills, the Treasury had concerns that issuing large numbers of different designs would aid fraudsters.
Walsh appeared and explained to the committee that Congress had previously authorized a commission to work with state and local authorities in planning for observances which were to be held in December 1920 on the 300th anniversary of the "Mayflower" landing, and were also to occur the following summer. Although events were to be held elsewhere in Massachusetts, and even outside the state, the focus would be on Plymouth, with the beautification of the area around <a href="Plymouth%20Rock">Plymouth Rock</a> a major goal. The commission had recommended the issuance of commemorative stamps, and also a federal appropriation, but it was not until Walsh saw a committee report for the Maine Centennial piece listed on a House document that he came up with the idea of a commemorative coin for the anniversary. This had been done in the past for the <a href="World%20Columbian%20Exposition">World Columbian Exposition</a> of 1893, Walsh recalled, and Ohio's <a href="William%20A.%20Ashbrook">William A. Ashbrook</a> chimed in (incorrectly) that a coin had been issued for the <a href="Jamestown%20Exposition">Jamestown Exposition</a> of 1907. Walsh stated that more were being asked for (500,000) than for the Alabama coin because of the great interest in the celebration; he suggested that to increase regional interest, the coins be struck at all the mints (<a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver</a>, and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco</a>). Ashbrook felt the number to be issued excessive, he suggested 300,000 as more appropriate, and Walsh consented. Missouri's <a href="William%20L.%20Nelson">William L. Nelson</a> moved that the committee approve the amended bill, and this carried. Vestal issued a report on behalf of his committee on March 26, 1920, indicating his committee's support for the bill once amended.
The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were considered in that order by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's <a href="Warren%20Gard">Warren Gard</a> asked a number of questions about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that it was because the coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. Gard followed up this point, asking if it had been a 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative <a href="John%20Franklin%20Miller%20%28representative%29">John Franklin Miller</a> asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman <a href="James%20W.%20Dunbar">James W. Dunbar</a> of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">ordinary half dollars</a> to which Walsh replied, "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.

The following day, April 22, 1920, the House reported its passage of the bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the <a href="Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">Senate Committee on Banking and Currency</a>; on April 28, Connecticut's <a href="George%20P.%20McLean">George P. McLean</a> reported it back with a recommendation it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, rather than awaiting their turns, but Utah Senator <a href="Reed%20Smoot">Reed Smoot</a> objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-<a href="Dumping%20%28pricing%20policy%29">dumping</a> trade bill had just been objected to by <a href="Charles%20S.%20Thomas">Charles S. Thomas</a> of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the bills had not been considered by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Pilgrim bill was enacted with the signature of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> on May 12, 1920.

The Pilgrim Tercentenary Commission made sketches for a design, which were converted to three-dimensional plaster models by <a href="Cyrus%20E.%20Dallin">Cyrus E. Dallin</a>, a Boston sculptor known for his portrayals of Native Americans who had also created works related to the Pilgrims. As the legislation was not approved until May 12, 1920, and the commission hoped to have the coins available for sale as early as possible, Dallin was urged to hurry with his work. The selection of Dallin apparently delighted <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> (CFA) chairman <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles Moore</a>, who wrote to the sculptor in convivial terms.

Dallin finished his models in August 1920 and the commission referred the designs to sculptor member <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>. On examining Dallin's work, Fraser deemed the lettering crude, but in an undated letter to Moore (probably late August) regretted that due to the tight timeline for production, there was no opportunity to make changes. He suggested that the Mint be urged to allow three months in future for CFA consideration. After the commission met on September 3, a letter to that effect was sent to the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the United States Mint</a>, <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Baker">Raymond T. Baker</a>. The letter was ignored, but the Treasury approved the designs.

The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> of the coin features William Bradford. He wears a hat and carries a Bible under his arm. Bradford, noted for piety, is intended to be seen in a moment of meditation. Dallin's plaster models had the words "" on the volume; these, together with Dallin's initials "", were removed. Instead, the initial D was placed under Bradford's elbow, likely impressed upon the <a href="glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hub</a> as an afterthought by a punch normally used to create the <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> D for the Denver Mint. Numismatists Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> deemed Bradford's broad collar near enough to Puritan wear of the day to pass, though they questioned the authenticity of the ruffled <a href="cravat">cravat</a>. Bradford's portrait is in any case an invention; no genuine likeness of him is known. The crudeness of the lettering complained of by Fraser is not apparent due to the relatively small size of the coins.

The reverse depicts the "Mayflower" under full sail. Numismatic writers have focused much attention on the fact that the ship bears a triangular <a href="flying%20jib">flying jib</a>, a type of sail not used at the time of the "Mayflower" voyage. This error was avoided by <a href="Clair%20Aubrey%20Huston">Clair Aubrey Huston</a> in his design for the one-cent stamp issued on December 21, 1920, for the anniversary. The inscriptions and dates that encircle the coin are self-explanatory.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on U. S. coins and medals, deemed the Pilgrim half dollar "a masterpiece in the conservative tradition". He suggested that Dallin's portrait of Bradford was influenced by <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> and his sculpture, <a href="The%20Puritan%20%28Springfield%2C%20Massachusetts%29">"The Puritan"</a>. Vermeule deemed the ship on the reverse a great advance on <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>'s 1892 depiction of the <a href="Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20%28ship%29">"Santa María"</a> on the <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">Columbian half dollar</a>, and felt that Dallin's vessel presaged the ships (at least five) on commemorative coins of the 1930s. "Seen from the stern on the waves, the Pilgrims' ship is impressive."

The <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> coined 200,112 half dollars in October 1920, with the excess above the round number reserved for inspection and testing at the 1921 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. They were shipped to the <a href="FleetBoston%20Financial">National Shawmut Bank</a> of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits to go to the tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was no thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. The <a href="recession%20of%201921">recession of 1921</a> began soon after; sales dropped, and tens of thousands of both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.

Both dates of the Pilgrim half dollar have appreciated in price over the years, with the rarer 1921 leading the way, of which only 20,000 are extant. At the peak of the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 1920 sold for $1.75 and the 1921 for $8; at the peak of the second boom in 1980 the 1920 sold for $275 and the 1921 for $800. The deluxe edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (2015) lists the 1920 at between $85 and $650 and the 1921 at between $170 and $850, each depending on condition. An exceptional specimen of the 1920 sold at auction in 2014 for $7,344.

Coin dealer and numismatic author <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> deemed the Pilgrim coin to be the first time that a commemorative half dollar had been struck over multiple years for the purpose of making numismatists buy multiple coins to keep their collections complete:

History of US science fiction and fantasy magazines to 1950

<a href="Science%20fiction%20magazine">Science fiction</a> and <a href="Fantasy%20fiction%20magazine">fantasy magazines</a> began to be published in the United States in the 1920s. Stories with science fiction themes had been appearing for decades in <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s such as "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>", but there were no magazines that specialized in a single genre until 1915, when <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a>, one of the major pulp publishers, brought out "<a href="Detective%20Story%20Magazine">Detective Story Magazine</a>". The first magazine to focus solely on fantasy and horror was "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", which was launched in 1923, and established itself as the leading <a href="weird%20fiction">weird fiction</a> magazine over the next two decades; writers such as <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>, <a href="Clark%20Ashton%20Smith">Clark Ashton Smith</a> and <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a> became regular contributors. In 1926 "Weird Tales" was joined by "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>; "Amazing" printed only science fiction, and no fantasy. Gernsback included a letter column in "Amazing Stories", and this led to the creation of organized <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fandom</a>, as fans contacted each other using the addresses published with the letters. Gernsback wanted the fiction he printed to be scientifically accurate, and educational, as well as entertaining, but found it difficult to obtain stories that met his goals; he printed "<a href="The%20Moon%20Pool">The Moon Pool</a>" by <a href="A.%20Merritt">Abraham Merritt</a> in 1927, despite it being completely unscientific. Gernsback lost control of "Amazing Stories" in 1929, but quickly started several new magazines. "<a href="Wonder%20Stories">Wonder Stories</a>", one of Gernsback's titles, was edited by <a href="David%20Lasser">David Lasser</a>, who worked to improve the quality of the fiction he received. Another early competitor was "<a href="Astounding%20Stories%20of%20Super-Science">Astounding Stories of Super-Science</a>", which appeared in 1930, edited by <a href="Harry%20Bates%20%28author%29">Harry Bates</a>, but Bates printed only the most basic adventure stories with minimal scientific content, and little of the material from his era is now remembered.

In 1933 "Astounding" was acquired by Street & Smith, and it soon became the leading magazine in the new genre, publishing early classics such as <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s "<a href="Sidewise%20in%20Time">Sidewise in Time</a>" in 1934. A couple of competitors to "Weird Tales" for fantasy and weird fiction appeared, but none lasted, and the 1930s is regarded as "Weird Tales"' heyday. Between 1939 and 1941 there was a boom in science fiction and fantasy magazines: several publishers entered the field, including <a href="Standard%20Magazines">Standard Magazines</a>, with "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>" and "Thrilling Wonder Stories" (a retitling of "Wonder Stories"); <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, with "<a href="Astonishing%20Stories">Astonishing Stories</a>" and "<a href="Super%20Science%20Stories">Super Science Stories</a>;" and <a href="Fiction%20House">Fiction House</a>, with "<a href="Planet%20Stories">Planet Stories</a>", which focused on melodramatic tales of interplanetary adventure. <a href="Ziff%20Davis">Ziff-Davis</a> launched "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>", a fantasy companion to "Amazing." "Astounding" extended its pre-eminence in the field during the boom: the editor, <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>, developed a stable of young writers that included <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, and <a href="A.E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>. The period starting in 1938, when Campbell took control of "Astounding", is often referred to as the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a>. Well-known stories from this era include "<a href="Slan">Slan</a>", by van Vogt, and "<a href="Nightfall%20%28Asimov%20novelette%20and%20novel%29">Nightfall</a>", by Asimov. Campbell also launched "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>", a fantasy companion to "Astounding", in 1939; this was the first serious competitor for "Weird Tales". Although wartime paper shortages forced "Unknown"'s cancellation in 1943, it is now regarded as one of the most influential pulp magazines.

Only eight science fiction and fantasy magazines survived World War II. All were still in pulp magazine format except for "Astounding", which had switched to a <a href="Digest%20size">digest format</a> in 1943. "Astounding" continued to publish popular stories, including "<a href="Vintage%20Season">Vintage Season</a>" by <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C. L. Moore</a>, and "<a href="With%20Folded%20Hands">With Folded Hands</a> ..." by <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>. The quality of the fiction in the other magazines improved over the decade: "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder" in particular published some excellent material and challenged "Astounding" for the leadership of the field. A few more pulps were launched in the late 1940s, but almost all were intended as vehicles to reprint old classics. One exception, "<a href="Out%20of%20This%20World%20Adventures">Out of This World Adventures</a>", was an experiment by <a href="Avon%20%28publisher%29">Avon</a>, combining fiction with some pages of comics. It was a failure and lasted only two issues. Magazines in digest format began to appear towards the end of the decade, including "<a href="Other%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">Other Worlds</a>", edited by <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>. In 1949, the first issue of "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</a>" appeared, followed in October 1950 by the first issue of "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>"; both were digests, and between them soon dominated the field. Very few science fiction or fantasy pulps were launched after this date; the 1950s was the beginning of the era of digest magazines, though the leading pulps continued until the mid-1950s, and authors began selling to mainstream magazines and large book publishers.

By the end of the 19th century, stories with recognizably science fictional content were appearing regularly in American magazines. These magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include non-fiction articles and poetry as well. In October 1896, the <a href="Frank%20Munsey">Frank A. Munsey</a> company's "<a href="Argosy%20%28magazine%29">Argosy</a>" magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year it began using cheap wood-pulp paper. This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> era. For twenty years the pulps were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1915 the influential magazine publisher <a href="Street%20%26amp%3B%20Smith">Street & Smith</a> began to issue titles that focused on a particular niche, such as "<a href="Detective%20Story%20Magazine">Detective Story Magazine</a>" and "<a href="Western%20Story%20Magazine">Western Story Magazine</a>", thus pioneering the specialized and single-genre pulps.

As the pulps proliferated, they continued to carry science fiction (sf), both in the general fiction magazines such as "Argosy" and "<a href="All-Story%20Weekly">All-Story</a>", and in the more specialized titles such as sports, detective fiction, and (especially) the <a href="Pulp%20magazine%23Notable%20original%20characters">hero pulps</a>. Science fiction also appeared outside the world of pulps: <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>, who had begun his career as an editor and publisher in 1908 with a radio hobbyist magazine called "<a href="Modern%20Electrics">Modern Electrics</a>", soon began including articles speculating about future uses of science, such as "Wireless on Saturn", which appeared in the December 1908 issue. The article was written with enough humour to make it clear to his readers that it was simply an imaginative exercise, but in 1911 "Modern Electrics" began serializing "<a href="Ralph%20124C%2041%2B">Ralph 124C 41+</a>", a novel set in the year 2660. In 1913 Gernsback launched another magazine, "<a href="Electrical%20Experimenter">The Electrical Experimenter</a>" (retitled "Science and Invention" in 1920), which frequently ran science fictional tales, written both by Gernsback and others.

In 1919, Street & Smith launched "<a href="The%20Thrill%20Book">The Thrill Book</a>", a magazine for stories that were unusual or unclassifiable in some way, which in most cases meant that they included either fantasy or science fiction elements. "The Thrill Book" ceased publication in October 1919, having lasted sixteen issues; it carried some sf, particularly towards the end of its short run, but is not generally regarded as a science fiction or fantasy pulp. Two years later, Gernsback launched yet another magazine, titled "<a href="Practical%20Electrics">Practical Electrics</a>", and in 1924 he sent a letter to its subscribers suggesting a magazine that would publish only scientific fiction. The response was weak, and Gernsback shelved the project.

The first magazine to be primarily associated with fantasy and science fiction was "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", which appeared in March 1923. It was initially edited by <a href="Edwin%20Baird">Edwin Baird</a> and issued by Rural Publishing, a company owned by Jacob Clark Henneberger and John M. Lansinger. Rural had previously launched the magazine "<a href="Detective%20Tales">Detective Tales</a>". "Weird Tales" was intended to provide a market for fantasy and weird fiction, and Henneberger was keen to obtain material unusual enough that it could not be sold to the existing pulp magazines. The planned monthly schedule soon began to slip, skipping July and December. As early as February 1924, <a href="Farnsworth%20Wright">Farnsworth Wright</a> took over from Baird as interim editor. After the May-June-July 1924 Anniversary Issue was published, Henneberger and Lansinger split the company, each taking one of the magazines. Henneberger kept nominal control of "Weird Tales", while the Cornelius Printing Company, of Indianapolis, to whom Rural owed most of its debt, took over primary ownership. The magazine went on hiatus for five months while Cornelius built a new printing plant. "Weird Tales" resumed publication with the November 1924 issue, with Farnsworth Wright as permanent editor. The magazine quickly began to improve, both in appearance and quality, as Wright nurtured talented fantasy writers such as <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a> and <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>.

Wright frequently published science fiction, including <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>'s first story, which appeared in August 1926, and work by <a href="Joseph%20Schlossel">J. Schlossel</a> and <a href="Otis%20Adelbert%20Kline">Otis Adelbert Kline</a>, as well as weird and occult fiction. The first magazine devoted entirely to science fiction joined "Weird Tales" on the newsstands on 10 March 1926, titled "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>" and dated April. Gernsback had delayed the launch a couple of years after his subscriber survey had shown only limited interest in an sf magazine, but finally decided to take the plunge. He ceased publication of "Practical Electrics" (recently retitled "The Experimenter") but retained the editor, <a href="T.%20O%27Conor%20Sloane">T. O'Conor Sloane</a>, to edit the new magazine, though Gernsback had final say over the fiction content. The first issue of "Amazing" consisted entirely of reprinted material, including <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s novel "<a href="Off%20on%20a%20Comet">Off on a Comet</a>", and stories by <a href="H.G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, but new fiction quickly appeared, with <a href="Clare%20Winger%20Harris">Clare Winger Harris</a> and <a href="A.%20Hyatt%20Verrill">A. Hyatt Verrill</a> each finding success in one of Gernsback's early reader competitions. Both went on to become established writers. Gernsback also introduced a letter column, and encouraged his readers to join in lively discussions there. In the view of <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, a historian of science fiction, this was "the real secret of the success of "Amazing Stories" and is the cause of the popularity of science fiction": the letter column gave science fiction fans, many of whom were lonely, a forum in which to make friends and talk about their interests. The resulting community of like-minded readers gave birth to <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fandom</a>, and also to a generation of writers who had grown up reading the genre.

"Amazing" was very successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 in less than a year. It was some time before significant competition appeared, but two minor fantasy magazines were launched the year after "Amazing"'s first issue. One, "<a href="Tales%20of%20Magic%20and%20Mystery%20%28magazine%29">Tales of Magic and Mystery</a>" appeared in 1927 and lasted only five issues; it specialized in stories about magic, including a series on Houdini. It was a financial failure, and is now remembered mainly for having published "<a href="Cool%20Air">Cool Air</a>", a story by Lovecraft. The other was "<a href="Ghost%20Stories%20%28magazine%29">Ghost Stories</a>", which was launched in mid-1926 by <a href="Bernarr%20Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a>, who also published confessional magazines such as "<a href="True%20Story%20%28magazine%29">True Story</a>". Much of the material in "Ghost Stories" was written in a similar confessional style, featuring tales of encounters with ghosts presented as true events.

In June 1927 Gernsback published "<a href="Amazing%20Stories%20Annual">Amazing Stories Annual</a>", twice the size (and twice the price) of the regular "Amazing Stories". It carried a new Mars novel, "<a href="The%20Master%20Mind%20of%20Mars">The Mastermind of Mars</a>", by <a href="Edgar%20Rice%20Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>, which Burroughs had been unable to sell elsewhere, perhaps because it contained satirical elements aimed at religious fundamentalism. Burroughs' name was a powerful aid to sales, and since Gernsback had secured two stories by <a href="A.%20Merritt">Abraham Merritt</a>, who was also very popular, the magazine sold out all 150,000 copies, despite the high price. This success convinced Gernsback to launch another science fiction title, and the first issue of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories%20Quarterly">Amazing Stories Quarterly</a>" appeared in 1928 with a Spring cover date. In the same year Gernsback printed E.E. Smith's first novel, in "Amazing", titled "<a href="The%20Skylark%20of%20Space">The Skylark of Space</a>". It was enormously successful, and on the strength of Smith's "<a href="Skylark%20%28series%29">Skylark</a>" series of novels, and his later "<a href="Lensman%20series">Lensman</a>" series, Smith became "one of the greatest names, if not the greatest of all" to sf readers of the 1930s.

Gernsback's declared goals for "Amazing" were to educate and to entertain. In the editorial for the first issue he asserted that "Not only do these amazing tales make tremendously interesting reading – they are also always instructive. They supply knowledge that we might not otherwise obtain – and they supply it in a very palatable form. For the best of these modern writers of scientifiction have the knack of imparting knowledge and even inspiration without once making us aware that we are being taught". It was difficult for Gernsback to find high-quality new material that was both entertaining and met his declared goal of providing scientific information, and the early issues of "Amazing" contained a high proportion of reprints. He discovered that his readers preferred the fantastical romances of Burroughs and Merritt to the more scientific stories of Verne and Wells, and perhaps in response published Merritt's "<a href="The%20Moon%20Pool">The Moon Pool</a>" in the May 1927 issue of "Amazing." The story was completely unscientific; Gernsback's introduction to the story claimed that Merritt was introducing a new science, but Ashley comments that Gernsback was simply "looking for an excuse for including such fantastic fiction in the magazine when it did not fit in with his basic creed".

In early 1929 Gernsback went bankrupt, and his magazines were sold to Bergan A. Mackinnon; both "Amazing Stories" and "Amazing Stories Quarterly" continued publication under their new ownership, and Sloane remained as editor. Within two months Gernsback had launched two new magazines, "<a href="Air%20Wonder%20Stories">Air Wonder Stories</a>" and "<a href="Science%20Wonder%20Stories">Science Wonder Stories</a>". Gernsback still believed in the educational value of science fiction, and contrasted his goals for "Air Wonder Stories" with the fiction appearing in aviation pulps such as "<a href="Sky%20Birds%20%28magazine%29">Sky Birds</a>" and "<a href="Flying%20Aces%20%28magazine%29">Flying Aces</a>", which were "purely 'Wild-West'-world war adventure-sky busting" stories, in his words. He planned to fill "Air Wonder" with "flying stories of the future, strictly along scientific-mechanical-technical lines, full of adventure, exploration and achievement". Both "Air Wonder" and "Science Wonder" were edited by <a href="David%20Lasser">David Lasser</a>, who had no prior experience as an editor and who knew little about sf, but whose degree from <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> had convinced Gernsback to take him on. Lasser printed work by some popular authors, including <a href="Fletcher%20Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a>, <a href="Stanton%20A.%20Coblentz">Stanton Coblentz</a>, and <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>, and two of the winners of the contests Gernsback frequently ran subsequently became well known in the field: <a href="Raymond%20A.%20Palmer">Raymond Palmer</a>, later the editor of "Amazing Stories", and <a href="John%20Wyndham">John Wyndham</a>, best known for his 1951 novel "<a href="The%20Day%20of%20the%20Triffids">The Day of the Triffids</a>". The readership of the two magazines overlapped strongly, most readers being science fiction fans rather than aviation fans. With these two titles established, Gernsback added "<a href="Science%20Wonder%20Quarterly">Science Wonder Quarterly</a>" in October 1929, also edited by Lasser. At the same time Gernsback sent a letter to some of the writers he had already bought stories from, asking for "detective or criminal mystery stories with a good "scientific" background", and in January 1930 he launched "<a href="Scientific%20Detective%20Monthly">Scientific Detective Monthly</a>", edited by his deputy, Hector Grey, as a new cross-genre title, giving him four magazines in all.

January 1930 also saw the first issue of "<a href="Astounding%20Stories%20of%20Super-Science">Astounding Stories of Super-Science</a>", which would go on to become the most influential magazine in the field within a decade. The publisher was <a href="William%20Clayton%20%28publisher%29">William Clayton</a>, a successful publisher of pulp titles. In 1928 Harold Hersey, who by then was working for Clayton, had suggested a new science fiction magazine to add to the line-up; Clayton was unconvinced, but changed his mind the following year. "Astounding"'s editor, <a href="Harry%20Bates%20%28author%29">Harry Bates</a>, was uninterested in the educational goals that motivated Gernsback. Bates filled "Astounding" with adventure stories with minimal scientific content: the stories are generally considered to have been poor quality, and Ashley considers Bates to have been "destroying the ideals of science fiction" with formulaic plots. Gernsback's magazines were infamous for low rates and very slow payment, and "Astounding"'s high rates and quick payment attracted some well-known pulp writers such as <a href="Murray%20Leinster">Murray Leinster</a> and <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>. (Asimov later said that in the early industry payment was "not on publication but (the saying went) on lawsuit".) "Astounding" was also better value for money than its competitors, with both the lowest price and, along with "Amazing", the most pages. By mid-1930, Gernsback began to consolidate his magazines, merging "Air Wonder" with "Science Wonder Stories". The combined magazine was titled "Wonder Stories", and "Science Wonder Quarterly" was similarly retitled "Wonder Stories Quarterly". At the same time "Scientific Detective Monthly" was retitled "Amazing Detective Tales." Dropping "Science" and "Scientific" from the titles may have been intended to avoid giving readers the impression that these were actually scientific periodicals. "Amazing Detective Tales", at least, was not helped by the title change, and after the October issue Gernsback sold the magazine to Wallace Bamber, who published five more issues the following year, though there was no longer any sf or fantasy content.

Meanwhile, "Ghost Stories", the Macfadden title launched in 1926, was suffering declining sales. Hersey, who by 1930 had gone into business as an independent publisher, acquired the title from Macfadden, and started another magazine, "<a href="Miracle%20Science%20and%20Fantasy%20Stories">Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories</a>", the following year, with <a href="Elliott%20Dold">Elliott Dold</a> as editor. Neither venture was a success. "Miracle" ceased publication after only two issues when Dold fell ill, though sales were poor in any case, and Hersey was unable to revive "Ghost Stories"' fortunes; it was cancelled at the start of 1932. 1931 also saw "Amazing Stories" change hands once again; this time it was acquired by Macfadden, whose deep pockets helped insulate "Amazing" from the effects of the Depression. Sloane continued as editor.

"Weird Tales" was by now well established, but in 1931 Clayton finally gave it some direct competition with "<a href="Strange%20Tales%20%28pulp%20magazine%29">Strange Tales</a>", which was also edited by Bates. Like its competitor, "Strange Tales" frequently published science fiction as well as fantasy; as with "Astounding" it paid better rates than the competition, and as a result attracted some good writers, including Jack Williamson, whose "Wolves of Darkness", about an invasion by beings from another dimension, is one of its better-remembered stories. "Strange Tales" did not last long: by late 1932, Clayton was in financial difficulties, and "Astounding" switched to a bimonthly schedule. Already bimonthly, "Strange Tales" also reduced its publication frequency. The bulk of Clayton's debts were owed to his printer, which Clayton tried to acquire to prevent it buying out his publishing house, but this proved a disastrous move. He lacked funds to complete the transaction, and was forced to declare bankruptcy. The January 1933 issue of both magazines was intended to be the last, but enough stories remained in inventory to produce one more issue of "Astounding", which appeared in March 1933. Street & Smith acquired "Astounding" and "Strange Tales" from the sale of Clayton's assets, and relaunched "Astounding" in October that year. "Strange Tales" did not reappear; Street & Smith decided to run the stories in "Strange Tales"' inventory in "Astounding" instead.

At "Wonder Stories", David Lasser remained as editor during the early 1930s, though "Wonder Stories Quarterly" had to be cut for budget reasons at the start of 1933. Lasser corresponded with his authors to help improve both their level of scientific literacy, and the quality of their writing; Asimov has described "Wonder Stories" as a "forcing ground", where young writers learned their trade. Lasser was willing to print material that lay outside the usual pulp conventions, such as <a href="Eric%20Temple%20Bell">Eric Temple Bell</a>'s "The Time Stream" and <a href="Festus%20Pragnell">Festus Pragnell</a>'s "The Green Man of Graypec." Sf critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a> gives Lasser credit for making "Wonder Stories" the best science fiction magazine of his day, and critics <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> and <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a> consider it to be the best of Gernsback's forays into the genre. Despite his success, Lasser was let go in mid-1933, perhaps because he was very well-paid, since there is some evidence of a financial crisis in Gernsback's affairs at the time. Lasser was spending more time working on labor rights, and Gernsback may also have felt he was neglecting his editorial duties. Gernsback replaced Lasser with a 17-year-old sf fan, <a href="Charles%20Hornig">Charles Hornig</a>, at less than a third of Lasser's salary.

Street & Smith was a well-established pulp publisher, with an excellent distribution network, and the revived "Astounding" was quickly competitive. It was edited by <a href="F.%20Orlin%20Tremaine">F. Orlin Tremaine</a>, with assistance from Desmond Hall; both had come to Street & Smith from the wreckage of Clayton. Tremaine was an experienced pulp editor, and Street & Smith gave him a budget of one cent per word, which was better than the competing magazines could pay. In December 1933 Tremaine wrote an editorial calling for "thought variant" stories that contained original ideas and did not simply reproduce adventure themes in a science-fiction context. The early stories identified by Tremaine as "thought variants" were not always particularly original, but it soon became apparent that Tremaine was willing to take risks by publishing stories that would have fallen foul of editorial taboos at other magazines. By the end of 1934, "Astounding" was the leading sf magazine; important stories published that year include Murray Leinster's "<a href="Sidewise%20in%20Time">Sidewise in Time</a>", the first genre sf story to use the idea of alternate history; "<a href="The%20Legion%20of%20Space">The Legion of Space</a>", by Jack Williamson; and <a href="Twilight%20%28Campbell%20short%20story%29">"Twilight"</a>, by <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a>, writing as Don A. Stuart. Within a year "Astounding"'s circulation was estimated at 50,000, about twice that of the competition.

The month after Tremaine announced his "thought variant" policy, Hornig launched his own "New Policy" at "Wonder Stories"; as with thought variants, the goal was to emphasize originality and bar stories that merely reworked well-worn ideas. Hornig's rates were lower than "Astounding"'s, and sometimes his writers were paid very late, or not at all; despite these handicaps, Hornig managed to find some good material, including <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Weinbaum">Stanley G. Weinbaum</a>'s "<a href="A%20Martian%20Odyssey">A Martian Odyssey</a>", which appeared in the July 1934 "Wonder" and has been frequently reprinted.

"Amazing Stories", and its sister magazine, "Amazing Stories Quarterly", both of which had been edited by T. O'Conor Sloane since Gernsback lost control of them in 1929, published little of note during the early 1930s, though Sloane did print the first story by several writers later to become well-known, including John W. Campbell, John Wyndham, and <a href="Howard%20Fast">Howard Fast</a>. The "Quarterly" schedule became irregular in 1932, and it finally ceased publication with the Fall 1934 issue. "Weird Tales" had survived a bank failure in 1930 that froze most of the magazine's cash, and was continuing to publish well-received material—mostly fantasy and horror, but still including some science fiction. H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard became regular contributors, and <a href="Margaret%20Brundage">Margaret Brundage</a> monopolized the covers for a while, becoming perhaps the best-known artist to work for the magazine; almost all her covers included a nude figure. <a href="Virgil%20Finlay">Virgil Finlay</a> began contributing interior artwork in the mid-1930s; both Finlay and Brundage were very popular with the readers.

Gernsback experimented with some companion fiction titles in other genres in 1934, but was unsuccessful, and "Wonder Stories"' decline proved irreversible. After a failed attempt to persuade his readers to support a subscription-only model, he gave up and sold the magazine to <a href="Ned%20Pines">Ned Pines</a> of <a href="Standard%20Magazines">Standard Magazines</a> in February 1936. It was retitled "Thrilling Wonder Stories" to fit in with Pines' other titles such as "<a href="Thrilling%20Detective">Thrilling Detective</a>", and given to <a href="Mort%20Weisinger">Mort Weisinger</a> to edit, under the supervision of <a href="Leo%20Margulies">Leo Margulies</a>, Standard's editor-in-chief. The format was left unchanged, but the stories and covers became much more action-oriented. Standard's first issue, dated August 1936, contained stories by several well-known writers, including <a href="Ray%20Cummings">Ray Cummings</a>, <a href="Eando%20Binder">Eando Binder</a>, and Stanley G. Weinbaum, but overall the fiction was unsophisticated compared to what could be found in "Astounding". A comic strip, "Zarnak", was tried, but this only lasted eight issues.

Two more science fiction and fantasy magazines were launched in 1936, but neither lasted beyond the end of the year. Hersey, who had tried the market in 1931 with "Miracle", brought out "<a href="Flash%20Gordon%20Strange%20Adventure%20Magazine">Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine</a>", in an attempt to market pulp magazines to comics fans. <a href="E.%20F.%20Bleiler">Everett Bleiler</a>, a historian of science fiction, describes the stories as "moronic" and "third-rate". Although the magazine was timed to exploit the release of the first <a href="Flash%20Gordon%20%28serial%29">Flash Gordon serial</a>, it was a failure, and only one issue appeared. "<a href="The%20Witch%27s%20Tales">The Witch's Tales</a>", a fantasy and horror pulp with ties to a popular <a href="The%20Witch%27s%20Tale">radio show of the same name</a>, was slightly more successful, with two issues in November and December 1936. Ashley considers the fiction to have been of reasonable quality, and the magazine's failure may have been because Carwood, the publisher, was small and relatively inexperienced, and may have had weak financing and distribution.
At the end of 1937, Street & Smith promoted Tremaine to assistant editorial director, and his place as editor of "Astounding" was taken by John W. Campbell. A few months later Street & Smith let Tremaine go, and gave Campbell a freer hand with the magazine. Campbell immediately changed the title from "Astounding Stories" to "Astounding Science-Fiction"; his editorial policy was targeted at the more mature readers of science fiction, and he felt that ""Astounding Stories"" did not convey the right image. He also asked his cover artists to produce more sober and less sensational artwork than had been the case under Tremaine. His most important change was in the expectations he placed on his writers: he asked them to write stories that felt as though they could have been published as non-sf stories in a magazine of the future. A reader of the future would not need long explanations for the gadgets in their lives, so Campbell asked his writers to find ways of naturally introducing technology to their stories. He also began running regular scientific fact articles, with the goal of stimulating story ideas. Campbell's approach differentiated "Astounding" from rivals; <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a> recalled that "it didn't look like an SF magazine" because covers did not show men with ray guns and women with large breasts.

Meanwhile, Bernarr Macfadden's Teck Publications, the owner of "Amazing Stories", was running into financial difficulties, and in 1938 the magazine was sold to <a href="Ziff-Davis">Ziff-Davis</a>, a Chicago-based publisher. Raymond Palmer, the editor, was a local fan. Under Sloane "Amazing" had been dull; Palmer wanted it to be fun, and soon transformed the magazine, publishing escapist stories. He was unable to make "Amazing" into a real rival to "Astounding", and Ashley speculates that <a href="Bernard%20George%20Davis">Bernard G. Davis</a>, who ran the editorial offices of Ziff-Davis, may have instructed Palmer to focus on entertainment rather than on serious science fiction.

During the 1930s the hero pulps were among the most popular titles on the newsstands; these were magazines focused on the adventures of a single character, such as "<a href="Doc%20Savage%20%28magazine%29">Doc Savage</a>" or "<a href="The%20Shadow%20%28magazine%29">The Shadow</a>". These often had science-fictional plots, but were not primarily science fiction or fantasy magazines. One example that was clearly fantasy was "<a href="Doctor%20Death%20%28magazine%29">Doctor Death</a>", which featured an evil genius who had supernatural powers. It appeared in February 1935 and lasted for only three issues.

As Campbell began to hit his stride as editor of "Astounding", the first boom in science fiction magazine publishing took off, starting with "<a href="Marvel%20Science%20Stories">Marvel Science Stories</a>"' appearance in 1938. This was an attempt by publishers Abraham and <a href="Martin%20Goodman%20%28publisher%29">Martin Goodman</a> to expand their list of titles into science fiction and fantasy. They were known for "<a href="weird%20menace">weird menace</a>" magazines, a genre incorporating "sex and sadism" into story lines that placed women in danger, usually because of a threat that appeared to be supernatural but was ultimately revealed to be the work of a human villain. For "Marvel Science Stories", the Goodmans asked their authors to include more sex in their stories than was usual in the sf field; reader reaction was strongly negative to the spicier stories, but the Goodmans kept the magazine going until early 1941, and eventually revived it in 1950 for a few more issues when another sf magazine boom began. A companion magazine, "<a href="Dynamic%20Science%20Stories">Dynamic Science Stories</a>", appeared in February 1939; it was intended to carry longer stories but only lasted two issues.

Of more importance to the science fiction and fantasy genres were several other magazines that debuted in 1939. The first to appear, from Standard Magazines, were "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>" and "<a href="Strange%20Stories">Strange Stories</a>", launched in January and February respectively as companions to "Thrilling Wonder Stories"; Mort Weisinger edited all three. "Startling" included a lead novel and a "Hall of Fame" reprint section in every issue; the latter was possible because the publisher, Standard Magazines, owned the back catalog of "Wonder Stories". At that time no other sf pulp was including novels; readers approved, and "Startling" quickly became one of the most popular sf magazines. "Strange Stories" was launched as a direct competitor to "Weird Tales", and the first issue featured many of "Weird Tales"' most popular authors, including <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, <a href="August%20Derleth">August Derleth</a>, <a href="Henry%20Kuttner">Henry Kuttner</a> and <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a>. Bloch, Derleth, and Kuttner were all frequent contributors over the magazine's life, but Ashley regards it as a poor imitation of "Weird Tales", fewer of its stories having been anthologized since. At the end of 1938 "Weird Tales"' owner, B. Cornelius, sold his interest in the magazine to William J. Delaney, the publisher of "<a href="Short%20Stories%20%28magazine%29">Short Stories</a>", a general fiction magazine. Delaney's offices were in New York, and "Weird Tales"' editor, Farnsworth Wright, moved there from Chicago. Delaney made several changes to page count and frequency to try to increase circulation, but none were successful. While this took place, another competitor to "Weird Tales" was launched, this time by Street & Smith. The new magazine, titled "<a href="Unknown%20%28magazine%29">Unknown</a>", was a companion to "Astounding" and was also edited by John W. Campbell. Campbell's declared policy for the magazine was to "offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change your entire understanding of the term"; the goal was to bring "the science fiction rationale to fantasy", in Ashley's words. "Unknown"'s first issue was dated March 1939, with <a href="L.%20Ron%20Hubbard">L. Ron Hubbard</a> and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> soon among the most frequent contributors.

Also in March 1939, a new publisher entered the field: <a href="Louis%20Silberkleit">Louis Silberkleit</a>, who had once worked for Gernsback, was the owner of the <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Magazines">Blue Ribbon Magazines</a> imprint; he launched "<a href="Future%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Science%20Fiction%20Stories">Science Fiction</a>", following up with "<a href="Future%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Science%20Fiction%20Stories">Future Fiction</a>" in November that year. Both were edited by Charles Hornig, who had edited "Wonder Stories" for Gernsback. Silberkleit gave Hornig a very limited budget, so he rarely saw submissions from established writers unless they had already been rejected by the better-paying markets. The result was mediocre fiction. Silberkleit was also slow to pay, which was an additional discouragement to authors deciding where to send their work. In May <a href="Ziff%20Davis">Ziff-Davis</a>, the publishers of "Amazing Stories", joined the fray, with "<a href="Fantastic%20Adventures">Fantastic Adventures</a>", also edited by Raymond Palmer. As with "Amazing", Palmer focused on entertainment, rather than trying to break new ground. "Fantastic Adventures" was not positioned as a rival to "Weird Tales" or "Unknown", but focused instead on other-worldly adventures in the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and soon developed a reputation for whimsical fantasy as well.

The original pulp publisher, the <a href="Munsey%20Company">Munsey Company</a>, still had no dedicated science fiction or fantasy magazine by this time, but frequently published stories in "Argosy" and "<a href="All-Story%20Weekly">All-Story</a>" which were clearly within the genre. At the end of 1939 Munsey launched "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" as a vehicle to reprint these older stories. The editor, <a href="Mary%20Gnaedinger">Mary Gnaedinger</a>, choose Merritt's "The Moon Pool" and Ray Cummings' "The Girl in the Golden Atom" for the first issue, dated September/October; both titles were likely to attract readers. Gnaedinger engaged Virgil Finlay to do interior illustrations for the second issue, and the magazine was soon successful enough to switch from bimonthly to monthly publication.

The ninth and last new science fiction or fantasy magazine to appear with a 1939 cover date was "<a href="Planet%20Stories">Planet Stories</a>", its first issue dated December. The publisher was <a href="Fiction%20House">Fiction House</a>, which had been a successful pulp publisher in the 1920s, though the Depression temporarily closed its doors. After a relaunch in 1934 Fiction House specialized in detective and romance magazines, and "Planet" was published by its Love Romances, Inc. imprint. The editor, Malcolm Reiss, targeted younger readers, and focused solely on interplanetary fiction, though initially the stories were so weak that Ashley speculates Reiss was forced to start the magazine without enough time to acquire worthwhile material.

When Campbell took over as editor of "Astounding", he began to attract some of the major writers in the field, including <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a>, L. Ron Hubbard, and Jack Williamson. The launch of "Unknown" strengthened Campbell's dominance of the field; Henry Kuttner, <a href="C.%20L.%20Moore">C.L. Moore</a>, and L. Sprague de Camp contributed to both of Campbell's magazines. As well as developing working relationships with these and other established writers, Campbell discovered and nurtured many new talents. In 1938, he bought <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a>'s first story, "The Faithful"; the following year, he published the first stories of <a href="A.%20E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>, and <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, along with an early story by <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>. All these writers were strongly associated with "Astounding" over the next few years, and the period starting with Campbell's editorship is sometimes called the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Golden Age of Science Fiction</a>.

Heinlein rapidly became one of the most prolific contributors to "Astounding", publishing almost two dozen short stories in the next two years, along with three novels: "<a href="If%20This%20Goes%20On%E2%80%94">If This Goes On—</a>", "<a href="Sixth%20Column">Sixth Column</a>", and "<a href="Methuselah%27s%20Children">Methuselah's Children</a>". In September 1940, van Vogt's first novel, "<a href="Slan">Slan</a>", began serialization; the book was partly inspired by a challenge Campbell laid down to van Vogt that it was impossible to tell a superman story from the point of view of the superman. It proved to be one of the most popular stories Campbell published, and is an example of the way Campbell worked with his writers to feed them ideas and generate the material he wanted to buy. Asimov's "<a href="Robot%20series%20%28Asimov%29">Robot</a>" series began to take shape in 1941, "<a href="Reason%20%28short%20story%29">Reason</a>" and "<a href="Liar%21%20%28short%20story%29">Liar!</a>" appearing in the April and May issues; as with "Slan", these stories were partly inspired by conversations with Campbell. The September 1941 issue included Asimov's short story "<a href="Nightfall%20%28Asimov%20novelette%20and%20novel%29">Nightfall</a>", one of the most lauded sf stories ever written, and in November, "<a href="Second%20Stage%20Lensmen">Second Stage Lensmen</a>", a novel in Smith's "Lensman" series, began serialization. The following year saw the beginning of Asimov's "<a href="Foundation%20series">Foundation</a>" stories, with "Foundation" appearing in May and "Bridle and Saddle" in June. Van Vogt's "Recruiting Station", in the March issue, was the first story in his "Weapon Shop" series, described by John Clute as the most compelling of all van Vogt's work.

Many of the stories from the Golden Age have demonstrated enduring popularity, but in the words of Peter Nicholls and Mike Ashley, "the soaring ideas of Golden Age sf were all too often clad in an impoverished pulp vocabulary aimed at the lowest common denominator of a mass market". Nicholls and Ashley acknowledge that, despite the uneven literary quality of the stories, the era did produce something extraordinary: "the wild and yearning imaginations of a handful of genre writers – who were mostly very young, and conceptually very energetic indeed – laid down entire strata of sf motifs which enriched the field greatly", and they consider that the Golden Age generated "a quantum jump in quality, perhaps the greatest in the history of the genre".

The boom in sf magazine publishing continued into 1940, Standard Magazines adding yet another title to Mort Weisinger's portfolio. This was "<a href="Captain%20Future%20%28magazine%29">Captain Future</a>", a hero pulp with simple space opera plots in which Captain Future and his friends saved the solar system or the entire universe from a villain. Nearly all the lead novels were written by Edmond Hamilton. It appeared quarterly, the first issue dated Winter 1940. Standard's sf titles were unabashedly aimed at young readers, with patronizing gimmicks such as "Sergeant Saturn", who answered readers' letters in all three magazines.

"Captain Future" was followed by "<a href="Astonishing%20Stories">Astonishing Stories</a>" and "<a href="Super%20Science%20Stories">Super Science Stories</a>", two new titles from <a href="Popular%20Publications">Popular Publications</a>, a well-established pulp publisher. Both magazines were bimonthly, "Astonishing"'s first issue dated February 1940, and "Super Science Stories" appearing the following month; and both were edited by nineteen-year-old <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>—he had shown up at Popular's offices looking for editorial work just as they were considering starting a new magazine, and left as the editor of both new titles. Pohl had a very limited budget, but his contacts with other budding sf writers such as <a href="Cyril%20M.%20Kornbluth">Cyril Kornbluth</a> and <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> meant he was able to find surprisingly good material. Popular paid promptly, which was more than could be said for some of the other publishers, and so despite the low rates Pohl soon began to see submissions that had been rejected by Campbell at "Astounding" but not sent anywhere else. As a result, he occasionally printed material by some of the "Astounding" regulars, including "Genus Homo", a collaboration between L. Sprague de Camp and <a href="P.%20Schuyler%20Miller">P. Schuyler Miller</a>, and "<a href="Lost%20Legacy">Lost Legion</a>", by Robert A. Heinlein.

In mid-1940 Louis Silberkleit, who already had two titles on the market ("Science Fiction" and "Future Fiction", both edited by Charles Hornig), added a third, titled "<a href="Science%20Fiction%20Quarterly">Science Fiction Quarterly</a>", with the intention of including a full-length novel in every issue. Silberkleit obtained reprint rights to some of the lead novels from Gernsback's "Science Wonder Quarterly" that had appeared a decade earlier. The new magazine was added to Hornig's responsibilities, but by the end of the year Hornig had moved to California and all three titles were given to <a href="Robert%20A.%20W.%20Lowndes">Robert W. Lowndes</a> to edit. Mid-1940 also saw Munsey launch "<a href="Fantastic%20Novels">Fantastic Novels</a>", a companion to "Famous Fantastic Mysteries"; like "Science Fiction Quarterly" it was planned as a vehicle for novel-length works, though in this case the novels were reprints from Munsey's backlog.

In December 1940 the first issue of "<a href="Comet%20%28magazine%29">Comet</a>" appeared. This saw the return to the field of F. Orlin Tremaine, who had been influential in the mid-1930s when he edited "Astounding". The publisher, H-K Publications, was owned by Harold Hersey, who had previously been involved with several failed magazines—"The Thrill Book", "Ghost Stories", "Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories", and "Flash Gordon Strange Adventures". Tremaine had a relatively high budget for fiction compared to many of the new magazines, but this may have put "Comet" under greater financial pressure, and it only survived for five issues, ceasing publication with the July 1941 issue.

Two more magazines appeared in early 1941, "<a href="Cosmic%20Stories%20and%20Stirring%20Science%20Stories">Stirring Science Stories</a>" and "<a href="Cosmic%20Stories%20and%20Stirring%20Science%20Stories">Cosmic Stories</a>", on alternating months, starting in February. These were published by a father and son operating under the name of Albing Publications; they had almost no capital, but persuaded <a href="Donald%20A.%20Wollheim">Donald Wollheim</a> to edit the magazine for no salary at all, with no budget for fiction. The plan was to start paying contributors once the magazine was profitable. Like Pohl, Wollheim knew several budding writers who were willing to donate stories, and managed to acquire some good fiction, including "Thirteen O'Clock" and "The City in the Sofa", by Kornbluth, which Ashley describes as "enjoyable tongue-in-cheek fantasies". In the event only six issues appeared in 1941 before Albing failed financially, though Wollheim was able to find another publisher for one more issue of "Stirring" in March 1942.

The final magazine to launch during 1941 was titled "Uncanny Stories," published by the Goodman brothers. "Marvel Science Stories" ceased publication in 1941, and "Uncanny" was probably created to use up some remaining stories in its inventory. It was dated the same month as the last issue of "Marvel": April 1941, and contained little worthwhile; Ashley comments that the lead story, "Coming of the Giant Germs" by Ray Cummings, was "one of his most appalling stories".

In early 1940, Farnsworth Wright was replaced as editor of "Weird Tales" by <a href="Dorothy%20McIlwraith">Dorothy McIlwraith</a>, who also edited "Short Stories". McIlwraith had no particular expertise in the horror field and, although she was a competent editor, the Wright era is generally considered to have been "Weird Tales" heyday. With Wright's departure, "Unknown" quickly became the leading magazine in its small field. "Unknown" acquired a stable of regular writers, many of whom were also appearing in "Astounding", and all of whom were comfortable with the rigor that Campbell demanded even of a fantasy plot. Frequent contributors included L. Ron Hubbard, Theodore Sturgeon, and L. Sprague de Camp, who, in collaboration with Fletcher Pratt, contributed three stories about a world where magic operates by logical rules. The stories were later collected as part of Pratt and de Camp's "Incompleat Enchanter" series; John Clute has commented that the title of one of them, "<a href="The%20Mathematics%20of%20Magic">The Mathematics of Magic</a>", is "perfectly expressive of the terms under which magic found easy mention in "Unknown"". Other stories still regarded as classics include "<a href="They%20%28Heinlein%29">They</a>" by Heinlein, "Smoke Ghost" by <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, along with several stories in Leiber's <a href="Fafhrd%20and%20the%20Gray%20Mouser">Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser</a> series, and "Trouble With Water" by <a href="H.%20L.%20Gold">H.L. Gold</a>. "Unknown"'s influence was far-reaching; according to Ashley, the magazine created the modern genre of fantasy, and science fiction scholar Thomas Clareson suggests that by destroying the genre boundaries between sf and fantasy it allowed stories such as Simak's <a href="City%20%28novel%29">City series</a> to be written. Clareson also proposes that "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", two of the most important and successful science fiction and fantasy magazines, were direct descendants of "Unknown".

In 1941 Weisinger left Standard Magazines to work on the early <a href="DC%20Comics">DC</a> <a href="Superman">Superman</a> comics, and <a href="Oscar%20J.%20Friend">Oscar J. Friend</a> took over as editor of "Startling", "Thrilling Wonder", and "Captain Future"; "Strange Stories", which had been Weisinger's idea, was killed off with the January issue. Friend continued the juvenile focus of the three sf magazines, and the covers, often by <a href="Earle%20K.%20Bergey">Earle K. Bergey</a>, reinforced the editorial policy: they frequently included women in implausibly revealing spacesuits or wearing Bergey's trademark "brass brassières". "Captain Future" ceased publication in early 1944, and later that year Friend was replaced as editor by <a href="Sam%20Merwin%20Jr.">Sam Merwin</a> on both "Startling" and "Thrilling". "Planet Stories"' first few issues contained little notable fiction, but it improved throughout the war. <a href="Leigh%20Brackett">Leigh Brackett</a> was a regular contributor of <a href="planetary%20romance">planetary romance</a>s—melodramatic tales of action and adventure on alien planets and in interplanetary space—and her work had a strong influence on other writers, including <a href="Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradley">Marion Zimmer Bradley</a>. Other well-known writers who sold to "Planet" included Simak, Blish, <a href="Fredric%20Brown">Fredric Brown</a>, and Asimov.

At Ziff-Davis, Palmer remained editor of both "Fantastic Adventures" and "Amazing Stories" throughout World War II. Much of the material in both magazines came from a group of Chicago-based writers who published under both their own names and various house pseudonyms; among the most prolific were <a href="William%20P.%20McGivern">William P. McGivern</a>, <a href="David%20Wright%20O%27Brien">David Wright O'Brien</a>, <a href="Don%20Wilcox">Don Wilcox</a>, and <a href="Chester%20S.%20Geier">Chester S. Geier</a>. The fiction was rarely noteworthy; Ashley describes the wartime "Fantastic Adventures" as "concentrat[ing] more on quantity than quality, on brash sensationalism than subtlety", though he also comments that it was the most attractive science fiction or fantasy magazine on newsstands at the time, with covers by <a href="J.%20Allen%20St.%20John">J. Allen St. John</a>, <a href="Harold%20W.%20McCauley">Harold McCauley</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Gibson%20Smith">Robert Gibson Smith</a>. Similarly, the fiction in "Amazing" was of uneven quality, though occasionally Palmer obtained good material, including stories by <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>, and John Wyndham.

Few of the new magazines launched during the boom lasted until the end of the war, which brought paper shortages that forced difficult decisions on the publishers. Not every magazine cancellation was because of the war; the usual vicissitudes of magazine publishing also played a role. In 1941, Silberkleit cancelled "Science Fiction" after 12 issues because of poor sales, merging it with "Future Fiction." Two years later Silberkleit ceased publication of both "Future" and "Science Fiction Quarterly" when he decided to use the limited paper he could acquire for his western and detective titles instead. Both "Science Fiction" and "Future" eventually reappeared in the 1950s. "Fantastic Novels" merged with its stablemate, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries", in 1941, probably because of wartime difficulties, after only five issues. In 1942 "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" was sold by Munsey to Popular, who were already the publishers of "Astonishing Stories" and "Super Science Stories". Mary Gnaedinger continued as editor, but the editorial policy changed to exclude reprints of stories that had appeared in magazine form. Booklength work was still reprinted, including <a href="G.%20K.%20Chesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Was%20Thursday">The Man Who Was Thursday</a>" and <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' "<a href="The%20Island%20of%20Dr.%20Moreau">The Island of Dr. Moreau</a>". In the event, "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" was the only one of Popular's science fiction and fantasy titles to survive the war. Both "Astonishing" and "Super Science Stories" ceased publication in 1943 when Frederik Pohl, the editor of both titles, enlisted in the army; the publisher was having difficulty obtaining enough paper and decided to close the magazines down. The same year, paper shortages forced John Campbell to choose between "Astounding" and "Unknown", which had already gone to a bimonthly schedule; he decided to keep "Astounding" on a monthly schedule, and "Unknown" ceased publication with the October 1943 issue. "Astounding" switched to digest format the following month; this was a leading indicator for the direction the field would take, though it would be over a decade before the rest of the field followed suit.

Asimov said that "The <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">dropping of the atom bomb in 1945</a> made science fiction respectable" to the general public, but only eight US science fiction or fantasy magazines survived World War II: "Astounding Science Fiction", published by Street & Smith; "Weird Tales", from Delaney's Short Stories, Inc.; Standard Magazines' "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder Stories"; Ziff-Davis's "Amazing Stories" and "Fantastic Adventures"; Popular's "Famous Fantastic Mysteries"; and "Planet Stories", published by Love Romances, Inc. All had been forced to quarterly schedules by the war, except "Weird Tales", which was bimonthly, and "Astounding," still the leading sf magazine. Campbell continued to find new writers: <a href="William%20Tenn">William Tenn</a>, <a href="H.%20Beam%20Piper">H. Beam Piper</a>, <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href="John%20Christopher">John Christopher</a> all made their first sales to "Astounding" in the late 1940s, and he published many stories now regarded as classics, including "<a href="Vintage%20Season">Vintage Season</a>" by C.L. Moore, "<a href="With%20Folded%20Hands">With Folded Hands</a> ..." by Jack Williamson, "<a href="Children%20of%20the%20Lens%20%28novel%29">Children of the Lens</a>" by E.E. Smith, and "<a href="The%20Players%20of%20Null-A">The Players of Null-A</a>" by A.E. van Vogt. The pace of invention which had marked the war years for "Astounding" was now slackening, however, and in Ashley's words the magazine was now "resting on its laurels". In 1950, Campbell published an article on <a href="dianetics">dianetics</a> by L. Ron Hubbard; this was a psychological theory that would eventually evolve into <a href="Scientology">Scientology</a>, a new religion. Dianetics was denounced as pseudoscience by the medical profession, but to the dismay of many of "Astounding"'s readers it was not until 1951 that Campbell disavowed it.

Sam Merwin, who had taken over from Oscar Friend at Standard Magazines towards the end of the war, abandoned the juvenile approach that had characterized both "Startling" and "Thrilling"; he asked Bergey to make his covers more realistic, and started to publish more <a href="hard%20science%20fiction">hard science fiction</a>, including work by Murray Leinster, <a href="George%20O.%20Smith">George O. Smith</a>, and Hubbard. He bought <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>'s first sale, "The World Thinker", which appeared in 1945, and published a good deal of material by Ray Bradbury, including several of his <a href="The%20Martian%20Chronicles">Martian Chronicle</a> stories. Some of the highest-profile names from Campbell's stable of "Astounding" writers sold to Merwin, including van Vogt, Heinlein, and Sturgeon, whose "The Sky Was Full of Ships" appeared in 1947 and was much praised by readers. Other notable stories include Fredric Brown's "<a href="What%20Mad%20Universe">What Mad Universe</a>", which appeared in 1948, and Kuttner's "<a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Flame">Valley of the Flame</a>", one of several <a href="science%20fantasy">science fantasy</a> novels he published in "Startling". Writers such as <a href="John%20D.%20MacDonald">John D. MacDonald</a>, <a href="Margaret%20St.%20Clair">Margaret St. Clair</a>, William Tenn, Arthur C. Clarke, James Blish, and <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a> all sold to Merwin, and the net effect was a dramatic improvement in the quality of both magazines, to the point where Ashley suggests that by the late 1940s, "Thrilling Wonder", in particular, was a serious challenger to "Astounding" for the leadership of the field.

"Planet Stories" also improved dramatically by the end of the decade. Several well-known writers, including Blish, Brown, and Knight, published good material in "Planet", but the overall improvement was largely due to the contributions of Bradbury and Leigh Brackett, both of whom set many of their stories on a version of Mars that owed much to the <a href="Barsoom">Barsoom</a> of Edgar Rice Burroughs. Brackett, one of "Planet"'s most prolific contributors, developed her style over the 1940s and eventually became the leading exponent of planetary romances. Her series of stories about Eric John Stark, considered by Ashley to be her best work, began in "Planet" with "Queen of the Martian Catacombs" in the Summer 1949 issue. Bradbury's work for "Planet" included two of his Martian Chronicles stories, and a collaboration with Brackett, "Lorelei of the Red Mist", which appeared in 1946. Tim Forest, a historian of the pulps, considers Bradbury's work to be "Planet"'s "most important contribution to the genre". The covers were generally simple action scenes, featuring a helpless damsel threatened by a bug-eyed monster, but according to Clute "the content was far more sophisticated than the covers".
"Weird Tales" had lost much of its unique flavor with the departure of Farnsworth Wright, but in Ashley's view McIlwraith made the magazine more consistent: "though the issues edited by McIlwraith "seldom attain[ed] Wright's highpoints, they also omitted the lows". McIlwraith continued to publish some of "Weird Tales" most popular authors, such as Fredric Brown and Fritz Leiber, but eliminated <a href="sword%20and%20sorcery">sword and sorcery</a> fiction, which Robert E. Howard had popularized under Wright with his stories of <a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian">Conan</a>, <a href="Solomon%20Kane">Solomon Kane</a> and <a href="Bran%20Mak%20Morn">Bran Mak Morn</a>. August Derleth, who had corresponded with Lovecraft until the latter's death in 1937, continued to send Lovecraft manuscripts to McIlwraith during the 1940s, and at the end of the decade decided to issue a magazine to publicize <a href="Arkham%20House">Arkham House</a>, a publishing venture he had begun in 1939 that reprinted largely from the pages of "Weird Tales". The title was "<a href="The%20Arkham%20Sampler">The Arkham Sampler</a>"; Derleth intended it to be a more literary magazine than the current crop of sf and fantasy pulps. It published both new and reprint material. Some of the stories were of good quality, including work by Robert Bloch and <a href="Edward%20Plunkett%2C%2018th%20Baron%20of%20Dunsany">Lord Dunsany</a>, but it closed down after eight quarterly issues for financial reasons.

At Ziff-Davis, "Fantastic Adventures" continued as it had during the war, with an occasional noteworthy story such as "Largo", by Theodore Sturgeon, and "I'll Dream of You" by <a href="Charles%20F.%20Myers">Charles F. Myers</a>. Both "Fantastic Adventures" and its sister magazine, "Amazing Stories", were able to return to monthly publication by late 1947 because of the "Shaver Mystery", a series of stories by <a href="Richard%20Sharpe%20Shaver">Richard Shaver</a>. In the March 1945 issue of "Amazing" Palmer published a story by Shaver called "I Remember Lemuria". The story, about prehistoric civilizations, was presented by Palmer as a mixture of truth and fiction, and the result was a dramatic boost to Amazing's circulation. Palmer ran a new Shaver story in every issue, culminating in a special issue in June 1947 devoted entirely to the Shaver Mystery. "Amazing" soon drew ridicule for these stories and William Ziff ordered Palmer to limit the amount of Shaver-related material in the magazine; Palmer complied, but his interest (and possibly belief) in this sort of material was now significant, and he soon began planning to leave Ziff-Davis. In 1947 he formed Clark Publications, launching <a href="Fate%20%28magazine%29">"Fate"</a> the following year, and in 1949 he resigned from Ziff-Davis to edit that and other magazines.

In March 1948, "Fantastic Novels" reappeared; it had been published by Munsey as a reprint companion to "Famous Fantastic Mysteries", now owned by Popular, and it took on the same role in its new incarnation. Gnaedinger, the editor, was a fan of Abraham Merritt's work, and the first three issues of the new version included stories by Merritt. Reprints of old classics such as <a href="George%20Allan%20England">George Allan England</a>'s "The Flying Legion" and <a href="Garrett%20P.%20Serviss">Garrett P. Serviss</a>'s "The Second Deluge" constituted most of "Fantastic Novels"' contents, with some more recent material such as "<a href="Earth%27s%20Last%20Citadel">Earth's Last Citadel</a>", by Kuttner and Moore, which had only previously appeared as a serial in "Argosy" in 1943.

Mainstream magazines began publishing science fiction after the war. Heinlein amazed fans and fellow writers when, Asimov recalled in 1969, "<a href="The%20Green%20Hills%20of%20Earth">an undiluted science fiction story of his</a>" appeared in "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>". Small science fiction magazines often lost experienced authors to mass-market publications like "<a href="Playboy%20%28magazine%29">Playboy</a>" so did not benefit, Asimov said, "from the field's new-won respectability".

Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected magazine publishers, shut down all their pulps in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, largely as a result of the success of <a href="Paperback">pocketbooks</a>, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their <a href="Slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick</a> magazines. The only survivor of Street & Smith's pulp titles was the digest-format "Astounding Science Fiction". By the end of 1955, "Fantastic Adventures", "Famous Fantastic Mysteries", "Thrilling Wonder", "Startling Stories", "Planet Stories", "Weird Tales", and "Fantastic Story Quarterly" had all ceased publication. Despite the pulps' decline, a few new magazines did appear in pulp format at the end of the 1940s, though these were all short-lived, and several of them focused on reprints rather than new material.

One of the first new post-war titles was "<a href="Fantasy%20Book%20%28magazine%29">Fantasy Book</a>", which appeared in 1947. It was the work of William Crawford, a specialty publisher, and varied between pulp and digest sizes. Crawford ran into problems with distribution and production, and the magazine was never regular, but he produced eight issues over the next four years that included some worthwhile material, most notably <a href="Cordwainer%20Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a>'s first story, "<a href="Scanners%20Live%20in%20Vain">Scanners Live in Vain</a>", in the January 1950 issue.

Popular had added "Fantastic Novels" as a companion to "Famous Fantastic Mysteries" in 1948; the following year it launched "<a href="A.%20Merritt%27s%20Fantasy%20Magazine">A. Merritt's Fantasy Magazine</a>", in an attempt to cash in on Merritt's popularity, and "<a href="Captain%20Zero%20%28magazine%29">Captain Zero</a>", a science-fictional hero pulp. Both were failures, lasting only five and three issues, respectively. Standard's "Startling Stories" and "Thrilling Wonder", both well-regarded by the end of the decade, were joined in 1950 by two reprint magazines. One was "<a href="Fantastic%20Story%20Quarterly">Fantastic Story Quarterly</a>", which was intended to carry reprints that were too long to run in "Startling"'s "Hall of Fame" department. This was initially a financial success, and Standard decided to add another title, "Wonder Story Annual". Both titles survived into the mid-1950s. Two exceptions to the reprint rule were "Future Science Fiction", which Silberkleit brought back as a bimonthly pulp in May 1950, still edited by Lowndes, and "<a href="Out%20of%20This%20World%20Adventures">Out of This World Adventures</a>", also in pulp format, which combined science fiction material with a few pages of comics. The publisher, <a href="Avon%20%28publisher%29">Avon</a>, also launched a romance magazine and a western magazine with the same format, but the experiment was a failure and "Out of This World Adventures" only lasted for two issues, dated July and December 1950. At the end of 1950 "Marvel Science Stories" reappeared as the Goodman brothers saw a new boom in sf magazines getting under way; it began as a pulp, but changed to a digest the following year. The fiction was of higher quality than in the first incarnation of the magazine, but it lasted less than two years.

Although "Astounding" had been in digest format since 1943, few new digest magazines had been launched since then. One of the first into the fray was <a href="Other%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">"Other Worlds"</a>, Raymond Palmer's first new sf magazine since he had left Ziff-Davis. It appeared in November 1949, and was bimonthly for the first year. Palmer acquired stories by Ray Bradbury, A.E. van Vogt, and <a href="Raymond%20F.%20Jones">Raymond F. Jones</a>, but the overall quality was not high; Ashley characterizes the magazine as "good, but not quite good enough". <a href="Howard%20Browne">Howard Browne</a> took over from Palmer as editor of "Amazing" and "Fantastic Adventures", and made strides in improving the quality of both magazines, though much of his impact only became visible after 1950.

In December 1949, <a href="Lawrence%20Spivak">Lawrence Spivak</a>, the editor of <a href="Ellery%20Queen%27s%20Mystery%20Magazine">Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</a>, launched "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy</a>" as a fantasy companion, in digest format. The editors were <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>, a well-regarded mystery writer who wrote some science fiction, and <a href="J.%20Francis%20McComas">J. Francis McComas</a>. It was retitled "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction" with the following issue, and four more quarterly issues appeared in 1950. The contents were of the same standard as the fiction that appeared in slick magazines of the day, and it was soon successful. In October 1950 the first issue of "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>" appeared, edited by H.L. Gold, also in digest format; it too did well, and in the 1950s both magazines became very highly regarded, supplanting "Astounding" as the leading science fiction magazines.

Three more magazines began publication in 1950, all in digest format. The first was "<a href="Fantasy%20Fiction%20%281950%20magazine%29">Fantasy Fiction</a>", which produced two issues. It included some respectable reprinted material from 1930s issues of "Argosy", but none of the new stories were memorable. In October 1950, Raymond Palmer, who had left Ziff-Davis to become a publisher in his own right, launched "Imagination". A serious accident in the summer forced him to turn most of the editing work over to <a href="Bea%20Mahaffey">Bea Mahaffey</a>, and after two issues he sold the magazine to <a href="William%20Hamling%20%28publisher%29">William Hamling</a>, who kept it going until 1958. The final magazine of the decade was "<a href="Worlds%20Beyond%20%28magazine%29">Worlds Beyond</a>", edited by Damon Knight, which appeared in December 1950, and lasted for three monthly issues; the publisher, Hillman Periodicals, decided to scrap the magazine only days after the first issue went on sale. All three issues featured quality work, and many of the stories have been reprinted frequently; Willam Tenn's "Null-P" and C.M. Kornbluth's "The Mindworm" being perhaps the best-known. Knight included material by non-genre writers such as <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a> and <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, along with genre names such as <a href="Katherine%20MacLean">Katherine MacLean</a> and Lester del Rey. Ashley suggests that had Knight been allowed to continue, the magazine would have been a significant contribution to 1950s science fiction.

<a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday</a>, <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>, and other large, mainstream companies began publishing science fiction books around 1950. They issued <a href="fixup">fixup</a>s and collections of magazine fiction, but also original stories; authors no longer only had magazines as buyers.

Amazing Stories Quarterly

Amazing Stories Quarterly was a U.S. <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> that was published between 1928 and 1934. It was launched by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a> as a companion to his "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", the first <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, which had begun publishing in April 1926. "Amazing Stories" had been successful enough for Gernsback to try a single issue of an "Amazing Stories Annual" in 1927, which had sold well, and he decided to follow it up with a quarterly magazine. The first issue of "Amazing Stories Quarterly" was dated Winter 1928 and carried a reprint of the 1899 version of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>' "<a href="When%20The%20Sleeper%20Wakes">When the Sleeper Wakes</a>". Gernsback's policy of running a novel in each issue was popular with his readership, though the choice of Wells' novel was less so. Over the next five issues, only one more reprint appeared: Gernsback's own novel "<a href="Ralph%20124C%2041%2B">Ralph 124C 41+</a>", in the Winter 1929 issue. Gernsback went bankrupt in early 1929, and lost control of both "Amazing Stories" and "Amazing Stories Quarterly"; his assistant, <a href="T.%20O%27Conor%20Sloane">T. O'Conor Sloane</a>, took over as editor. The magazine began to run into financial difficulties in 1932, and the schedule became irregular; the last issue was dated Fall 1934.

Authors whose work appeared in "Amazing Stories Quarterly" include <a href="Stanton%20A.%20Coblentz">Stanton A. Coblentz</a>, <a href="Miles%20J.%20Breuer">Miles J. Breuer</a>, <a href="Alpheus%20Hyatt%20Verrill">A. Hyatt Verrill</a>, and <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>. Critical opinions differ on the quality of the fiction Gernsback and Sloane printed: <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a> regards several of the novels as being important early science fiction, but <a href="E.%20F.%20Bleiler">Everett Bleiler</a> comments that few of the stories were of acceptable quality. Milton Wolf and <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> are more positive in their assessment; they consider the work Sloane published in the early 1930s to be some of the best in the new genre.

Although science fiction (sf) had been published before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", a U.S. <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> published by <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>. The new magazine was successful, and in 1927 Gernsback brought out a double-sized "Amazing Stories Annual", which also sold well. These successes convinced him to start a companion magazine to "Amazing Stories", titled "Amazing Stories Quarterly". The first issue, dated Winter 1928, appeared on newsstands on January 5 that year.

Gernsback went bankrupt in early 1929, and lost control of both "Amazing Stories" and "Amazing Stories Quarterly". After a short period in receivership, they were acquired by Bergan Mackinnon, who sold them on to <a href="Bernarr%20Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a>'s Teck Publications. <a href="T.%20O%27Conor%20Sloane">T. O'Conor Sloane</a>, who had worked on both magazines for Gernsback, took over as editor. In 1932 the magazine, which was probably never very profitable, began to suffer from financial problems, and the quarterly schedule became irregular after the Winter 1932 issue. The last two issues were filled completely with reprints from early issues and from "Amazing Stories". The last issue was dated Fall 1934, though the decision to discontinue the magazine was not taken until some time later, as an editorial comment in the May 1935 issue of "Amazing Stories" mentioned that further issues might still appear.

The first issue of "Amazing Stories Quarterly" contained a reprint of <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>' novel "When the Sleeper Wakes", though for some reason Wells did not provide Gernsback with the revised text published in 1910 under the title "<a href="The%20Sleeper%20Awakes">The Sleeper Awakes</a>"; the text printed was that of the original 1899 edition. The other material in the issue was original, and the following issues included material by <a href="Edmond%20Hamilton">Edmond Hamilton</a>, <a href="Stanton%20A.%20Coblentz">Stanton A. Coblentz</a>, <a href="Roman%20Frederick%20Starzl">R.F. Starzl</a>, <a href="David%20H.%20Keller">David H. Keller</a>, <a href="S.%20P.%20Meek">S.P. Meek</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Schlossel">J. Schlossel</a>, and <a href="Clare%20Winger%20Harris">Clare Winger Harris</a>, one of the earliest women writers of sf. Although readers' reactions to the Wells novel were negative, they approved of Gernsback's policy of publishing a novel in each issue. The only other reprint in the early days of the magazine was Gernsback's own novel "<a href="Ralph%20124C%2041%2B">Ralph 124C 41+</a>", which appeared in the Winter 1929 issue. The novel, set in the year 2660, was little more than a series of predictions about the future tied together by a minor plot. Gernsback included a letter column, and began a competition for the best editorials submitted by readers; the first prize was awarded to <a href="Jack%20Williamson">Jack Williamson</a>, later to become a successful science fiction writer but at that time just starting his career. Gernsback also started other departments to engage the readers, including book reviews, science quizzes, and science news. The last issue under Gernsback's control was dated Spring 1929; under Sloane's editorship, most of these nonfiction departments ceased.

According to Milton Wolf and <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, historians of science fiction, over the next two years Sloane published some of the best sf of the early years of the field in "Amazing Stories Quarterly". Wolf and Ashley cite "Paradox", by <a href="Charles%20Cloukey">Charles Cloukey</a>, an early time-travel story; "<a href="The%20Bridge%20of%20Light">The Bridge of Light</a>", by <a href="Alpheus%20Hyatt%20Verrill">A. Hyatt Verrill</a>, a novel about a lost civilization in South America; "The Birth of a New Republic", by <a href="Miles%20J.%20Breuer">Miles J. Breuer</a> and Jack Williamson, in which a man of the 24th century reminisces about a revolt by the inhabitants of the Moon against the Earth; "Paradise and Iron", by Breuer; and "White Lily", by <a href="Eric%20Temple%20Bell">Eric Temple Bell</a>, under the pseudonym John Taine, about a form of crystal life that endangers the planet. After 1931, according to Wolf and Ashley, the fiction in "Amazing Stories Quarterly" became less entertaining. <a href="E.%20F.%20Bleiler">Everett Bleiler</a>, the author of a detailed review of the first ten years of science fiction magazines, is less complimentary, describing <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell, Jr.</a>'s <a href="Space%20opera">space operas</a>, which appeared from 1930 to 1932, as "turgid", and commenting that only a dozen or so of the stories in the magazine's entire run "might have been considered worth reading if one could put oneself back in the 1930s, accepting the standards of the time". Bleiler mentions three authors, Coblentz, Taine, and Breuer, as having produced notably original material, but adds that their work was "not strong enough for mainstream fiction" and had "too little action and too much sophistication for pulp". Bleiler does however agree with Wolf and Ashley that the magazine's quality declined over time. <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a>, in the "<a href="The%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Science%20Fiction">Science Fiction Encyclopedia</a>", also highlights Coblentz, Taine and Breuer, along with Williamson and Verrill, among the magazine's contributors; Stableford regards their contributions as being among "the most important early pulp sf novels".

"Amazing Stories Quarterly" was published by Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing until Spring 1929. A single issue appeared from Irving Trust, the trustee in Gernsback's bankruptcy; then four issues, from Fall 1929 to Summer 1930, again under the Experimenter Publishing imprint, and then four more from Radio-Science Publications. The last ten issues, from Fall 1931 to Fall 1934, were published by Teck Publishing, of <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> and <a href="Dunellen%2C%20New%20Jersey">Dunellen</a>. The magazine was in large pulp format throughout, and was 144 pages long, except for the last two issues, which were 128 pages. It was priced at 50 cents. The first six issues were edited by Gernsback; from the Summer 1929 issue on, the editor was Sloane. There was a Canadian reprint of the final issue, Fall 1934.

Another 27 issues of "Amazing Stories Quarterly" appeared from Ziff-Davis from 1940 to 1943, and also from 1949 to 1951, but these were not original magazines, only rebound issues of "Amazing Stories".

Prince Romerson

Prince Romerson ( – March 30, 1872) was a <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> soldier of <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiian</a> descent. One of the "Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War", he was among a group of more than one hundred documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants who fought in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> while the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> was still an independent nation.

Living in the American Northeast before the war, Romerson enlisted in the <a href="Union%20Navy">Union Navy</a> in 1863 as part of the <a href="Atlantic%20Blockading%20Squadron">Blockading Squadrons</a> responsible for maintaining the <a href="Union%20blockade">blockade</a> of the ports of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. After being discharged from naval service, he reenlisted in the Union Army under the <a href="5th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Colored%20Volunteer%20Cavalry">5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">United States Colored (USCC) regiment</a>, and was promoted to the rank of <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> on June1, 1864. Romerson fought with the 5thUSCC until the end of the war. Illness prevented him from continuing with his regiment's reassignment to <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Texas">Clarksville, Texas</a>, and he was mustered out in 1865. After the war, like many former USCT veterans, he remained in the army on the frontier as part of the <a href="Buffalo%20Soldier">Buffalo Soldier</a>s. He died in 1872.

Romerson's military career shows the diverse attitudes of officers to the Native Hawaiians and people of color who served on segregated units during and shortly after the Civil War. In 2010, the Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War were commemorated with a bronze plaque erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>.

After the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, King <a href="Kamehameha%20IV">Kamehameha IV</a> declared the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>'s neutrality on August26, 1861. Despite this stance of neutrality, many <a href="Native%20Hawaiian">Native Hawaiian</a>s and Hawaii-born Americans (mainly descendants of American missionaries) abroad and in the islands acted independently and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. Native Hawaiian participation in American wars was not unheard of; Native Hawaiians had served in the United States Navy and Army since the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, and even more fought during the American Civil War. There were varying reasons for joining the war. Hawaiians abroad often sought economic gains and adventures through their enlistment. These included the unemployed sailors on whaling ships who joined the Union Navy and sailors on whaling ships captured by the Confederate Navy who served on the <a href="CSS%20Shenandoah">CSS "Shenandoah"</a>. There was also an ideological sympathy for the cause of the war. Many Hawaiians sympathized with the Union because of Hawaii's ties to <a href="New%20England">New England</a> through missionaries and the whaling industry, and the opposition of many people in the islands to <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>.

Prince Romerson was born around 1840, but little is known about his life before the war. There is no indication that his first name denotes any royal status, and his surname was often listed as "Robinson". Different versions of his enlistment records noted his birthplace as "Owyhee, Sandwich Island" (the <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">island of Hawaii</a>), or "<a href="India">India</a>". There is also disagreement over his ethnicity. Some Filipino historians have claimed him as one of their own, and he is included in lists of Filipino American Civil War combatants.
Romerson worked as a barber before his enlistment in 1863. It is thought that he came to the United States as a sailor aboard a merchant or whaling ship in the Pacific; Hawaiian sailors were highly regarded in the 18th- and 19th-century maritime industry and sought out as crew members. Regardless, it is known that Romerson was living in New York prior to joining the Navy. Probably helped by his experience at sea, he enlisted on January22, 1863, as a <a href="Landsman%20%28rank%29">landsman</a> in the <a href="Union%20Navy">Union Navy</a>. He served on and as part of the <a href="Atlantic%20Blockading%20Squadron">Blockading Squadrons</a>, responsible for maintaining the <a href="Union%20blockade">blockade</a> of the ports of the Confederate States.

After serving in the Navy for a year, Romerson joined as a private in CompanyM of the <a href="5th%20Regiment%20Massachusetts%20Colored%20Volunteer%20Cavalry">5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry</a>. Led by Lieutenant Cornelius Kaler, Company M was the last be mustered in on May 5, 1865. Like most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war, Romerson was assigned to the <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">colored regiments</a> probably because of his dark skin color and the military's segregation policy. Romerson is one of the few Hawaiian soldiers of the Civil War whose real name is known; many combatants served under anglicized pseudonyms ("nome de guerre") because they were easier for English-speaking Americans to pronounce than <a href="Hawaiian%20language">Hawaiian</a> names. They were often registered as "<a href="Kanaka%20%28Pacific%20Island%20worker%29">kanakas</a>", the 19th-century term for Hawaiians and <a href="Pacific%20Islander">Pacific Islander</a>s, with the "<a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Sandwich Islands</a>" (i.e. Hawaii) noted as their place of origin. Serving in the same regiment was another Hawaiian soldier named Charles Heatley.
Historian <a href="Ruthanne%20Lum%20McCunn">Ruthanne Lum McCunn</a> noted, "The military records of Hawaii-born Prince Romerson reveal both his service the US and the diverse attitudes of officers toward people of color." Romerson was quickly promoted to <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a> on June 1, 1864, possibly because he was literate. Romerson fought with his regiment at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Petersburg">Second Battle of Petersburg</a> and took part in the Richmond–Petersburg Campaign, better-known as the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>. He also served as a guard for the Union prison camp for Confederates at <a href="Point%20Lookout%20State%20Park">Camp Lookout, Maryland</a>. Between the Union victory at <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox</a> and the 5th Regiment's reassignment to <a href="Clarksville%2C%20Texas">Clarksville, Texas</a>, Romerson fell ill and was sent to the Corps d'Afrique USA General Hospital in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> on July8, 1865. Never recovering sufficiently to rejoin his regiment, he was transferred to DeCamp USA General Hospital, <a href="Davids%27%20Island%20%28New%20York%29">David's Island</a>, New York, before being mustered out on October9, 1865.

In the post-war period, Romerson sought to rejoin the military, and in 1867 he enlisted in the 39th United States Infantry Regiment at the reduced rank of private. The 39th later consolidated with the 40th to create the <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">25th United States Infantry Regiment</a>. A racially segregated unit of the United States Army, its personnel were dubbed "<a href="Buffalo%20Soldier">Buffalo Soldier</a>s" and included many Civil War veterans from colored regiments such as the 5thUSCC. Romerson served in the 25th for a full three-year term fighting in the <a href="American%20Indian%20Wars">American Indian Wars</a> along the Texas frontier. He died on March30, 1872, possibly at <a href="Fort%20Griffin">Fort Griffin</a>, where he was initially buried. On May11, 1872, he was re-interred at the <a href="San%20Antonio%20National%20Cemetery">San Antonio National Cemetery</a>.

Prince Romerson's service in the war illustrated one of the many examples of Hawaiian recruits assigned to segregated regiments and the diverse attitude towards them. McCunn noted, "Indisputable is his commitment to honorable service." After the war, the military service of Hawaiians, including Prince Romerson and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective memories of the American Civil War and the history of Hawaii. In recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember "our boys from Hawaii". Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history has inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war. On August26, 2010, on the anniversary of the signing of the Hawaiian Neutrality Proclamation, a bronze plaque was erected along the memorial pathway at the <a href="National%20Memorial%20Cemetery%20of%20the%20Pacific">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</a> in Honolulu recognizing these Hawaiʻi Sons of the Civil War, the more than one hundred documented Hawaiians who served during the American Civil War for both the Union and the Confederacy.
As of 2014, researchers have identified 119 documented Native Hawaiian and Hawaii-born combatants from historical records. The exact number still remains unclear because many Hawaiians enlisted and served under anglicized pseudonyms, and little is known about them due to the lack of detailed records.

In 2015, the sesquicentennial of the end of the American Civil War, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> released a publication entitled "Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War", concerning the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaii's involvement and the biographies of Romerson and others were written by historians Ruthanne Lum McCunn, Anita Manning and Justin Vance.

Political Animals and Animal Politics

Political Animals and Animal Politics is a 2014 <a href="edited%20collection">edited collection</a> published by <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan">Palgrave Macmillan</a> and edited by the <a href="green%20politics">green</a> <a href="political%20theorist">political theorist</a>s <a href="Marcel%20Wissenburg">Marcel Wissenburg</a> and <a href="David%20Schlosberg">David Schlosberg</a>. The work addresses the emergence of academic <a href="animal%20ethics">animal ethics</a> informed by <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> as opposed to <a href="moral%20philosophy">moral philosophy</a>. It was the first edited collection to be published on the topic, and the first book-length attempt to explore the breadth and boundaries of the literature. As well as a substantial introduction by the editors, it features ten sole-authored chapters split over three parts, respectively concerning <a href="political%20institutions">institutional</a> change for animals, the relationship between animal ethics and <a href="ecologism">ecologism</a>, and real-world laws made for the benefit of animals. The book's contributors were Wissenburg, Schlosberg, Manuel Arias-Maldonado, Chad Flanders, Christie Smith, Clemens Driessen, Simon Otjes, Kurtis Boyer, Per-Anders Svärd, and Mihnea Tanasescu. The focus of their individual chapters varies, but recurring features include discussions of <a href="human%20exceptionalism">human exceptionalism</a>, exploration of ways that animal issues are or could be present in political discourse, and reflections on the relationship between theory and practice in politics.

In part, "Political Animals and Animal Politics" arose from a <a href="academic%20workshop">workshop</a> that Wissenburg and Schlosberg organised at the 2012 <a href="European%20Consortium%20for%20Political%20Research">European Consortium for Political Research</a> Joint Sessions <a href="academic%20conference">conference</a>, though not all attendees contributed to the volume and not all contributors presented at the workshop. Footage of the workshop appeared in "De Haas in de Marathon" ("The Pacer in the Marathon"), a 2012 documentary about the Dutch <a href="Party%20for%20the%20Animals">Party for the Animals</a>. "Political Animals and Animal Politics" was published as part of the <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan%20Animal%20Ethics%20Series">Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series</a>, edited by <a href="Andrew%20Linzey">Andrew Linzey</a> and <a href="Priscilla%20Cohn">Priscilla Cohn</a>.

Reviewers identified the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, but challenged the inclusion of chapters focused on the environment. They criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as <a href="Robert%20Garner">Robert Garner</a>, <a href="Sue%20Donaldson">Sue Donaldson</a> and <a href="Will%20Kymlicka">Will Kymlicka</a>, <a href="Alasdair%20Cochrane">Alasdair Cochrane</a>, <a href="Kimberly%20K.%20Smith">Kimberly Smith</a>, or <a href="Siobhan%20O%27Sullivan">Siobhan O'Sullivan</a>. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one that engaged most directly with this literature, but his approach was a negative one. Garner has written that "Political Animals and Animal Politics" should be praised for its trailblazing, but predicted that it would be superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.

The Dutch <a href="green%20politics">green</a> <a href="political%20theorist">political theorist</a> <a href="Marcel%20Wissenburg">Marcel Wissenburg</a> and the American green political theorist <a href="David%20Schlosberg">David Schlosberg</a> organised a <a href="academic%20workshop">workshop</a> entitled "Political Animals and Animal Politics" at the 2012 <a href="European%20Consortium%20for%20Political%20Research">European Consortium for Political Research</a> Joint Sessions <a href="academic%20conference">conference</a>, which was held at the <a href="University%20of%20Antwerp">University of Antwerp</a>, Belgium, between 10 and 15 April 2012. The two had been talking for around a year about organising a conference broadly on the theme of "nature, animals and political theory". The workshop aimed to fill a gap in the political literature on the status of nonhuman animals, something, they claimed, previously considered only at the margins of work otherwise about the <a href="environmental%20politics">environment</a>/<a href="resource%20management">resource management</a>, or else by those more primarily interested in <a href="moral%20philosophy">moral</a> issues. Both Wissenburg and Schlosberg presented papers; papers were also presented by Manuel Arias-Maldonado (<a href="University%20of%20Granada">University of Granada</a>), Susan Boonman-Berson (<a href="Wageningen%20University%20and%20Research">Wageningen University and Research</a>), Kurtis Boyer (<a href="Lund%20University">Lund University</a>), Clemens Driessen (<a href="Utrecht%20University">Utrecht University</a>), Chad Flanders (<a href="Saint%20Louis%20University">Saint Louis University</a>), <a href="Robert%20Garner">Robert Garner</a> (<a href="University%20of%20Leicester">University of Leicester</a>), Margareta Hanes (<a href="Vrije%20Universiteit%20Brussel">Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a>), Paul Lucardie (<a href="University%20of%20Groningen">University of Groningen</a>), Christopher Neff (<a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>), Kaspar Ossenblok (<a href="Ghent%20University">Ghent University</a>), Simon Otjes (<a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden University</a>), Christie Smith (<a href="University%20of%20Exeter">University of Exeter</a>), Mihnea Tanasescu (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Catherine Zwetkoff (<a href="University%20of%20Li%C3%A8ge">University of Liège</a>). For Schlosberg, the workshop, and the wide range of papers presented, illustrated the "coming-of-age of animal politics as a subfield of political theory".

The workshop featured a lecture by Michel Vandenbosch, of the Belgian organisation <a href="Global%20Action%20in%20the%20Interest%20of%20Animals">Global Action in the Interest of Animals</a>. On the second day, those involved were joined by <a href="Niko%20Koffeman">Niko Koffeman</a> of the Dutch <a href="Party%20for%20the%20Animals">Party for the Animals</a> and Karen Soeters of that party's Nicolaas G. Pierson Foundation <a href="think%20tank">think tank</a>. Footage from that day of the workshop, shot by Joost de Haas, was included in the documentary film "De Haas in de Marathon" ("The Pacer in the Marathon", 2012). The film was created by de Haas, who was commissioned by the Nicolaas G. Pierson Foundation. It focuses on the Party for the Animals's first ten years, including interviews with people associated with the party and explorations of the party's public reception. The film premiered on 28 October 2012, during a gathering to celebrate the party's 10th anniversary. It has since been made available in numerous languages.

Wissenburg and Schlosberg's workshop formed the basis of "Political Animals and Animal Politics", a <a href="edited%20collection">collection</a> edited by Wissenburg and Schlosberg, earlier versions of many of the volume's chapters having been presented at that time. Originally, the editors had intended to have discussion of <a href="political%20theory">political theory</a>, of movements for animals and of real-world politics, but the final volume was somewhat more theory-based than this. "Political Animals and Animal Politics" was published in 2014 by <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan">Palgrave Macmillan</a>; it is part of the <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan%20Animal%20Ethics%20Series">Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series</a>, which is edited by <a href="Andrew%20Linzey">Andrew Linzey</a> and <a href="Priscilla%20Cohn">Priscilla Cohn</a>. This interdisciplinary series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges posed by <a href="animal%20ethics">animal ethics</a>. "Political Animals and Animal Politics" was published in <a href="hardback%20book">hardback</a> (), <a href="softback%20book">softback</a> (), <a href="eBook">eBook</a> (), and online () formats.

"Political Animals and Animal Politics" was the first edited collection devoted to the "political turn in animal ethics", and the first "book-length attempt at seeking to define the contours" of this literature. According to <a href="Siobhan%20O%27Sullivan">Siobhan O'Sullivan</a>, the book may have been the first time that "political turn in animal ethics"—a phrase that had been used at European conferences for a number of years—appeared in print. This "animal political philosophy" is identified by the editors as an academic literature at the meeting point of animal ethics, <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> and real-world (but theory-driven) politics. Wissenburg and Schlosberg posit that this literature, though at one time only a small part of more morally focused animal ethics, has developed into a separate field of enquiry in its own right. They single out two key texts: Robert Garner's 2013 "A Theory of Justice for Animals" (<a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>) and <a href="Sue%20Donaldson">Sue Donaldson</a> and <a href="Will%20Kymlicka">Will Kymlicka</a>'s 2011 "Zoopolis" (Oxford University Press). Recognising the editors' identification of the political turn in animal ethics, Garner, writing with O'Sullivan and <a href="Alasdair%20Cochrane">Alasdair Cochrane</a>, argues that the literature is both made distinct and unified by its focus on <a href="justice">justice</a>; contributions to this literature, these authors argue, "imagine how political institutions, structures and processes might be "transformed" so as to secure justice for both human and nonhuman animals. Put simply, the essential feature of the political turn is this "constructive" focus on justice."

"Political Animals and Animal Politics" has three key aims, and, correspondingly, its chapters are split into three sections. These aims are the analysis of three key "innovations" that the editors identify in the book's introduction. The first of these is the move, in animal ethics, from thinking about personal change to thinking about the implementation of rules or norms of conduct at the societal level. The second of these is a possible <a href="rapprochement">rapprochement</a> between animal ethics and <a href="ecologism">ecologism</a> (<a href="environmental%20ethics">environmental ethics</a> and green political theory). The third is the increased presence of animal protection laws for the benefit of nonhuman animals themselves. Aside from the introduction, the book features ten single-authored chapters: three in Part I: The Politicization of the Animal Advocacy Discourse, three in Part II: The Rapprochement between Animal Ethics and Ecologism, and four in Part III: The Introduction of Laws and Institutions for the Benefit of Animals.
Arias-Maldonado argues that traditional appeals to the value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of <a href="human%20exceptionalism">human exceptionalism</a> and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human <a href="sympathy">sympathy</a> for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and <a href="sustainable">sustainable</a> <a href="Anthropocene">Anthropocene</a>. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.


For the purposes of his contribution, Wissenburg takes many standard contentions in animal ethics for granted. However, he challenges mainstream animal ethicists' tendency to adopt the language of <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a>, which he suggests misconstrues nonhuman animals as individuals and posits <a href="false%20dichotomies">false dichotomies</a> about their status. This adoption of liberal ideas can come in <a href="Tom%20Regan">Tom Regan</a>'s "old" form or Donaldson and Kymlicka's "new" form. Wissenburg challenges Donaldson and Kymlicka's extension of <a href="citizenship">citizenship</a> to nonhuman animals, and instead sketches the outline of an alternative proposal that pays attention to individual animals' modes of being. This he labels, adapting a phrase from <a href="Robert%20Nozick">Robert Nozick</a>, "liberalism for humans and <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> for animals".

Flanders argues that nonhuman animals could be "below" politics, in that they do not have politically considerable interests, or "above" politics, in that they have <a href="rights">rights</a> that trump political decision-making processes. Flanders argues that if animals are excluded from basic justice, as <a href="John%20Rawls">John Rawls</a> held, they can be defended on <a href="metaphysical">metaphysical</a> grounds (what Rawls refers to as on the basis of "comprehensive doctrines", as opposed to the "public reasons" which must be used for arguments in the political realm). This is potentially liberating for animal advocates. Nonetheless, Flanders argues, animal issues may be matters of basic justice insofar as they affect humans or that animals themselves have rights. Alternatively, the wrongness of <a href="animal%20cruelty">animal cruelty</a> may be a "fixed point" in our political reasoning. Flanders concludes that Rawlsianism provides a good starting point for the inclusion of animals in political decision-making.

Smith draws on <a href="Val%20Plumwood">Val Plumwood</a> to argue that rather than solely think about resituating animals in ethical terms, what is needed is the resituation of humans in ecological terms; both are needed, she argues, as the two tasks are linked. Smith rejects the <a href="culture">culture</a>/nature dichotomy, and suggests that a <a href="politics%20of%20recognition">politics of recognition</a> is an appropriate way to think about relationships. She draws upon <a href="feminist">feminist</a> and <a href="ecofeminist">ecofeminist</a> literature to conceive of recognition theory beyond <a href="intersubjective">intersubjective</a> self/other relations, allowing recognition beyond the human self. Smith seeks to show that recognition theories should not be considered "soft" or "naive" as accounts of justice, and instead that they offer an appropriate mode for thinking about ecological and animal injustices.

Schlosberg's contribution, is partly a response to challenges made to his "Defining Environmental Justice" (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed <a href="capabilities%20approach">capabilities</a>/<a href="Deliberative%20democracy">deliberation</a> approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach that moves beyond humans) grounded in the existence of conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.


Driessen explores ways in which nonhuman animals might be understood to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is <a href="Empirical%20research">empirical</a> rather than <a href="Norm%20%28philosophy%29">normative</a>, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans are involved in the development of new technologies, analysing the example (following <a href="Bruno%20Latour">Bruno Latour</a>) of <a href="Gaston%20Lagaffe">Gaston Lagaffe</a> building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers and cows using <a href="milking%20robots">milking robots</a>. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.

Otjes's approach is more empirical than that of many contributors to "Political Animals and Animal Politics". He examines the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, <a href="Dutch%20general%20election%2C%202006">in 2006</a>, won two seats in the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20%28Netherlands%29">House of Representatives</a>. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed the amount of time more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.

Boyer observes the distinction between how nonhuman animals can receive political protection "as individuals" and "as species". He argues that the latter form of protection is motivated by a desire to preserve human experience of the species rather than the experiences of the nonhuman animals themselves. Politically motivated species advocacy, Boyer argues, is highly <a href="anthropocentric">anthropocentric</a>, as advocates present these animals as sharing in particular revered <a href="virtue">virtue</a>s; as a result, the likes of habitat and genetic health are the focus of advocates, rather than the nonhuman animals themselves. Using the example of <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> preservation, Boyer illustrates how species advocacy becomes tied up with broader political goals concerning humans and competing visions of the value of animals. He concludes that the advancement of species advocacy can limit the achievement of the goals of the <a href="animal%20welfare">animal welfare</a> or animal rights movements.

Svärd, taking a more empirical approach than many other contributors, explores laws surrounding animal welfare in early 20th-century Sweden. He seeks to offer an empirical grounding for the argument that animal welfarism is problematic for animals, entrenching harmful use and <a href="speciesism">speciesism</a>. He analyses all official documentation from the <a href="Riksdag">Riksdag</a> from 1900–1944 on the subject of animal <a href="animal%20slaughter">slaughter</a> and welfare drawing upon <a href="Foucauldian">Foucauldian</a> <a href="policy%20analysis">policy analysis</a> and <a href="poststructuralist">poststructuralist</a> <a href="discourse%20analysis">discourse analysis</a>. He conceives of the debates as a political <a href="problematisation">problematisation</a> in which (drawing upon <a href="Lacanian%20psychoanalysis">Lacanian psychoanalysis</a>) animal cruelty was blamed on certain "other" groups (such as <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and <a href="Sami%20people">Sami</a>). He argues that animal welfarism was not the natural continuation of an old anti-cruelty discourse, but that Sweden's 1937 regulation of slaughter and 1944 animal protection laws served to reconstitute, reaffirm, and expand speciesist relations, paving the way for animal exploitation's expansion.

Tanasescu explores the idea of <a href="Rights%20of%20Nature">rights for nature</a>, an idea that, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He introduces the concept, with a focus on the differences between <a href="moral%20and%20legal%20rights">moral and legal rights</a>, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its <a href="2008%20Constitution%20of%20Ecuador">2008 constitution</a>, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the topic is left to be done, but the key lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

"Political Animals and Animal Politics" was reviewed by Garner for "<a href="Environmental%20Values%20%28journal%29">Environmental Values</a>", and the philosophers Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer, Josh Milburn, and Dan Hooley for "<a href="Environmental%20Ethics%20%28journal%29">Environmental Ethics</a>", the "<a href="Political%20Studies%20Review">Political Studies Review</a>" and the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Animal%20Ethics">Journal of Animal Ethics</a>" respectively. Garner lamented the absence of many of the key voices in the political theory literature on animal ethics—such as Cochrane, Donaldson and Kymlicka, O'Sullivan, <a href="Tony%20Milligan">Tony Milligan</a>, <a href="Kimberly%20K.%20Smith">Kimberly Smith</a> or Garner himself—in the book, meaning that "Political Animals and Animal Politics" "takes on the role of an observer of this debate rather than directly contributing to it in a leading sense". He also felt that the book offered little consideration of the details of the work of these leading theorists, identifying the absence of discussion of Cochrane's interest-based rights approach, a superficial consideration of Regan's account of animal rights, an oversimplification of his own position and a lack of context to understand the respective work of Kimberly Smith and O'Sullivan. He considered Wissenburg's chapter to be the only one that engages with the debate about the political turn in general, but noted that Wissenburg's approach is a negative one; Garner considered this unsurprising, given that Wissenburg is a green political theorist with little sympathy for "animal political theory".

Bendik-Keymer praised the book as having a "report-from-a-cutting-edge-conference quality", characterising two conceptual divides as shaping the volume: first, the distinction between theories endorsing human exceptionalism and those not; and, second, the disconnect between theory and practice. For him, the essays of part three—effectively three <a href="case%20studies">case studies</a>—illustrated ways that the "actual practice of politics evince psychological and pragmatic concerns that do not fit neatly into normative foundations". The core philosophical debate (about human exceptionalism) takes place in parts one and two. In part one, he suggested, essays assumed (and sometimes supported) human exceptionalism, sometimes framing it as the only justified way to include animals in politics, while human exceptionalism was denied in part two. It is Bendik-Keymer's view, in line with part one but against part two, that one need not reject anthropocentrism to "open up ecological thought". Anthropocentrism, he argued, can be "open to ecological identifications, having humane virtues, and showing responsibility for our behavior", though this is often denied in environmental ethics. Parts two and three, Bendik-Keymer felt, reveal "the need for a
viable politics of animals to be grounded in an adequate experience of community". The area of research that the book exposes, he argued, is animal community, and, in particular, whether animals' roles as co-creators of community (though not politics) calls for their recognition as political agents, rather than simply being included in politics through the ethical concern of human political agents.

Milburn questioned the success of the volume in achieving its second stated goal, concerning rapprochement between animal and environmental ethics; he considered the contributions respectively of Christie Smith, Schlosberg, and Tanasescu to be more clearly in the domain of environmental ethics than animal ethics, questioning the extent to which they belong in a volume about "animal politics". Similarly, Hooley argued that "Political Animals and Animal Politics" was "less of a work in the emerging field of animal politics than it is a collection of essays in the field of environmental politics". Alternatively, he claimed it could be viewed as a mixed work, noting that the contributions from Flanders, Otjes, Boyer and Svärd offered new contributions to the literature on animals and politics. Hooley thought it surprising that few authors engaged with the work of Donaldson and Kymlicka, and was critical of Wissenburg's discussion of the pair, which he claimed was "all too brief and ultimately disappointing".

Milburn thought that the opening chapters (and introduction) did well to establish the volume, and was happy with the inclusion of the more empirical contributions, given their potential theoretical significance. He picked out the chapters by Driessen, Boyer, and Wissenburg respectively as highlights, suggesting that the contributions of Driessen and Boyer seemed to challenge the volume's second stated goal, and noting that, though it was strong, he disagreed with the claims of Wissenburg's chapter. Garner highlighted the contributions of Flanders and Driessen, and commended the editors for putting together the book. Hooley concluded his review by claiming that the book offered something to those interested in the place of animals in politics, but that much of its contents would be of more interest for those looking to read about environmental political theory.

Garner identified "Political Animals and Animal Politics" as the first edited collection devoted to the political turn in animal ethics. Though he claimed that it was likely to be superseded, he argued that "Political Animals and Animal Politics" should be "welcomed for its trailblazing". Subsequent collections identified in reviews of the literature in the political turn include Garner and O'Sullivan's "The Political Turn in Animal Ethics" and Andrew Woodhall and Gabriel Garmendia da Trindade's "Ethical and Political Approaches to Nonhuman Animal Issues". Another publication identified in these reviews is the <a href="open%20access">open access</a> <a href="academic%20journal">journal</a> "Politics and Animals"; this published its first issue in 2015 with an "editorial collective" consisting of Boyer, Svärd, Katherine Wayne and Guy Scotton.

Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons

Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons is a three-part episodic <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform video game</a> developed by Ideas from the Deep (a precursor to <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>) and published by <a href="3D%20Realms">Apogee Software</a> in 1990 for <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>. It is the first set of episodes of the "<a href="Commander%20Keen">Commander Keen</a>" series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he retrieves the stolen parts of his spaceship from the cities of Mars, prevents a recently arrived alien mothership from destroying landmarks on Earth, and hunts down the leader of the aliens, the Grand Intellect, on the alien home planet. The three episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.

In September 1990, <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a>, while working at programming studio <a href="Softdisk">Softdisk</a>, developed <a href="Adaptive%20tile%20refresh">a way to implement</a> side-scrolling video games on <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s (PCs), which at the time was the province of dedicated <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a>s. Carmack and his coworkers <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hall">Tom Hall</a>, along with Jay Wilbur and Lane Roathe, developed a demo of a PC version of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.%203">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>", but failed to convince <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> to invest in a PC <a href="port%20%28video%20game%29">port</a> of their game. Soon afterwards, however, they were approached by <a href="Scott%20Miller%20%28entrepreneur%29">Scott Miller</a> of Apogee Software to develop an original game to be published through the Apogee <a href="shareware">shareware</a> model. Hall designed the three-part game, John Carmack and Romero programmed it, Wilbur managed the team, and artist <a href="Adrian%20Carmack">Adrian Carmack</a> helped later in development. The team worked continuously for almost three months on the game, working late into the night at the office at Softdisk and taking their work computers to John Carmack's home to continue developing it.

Released by Apogee on December 14, 1990, the trilogy of episodes was an immediate success; Apogee, whose monthly sales had been around US$7,000, made US$30,000 on "Commander Keen" alone in the first two weeks and US$60,000 per month by June, while the first royalty check convinced the development team, then known as Ideas from the Deep, to quit their jobs at Softdisk. The team founded id Software shortly thereafter and went on to produce another four episodes of the "Commander Keen" series over the next year. The trilogy was lauded by reviewers due to the graphical achievement and humorous style, and id Software went on to develop other successful games, including "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>" (1992) and "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>" (1993). The "Vorticons" trilogy has been released as part of several collections by id and Apogee since its first release, and has been sold for modern computers through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> since 2007.

The three episodes of "Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons" make up one <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform video game</a>: most of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. Keen can move left and right and can jump; after finding a <a href="pogo%20stick">pogo stick</a> in the first episode, he can also bounce continuously and jump higher than he can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The second episode introduces moving platforms as well as switches that extend bridges over gaps in the floor. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, and the player cannot save and return to the middle of a level. In between levels, Keen travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by moving Keen to the entrance or <a href="Save%20game">save their progress</a> in the game. Some levels are optional and can be bypassed, while others are secret and can only be reached by following specific procedures.

Each of the three episodes contain a different set of enemies in their levels, which Keen must kill or avoid. The first episode includes Martians, the second largely uses robots, and the third more species of aliens. All three episodes also include Vorticons, large blue canine-like aliens. Levels can also include hazards like electricity or spikes. Touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a <a href="Life%20%28gaming%29">life</a>, and the game is <a href="game%20over">ended</a> if all of Keen's lives are lost. After finding a <a href="raygun">raygun</a> in the first episode, Keen can shoot at enemies using ammunition found throughout the game; different enemies take differing numbers of shots to kill, or in some cases are immune. Some enemies can also be stunned if they are jumped on, such as the one-eyed Yorps, which block Keen's path but do not harm him. Keen can find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded every 20,000 points. There are also colored keycards that grant access to locked parts of levels, and in the third episode on rare occasions an <a href="ankh">ankh</a>, which gives Keen temporary invulnerability.

The game is broken up into three episodes: "Marooned on Mars", "The Earth Explodes", and "Keen Must Die!". In the first episode, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze builds a spaceship and puts on his older brother's football helmet to become Commander Keen. One night while his parents are out of the house, he flies to Mars to explore, but while away from the ship the Vorticons steal four vital components and hide them in Martian cities. Keen journeys through Martian cities and outposts to find the components, despite the efforts of Martians and robots to stop him. After securing the final component, which is guarded by a Vorticon, Keen returns to Earth—discovering a Vorticon mothership in orbit—and beats his parents home, who discover that he now has a pet Yorp.

In the second episode, the Vorticon mothership has locked its X-14 Tantalus Ray cannons on eight of Earth's landmarks, and Keen journeys to the ship to find and deactivate each of the cannons. Keen does so by fighting more varied enemies and hazards and a Vorticon at each cannon's control. At the end of the episode, he discovers that the Vorticons are being mind-controlled by the mysterious Grand Intellect, who is actually behind the attack on Earth.

In the third episode, Keen journeys to the Vorticon homeworld of Vorticon VI to find the Grand Intellect. He travels through Vorticon cities and outposts to gain access to the Grand Intellect's lair, fighting mostly against the Vorticons themselves. Upon reaching the lair, he discovers that the Grand Intellect is actually his school rival Mortimer McMire, whose <a href="Intelligence%20quotient">IQ</a> is "a single point higher" than Keen's. Keen defeats Mortimer and his "Mangling Machine" and frees the Vorticons; the Vorticon king and "the other Vorticons you haven't slaughtered" then award him a medal for saving them.

In September 1990, <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a>, a game programmer for the "Gamer's Edge" video game subscription service and <a href="disk%20magazine">disk magazine</a> at <a href="Softdisk">Softdisk</a> in <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport, Louisiana</a>, with the aid of a copy of <a href="Michael%20Abrash">Michael Abrash</a>'s "Power Graphics Programming", developed from scratch a way to create graphics which could smoothly scroll in any direction in a <a href="PC%20game">computer game</a>. At the time, <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">IBM-compatible general-purpose computers</a> were not able to replicate the common feat of <a href="video%20game%20console">video game console</a>s such as the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, that of redrawing the entire screen fast enough for a smooth side-scrolling video game due to their specialized hardware. Carmack, rejecting the "clever little shortcuts" that other programmers had attempted to solve the problem, created <a href="adaptive%20tile%20refresh">adaptive tile refresh</a>: a way to slide the majority of the visible screen to the side both horizontally and vertically when the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> moved as if it had not changed, and only redraw the newly-visible portions of the screen. Other scrolling computer games had previously redrawn the whole screen in chunks, or like Carmack's earlier games were limited to scrolling in one direction. He discussed the idea with coworker <a href="Tom%20Hall">Tom Hall</a>, who encouraged him to demonstrate it by recreating the first level of the recently released "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.%203">Super Mario Bros. 3</a>" on a computer. The pair did so in a single overnight session, with Hall recreating the graphics of the game—replacing the player character of <a href="Mario">Mario</a> with Dangerous Dave, a character from <a href="Dangerous%20Dave">an eponymous previous "Gamer's Edge" game</a>—while Carmack optimized the code. The next morning, September 20, Carmack and Hall showed the resulting game, "Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement", to another coworker, <a href="John%20Romero">John Romero</a>. Romero recognized Carmack's programming feat as a major accomplishment: <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> was one of the most successful companies in Japan, largely due to the success of their <a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">"Mario" franchise</a>, and the ability to replicate the gameplay of the series on a computer could have large implications. The scrolling technique did not meet Softdisk's coding guidelines as it needed at least a 16-color <a href="Enhanced%20Graphics%20Adapter">EGA</a> graphics processor, and the programmers in the office who did not work on games were not as impressed as Romero.

Romero felt that the potential of Carmack's idea should not be "wasted" on Softdisk; while the other members of the "Gamer's Edge" team more or less agreed, he especially felt that their talents in general were wasted on the company, which needed the money their games brought in but in his opinion neither understood nor appreciated video game design as distinct from general software programming. The manager of the team, fellow programmer Jay Wilbur, recommended that they take the demo to Nintendo itself to position themselves as capable of building a PC version of "Super Mario Bros." for the company. The group—composed of Carmack, Romero, Hall, Wilbur, and "Gamer's Edge" editor Lane Roathe—decided to build a full demo game to send to Nintendo. As they lacked the computers to build the project at home and could not work on it at Softdisk, they "borrowed" their work computers over the weekend, taking them in their cars to a house shared by Carmack, Wilbur, and Roathe. The group then spent the next 72 hours working non-stop on the demo, which copied "Super Mario Bros. 3" with some shortcuts taken in the artwork, sound, and level design, and a title screen that credited the game to the programmers under the name Ideas from the Deep, a name Romero had used for some prior Softdisk projects. The response from Nintendo a few weeks later was not as hoped for: while Nintendo was impressed with their efforts, they wanted the "Mario" series to remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles.
Around the same time the group was rejected by Nintendo, Romero was receiving fan mail about some of the games he had developed for "Gamer's Edge." Upon realizing that all of the letters came from different people but shared the same address—that of <a href="Scott%20Miller%20%28entrepreneur%29">Scott Miller</a> of <a href="3D%20Realms">Apogee Software</a>—he wrote back an angry reply, only to receive a phone call from Miller soon after. Miller explained that he was trying to get in contact with Romero unofficially, as he expected that Softdisk would screen his mail to him at the company. He wanted to convince Romero to publish more levels for his previous "Pyramids of Egypt"—an adventure game in which the player navigates mazes while avoiding Egyptian-themed traps and monsters—through Apogee's <a href="shareware">shareware</a> model. Miller was pioneering a model of game publishing in which part of a game would be released for free, with the remainder of the game available for purchase from Apogee. Romero said he could not, as "Pyramids of Egypt" was owned by Softdisk, but that it did not matter as the game he was now working on was much better. Romero sent Miller the "Mario" demo, and the two agreed that Ideas from the Deep would create a new game for Apogee. The group negotiated that Miller would front them money for the development costs, which Miller later claimed was all the money Apogee had. Miller sent the group a US$2,000 advance in return for an agreement that they would create a game before Christmas of 1990, only a few months away. This advance was the team's entire budget for development. The game was planned to be split into three parts to match Apogee's shareware model of giving away the first part for free to attract interest in the whole.

Ideas from the Deep convened to come up with the design for the game, and Hall suggested a console-style platformer in the vein of "Super Mario Bros.", as they had the technology made for it; he further recommended a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> theme. John Carmack added the idea of a genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on "Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons".

The Ideas from the Deep team, who referred to themselves as the "IFD guys", could not afford to leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they continued to work at Softdisk making "Gamer's Edge" games during the day while working on "Commander Keen" at night. They also continued to take home their work computers to Carmack's house on the weekends, putting them in their cars at night and bringing them back in the morning before anyone else arrived; they even began to request upgrades to the computers from Softdisk, nominally for their work. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist <a href="Adrian%20Carmack">Adrian Carmack</a> from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon kicked out of the group; Romero, the self-appointed leader of the team, liked him but felt that his work ethic did not match well with the rest of the team and pushed for his removal. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on "Commander Keen", with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks. Several members of the team have mentioned in interviews as an example of the team's commitment a night during development when a heavy storm flooded the path to get to the house, preventing them from working, and John Romero waded through a flooding river to make it to the house anyway.

As the principal designer, Hall's personal experiences and philosophies strongly impacted the game: Keen's red shoes and <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>'s psychological theories, such as that of the <a href="Id%2C%20ego%20and%20super-ego%23Id">id</a>. Other influences on Hall for the game were "<a href="Duck%20Dodgers%20in%20the%2024%C2%BDth%20Century">Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century</a>" (1953) and other <a href="Chuck%20Jones">Chuck Jones</a> cartoons, and "The Available Data on the Worp Reaction", a 1953 short story by Lion Miller about a child constructing a spaceship. Keen's "Bean-with-Bacon" spaceship was taken from a <a href="George%20Carlin">George Carlin</a> skit about using bay leaves as deodorant so as to smell like soup. Keen was intended to be a reflection of Hall as he had wanted to be as a child. The team separated the game from its "Super Mario Bros." roots by adding non-linear exploration and additional mechanics like the pogo stick. A suggestion from Miller that part of the popularity of "Super Mario Bros" was the presence of <a href="easter%20egg%20%28media%29">secrets and hidden areas</a> in the game led Hall to add several secrets, such as an entire hidden level in the first episode, and a "Galactic Alphabet" in which signs in the game were written, which if deciphered by the players revealed hidden messages, jokes, and instructions. The level maps were designed using a custom-made program called Tile Editor (TEd), which was first created for "Dangerous Dave" and was used for the entire "Keen" series as well as several other games.

As the game neared completion, Miller began to market the game to players. Strongly encouraged by the updates the team was sending him, he began heavily advertising the game in all of the <a href="bulletin%20board%20system">bulletin board system</a>s (BBS) and game magazines he had access to, as well as sending the team US$100 checks every week labelled "pizza bonus" after one of the game's food items to keep them motivated. The game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14, Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30.

"Commander Keen" was an immediate hit for Apogee: the company's previous sales levels had been around US$7,000 per month, but by Christmas "Keen" already had sales of almost US$30,000. Miller described the game as "a little atom bomb" to magazine editors and BBS controllers when asked about it; its success led him to recruit his mother and hire his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players, and to quit his other job and move Apogee from his house into an office. By June 1991, the game was bringing in over US$60,000 per month. Chris Parker of "<a href="PC%20Magazine">PC Magazine</a>" later in 1991 referred to the game's release as a "tremendous success". Apogee announced plans to license the game to another publisher for a <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> port in an advertising flyer that year, but no such version was ever created. Scott Miller estimates that the trilogy eventually sold between 50,000 and 60,000 copies.

A contemporary review by Barry Simon of "PC Magazine" praised the game's graphical capabilities as having a "Nintendo feel", though he termed the graphics as "well drawn" but "not spectacular" in terms of resolution. He noted that the game was very much an arcade game that players would not purchase for "its scintillating plot or ground-breaking originality", but said that all three episodes were very fun to play and that the scrolling graphics set it apart from similar games. A short summary of the trilogy in 1992 in "<a href="PC%20World">PC World</a>" termed it "one of the most spectacular games available" and praised the "superb" sound and graphics, while a similar summary in "<a href="CQ%20Amateur%20Radio">CQ Amateur Radio</a>" described it as "Nintendo comes to the PC" and the "best action/adventure game" the reviewer had ever seen. In October 1992, the <a href="Shareware%20Industry%20Awards">Shareware Industry Awards</a> gave the <a href="Commander%20Keen">"Commander Keen" series</a> the "Best Entertainment Software and Best Overall" award. A review of the entire "Commander Keen" series in 1993 by <a href="Sandy%20Petersen">Sandy Petersen</a> in the first "Eye of the Monitor" column for "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>" described the series as action games with "hilarious graphics". Acknowledging its debt to "Super Mario Bros.", he called it, including the Vorticon trilogy, "one of the best games of its type" and praised it for not being "mindlessly hard", though still requiring some thought to play through, and especially for the humor in the graphics and gameplay.

Ideas from the Deep's first royalty check from Apogee in January 1991 for US$10,500 convinced them that they no longer needed their day jobs at Softdisk but could devote themselves full-time to their own ideas. Hall and Wilbur were concerned about the risk of being sued if they did not break the news gently to Softdisk, but Romero and John Carmack were dismissive of the possibility, especially as they felt they had no assets for which they could be sued. Shortly thereafter, John Carmack was confronted by their boss, Softdisk owner Al Vekovius, who had become suspicious of the group's increasingly erratic, disinterested, and surly behavior at work, as well as their multiple requests for computer upgrades. Vekovius had been told by another employee that the group were making their own games, and he felt that Carmack was generally incapable of lying. Carmack in turn bluntly admitted that they had made "Keen" with Softdisk computers, that they felt no remorse for their actions, and that they were all planning on leaving. Vekovius felt that the company was reliant on the "Gamer's Edge" subscriptions and tried to convince the group to instead form a new company in partnership with Softdisk; when Ideas from the Deep made no secret of the offer in the office, the other employees threatened to all quit if the team was "rewarded" for stealing from the company. After several weeks of negotiation, the Ideas team agreed to produce a series of games for Softdisk, one every two months, and on February 1, 1991, founded <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>.

In the 2017 "History of Digital Games", author Andrew Williams claims that "Vorticons" "signaled a new direction for computer games in general", as well as setting a tone of gameplay mechanics for future id games, by introducing a sense of "effortless movement" as players explored through large open spaces instead of disconnected screens like prior platforming computer games. In the summer of 1991, id hosted a seminar for game developers with the intention of licensing the "Commander Keen" <a href="game%20engine">engine</a>; they did so, forming the spiritual predecessor to both <a href="QuakeCon">QuakeCon</a> and id's standard of licensing their game engines. Id Software also produced several more games in the "Commander Keen" series; the first of these, "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20in%20Keen%20Dreams">Commander Keen in Keen Dreams</a>", was published in 1991 through their agreement with Softdisk. "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20in%20Goodbye%2C%20Galaxy">Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy</a>", composed of the episodes "Secret of the Oracle" and "The Armageddon Machine", was published through Apogee in December 1991, and the final id-developed "Keen" game, "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20in%20Aliens%20Ate%20My%20Babysitter">Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter</a>", was published through <a href="FormGen">FormGen</a> around the same time. Another trilogy of episodes, titled "The Universe Is Toast!", was planned for December 1992, but was cancelled after the success of id's "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>" and development focus on "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>". A final "Keen" game, "<a href="Commander%20Keen%20%282001%20video%20game%29">Commander Keen</a>", was developed for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Color">Game Boy Color</a> in 2001 by David A. Palmer Productions in association with id Software, and published by <a href="Activision">Activision</a>.

The original trilogy has been released as part of several collections since its first release: the "id Anthology" compilation in 1996, a compilation release by Apogee in 1998 of "Invasion of the Vorticons" and "Goodbye, Galaxy", a similar compilation in 2001 by 3D Realms titled "Commander Keen Combo CD", and the "3D Realms Anthology" in 2014. They have also been released for modern computers through a <a href="DOS">DOS</a> emulator, and sold through <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> since 2007 as a part of the "Commander Keen Complete Pack". According to <a href="Steam%20Spy">Steam Spy</a>, as of 2017 over 200,000 copies are registered through Steam.

The Fade Out

The Fade Out is a <a href="crime%20comics">crime comics</a> series created by writer <a href="Ed%20Brubaker">Ed Brubaker</a> and artist <a href="Sean%20Phillips">Sean Phillips</a> with the help of colorist Elizabeth Breitweiser and research assistant Amy Condit. Twelve issues were published by <a href="Image%20Comics">Image Comics</a> between August 2014 and January 2016. The story has been collected into three <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback volumes</a> and a single hardcover collection.

The story, partly inspired by the life of Brubaker's uncle, is set in 1948 and stars Charlie Parish, a Hollywood <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a> suffering from <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) and <a href="front%20organization">fronting</a> for his <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist">blacklisted</a> best friend, Gil. When Charlie wakes from a <a href="Blackout%20%28drug-related%20amnesia%29%23Alcohol%20and%20long-term%20memory">blackout</a> in the same room as a murdered starlet, he and Gil set out to bring her killer to justice. As they learn more about her troubled past, they find themselves up against powerful Hollywood elites who do not want to upset the status quo.

Although Brubaker had been concerned the premise was not commercial enough to have wide appeal, "The Fade Out" sold better than any of the authors' previous collaborations, and early issues went through several printings. The series received positive reviews from critics. 

Ed Brubaker's uncle, <a href="John%20Paxton">John Paxton</a>, was a noted Hollywood <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a> in the 1930s and 1940s known for "<a href="Murder%2C%20My%20Sweet">Murder, My Sweet</a>", "<a href="Crossfire%20%28film%29">Crossfire</a>", "<a href="The%20Wild%20One">The Wild One</a>" and "<a href="On%20the%20Beach%20%281959%20film%29">On the Beach</a>". His wife, Sarah Jane Paxton, worked <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> for <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> at the same time. They told Brubaker stories about their experiences, and he developed a lifelong fascination with the time and setting. In particular, he was drawn to the false personas he felt everyone had to put forward to succeed.

In mid-2014, having just finished their previous collaboration, "<a href="Fatale%20%28Image%20Comics%29">Fatale</a>", Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project would be a <a href="noir%20fiction">noir</a> <a href="Historical%20period%20drama">period piece</a> or a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed the creators could publish any comic without having to <a href="sales%20pitch">pitch</a> it to the publisher first. The pair announced "The Fade Out" and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series because they were not sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since "Fatale" had taken twice as long as originally planned, they did not want to mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.

When they were asked for a promotional image for use at Image Expo, Brubaker suggested "a typewriter and some blood and a dead body's hands". Phillips removed the hands and incorporated the blood into the logo. After completing the image, he thought the stark white background would help the book stand out on sales racks and continued to use it for subsequent covers.

While the central plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea was of a writer with <a href="Posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">PTSD</a> who cannot write and is instead fronting for his <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist">blacklisted</a> best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between <a href="first-person%20narrative">first-</a> and <a href="Narration%23Third-person">third-person narration</a> because it allowed him to tell a broader story. He was also trying to create a layered story which would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.

Phillips, who lives in the United Kingdom, sometimes has difficulty accurately portraying modern America and said "1948 Hollywood might as well be sci-fi". Since there was not enough time for him to do his own research and maintain a monthly schedule, Brubaker hired Amy Condit as a research assistant. Condit, who is the manager of the <a href="Highland%20Park%20Police%20Station%23Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Museum">Los Angeles Police Museum</a>, supplied Phillips with thousands of reference photos. Phillips also bought some DVDs he thought might be useful, but never found time to watch them.

Although Phillips has been using digital tools like <a href="Cintiq">Cintiq</a> and <a href="Manga%20Studio">Manga Studio</a> to create his art since 1997, "The Fade Out" is his first project completed using them exclusively. The change increased the amount of time needed to create each page by almost 50 percent, but had no effect on <a href="colorist">colorist</a> Elizabeth Breitweiser. Visually, Phillips style remained the same as his previous work, which critic Charley Parked notes for its "strong spotted blacks and bold use of negative space". Phillips also changed his regular lettering font to one more "sympathetic to the period". During publication, he chose to remain in the dark about where the story was going, sometimes receiving only a few pages of the script at a time.

The 40-page first issue was released in print and <a href="electronic%20publishing">digitally</a> on August 20, 2014. <a href="Jamie%20McKelvie">Jamie McKelvie</a> and <a href="Chip%20Zdarsky">Chip Zdarsky</a> provided art for two retailer-exclusive <a href="variant%20cover">variant cover</a>s. These variants were commissioned directly by the retailers. Unlike most comics sold in the <a href="direct%20market">direct market</a>, unsold copies of this issue could be returned to the publisher. This tactic allowed retailers to place higher orders without taking a financial risk. Estimated sales were just under 35,000 copies, making it the 61st best-selling comic book for the month. Due to re-orders, the issue sold out at the distributor level on the day of release. A second printing was announced the next day and was released on September 24, 2014, the same day as issue two. Including sales for the second printing, the first issue sold approximately 41,000 copies. In addition to the standard print version, a larger "magazine" version with eight additional pages of art was available for an extra cost. This version, which was not returnable, was estimated to have sold an additional 8300 copies. All told, "The Fade Out" #1 had better sales than anything Brubaker and Phillips had previously done together. Brubaker suspects the numbers were higher partly because they had developed a following, and partly because retailers had become more supportive of Image books in general.

The second issue also went through a second printing, which was released the same day as issue three. Its total sales were estimated to be around 30,500.

In addition to the regular 22 pages of story, each issue included extra material. Because the opening credit page was a <a href="splash%20panel">two-page splash</a> across the inside front cover and page one, an additional page needed to be inserted to make the story start on the <a href="recto%20and%20verso">recto</a> side of the page. Brubaker's solution was to use page two as a cast list with short descriptions that updated as the story progressed, which he felt was "old-fashioned and neat". <a href="Jess%20Nevins">Jess Nevins</a> and Devin Faraci, among others, contributed essays and articles at the end of each issue about crime and misfortune among actors famous in the 1940s. The back cover of each issue included promotional images or reviews for the fictional movie being filmed in the comic. These typically foreshadowed future events or expanded on minor characters.

In September 2015, Image's solicitations for upcoming comics revealed "The Fade Out" would end with issue twelve, which was released on January 6, 2016. Like the first issue, it had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. It sold an estimated 16,500 copies and was the 136th-best selling issue of the month. Brubaker has said "The Fade Out" was, at the time, his most complex story and it ended "exactly the way [he had] pictured it in the beginning". The creators had already begun work on their next collaboration, "<a href="Kill%20or%20Be%20Killed%20%28comics%29">Kill or Be Killed</a>", before the final issue of "The Fade Out" had been published. The series was collected into three <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperback</a> volumes during publication and one oversized hardcover in October 2016. The articles and essays found in the single issues are not included in the collections.

In the letter column of "<a href="Kill%20or%20Be%20Killed%20%28comics%29">Kill or Be Killed</a>" #12 (September 2017), Brubaker mentioned plans for a semi-sequel to "The Fade Out". He said that if made, the comic book would share the setting and some of the supporting characters, but the plot would be unrelated.

Charlie Parish, a Hollywood screenwriter suffering from <a href="Posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">PTSD</a>, is fronting for his <a href="Hollywood%20blacklist">blacklisted</a> best friend, Gil. When Charlie wakes from a <a href="Blackout%20%28drug-related%20amnesia%29%23Alcohol%20and%20long-term%20memory">blackout</a> in the same room as a murdered starlet, he and Gil set out to bring her killer to justice. As they follow leads trying to piece together the night leading up to the murder, cooperative witnesses are punished by the studio's <a href="cleaner%20%28crime%29">fixer</a>. Charlie is prepared to quit when Gil tries to blackmail the head of the studio by anonymously claiming he "knows what happened" with the starlet. Misunderstanding the threat, the studio head tries to destroy evidence that he had sexually abused her when she was a <a href="child%20actor">child actor</a>. Charlie and Gil are able to retrieve a folder of photographs and decide to keep fighting for justice. They plan to kidnap the other studio co-founder, who is now suffering from <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> and will freely admit to the past sins. They arrive at the co-founder's mansion at the same time the fixers are murdering him to prevent him from talking. As the two friends are escaping from the fixers, Gil is shot and killed. When Charlie resigns himself to working in the corrupt culture, the fixer reveals the actress was murdered by an undercover FBI agent who was <a href="McCarthyism%23blacklists">looking for communists in Hollywood</a>.

Critics gave the series positive reviews. According to the <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> "Comic Book Roundup", the first issue scored an average 9.2/10 based on 41 reviews, the series as a whole averaged 8.9/10 based on 154 reviews, and the final issue averaged 9.6/10 based on 9 reviews. The series won the 2016 <a href="Eisner%20Award">Eisner Award</a> for "Best Limited Series".

Sam Marx, writing for "Comicosity", called "The Fade Out" the creators' "most ambitious series yet" and praised their ability to set a scene. Reviewing for "<a href="Comic%20Book%20Resources">Comic Book Resources</a>", Greg McElhatton gave Brubaker credit for avoiding excessive exposition at the start of the story, but felt some of the characters seemed stereotypical. The first issue was placed on the "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" "Must List". Chase Magnett of <a href="Comics%20Bulletin">Comics Bulletin</a> described the ending as "an <a href="Climax%20%28narrative%29%23Anticlimax">anti-climax</a> with no big showdown, revelations, or death", but went on to say the "sense of disappointment is exactly why it's great". McElhatton agreed, saying a happy ending would have "felt like a cheat", but the "central mystery [is given] a proper amount of closure".

Phillips' art was commended by McElhatton, who appreciated the variety of body types in crowd scenes and the strong use of body language to convey emotion. Jim Bush at Entertainment Fuse usually liked Phillips' work, but felt the sex scenes in issue seven did not play to the artist's strengths. Mary Kate Jasper, a reviewer for Comic Book Resources, noted how colorist Elizabeth Breitweiser enhanced Phillips' work with "splotches of color in unexpected arrangements, giving everyone the appearance of being forever in shadow or inside with the windows drawn". She particularly liked how Breitweiser made characters' eyes appear to glisten and stand out in otherwise dark panels.

Brubaker received calls from interested parties in Hollywood about adapting "The Fade Out" very early in its publication. However, he did not want to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote it because he was imagining it in the other medium.

Fallout 4: Far Harbor

Fallout 4: Far Harbor is an <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a> for the 2015 video game "<a href="Fallout%204">Fallout 4</a>", developed by <a href="Bethesda%20Game%20Studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and published by <a href="Bethesda%20Softworks">Bethesda Softworks</a>. "Far Harbor" was released on May 19, 2016 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> as <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> (DLC). The game is set in the year 2287, in the aftermath of a <a href="nuclear%20war">nuclear war</a> that destroys most of the United States. In the expansion, the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> is recruited by a detective agency to investigate the disappearance of a young girl living in a remote area.

The game can be played in <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> or <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Third-person%20view">third-person perspective</a>; in either case, the player controls the protagonist throughout their investigation on The Island, a landmass off the coast of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>. "Far Harbor"s main gameplay consists of quests and puzzle sections. Upon completing the <a href="quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">quests</a> in the game, the player is rewarded with bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles (the franchise's main fictional currency), and <a href="experience%20points">experience points</a>. The puzzles feature a variety of different <a href="game%20mechanics">game mechanics</a>; some require the player to hit targets with lasers, and others allow building using blocks.

"Far Harbor"s announcement was made three months after the release of "Fallout 4". The expansion was influenced by player feedback regarding the base game's <a href="Dialog%20tree">dialogue system</a>, which was not considered to be as successful as the other game mechanics. The development team also noticed the players' interest in releases that added large amounts of explorable territory. The price of "Fallout 4"s <a href="Season%20ticket">season pass</a> was increased because of the expansion's size. The expansion received generally favorable reviews from critics. The addition of new quests was praised, but there were mixed opinions on the expansion's atmosphere and its use of fog. The main criticisms were directed at the puzzles, which reviewers thought were a waste of time, unnecessary, or overly frustrating. In July 2016, Guillaume Veer accused Bethesda of copying his "" <a href="game%20mod">mod</a>, named "Autumn Leaves", though Veer said that he was not upset even if Bethesda had deliberately incorporated material from "Autumn Leaves" in "Far Harbor".

"Fallout 4: Far Harbor" is an <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a> for the <a href="Action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing</a> game, "<a href="Fallout%204">Fallout 4</a>", the fifth installment in the <a href="Fallout%20series">"Fallout" series</a>. It is set 210 years after "The Great War", which resulted in nuclear devastation across the United States. The expansion is similar to the base game in that the <a href="player%20character">player character</a> (the "Sole Survivor") is tasked with investigating a character's disappearance. In the base game, the player is searching for their lost family, while in "Far Harbor", the player is recruited by the Valentine Detective Agency to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Kasumi. Both the base game and the expansion pack offer the ability to swap between <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> and <a href="Virtual%20camera%23Third-person%20view">third-person perspectives</a>. The expansion is set on a <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a>, fog-smothered island, and is located in "Fallout"s version of <a href="Bar%20Harbor">Bar Harbor</a>, a town in <a href="Hancock%20County%2C%20Maine">Hancock County, Maine</a>. "Far Harbor" features three <a href="Political%20faction">factions</a> which include both violent and peaceful <a href="non-player%20characters">non-player characters</a>.
The expansion contains quests and puzzles that the player must solve. There are different ways to complete quests, all with their own pitfalls. Peaceful resolutions can be made with characters and factions, though these can have ill effects, such as releasing secrets or worsening relations with other factions. Violent completion of quests may be faster, though they can result in the weakening of alliances between the player and the factions. In some of the puzzle sections, the player directs <a href="Laser%23As%20weapons">lasers</a> to hit designated targets; others require the player to build with blocks, as in "<a href="Minecraft">Minecraft</a>". Puzzle sections were not featured in the base game. Upon completion of quests, the assisted factions reward the protagonist with Nuka-Cola <a href="bottle%20cap">bottle cap</a>s, one of the fictional currencies found throughout the "Fallout" series. The player character also gains <a href="experience%20points">experience points</a>. Some of the quests include investigating minor mysteries, retrieving missing items, solving disagreements, and clearing out monster-infested areas.

One of the gameplay mechanics which carried over from the previous iterations is <a href="V.A.T.S.">V.A.T.S.</a> (Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System). While using V.A.T.S., real-time combat is slowed, allowing the player to choose where to shoot the enemy: shooting enemies in the head will typically result in death while shooting their legs can slow them. Weapons can also be shot at to disarm the enemy. Using V.A.T.S. lowers the player's <a href="action%20points">stamina</a> (Action Points, or AP). Some actions are unavailable to the player if their stamina is insufficient, in which case the player has to wait for their AP to regenerate. The use of <a href="Power%20armor">Power Armor</a> in combat increases the rate at which the player's AP are used. The <a href="Pip%20boy">Pip-Boy</a>, a small computer strapped to the character's wrist, also plays a role in both "Fallout 4" and "Far Harbor". It contains a menu which the player can access to view maps, statistics, data, and items, and when the player is able to visit Far Harbor, the Pip-boy will receive a signal from Valentine's Detective Agency.

The expansion is set on a <a href="post-apocalyptic">post-apocalyptic</a> version of <a href="Mount%20Desert%20Island">Mount Desert Island</a>, known in-game as The Island, which is north-east of the Commonwealth, "Fallout"s post-apocalyptic version of <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside the fog are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn the fog into liquid in order to protect its inhabitants.

There are three major conflicting factions present in the expansion, all residing in separate areas: the Harbormen of Far Harbor; the synth (synthetic humans) colony of Acadia; and the Church of the Children of Atom. The Harbormen of Far Harbor are led by the town leader, Captain Avery, and seek to reclaim The Island from the fog that has gradually driven them out of their homes. The Children of Atom live in an old nuclear submarine base called the Nucleus and are led by High Confessor Tektus. Tektus is a fanatical follower of the Church of Atom who seeks to disable or destroy the fog condensers. The refuge for the synth colony of Acadia is an abandoned research center at the top of The Island; the group are led by a mysterious prototype synth called DiMA. DiMA is friendly to both the Harbormen and the Children so long as Acadia remains autonomous and isolated from the rest of the world.

Valentine's Detective Agency receives a request for help from Kenji and Rei Nakano, a husband and wife living in a remote corner of the Commonwealth: their daughter, Kasumi, has vanished without a trace or explanation. The Sole Survivor is sent to investigate, discovers Kasumi had been in contact with Acadia and borrows Kenji's boat to follow her. Arriving in the town of Far Harbor, the Sole Survivor finds The Island locked in a tense stalemate between the local residents and the Children of Atom. With the aid of a local hunter and one of the Harbormen named Old Longfellow, the Sole Survivor finds Kasumi living in Acadia. Kasumi has come to believe that she is a synth, and has sought refuge in Acadia, even though she has started to doubt the intentions of DiMA. At Kasumi's behest, the Sole Survivor switches focus to investigating DiMA, and gradually learns he has consciously chosen to store some of his memories on hard drives outside of his body. He has hidden them inside a computer simulation in the Children of Atom's base, the Nucleus, but has grown increasingly concerned that if the Children access the memories, they will have the means to destroy Far Harbor. The Sole Survivor approaches the Children of Atom to recover DiMA's memories and learns that he put in place a series of fail-safes to protect Acadia, and to preserve the balance of power between Far Harbor and the Children of Atom. These are the access codes to a nuclear warhead, stored within the Nucleus, and the means to sabotage the fog condensers protecting Far Harbor. The Sole Survivor also discovers that DiMA murdered Captain Avery and replaced her with a synth to maintain peace between Far Harbor and Acadia.

There are eight possible endings. The Sole Survivor is faced with a choice: to destroy Far Harbor, to destroy the Children of Atom, or to inform the people of Far Harbor of DiMA's crime and trigger a feud between the Harbormen and Acadia. Should the player choose to detonate the warhead, the Harbormen will take control of the island, while if the player destroys the fog condensers, the Children will become dominant. In both scenarios Acadia will be spared, though DiMA will disapprove of the player's actions. Alternatively, if the player confronts DiMA over Avery's murder, Acadia may become hostile. The Sole Survivor is able to establish a more permanent peace between all parties by assassinating or chasing away High Confessor Tektus, and allowing DiMA to replace him with a synth who will adopt a more moderate stance towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can choose to make the main factions aware of Acadia's existence. If so, The Institute, a scientific organization that made the synths, will send agents to reclaim the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a quasi-religious organization rooted in the United States Armed Forces, will launch an expedition to exterminate them. The Railroad, a group opposed to the existence of The Institute with the aim of freeing sentient synths, will send an operative to make contact with Acadia, though the latter will reject their help.

In the aftermath, the Sole Survivor returns to the Nakano family back in the Commonwealth. Kasumi, depending on the player's choices, may return with the player character or stay in Acadia.

"Far Harbor" was developed by <a href="Bethesda%20Game%20Studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and was announced three months after the official release of "Fallout 4"—alongside "", "", and teasers of other upcoming expansions—in a blog post on February 16, 2016. The expansion was released on May 19, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>. Of the first three expansions, "Far Harbor" added the largest landmass, and was consequently sold at a higher price. It also added new dungeons (self-contained quest locations), quests, creatures, and other miscellaneous features. The expansion was included in the "Fallout 4" <a href="Season%20ticket">season pass</a>, a collection of all the expansion packs. Because of the large amount of additional content, the price for the pass was increased from US$30 to $50.

The expansion was influenced by feedback from players regarding the <a href="Dialog%20tree">dialogue system</a> in "Fallout 4", which "didn't work as well as other features". The dialogue system in "<a href="Fallout%20%28series%29">Fallout</a>" games allows the players to converse with and influence the non-player characters. The dialogue options in "Far Harbor" were designed to give players more flexibility in bringing the game to an end, with the expansion featuring more dialogue choices. The development team also found players were interested in visiting new locations, adding inspiration to "Far Harbor" albeit at increased development cost and time to completion.

Two weeks after the expansion's official release, the PlayStation 4 version was re-released to fix performance issues. In a performance analysis by "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>"'s Digital Foundry, it was discovered that although "Fallout 4" typically ran at 30 <a href="frames%20per%20second">frames per second</a> (fps), when the player was outside and, in "Far Harbor"s foggy <a href="biome">biome</a>s, the frame rate could drop to 15 fps, and could drop even lower during action-oriented events such as firefights. In the same analysis, the Xbox One version was found to run at 20–30 fps but experienced various issues, such as stuttering and software lock-ups. The update toned down the level of fog, and was successful in making the game more stable.

"Fallout 4: Far Harbor" was released to "generally favorable" reviews, according to the <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. The new quests drew praise from reviewers, though the puzzle sections were criticized. In particular, Dan Stapleton ("<a href="IGN">IGN</a>") expressed admiration for the new quests but said that the puzzle rooms were "so hard to fail I'm not sure why Bethesda bothered". He also mentioned that the "Far Harbor" expansion contained some of the strongest quest content in "Fallout 4". Peter Brown ("<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>") commended the addition of "hours of side quests driven by curious characters", and the staff at "Game Central" agreed. Matt Wittaker ("<a href="Hardcore%20Gamer">Hardcore Gamer</a>") appreciated the quests: he praised the main questline for its focus on "moral ambiguity and tough choices", saying that that was what "Fallout" fans were seeking. The reviewers for "Game Revolution" and "GameCentral" disliked the puzzles, as did Jack de Quidt ("<a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a>") who regarded them as very frustrating even though he felt they were "a small part of the release". Both de Quidt and the "Game Revolution" reviewer considered the engine insufficient for the intricate puzzle sequences. Several reviewers made comparisons to the video game "<a href="Minecraft">Minecraft</a>" when talking about the block-related content added in the expansion.

Reviewers had varying opinions on the atmosphere and the fog. Stapleton commended the majority of the content except the fog, which he felt became annoying after a time, but Matt Wittaker thought the fog was not much of a nuisance if the player's character was built to mitigate radiation. David Ambrosini ("IGN") and Christopher Livingston ("<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>") both praised the atmosphere; with Livingston saying "you can literally taste [it]". Reviewers were also divided over the storyline, with the writers for "Game Revolution" admiring the story and new characters, while Peter Brown found them uninteresting.

Some reviewers did not like the expansion's repetitiveness, and Nic Rowen ("<a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a>") was disappointed with the lack of uniqueness in the release. Chad Sapieha ("<a href="National%20Post">Post Arcade</a>") said that he was growing weary of the repetitive small tasks like managing loot, and traveling between settlements just to dispose of it; he added that he was done with "Fallout 4" and its DLC and was prepared to move onto a further installment. David Soriano ("IGN") commended the extensive size of the map but felt it was somewhat wasted. Alice Bell ("VideoGamer.com") and the reviewers at "GameCentral" praised the value for money: Bell said that "Far Harbor" was the best of the first three expansion packs for getting "the most <a href="Bang%20for%20the%20buck">bang for your buck</a>", even taking into account the design flaws.
In July 2016, <a href="Mod%20DB">Mod DB</a> user Guillaume Veer, going by the online <a href="alias%20name">alias</a> of BaronVonChateau, accused Bethesda of copying one of his "" <a href="game%20mod">mods</a>, named "Autumn Leaves". Comparing the plot of "Autumn Leaves" and one of "Far Harbor"s quests called Brain Dead, Veer described both as having “a colorful cast of eccentric robots, in charge of a forgotten Vault where a strange murder happened". Pete Hines, the <a href="Vice%20president%23In%20business">vice president</a> of Bethesda's marketing team, responded with: "we love our mod community and would never disrespect them", adding that any similarities were completely coincidental.

Other similarities were discussed in an article by Mat Paget ("GameSpot"), such as the fact that both "Far Harbor" and "Autumn Leaves" feature the ability to use the character's voice to determine whether they are a robot. Veer noted that he was not upset with the similarities, saying that he takes inspiration from other games too: "I seriously think this is perfectly okay. After all, Autumn Leaves' inspirations are countless ... and being influenced is a natural part of the writing process." Veer said that having the names of modders in the game's credits for acknowledgement would be beneficial. He also said that he was comfortable even if Bethesda did deliberately use content from "Autumn Leaves", and wrote that "I honestly thought Bethesda’s staff played Autumn Leaves, had a blast with it, took some things out of it and made their own thing for Far Harbor. ... And I seriously think this is perfectly okay."

Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?

"Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" is the seventh episode of the <a href="Private%20Practice%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> of the American television <a href="medical%20drama">medical drama</a> "<a href="Private%20Practice%20%28TV%20series%29">Private Practice</a>" and the show's 61st episode overall. Written by <a href="Shonda%20Rhimes">Shonda Rhimes</a> and directed by <a href="Allison%20Liddi-Brown">Allison Liddi-Brown</a>, the episode was originally broadcast on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> in the United States on November 4, 2010. "Private Practice" centers on a group of young doctors working in a <a href="medicine">private medical practice</a>, and this episode deals with the immediate aftermath of <a href="Charlotte%20King">Charlotte King</a>'s rape.

The episode, written in collaboration with the <a href="Rape%2C%20Abuse%20%26amp%3B%20Incest%20National%20Network">Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network</a> (RAINN), revolved around <a href="KaDee%20Strickland">KaDee Strickland</a>'s character, Charlotte, and was intended to accurately portray a victim's recovery from rape. <a href="Nicholas%20Brendon">Nicholas Brendon</a> guest-starred as Lee McHenry, and Blue Deckert appeared as detective Joe Price. "Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" earned Rhimes, Strickland, and the series several awards and nominations and was well received by critics, with Strickland's character and performance praised. The initial broadcast was viewed by 10.18 million people, received a 3.9/11 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">Nielsen rating/share</a> in the 18–49 demographic, and had the fifth-highest number of viewers that night.

The episode opens with St. Ambrose Hospital chief of staff <a href="Charlotte%20King">Charlotte King</a> (<a href="KaDee%20Strickland">KaDee Strickland</a>) hiding in a supply closet after being raped in her office. Alternative-medicine specialist <a href="Pete%20Wilder">Dr. Pete Wilder</a> (<a href="Tim%20Daly">Tim Daly</a>) finds and examines her, diagnosing a broken wrist, eye socket and nose and a deep arm laceration, and admits her to the hospital. King lies to Wilder, telling him that she was injured in a mugging. Wilder calls the police; King attempts to contact her boyfriend, <a href="Cooper%20Freedman">Dr. Cooper Freedman</a> (<a href="Paul%20Adelstein">Paul Adelstein</a>), but cannot reach him because he is out drinking with <a href="Amelia%20Shepherd">Dr. Amelia Shepherd</a> (<a href="Caterina%20Scorsone">Caterina Scorsone</a>) and <a href="Sam%20Bennett%20%28Private%20Practice%29">Dr. Sam Bennett</a> (<a href="Taye%20Diggs">Taye Diggs</a>). At the police station psychiatrist <a href="Sheldon%20Wallace">Sheldon Wallace</a> (<a href="Brian%20Benben">Brian Benben</a>) interrogates Lee McHenry (<a href="Nicholas%20Brendon">Nicholas Brendon</a>), who was found with blood on his clothes. After nurses photograph King's injuries, <a href="Addison%20Montgomery">Dr. Addison Montgomery</a> (<a href="Kate%20Walsh%20%28actress%29">Kate Walsh</a>) realizes that King was raped and offers her a <a href="rape%20kit">rape kit</a>. During her <a href="pelvic%20examination">pelvic examination</a>, King refuses the rape kit and tells Montgomery not to tell anyone else about the rape. Freedman arrives with Shepherd and Bennett, and is surprised at the extent of King's injuries. During the <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>, King and Shepherd bond over their shared <a href="drug%20addiction">drug addiction</a> when King refuses pain medication. Shepherd admits drinking alcohol again, and King offers to take her to <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> meetings. Shepherd <a href="Surgical%20suture">sutures</a> King's wounds, which causes King great pain; Freedman feels powerless, unable to protect her.

Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after discovering his girlfriend's infidelity but denies that the blood on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery that she does not understand what it is like to be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist <a href="Violet%20Turner">Violet Turner</a> (<a href="Amy%20Brenneman">Amy Brenneman</a>) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the <a href="fetal%20abduction">fetal abduction</a> she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.

The 43-minute episode was written by <a href="Shonda%20Rhimes">Shonda Rhimes</a> and directed by <a href="Allison%20Liddi-Brown">Allison Liddi-Brown</a>. Christal A. Khatib edited the music, and Gregory Van Horn was its production designer. <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>'s "<a href="Prelude%20and%20Fugue%20in%20C%20major%2C%20BWV%20846">Prelude and Fugue in C</a>" was played during the opening sequence. Rhimes wrote the episode in collaboration with the <a href="Rape%2C%20Abuse%20%26amp%3B%20Incest%20National%20Network">Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network</a> (RAINN) to ensure that King's recovery was presented as accurately as possible. She later called it one of her favorites from the series and said, "I feel like I changed as a writer writing that episode."

Approached by Rhimes about the concept, Strickland agreed to the storyline on the conditions that it would not be limited to a single episode and would significantly impact the character. She liked the script, describing it as "humanizing the victims and just really creating a legitimate experience for the audience in a way that you may not see on network television". As well as communicating with RAINN representatives, the actress visited the Rape Treatment Center at <a href="UCLA%20Medical%20Center%2C%20Santa%20Monica">UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica</a> and saw a young girl being admitted, which shaped her performance. Strickland also researched reactions to sexual assault by survivors, their friends and families. The decision to portray King's resistance to reporting her rape was reached after consultation with the Rape Treatment Center. Strickland defended the choice, calling it an essential aspect of King's character development. Most of the episode focused on King's psychological response to the rape. According to Strickland,

The actress described the filming of the rape as easier than the scenes depicting its aftermath, which she called "psychologically ... [and] ... physically hard". Strickland and Brendon agreed on a <a href="safeword">safeword</a> when they filmed the rape, due to its brutality. The scene affected Strickland to the extent that she found it difficult to act on the set on which the rape was shot. The actress called the filming process "intense" and "truthful", but "by no means is any of that even comparable to anything that women and men have had experience with". Brendon was cast against type as McHenry, King's rapist, since he is primarily known for portraying the comedic <a href="Xander%20Harris">Xander Harris</a> in "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>". Strickland said that Brendon's character should not be interpreted as crazy, because perpetrators of rape are "people who are around us all the time"; she called Brendon's acceptance of the role "brave".

According to Strickland, every character on the show was affected by King's rape. The episode explored Freedman's identity and response as the partner of a rape victim, with Adelstein identifying his character as "a conscious 21st-century male" in his interactions with King. According to Strickland, Montgomery's decision to use the rape kit on King without her knowledge would be a major storyline in the future and Turner would become persistent in getting help for King after learning about the rape since the characters had similar traumatic experiences. A behind-the-scenes feature about the episode and others involving King's rape, "An Inside Look: The Violation of Charlotte King", was included on the fourth-season DVD and Blu-ray releases.

"Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" was originally broadcast on November 4, 2010 in the United States on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> network. The episode was viewed by a total of 10.18 million people, and had a 44 percent increase from the previous episode "All in the Family", which earned an average rating of 7.68. Although it was the fifth-highest-rated show that night (behind <a href="CBS">CBS</a>'s "<a href="The%20Big%20Bang%20Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a>", "<a href="%24h%2A%21%20My%20Dad%20Says">$h*! My Dad Says</a>", "" and "<a href="The%20Mentalist">The Mentalist</a>"), its 3.9/11 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> topped the 10:00 <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern</a> time slot for the <a href="Nielsen%20ratings%23Ratings/share%20and%20total%20viewers">rating and share</a> percentages of the 18–49 demographic. The episode was aired with a <a href="Television%20content%20rating%20systems">message encouraging viewer discretion</a>, due to its violence. The following episode "What Happens Next" saw a decrease in ratings, and was viewed by a total of 8.21 million people.

The critical response was largely positive, with a "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" writer ranking "Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" one of 2010's top 25 television episodes. Alec Stern of "<a href="The%20Michigan%20Daily">The Michigan Daily</a>" cited the episode as an example of the show's improved quality, and <a href="The%20Futon%20Critic">The Futon Critic</a>'s Brian Ford Sullivan also included it in his list of 50 best episodes of 2010. Strickland's performance received an overwhelmingly positive response after the episode first aired. The reviewer from "TV Guide" felt that Strickland's performance was worthy of an Emmy, and that the first time Freedman saw King's injuries was "like we weren't even watching TV anymore". A <a href="TVLine">TVLine</a> post later listed Strickland as one of the Emmy Awards' 21 biggest snubs. "<a href="E%21%20News">E! News</a>" <a href="Kristin%20dos%20Santos">Kristin dos Santos</a> also praised Strickland's portrayal of King, writing that she deserved an Emmy nomination, and Winston Mize of SpoilerTV wrote that Strickland was "robbed. of. all. the. awards". "TV Fanatic" Steve Marsi liked the episode, saying that its pacing and Strickland's performance immersed the audience despite the difficult subject matter.

The treatment of rape in the episode has been widely praised by television critics. SpoilerTV's Winston Mize felt that it was one of Rhimes' best shows, and that it avoided a preachy or excessively-dramatic take on rape. JeromeWetzelTV of <a href="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a> found the episode "disturbing, intense, tragic, and moving", with the rape handled delicately and responsibly. "E! News"' Jennifer Arrow described the rape scene as "the most realistic depiction of rape in media history" and noted Brendon's casting as an evil character in contrast with his more light-hearted performance as Harris in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".

The depiction of King's rape and its aftermath was compared to similar storylines on other shows. Arrow called it part of the "rape-on-TV trend", linking King's rape with those of <a href="Gemma%20Teller%20Morrow">Gemma Teller Morrow</a> of <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a>'s crime drama "<a href="Sons%20of%20Anarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a>" and <a href="Naomi%20Clark">Naomi Clark</a> of <a href="the%20CW">the CW</a> teen drama "<a href="90210%20%28TV%20series%29">90210</a>". According to Arrow, all three characters were "strong, no-nonsense ladies who generally dominate their environments" and did not report their rape. She asked if each show's decision for the victim not to report the rape was part of a larger cultural belief that "trusts in women who keep their silence". "TV Fanatic" Steve Marsi called the episode reminiscent of "" in its presentation of events in real time and emphasis on character reactions. "The Michigan Daily" Alec Stern called sexual assault "a crutch Shonda Rhimes has turned to in all three of her series", writing that the development of King's character was superior to the storyline of <a href="Mellie%20Grant">Mellie Grant</a>'s rape on the ABC drama "<a href="Scandal%20%28TV%20series%29">Scandal</a>".

The episode was cited at the 2011 <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Television Academy Honors</a> for exemplifying "Television with a Conscience". The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences praised the episode for "master[ing] the gut-wrenching crime of sexual assault". "Private Practice" received the award in 2010 for its approach to <a href="Assisted%20suicide">physician-assisted suicide</a> in the <a href="Private%20Practice%20%28season%202%29">second-season</a> episode, "Nothing to Fear", and a drama-series <a href="Women%27s%20Image%20Network%20Awards">Women's Image Network Award</a> at the 13th annual WIN awards. "Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" was a finalist for the Sentinel for Health Award for Primetime Drama (Major Storyline) for its representation of rape, losing to the <a href="Parenthood%20%282010%20TV%20series%29">"Parenthood"</a> episode <a href="Parenthood%20%28season%202%29">"Qualities and Difficulties"</a> (which focused on <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>). The show was nominated for the PRISM Award for Drama Series Multi-Episode Storyline (Mental Health) for "Did You Hear What Happened to Charlotte King?" and the following episodes, "What Happens Next" and "Can't Find My Way Back Home", losing to the first two seasons of "Parenthood".

Rhimes and Strickland received a RAINN Hope Award in recognition of "their efforts in educating the public about sexual assault prevention". Strickland said that she considered submitting the episode, or the later episodes "Can't Find My Way Home" or "Blind Love," for consideration at the <a href="63rd%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">63rd Primetime Emmy Awards</a>, but she did not receive a nomination. The actress received the Female Performance in a Drama Series Multi-Episode Storyline award at the 2011 PRISM Awards. Rhimes received the <a href="NAACP%20Image%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20in%20a%20Dramatic%20Series">NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series</a> at the 2011 NAACP Awards for her work on the episode.

After its broadcast, RAINN had a "500-percent increase in service requests" (which temporarily crashed its website). Strickland participated in a <a href="public%20service%20announcement">public service announcement</a> to increase awareness of rape and sexual abuse, and said that she had received many emails from survivors of sexual assault. After her work on the episode, RAINN called the actress a "vocal advocate for using DNA evidence in solving rape cases".

Boeing CH-47 Chinook in Australian service

The <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> has operated <a href="Boeing%20CH-47%20Chinook">Boeing CH-47 Chinook</a> heavy-lift helicopters for most of the period since 1974. Thirty of the type have entered Australian service, comprising twelve CH-47C variants, eight CH-47Ds and ten CH-47Fs. The helicopters have been operated by both the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) and <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>.

An initial order of eight Chinooks for the RAAF was placed in 1962, but soon cancelled in favour of more urgent priorities. The Australian military still required helicopters of this type, and twelve CH-47C Chinooks were ordered in 1970. The CH-47s entered service with the RAAF in December 1974. The eleven surviving Chinooks were retired in 1989 as a cost-saving measure, but it was found that the Australian Defence Force's other helicopters could not replace their capabilities. As a result, four of the CH-47Cs were upgraded to CH-47D standard, and returned to service in 1995 with the Australian Army. The Army acquired two more CH-47Ds in 2000 and another pair in 2012. The CH-47Ds were replaced with seven new CH-47F aircraft during 2015, and another three were delivered in 2016.

The Chinooks have mainly been used to support the Australian Army, though they have performed a wide range of other tasks. Three Chinooks took part in the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Iraq War</a> during 2003, when they transported supplies and Australian special forces. A detachment of two Chinooks was also <a href="Operation%20Slipper">deployed to Afghanistan</a> during the northern spring and summer months for each year between 2006 and 2007 and 2008 to 2013, seeing extensive combat. Two of the CH-47s deployed to Afghanistan were destroyed as a result of crashes. The helicopters have also frequently been assigned to assist recovery efforts following natural disasters and undertook a range of civilian construction tasks while being operated by the RAAF.

During the early 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) considered new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas Dakota</a>s. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou</a>s. The RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the intended role and preferred a more sophisticated aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.
This disagreement ended in September 1962. As part of the expansion of the military in response to Indonesia's policy of <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">"confrontation"</a> with its neighbours, the RAAF was directed by the Australian Government to conduct an urgent evaluation of <a href="STOL">short takeoff and landing</a> aircraft and heavy-lift helicopters that could be purchased to improve the Army's tactical mobility. A team of seven RAAF officers headed by Group Captain <a href="Charles%20Read%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Read</a>, the director of operational requirements, was immediately dispatched to the United States and assessed the <a href="Sikorsky%20S-61">Sikorsky S-61</a>, <a href="Boeing%20Vertol%20CH-46%20Sea%20Knight">Boeing Vertol 107-II</a> and CH-47 Chinook helicopters. The team judged the Chinook to be clearly the most suitable of these types, and recommended that several be acquired; this was in line with the Army's preference. The Government subsequently accepted a recommendation made by the RAAF to acquire a package of twelve Caribou fixed-wing aircraft and eight Chinooks, and placed an order for these aircraft within weeks of the evaluation. The Chinook order was cancelled by the Government when it was learned that it would take several years for the helicopters to be delivered, and the RAAF's orders of Caribous and <a href="Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois">Bell UH-1 Iroquois</a> tactical transport helicopters were expanded instead.
The Australian military continued to consider options to acquire heavy-lift helicopters throughout the 1960s, and a formal program to achieve this goal was initiated by the RAAF in 1969. At this time the helicopters were intended to be deployed to South Vietnam as part of the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">Australian contribution to the Vietnam War</a>. Another team of Air Force officers travelled to the United States, and evaluated the <a href="Sikorsky%20CH-53%20Sea%20Stallion">Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion</a> and the Chinook. The team leader, Group Captain <a href="Peter%20Raw">Peter Raw</a>, recommended that CH-53s be ordered. Senior RAAF officers and the Army were not pleased with this outcome, and the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Air Board</a> rejected Raw's report. Read, who was now an <a href="air%20vice-marshal">air vice-marshal</a> and <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">deputy chief of the air staff</a>, was directed to review the choice of helicopters, and again recommended that Chinooks be acquired. He justified this choice on the grounds that the Chinook could carry more cargo than the CH-53 and was better suited for operations in the mountains of the Australian-administered <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua%20and%20New%20Guinea">Territory of Papua and New Guinea</a>. Read's recommendation was accepted by the Government, and an order for twelve CH-47C Chinooks was placed in August 1970. It was planned to rotate the helicopters in and out of service, six being available at any time. The order was suspended later in 1970 when a series of engine problems affected the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>'s CH-47Cs, but was reinstated in March 1972 after these issues were resolved. The total cost of the purchase was $A37 million. The order made Australia the CH-47's first export customer.

The contract for the Chinooks included an <a href="offset%20agreement">offset agreement</a> with Boeing through which the firm gave Australian companies opportunities to manufacture components of both the RAAF's helicopters and those destined for other customers. This was the first of several such agreements that were included in Australian military aircraft procurement contracts during the 1970s and 1980s, the goal being to assist the local <a href="Defence%20industry%20of%20Australia">defence industry</a> to access international markets. This agreement had some benefits, as several of the participating Australian companies upgraded their factories to manufacture complex elements of the CH-47. The offset contracts for the Chinook concluded in the early 1980s, but the improved equipment and manufacturing processes were employed in the project to build <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet%20in%20Australian%20service">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> fighter aircraft in Australia between 1985 and 1990. In line with the RAAF's procurement and support philosophy and the aim of ensuring that the force was self-sufficient, a very large quantity of spare parts for the CH-47Cs was also ordered; in 1993 it was reported that this was the second-largest stockpile of Chinook spare parts after that held by Boeing, and was worth more than $A120 million.

It was decided to station the Chinooks at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, as it was located at the midpoint between the Army's main field formations that were based on the outskirts of <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in New South Wales and the north Queensland city of <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>. Construction began on support facilities for the helicopters at Amberley shortly after the order for them was confirmed in 1972.

<a href="No.%2012%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 12 Squadron</a> was re-raised at Amberley on 3 September 1973 to operate the Chinooks. This unit had flown bombers between 1939 and 1948 before being renumbered <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>. The twelve CH-47s were transported from the United States to Australia on board the aircraft carrier , and were unloaded at Brisbane on 28 March 1974. No. 12 Squadron began training flights on 8 July 1974, and the unit was declared operational in December the next year. The squadron typically had between four and six CH-47Cs operational at any time throughout the type's service, the fleet being rotated through long-term storage at RAAF Base Amberley as planned. In November 1980, eight Chinooks were simultaneously operational for the first time, and a <a href="Formation%20flying">formation flight</a> was conducted to mark the occasion. The CH-47Cs had a crew of four, comprising two pilots, a <a href="loadmaster">loadmaster</a> and one other, and could transport up to 33 passengers or of cargo. The helicopters were assigned <a href="Aircraft%20registration">serial numbers</a> A15-001 to A15-012.

The Chinooks' main role was to support the Army. The helicopters were used to transport troops, artillery guns, ammunition, fuel and other supplies. They also provided part of the <a href="aeromedical%20evacuation">aeromedical evacuation</a> capability available to the Army. While the Chinooks generally operated in <a href="Northern%20Australia">Northern Australia</a>, they made frequent deployments to other parts of Australia, and No. 12 Squadron conducted an annual high-altitude flying training exercise in <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. As part of the security measures introduced after the <a href="Sydney%20Hilton%20Hotel%20bombing">Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing</a> on 13 February 1978, Chinooks were used to transport Australian Prime Minister <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> and several other national leaders from Sydney to <a href="Bowral">Bowral</a> for a <a href="Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting">Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting</a>. In August 1980, a CH-47 was flown from Amberley to <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, and used to recover a <a href="Royal%20Malaysian%20Air%20Force">Royal Malaysian Air Force</a> S-61 helicopter that had crashed in a remote location. This involved a return trip of , which was believed to have been the longest distance a helicopter had flown up to that time and remains the longest flight to have been conducted by a RAAF helicopter.

During their RAAF service, the Chinooks also undertook a range of non-military tasks. The helicopters frequently formed part of the Australian Defence Force's response to natural disasters, including by delivering food for people and livestock cut off by floods. They were also used for civilian construction tasks such as emplacing <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>s and carrying air conditioning plants to the top of tall buildings. On two occasions Chinooks supported <a href="Queensland%20Police%20Service">Queensland Police Service</a> drug eradication efforts in remote parts of the state by transporting fuel for RAAF Iroquois helicopters and carrying seized narcotics. In August 1981, two CH-47s lifted containers from the cargo ship "Waigani Express" to enable the vessel to be refloated after it ran aground in the <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a>. A similar operation was undertaken to free the "Anro Asia" when it ran aground near <a href="Caloundra">Caloundra</a>, Queensland, in November the same year. Another unusual task was conducted in December 1981 when a Chinook transported two bulldozers onto a grounded iron ore carrier near <a href="Port%20Hedland%2C%20Western%20Australia">Port Hedland, Western Australia</a>, so that they could be used to reposition the ship's load.

The RAAF's Chinook fleet suffered two serious accidents. On 26 June 1975, A15-011 crashed when one of its engine turbines disintegrated; none of its crew were injured. <a href="No.%203%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 3 Aircraft Depot</a> was assigned responsibility for repairing the helicopter, but it did not reenter service until 21 May 1981 as the maintenance unit lacked experience with major helicopter repairs. On 4 February 1985, A15-001 struck power lines and crashed into <a href="Perseverance%20Dam">Perseverance Dam</a> near <a href="Toowoomba">Toowoomba</a>, Queensland, while undertaking a navigation exercise. The helicopter's pilot, an exchange officer from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, was killed and the other three aircrew suffered minor injuries. The helicopter was written off and used as a fire training aid at Amberley. A court of inquiry found that A15-001's crew had been unaware of the presence of power lines in the area as they were not marked on the maps used to plan the flight, and were difficult to see from a moving helicopter. The inquiry also judged that the mission had been inadequately planned, and recommended that No. 12 Squadron update the master map used for preparing operations in the Amberley region to ensure that it included all flying hazards.

In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence <a href="Kim%20Beazley">Kim Beazley</a> decided to transfer all of the RAAF's Iroquois and <a href="Sikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk</a> battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The reduction of the RAAF's helicopter fleet increased the cost of operating the Chinooks due to the loss of <a href="economies%20of%20scale">economies of scale</a>, and made it more difficult to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF proposed transferring the Chinooks, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawks operational may have influenced this position, the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex type.

The RAAF and Army jointly decided to withdraw the Chinooks from service in May 1989. This decision was made to reduce costs, the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient air lift capability. No. 12 Squadron ceased flying on 30 June 1989, and was disbanded on 25 August that year. The CH-47Cs were placed in storage at Amberley.

While it was intended to sell the Chinooks after they were withdrawn from service, experience soon demonstrated that the Black Hawks were unable to fully replace them. In particular, it was found that heavy-lift helicopters were needed to transport fuel supplies for the Black Hawks during exercises and operations. As a result, plans to sell the Chinooks were put on hold in late 1989, and the Army and RAAF began investigating options to reactivate them. The 1991 Force Structure Review recommended that between four and six Chinooks—preferably upgraded to CH-47D standard—be reactivated to support the Black Hawks.

A deal to upgrade several of the Chinooks was reached in June 1993. Under this arrangement, seven of the surviving CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly cover the cost of upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The project's total cost was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville. It was also decided at this time to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army, as the RAAF no longer had significant expertise in operating the type and such a change would concentrate all the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service. The CH-47D variant of the Chinook was based on the C variant's airframe, and had improved engines and rotors, as well as upgraded avionics. These modifications resulted in the type having superior performance as well as lower operating costs.

All eleven CH-47Cs were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. The four CH-47Ds upgraded were the former A15-002, 003, 004, and 006, now renumbered A15-102, 103, 104, and 106 respectively. They were assigned to C Squadron of the <a href="5th%20Aviation%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">5th Aviation Regiment</a>, which was based at Townsville, and also comprised two squadrons equipped with Black Hawks as well as six Iroquois helicopters used as <a href="Attack%20helicopter">gunships</a>. The Regiment's experiences during the 1990s demonstrated that four Chinooks were not sufficient to meet the ADF's needs, leading to an order for two newly-built CH-47Ds in 1998. These helicopters were delivered in 2001, and designated A15-201 and A15-202.

Following their transfer to the Army, the Chinooks were used in similar roles to those they had undertaken in RAAF service. The first operational deployment of the Army Chinooks began in October 1997, when two of the helicopters and three Black Hawks that were in Papua New Guinea as part of a training exercise were tasked with delivering food supplies to the highlands of the country following a severe drought. The Chinooks were also used to transport fuel supplies for the other ADF aircraft and helicopters involved in this effort. At this time, the deployment of two Chinooks was the largest possible given the need to reserve other CH-47s for training tasks and rotate the fleet through maintenance periods. The Chinooks returned to Australia in March 1998.
In 2003 a detachment of three CH-47Ds was deployed to the Middle East as part of the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq</a>. The detachment formed part of the Special Operations Task Group, and operated from Jordan to transport supplies and personnel for Australian special forces units. Two histories published in 2004 stated that the helicopters entered Western Iraq throughout the initial stage of the conflict. A 2005 history also stated that one of the tasks undertaken by the detachment was flying commandos from the <a href="4th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> to <a href="Al%20Asad%20Airbase">Al Asad Airbase</a> within Iraq after the facility was captured by <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment">Special Air Service Regiment</a> units. However, an uncompleted internal Army history of the deployment of Australian forces to the Iraq War—released in 2017 following a freedom of information request—stated that as the Chinooks were not equipped with missile countermeasure systems and their pilots had not been trained to insert special forces behind enemy lines, they had been prohibited from entering Iraq and remained in Jordan throughout the conflict. This history stated that "it is not possible to explain the rationale" for the deployment of the CH-47s given their unsuitability for operations within Iraq, and judged that the main achievement of the detachment had been to free up British and American helicopters for other tasks.

During 2005 the Australian Government decided to deploy Chinooks to Afghanistan as part of the <a href="Operation%20Slipper">Australian forces in the country</a>. The need to prepare for this task contributed to a decision in October that year to dispatch Black Hawks rather than Chinooks to Pakistan as part of Australia's contribution to the international relief efforts which followed the <a href="2005%20Kashmir%20earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a>, despite the Chinooks being better suited for operations at the high altitudes affected by the disaster. In November 2005 the Government authorised a program of urgent upgrades to the CH-47Ds to improve their combat readiness ahead of being deployed to Afghanistan. The upgrades included fitting the helicopters with extra armour as well as new electronic warfare and communications systems. The helicopters' machine guns were also replaced with <a href="minigun">minigun</a>s. A longer-term plan to upgrade the helicopters, designated Phase 5 of project AIR 9000, was also in place at this time. This was to involve two sub-phases: under Phase 5A new engines were purchased in December 2004, and were scheduled to be fitted in late 2006. It was also planned to put the helicopters through a <a href="mid-life%20update">mid-life update</a> as part of Phase 5B, enabling them to remain in service until around 2025. Following the RAAF's acquisition of <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%20III%20in%20Australian%20service">Boeing C-17 Globemaster III</a> large transport aircraft in 2007, the Chinooks were transported by air on occasion. However, it took one and a half days worth of work to prepare the CH-47Ds for air transport.

A detachment of two Chinooks operated in Afghanistan during 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The detachment was designated the Aviation Support Element during 2006 and 2007, and renamed the Rotary Wing Group in 2008. The initial detachment arrived at <a href="Kandahar%20International%20Airport">Kandahar International Airport</a> in March 2006, and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country. The upgrades the helicopters had received proved successful, and allowed them to operate in combat alongside other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn in September 2006 the helicopters remained in the country and were used to support Coalition forces, with a particular emphasis on the Australian units located in <a href="Urozgan%20Province">Urozgan Province</a>. The detachment was withdrawn to Australia in February 2007, and did not deploy again until February 2008. During this period all six helicopters received further upgrades, which included new engines and <a href="Blue%20Force%20Tracking">blue force tracker</a> equipment. During subsequent years the detachment was withdrawn to Australia over the Afghan winters, and redeployed each northern spring. As the Chinooks' tasking was controlled by the <a href="International%20Security%20Assistance%20Force">International Security Assistance Force</a>, the ADF chartered a Russian <a href="Mil%20Mi-26">Mil Mi-26</a> between 2010 and 2013 to provide the Australian forces in Afghanistan with a dedicated heavylift helicopter. By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013, the helicopters had flown more than 6,000 hours in combat and transported almost 40,000 personnel. Preparing for and sustaining the Rotary Wing Group rotations absorbed most of C Squadron's resources throughout this period, and Chinooks were rarely available for other Army training or operational tasks.

Two Australian CH-47Ds were destroyed in Afghanistan. On 30 May 2011, A15-102 crashed in <a href="Zabul%20Province">Zabul Province</a>, resulting in the death of an Army <a href="unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">unmanned aerial vehicle</a> pilot who was travelling on board as a passenger. As it was impractical to recover the helicopter, it was destroyed by Coalition forces. The official inquiry into the crash found that it was caused by a known issue in which Chinooks suffered uncommanded pitch oscillations while flying through <a href="Density%20of%20air">dense air</a>, and that the aircrew had not been adequately trained to prevent such incidents. A15-103 was written off following a hard landing in <a href="Kandahar%20Province">Kandahar Province</a> on 22 June 2012; one of the crew members suffered minor injuries. Both of the Chinooks at Kandahar International Airport in April 2013 also suffered significant damage when the airport was struck by a severe hail storm. Two ex-US Army CH-47Ds were purchased in December 2011 to replace A15-102, and arrived in Australia in January 2012; these helicopters were designated A15-151 and A15-152.

A decision by the US Army in the mid-2000s to replace all its CH-47Ds with new-build CH-47Fs by 2017 endangered the viability of the Australian Chinooks. This was because the Australian Army's arrangements for the logistical support of its small number of CH-47Ds were heavily leveraged off those for the US Army's large fleet. In response, the Australian Army also established a project to acquire CH-47F Chinooks in the mid-2000s. The Australian Government provided initial approval for a CH-47F purchase in September 2007. As part of this decision, the Government chose to procure the helicopters through the US Government's <a href="Foreign%20Military%20Sales">Foreign Military Sales</a> program to minimise potential risks to the schedule and cost of the project.

Final approval to acquire CH-47Fs was granted by the Australian Government in February 2010, seven of the helicopters being ordered. A contract was signed on 19 March that year. The decision to increase the fleet size from six to seven was made to improve the robustness of the Army's helicopter capacities, including by reducing the impact of the loss of any of the helicopters. The total cost of the CH-47F project, including the construction of new facilities and the acquisition of two flight simulators, was $A631 million.

The CH-47F has generally similar performance to the CH-47D, and was designed to be easier to maintain and deploy. Its fuselage comprises few machined components, rather than the many fabricated sections of sheet metal used in the D variant, which reduces vibration and structural cracking. The F variant also includes more advanced avionics as well as design features that enable the helicopters to be more quickly prepared for transport within a cargo aircraft. The initial seven Australian CH-47Fs are fitted with rotor brakes and other equipment to better enable them to operate from the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy's</a> <a href="Canberra-class%20landing%20helicopter%20dock">"Canberra" class landing helicopter dock</a> vessels, but are otherwise identical to those operated by the US Army.

Australia's first two CH-47Fs were delivered in early April 2015, eight months later than originally expected, and entered service with the 5th Aviation Regiment on 5 May that year. At this time it was planned for C Squadron to be fully operational with the new Chinooks by January 2017. The seventh CH-47F was delivered three weeks ahead of schedule in September 2015. These helicopters were designated A15-301 to A15-307.
A further three CH-47Fs were ordered in December 2015 for $US150 million, including spare parts, related equipment and some support costs. The ADF had previously intended to expand the CH-47F fleet at a later date, but the order was placed at short notice to use funds made available by an under-spend on other Defence capabilities. All three helicopters were delivered in June 2016, two and half months earlier than planned. The Chinooks were designated A15-308 to A15-310. These helicopters are not fitted with rotor brakes as they were taken directly from the production line of helicopters for the US Army. As of 2017, it was planned to fit these helicopters with rotor brakes by 2020.

C Squadron's air crew undertook training to prepare them to operate the new type using the two flight simulators, and the CH-47F fleet achieved initial operating capacity in April 2016. During 2016, the CH-47s were approved to operate from the "Canberra" class vessels after trials proved successful. The first seven CH-47s reached full operating capability status in July 2017. C Squadron's operations were constrained at this time by personnel shortages and a backlog of maintenance tasks which at one point led to four of the helicopters simultaneously being out of service for <a href="Aircraft%20maintenance%20checks">deep maintenance</a>. These constraints are expected to delay full operating capability status for the entire CH-47F fleet to 2020.

The CH-47Ds were retired as they became due for deep maintenance checks, the last of the type leaving service in September 2016. Due to the many common components between the D and F variants, the helicopters were stripped for spare parts before being preserved in Australia. A15-202 was handed over to the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in April 2016, A15-104 will be displayed at the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Flying%20Museum">Australian Army Flying Museum</a> and the former Air Force helicopter A15-106 was transferred to the <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a>. The other three surviving CH-47Ds were retained by the Army for non-flying training, A15-151 and A15-152 for general and special forces training respectively, and A15-201 as a maintenance systems training airframe.

The "<a href="2016%20Defence%20White%20Paper">2016 Defence White Paper</a>" and its supporting documentation stated that the CH-47Fs will receive modifications to better enable them to perform aeromedical evacuation tasks by the 2025–26 financial year, and that it is intended to regularly upgrade the helicopters over time so that they can continue to be supported through the US military's logistics system. This will involve keeping pace with key changes introduced to the American CH-47F fleet, though there will be options to modify the helicopters to meet Australian requirements. As of 2017, the ADF intended to retain the CH-47Fs until 2040. The US Army has indicated that it will operate the type until the 2060s, which may lead to Australia doing the same.

The first overseas deployment of Australian CH-47Fs commenced in early March 2018. On 8 March, the Australian Government announced that three of the helicopters would be dispatched to Papua New Guinea to assist the relief efforts for victims of the <a href="2018%20Papua%20New%20Guinea%20earthquake">2018 Papua New Guinea earthquake</a>. The Chinooks commenced operations in the country on 11 March, and the deployment concluded in April that year.

Kaiman-class torpedo boat

The "Kaiman" class were high-seas <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s built for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> between 1904 and 1910. A total of 24 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies. <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a> built the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a>, <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a> of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a> built 13 boats, and <a href="Ganz%20Works">Ganz-Danubius</a> constructed the remaining 10 boats at their shipyards at <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a>. The class was considered to be a very successful design, and all boats saw extensive active service during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, undertaking a range of tasks, including escort duties, <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a>s and <a href="minesweeper">minesweeping</a>. All survived, although several were damaged by <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s and collisions. One was torpedoed and badly damaged by a French <a href="submarine">submarine</a>, and two sank an Italian submarine. All the boats were transferred to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> and scrapped at the end of the war, except for four that were allocated to the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Navy">navy</a> of the newly created <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a>. These were discarded and broken up between 1928 and 1930.

After the commissioning of the last of four <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s for the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian Navy</a> in 1900, there was a four-year hiatus in Austro-Hungarian construction of <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and torpedo boats. In 1904, a <a href="prototype">prototype</a> of a new torpedo boat was ordered from <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow Shipbuilders</a> at <a href="Poplar%2C%20London">Poplar, London</a>, and this became the <a href="lead%20ship">lead boat</a> of the "Kaiman" class. Two Austro-Hungarian naval shipbuilders then received plans and engineering assistance from the British and commenced construction; 13 boats were built by <a href="Stabilimento%20Tecnico%20Triestino">Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino</a>, located at <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>, and the remaining 10 boats by <a href="Ganz%20Works">Ganz-Danubius</a> at their shipyards at <a href="Rijeka">Fiume</a>. All boats used a single <a href="Multi-cylinder%20engine">four-cylinder</a> <a href="Compound%20steam%20engine">vertical triple expansion engine</a> driving one <a href="drive%20shaft">propeller shaft</a> using steam generated by two coal-fired <a href="Yarrow%20boiler">Yarrow boiler</a>s. They had a <a href="waterline%20length">waterline length</a> of , a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a normal <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . They had a <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29">standard displacement</a> of about . The crew consisted of 31 officers and enlisted men. Their machinery was rated at and was designed to propel the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal, which gave them a radius of action of at , or at .

They were armed with four <a href="%C5%A0koda%20Works">Škoda</a> <a href="QF%203-pounder%20Hotchkiss%23Austro-Hungarian%20service"></a> L/33 guns and three <a href="torpedo%20tubes">torpedo tubes</a>. The 47 mm guns were license-built versions of the British QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun; they had a <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a> of 25 rounds per minute and an effective range of . The 450 mm torpedoes were the L/5 type, which carried a <a href="warhead">warhead</a> and had a range of 3,000 m at a speed of . Later variants increased the warhead to and the range to at . In 1915, one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a> was added. The boats were initially given names, but were redesignated with numbers on 1 January 1914, with three suffixes; E for the Yarrow boat built in England, T for the boats built in Trieste, and F for the boats built in Fiume.

At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the "Kaiman"-class torpedo boats were split between the 1st and 2nd Torpedo Craft Flotillas, based at <a href="Bay%20of%20Kotor">Cattaro</a> and <a href="Pula">Pola</a> respectively. In the 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla, the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division had two groups of "Kaiman"-class boats: "50 E", "51 T" and "73 F" made up the 2nd Torpedo Boat Group, and "53 T", "54 T" and "56 T" made up the 3rd Torpedo Boat Group. In the 2nd Torpedo Craft Flotilla, the 5th Torpedo Craft Division had three groups of the class: "55 T", "68 F" and "70 F" made up the 4th Torpedo Boat Group; "61 T", "65 F" and "66 F" comprised the 5th Torpedo Boat Group; and "64 F", "69 F" and "72 F" made up the 6th Torpedo Boat Group. Also in the 2nd Torpedo Craft Flotilla, the 6th Torpedo Craft Division had three more groups of "Kaiman"-class boats: "52 T", "58 T" and "59 T" were in the 7th Torpedo Boat Group; "60 T", "62 T" and "63 T" made up the 8th Torpedo Boat Group; and "57 T", "67 F" and "72 F" comprised the 9th Torpedo Boat Group.

The "Kaiman" class was considered to be a very capable design, and all boats saw significant active service during the war. All survived, although several were badly damaged by <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s and collisions. On 8 August 1914, "72 F" accompanied the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s and and the during a <a href="shore%20bombardment">shore bombardment</a> of <a href="Bar%2C%20Montenegro">Antivari</a> in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Montenegro">Montenegro</a>. This was followed, on 2 September, by another shore bombardment of the Montenegrin coast by the "Huszár"-class destroyers and , assisted by "64 F" and "66 F". On 16 September, "68 F" and "72 F" were involved in a raid and landing at <a href="Sh%C3%ABngjin">San Giovanni di Medua</a> on the <a href="Principality%20of%20Albania">Albanian</a> coast. On 14 February 1915, "68 F", the "Huszár"-class destroyer and another torpedo boat bombarded <a href="Ulcinj">Dulcigno</a> and Antivari on the Montenegrin coastline. On 2 March 1915, the "Huszár"-class destroyers "Ulan", "Csikos" and , accompanied by "66 F" and "67 F", bombarded Antivari and sank the Montenegrin <a href="royal%20yacht">royal yacht</a> "<a href="Rumija%20%28ship%29">Rumija</a>". Three days later, "57 T" also bombarded Antivari.

On 24 May 1915, a large Austro-Hungarian force of three <a href="dreadnought%20battleship">dreadnought battleship</a>s, six <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s, and four destroyers, accompanied by fifteen "Kaiman"-class boats and four s, participated in the <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Ancona">Bombardment of Ancona</a>, a shore bombardment operation against the northern Adriatic coast of Italy. On the same day, the pre-dreadnought , accompanied by "56 T" and "73 F", bombarded <a href="Potenza%20Picena">Potenza Picena</a>, <a href="Termoli">Termoli</a> and <a href="Campomarino">Campomarino</a>. On 18 June, the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a> conducted a bombardment of a bridge near <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a>, accompanied by "57 T", "58 T", "63 T" and "67 F". On the same day, "Szigetvár", "64 F" and "69 F" bombarded <a href="Colonnella">Colonnella</a>, sinking one freighter during the shelling, and sinking two motor <a href="schooner">schooner</a>s encountered off Rimini following the bombardment. On 9 September 1915, "51 T" was torpedoed and had her <a href="bow%20%28ship%29">bow</a> blown off by the while she was patrolling off <a href="Palagru%C5%BEa">Palagruža</a>. She was towed to port and presumably repaired.

On 9 July 1916, the <a href="scout%20cruiser">scout cruiser</a> , "54 T", "73 F" and another torpedo boat raided the <a href="Otranto%20Barrage">Otranto Barrage</a>, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> naval blockade of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Otranto">Strait of Otranto</a>, which resulted in the sinking of two <a href="Naval%20drifter">drifters</a>, and damage to two more. Ten days later, "65 F" and "66 F" sank the <a href="SM%20U-42">Italian submarine "Balilla"</a> off <a href="Vis%20%28island%29">Lissa</a>. On 8 October, "68 F" encountered the Italian off San Giovanni di Medua, but after a brief chase was able to reach the cover of a <a href="Coastal%20artillery">shore battery</a>. On 16 November 1917, "61 T" and "65 F" were part of a <a href="minesweeper">minesweeping</a> force supporting the bombardment of a Italian shore battery at Cortellazzo near the mouth of the <a href="Piave%20%28river%29">Piave</a>. All boats were due to have their aft torpedo tube replaced by a single Škoda <a href="%C5%A0koda%207%20cm%20guns"></a> L/30 <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> gun in late 1918, but it is not clear whether this actually occurred. "52 T" <a href="ship%20grounding">ran aground</a> near <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split</a> in December 1918. Following World War I, the "Kaiman"-class boats were allocated to Great Britain, Italy and the new <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a> (later renamed Yugoslavia). Great Britain and Italy scrapped their boats, but the Yugoslavs retained "54 T", "60 T", "61 T" and "69 F" as "T12", "T9", "T10" and "T11" respectively. All four were discarded and broken up between 1928 and 1930.

Project Y

The Los Alamos Laboratory, also known as Project Y, was a secret laboratory established by the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> and operated by the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Its mission was to design and build the <a href="History%20of%20nuclear%20weapons">first atomic bombs</a>. <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> was its first director, from 1943 to December 1945, when he was succeeded by <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a>. In order to enable scientists to freely discuss their work while preserving security, the laboratory was located in a remote part of New Mexico. The wartime laboratory occupied buildings that had once been part of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Ranch%20School">Los Alamos Ranch School</a>.

The development effort initially concentrated on a <a href="gun-type%20fission%20weapon">gun-type fission weapon</a> using <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> called <a href="Thin%20Man%20%28nuclear%20bomb%29">Thin Man</a>. In April 1944, the Los Alamos Laboratory determined that the rate of <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> in plutonium bred in a nuclear reactor was too great due to the presence of <a href="plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a> and would cause a <a href="fizzle%20%28nuclear%20test%29">predetonation</a>, a <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> before the <a href="pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">core</a> was fully assembled. Oppenheimer then reorganized the laboratory and orchestrated an all-out and ultimately successful effort on an alternative design proposed by <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, an <a href="implosion-type%20nuclear%20weapon">implosion-type nuclear weapon</a>, which was called <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>. A variant of the gun-type design known as <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> was developed using <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a>.

Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory developed methods of purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an <a href="aqueous%20homogeneous%20reactor">aqueous homogeneous reactor</a>, the third reactor in the world to become operational. It also researched the Super, a <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a> that would use a fission bomb to ignite a <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reaction in <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> and <a href="tritium">tritium</a>.

The Fat Man design was tested in the <a href="Trinity%20nuclear%20test">Trinity nuclear test</a> in July 1945. Project Y personnel formed pit crews and assembly teams for the <a href="atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a> and participated in the bombing as weaponeers and observers. After the war ended, the laboratory supported the <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> nuclear tests at <a href="Bikini%20Atoll">Bikini Atoll</a>. A new Z Division was created to control testing, stockpiling and bomb assembly activities, which were concentrated at <a href="Sandia%20Base">Sandia Base</a>. The Los Alamos Laboratory became <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Scientific%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory</a> in 1947.

The discovery of the <a href="neutron">neutron</a> by <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> in 1932, followed by that of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> by German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> soon after, opened up the possibility of a controlled <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> using <a href="uranium">uranium</a>. At the time, few scientists in the United States thought that an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> was practical, but the possibility that a <a href="German%20atomic%20bomb%20project">German atomic bomb project</a> would develop atomic weapons sufficiently concerned scientists who were refugees from <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and other fascist countries, that they drafted the <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard%20letter">Einstein–Szilard letter</a> to warn President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. This prompted preliminary research in the United States, beginning in late 1939.
Progress was slow in the United States, but in Britain, Otto Frisch and <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a>, two refugee physicists from Germany at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>, examined the theoretical issues involved in developing, producing and using atomic bombs. They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a> occur, but it might require as little as of <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of <a href="TNT">TNT</a>. Their superior, <a href="Mark%20Oliphant">Mark Oliphant</a>, took the <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a> to Sir <a href="Henry%20Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), who in turn passed it on to <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Paget Thomson</a>, to whom the CSSAW had delegated responsibility for uranium research. CSSAW created the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> to investigate. In its final report in July 1941, the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. In response, the British government created a nuclear weapons project known as <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a>.

There was still little urgency in the United States, which unlike Britain was not yet engaged in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, so Oliphant flew there in late August 1941, and spoke to American scientists including his friend <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a>. He not only managed to convince them that an atomic bomb was feasible, but inspired Lawrence to convert his cyclotron into a giant <a href="mass%20spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a> for <a href="isotope%20separation">isotope separation</a>, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. In turn, Lawrence brought in his friend and colleague <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> to double-check the physics of the MAUD Committee report, which was discussed at a meeting at the <a href="General%20Electric%20Research%20Laboratory">General Electric Research Laboratory</a> in <a href="Schenectady%2C%20New%20York">Schenectady, New York</a>, on 21 October 1941.

In December 1941, the <a href="S-1%20Section">S-1 Section</a> of the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD) placed <a href="Arthur%20H.%20Compton">Arthur H. Compton</a> in charge of the design of the bomb. He delegated the task of bomb design and research into <a href="fast%20neutron%20calculations">fast neutron calculations</a>—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—to <a href="Gregory%20Breit">Gregory Breit</a>, who was given the title of "Co-ordinator of Rapid Rupture", and Oppenheimer as an assistant. But Breit disagreed with other scientists working at the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a>, particularly Enrico Fermi, over the security arrangements, and resigned on 18 May 1942. Compton then appointed Oppenheimer to replace him. <a href="John%20H.%20Manley">John H. Manley</a>, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country. Oppenheimer and <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois</a> examined the problems of neutron diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and <a href="hydrodynamics">hydrodynamics</a>—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave.

To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> in June and at the University of California in Berkeley, in July with theoretical physicists <a href="Hans%20Bethe">Hans Bethe</a>, <a href="John%20Van%20Vleck">John Van Vleck</a>, <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a>, <a href="Emil%20Konopinski">Emil Konopinski</a>, Robert Serber, <a href="Stan%20Frankel">Stan Frankel</a>, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and <a href="experimental%20physicist">experimental physicist</a>s <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a>, <a href="Felix%20Bloch">Felix Bloch</a>, <a href="Franco%20Rasetti">Franco Rasetti</a>, John Manley, and <a href="Edwin%20McMillan">Edwin McMillan</a>. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.

There were still many unknown factors. The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown; even more so those of <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> that had only recently been discovered by <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> and his team in February 1941, but which was theoretically <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned breeding plutonium in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s from <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> atoms that absorbed neutrons from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only microscopic quantities of plutonium were available that had been produced by <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>s.

There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a "cylindrical plug" into a sphere of "active material" with a "<a href="neutron%20reflector">tamper</a>"—dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency. They also explored designs involving <a href="spheroid">spheroid</a>s, a primitive form of "implosion" suggested by <a href="Richard%20C.%20Tolman">Richard C. Tolman</a>, and the possibility of <a href="Autocatalysis">autocatalytic methods</a>, which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded.

Considering the idea of the fission bomb theoretically settled—at least until more experimental data was available—the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the "Super", usually referred to today as a "<a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reaction between <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> and <a href="tritium">tritium</a>. Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe rejected each one. The fusion idea was set aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs. Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might "ignite" the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei, but Bethe calculated that this could not happen, and a report co-authored with Teller showed that "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started".

Oppenheimer's deft handling of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people came as a surprise even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had come to grips with the physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.

Groves Jr.</a> became director of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> on 23 September 1942. He visited Berkeley to look at Lawrence's <a href="calutron">calutron</a>s, and met with Oppenheimer, who gave him a report on bomb design on 8 October. Groves was interested in Oppenheimer's proposal to establish a separate bomb design laboratory. When they met again in Chicago a week later, he invited Oppenheimer to discuss the issue. Groves had to catch a train to New York, so he asked Oppenheimer to accompany him so that they could continue the discussion. Groves, Oppenheimer, and <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="James%20C.%20Marshall">James C. Marshall</a> and <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Kenneth Nichols</a> all squeezed into a single compartment where they talked about how a bomb laboratory could be created, and how it would function. Groves subsequently had Oppenheimer come to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where the matter was discussed with <a href="Vannevar%20Bush">Vannevar Bush</a>, the director of the OSRD, and <a href="James%20B.%20Conant">James B. Conant</a>, the chairman of the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC). On 19 October, Groves approved the establishment of a bomb laboratory.

While Oppenheimer seemed the logical person to direct the new laboratory, which became known as Project Y, he had little administrative experience; Bush, Conant, Lawrence and <a href="Harold%20Urey">Harold Urey</a> all expressed reservations about this. Moreover, unlike his other project leaders—Lawrence at the <a href="Berkeley%20Radiation%20Laboratory">Berkeley Radiation Laboratory</a>, Compton at the Metallurgical Project in Chicago, and Urey at the <a href="SAM%20Laboratories">SAM Laboratories</a> in New York—Oppenheimer did not have a <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>, raising concerns that he might not have the prestige to deal with distinguished scientists. There were also security concerns; many of Oppenheimer's closest associates were active members of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a>, including his wife <a href="Katherine%20Oppenheimer">Kitty</a>, girlfriend <a href="Jean%20Tatlock">Jean Tatlock</a>, brother Frank, and Frank's wife Jackie. In the end, Groves personally issued instructions to clear Oppenheimer on 20 July 1943.

The idea of locating Project Y with the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, or at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, was considered, but in the end it was decided that a remote location would be best. A site in the vicinity of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> was rejected on security grounds, and one near <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno, Nevada</a> as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the <a href="Sangre%20de%20Cristo%20Range">Sangre de Cristo Range</a>. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a> for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.

In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Engineer District (the military component of the Manhattan Project) surveyed sites around <a href="Gallup%2C%20New%20Mexico">Gallup</a>, <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20New%20Mexico">Las Vegas</a>, La Ventana, <a href="Jemez%20Springs%2C%20New%20Mexico">Jemez Springs</a>, and <a href="Otowi%20Historic%20District">Otowi</a>, and recommended the one near Jemez Springs. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the Otowi site, the vicinity of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Ranch%20School">Los Alamos Ranch School</a>. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the <a href="Sangre%20de%20Cristo%20Mountains">Sangre de Cristo Mountains</a>, which, he hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.

The <a href="United%20States%20Under%20Secretary%20of%20War">United States Under Secretary of War</a>, <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a>, approved the acquisition of the site on 25 November 1942, authorizing $440,000 for the purchase of the site of , all but of which were already owned by the Federal Government. <a href="Secretary%20of%20Agriculture">Secretary of Agriculture</a> <a href="Claude%20R.%20Wickard">Claude R. Wickard</a> granted use of some of <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> land to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> "for so long as the military necessity continues". The need for land for a new road, and later for a right of way for a power line, eventually brought wartime land purchases to , but only $414,971 was ultimately spent. The big ticket items were the school, which cost $350,000, and the Anchor Ranch, which cost $25,000. Both hired lawyers to negotiate deals with the government, but Hispanic homesteaders were paid as little as $7 an acre (). <a href="Grazing%20permits">Grazing permits</a> were withdrawn, and private land was purchased or condemned under <a href="eminent%20domain">eminent domain</a> using the authority of the <a href="War%20Powers%20Act%20of%201941">Second War Powers Act</a>. Petitions of condemnation were worded to cover all mineral, water, timber and other rights, so private individuals would have no reason whatsoever to enter the area. The site acquired an irregular shape due to abutting the <a href="Bandelier%20National%20Monument">Bandelier National Monument</a> and a Native American sacred burial ground.

An important consideration in the acquisition of the site was the existence of the Los Alamos Ranch School. This consisted of 54 buildings, of which 27 were houses, dormitories or other quarters providing of accommodation. The remaining buildings included a <a href="sawmill">sawmill</a>, <a href="ice%20house%20%28building%29">ice house</a>, <a href="barn">barn</a>s, carpentry shop, <a href="stable">stable</a>s and <a href="garage%20%28residential%29">garage</a>s, all totalling . At the nearby Anchor Ranch there were four houses and a barn. Construction work was supervised by the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers%23Divisions%20and%20districts">Albuquerque Engineer District</a> until 15 March 1944, when the Manhattan Engineer District assumed responsibility. <a href="Willard%20C.%20Kruger%20and%20Associates">Willard C. Kruger and Associates</a> of <a href="Santa%20Fe%2C%20New%20Mexico">Santa Fe, New Mexico</a>, was engaged as architect and engineer. <a href="Black%20%26amp%3B%20Veatch">Black & Veatch</a> was brought in for the design of utilities in December 1945. The former was paid $743,706.68 and the latter $164,116 by the time the Manhattan Project ended at the end of 1946. The Albuquerque District supervised $9.3 million of construction at Los Alamos, and the Manhattan District, another $30.4 million. The initial work was contracted to the M. M. Sundt Company of <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>, with work commenced in December 1942. Groves initially allocated $300,000 for construction, three times Oppenheimer's estimate, with a planned completion date of 15 March 1943. It soon became clear that the scope of Project Y was far greater than expected, and by the time Sundt finished on 30 November 1943, over $7 million had been spent. The Zia Company took over responsibility for maintenance in April 1946.
Oppenheimer initially estimated that the work could be performed by 50 scientists and 50 technicians. Groves tripled this number to 300. The actual population, including family members, was about 3,500 by the end of 1943, 5,700 by the end of 1944, 8,200 by the end of 1945, and 10,000 by the close of 1946. The most desirable accommodation were the six existing log and stone cottages that had once housed the headmaster and the Los Alamos Ranch School faculty. They were the only dwellings at Los Alamos that had bathtubs, and became known as "Bathtub Row". Oppenheimer lived on Bathtub Row; his next-door neighbor was <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20Sterling%20Parsons">W. S. "Deak" Parsons</a>, the head of the Ordnance and Engineering Division. Parsons' house was slightly larger, because Parsons had two children and Oppenheimer, at that point, had only one. After Bathtub Row, the next most desirable accommodation was the apartments built by Sundt. A typical two-storey building held four families. Each Sundt apartment had two or three bedrooms, a kitchen with a cranky black coal stove, and a small bathroom. J. E. Morgan and Sons supplied 56 prefabricated dwellings that became known as "Morganville". The Robert E. McKee Company built a part of the town known as "McKeeville". In June through October 1943, and again in June and July 1944, numbers outstripped the available accommodation and personnel were temporarily lodged in Frijoles Canyon. The houses at CEW and HEW were basic but of a higher standard (as specified by <a href="Kenneth%20Nichols">Nichols</a>) than the houses at Los Alamos (as specified by <a href="Leslie%20Groves">Groves</a>), but Nichols said to Los Alamos scientists that housing there was Groves' problem not his.

Rents were set based on the income of the occupant. Transient visitors to Los Alamos were accommodated in the <a href="Fuller%20Lodge">Fuller Lodge</a>, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once been part of the Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using <a href="gypsum%20board">gypsum board</a>. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired <a href="Boiler%20%28power%20generation%29">boiler</a>s. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.
The growth of the town outpaced the sewage system, and by late 1945 there were electrical outages. Lights had to be shut off during the day, and between 7 and 10 pm. Water also ran short. During the autumn of 1945, consumption was per day, but the water supply could furnish only . On 19 December, pipes that had been laid above ground to save time in 1943 froze, cutting off the supply completely. Residents had to draw water from 15 tanker trucks that carried per day. Because its name was secret, Los Alamos was referred to as "Site Y"; to residents it was known as "The Hill". Because they lived on Federal land, the state of New Mexico did not allow residents of Los Alamos to vote in elections, although it did require them to pay state income taxes. A drawn-out series of legal and legislative battles lay ahead before the residents of Los Alamos became fully-fledged citizens of New Mexico on 10 June 1949. Birth certificates of babies born in Los Alamos during the war listed their place of birth as PO Box 1663 in Santa Fe. All letters and packages came through that address.

Initially Los Alamos was to have been a military laboratory with Oppenheimer and other researchers commissioned into the Army. Oppenheimer went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, <a href="Robert%20Bacher">Robert Bacher</a> and <a href="Isidor%20Rabi">Isidor Rabi</a>, balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California. Financial and procurement activities were the responsibility of the University of California under a 1 January 1943 <a href="letter%20of%20intent">letter of intent</a> from the OSRD. This was superseded by a formal contract with the Manhattan District on 20 April 1943, which was backdated to 1 January. Financial operations were directed by the resident business officer, J. A. D. Muncy. The intent was that it would be militarized when the time came to finally assemble the bomb, but by this time the Los Alamos Laboratory had grown so large that this was considered both impractical and unnecessary, as the anticipated difficulties regarding civilians working on dangerous tasks had not occurred.

Colonel John M. Harman was the first post commander at Los Alamos. He joined the Santa Fe office as a lieutenant colonel on 19 January 1943, and was promoted to colonel on 15 February. Los Alamos officially became a military establishment on 1 April 1943, and he moved to Los Alamos on 19 April. He was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel C. Whitney Ashbridge, a graduate of the Los Alamos Ranch School, in May 1943. In turn, Ashbridge was succeeded by Lieutenant Colonel Gerald R. Tyler in October 1944, Colonel Lyle E. Seaman in November 1945, and Colonel Herb C. Gee in September 1946. The post commander was answerable directly to Groves, and was responsible for the township, government property and the military personnel.
Four military units were assigned to the post. The MP Detachment, 4817th Service Command Unit, arrived from <a href="Fort%20Riley%2C%20Kansas">Fort Riley, Kansas</a>, in April 1943. Its initial strength was 7 officers and 196 enlisted men; by December 1946 it had 9 officers and 486 men, and was manning 44 guard posts 24 hours a day. The Provisional Engineer Detachment (PED), 4817th Service Command Unit, was activated at <a href="Camp%20Claiborne%2C%20Louisiana">Camp Claiborne, Louisiana</a>, on 10 April 1943. These men performed jobs around the post such as working in the boiler plant, the motor pool and the mess halls. They also maintained the buildings and roads. It reached a peak strength of 465 men, and was disbanded on 1 July 1946.

The 1st Provisional <a href="Women%27s%20Army%20Corps">Women's Army Auxiliary Corps</a> (WAAC) Detachment was activated at <a href="Fort%20Sill%2C%20Oklahoma">Fort Sill, Oklahoma</a>, on 17 April 1943. Its initial strength was just one officer and seven auxiliaries. The WAAC became the <a href="Women%27s%20Army%20Corps">Women's Army Corps</a> (WAC) on 24 August 1943, and the detachment became part of the 4817th Service Command Unit, with a strength of two officers and 43 enlisted women. They were sworn into the United States Army by Ashbridge. It reached a peak strength of about 260 women in August 1945. The WACs did a wider variety of jobs than the PED; some were cooks, drivers and telephone operators, while others served as librarians, clerks and hospital technicians. Some performed highly specialized scientific research inside the Technical Area.

The <a href="Special%20Engineer%20Detachment">Special Engineer Detachment</a> (SED) was activated in October 1943 as part of the 9812th Technical Service Unit. It was made up of men with technical skills or advanced education, and was mostly drawn from the defunct <a href="Army%20Specialized%20Training%20Program">Army Specialized Training Program</a>. War Department policy forbade giving deferments from <a href="the%20draft">the draft</a> to men under 22, so they were assigned to the SED. It reached a peak strength of 1,823 men in August 1945. SED personnel worked in all areas of the Los Alamos Laboratory.

As director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, Oppenheimer was no longer answerable to Compton, but reported directly to Groves. He was responsible for the technical and scientific aspects of Project Y. He assembled the nucleus of his staff from the groups that had been working for him on neutron calculations. These included his secretary, <a href="Priscilla%20Greene">Priscilla Greene</a>, Serber and McMillan from his own group, and Emilio Segrè and <a href="Joseph%20W.%20Kennedy">Joseph W. Kennedy</a>'s groups from the University of California, <a href="John%20Harry%20Williams">J. H. Williams</a>' group from the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>, Joe McKibben's group from the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin">University of Wisconsin</a>, Felix Bloch's group from <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> and <a href="Marshall%20Holloway">Marshall Holloway</a>'s from <a href="Purdue%20University">Purdue University</a>. He also secured the services of Hans Bethe and Robert Bacher from the <a href="Radiation%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> at <a href="MIT">MIT</a>, Edward Teller, <a href="Robert%20F.%20Christy">Robert F. Christy</a>, <a href="Darol%20K.%20Froman">Darol K. Froman</a>, <a href="Alvin%20C.%20Graves">Alvin C. Graves</a> and John H. Manley and his group from the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory, and <a href="Robert%20R.%20Wilson">Robert R. Wilson</a> and his group, which included <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a>, that had been performing Manhattan Project research at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>. They brought with them a great deal of valuable scientific equipment. Wilson's group dismantled the cyclotron at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> and had it shipped to Los Alamos; McKibben's brought two <a href="Van%20de%20Graaff%20generator">Van de Graaff generator</a>s from Wisconsin; and Manley's brought the <a href="Cockcroft%E2%80%93Walton%20accelerator">Cockcroft–Walton accelerator</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">University of Illinois</a>.

Communications with the outside world went through a single Forest Service line until April 1943, when it was replaced by five Army telephone lines. This was increased to eight in March 1945. There were also three <a href="teletypewriter">teletypewriter</a>s with encoding machines. The first was installed in March 1943, and two more were added in May 1943. One was removed in November 1945. There were telephones in the offices, but none in private residences, as the Army regarded this as a security hazard. There were some public phones in the township for emergencies. Since there was no way to prevent the lines being tapped, classified information could not be discussed over the phone lines. Initially the phone lines were operable only during business hours until enough WACs arrived to man the switchboard around the clock.
Women at Los Alamos were encouraged to work, due to the shortage of labor and security concerns over bringing in local workers. About 60 wives of scientists were at work in Technical Area by September 1943. About 200 of the 670 workers in the laboratory, hospital and school were women in October 1944. Most worked in administration, but many women such as <a href="Lilli%20Hornig">Lilli Hornig</a>, <a href="Jane%20Hamilton%20Hall">Jane Hamilton Hall</a>, and Peggy Titterton worked as scientists and technicians. <a href="Charlotte%20Serber">Charlotte Serber</a> headed the A-5 (Library) Group. A large group of women worked on numerical calculations in the T-5 (Computations) Group. <a href="Dorothy%20McKibbin">Dorothy McKibbin</a> ran the Santa Fe office, which opened at 109 East Palace Avenue on 27 March 1943.

The Los Alamos Laboratory had a governing board, the members of which were Oppenheimer, Bacher, Bethe, Kennedy, D. L. Hughes (Personnel Director), D. P. Mitchell (Procurement Director) and Deak Parsons. McMillan, <a href="George%20Kistiakowsky">George Kistiakowsky</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Bainbridge">Kenneth Bainbridge</a> were later added. The laboratory was organized into five divisions: Administration (A), Theoretical (T) under Bethe, Experimental Physics (P) under Bacher, Chemistry and Metallurgy (CM) under Kennedy, and Ordnance and Engineering (E) under Parsons. All the divisions expanded during 1943 and 1944, but T Division, despite trebling in size, remained the smallest, while E Division grew to be the largest. Security clearance was a problem. Scientists (including, at first, Oppenheimer) had to be given access to the Technical Area without proper clearance. In the interest of efficiency, Groves approved an abbreviated process by which Oppenheimer vouched for senior scientists, and three other employees were sufficient to vouch for a junior scientist or technician.

The Los Alamos Laboratory was reinforced by a <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project%23Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">British Mission</a> under James Chadwick. The first to arrive were Otto Frisch and <a href="Ernest%20Titterton">Ernest Titterton</a>; later arrivals included <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and his son <a href="Aage%20Bohr">Aage Bohr</a>, and Sir <a href="G.%20I.%20Taylor">Geoffrey Taylor</a>, an expert on hydrodynamics who made a major contribution to the understanding of the <a href="Rayleigh%E2%80%93Taylor%20instability">Rayleigh–Taylor instability</a>. This <a href="instability">instability</a> at the <a href="Interface%20%28chemistry%29">interface</a> between two <a href="fluid">fluid</a>s of different <a href="density">densities</a> occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier, and was vital to the interpretation of experiments with explosives, predicting the effects of an explosion, the design of the <a href="neutron%20initiator">neutron initiator</a>s, and the design of the atomic bomb itself. Chadwick remained only for a few months; he was succeeded as head of the British Mission by Rudolf Peierls. The original idea, favored by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favor of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. With the passage of the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Act%20of%201946">Atomic Energy Act of 1946</a>, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All had left by the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed.

In 1943, development efforts were directed to a <a href="gun-type%20fission%20weapon">gun-type fission weapon</a> using plutonium called <a href="Thin%20Man%20%28nuclear%20bomb%29">Thin Man</a>. The names for all three atomic bomb design projects—<a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>, Thin Man, and <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>—were created by Serber, who chose them based on their design shapes. Thin Man was a long device, and its name came from the <a href="Dashiell%20Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a> <a href="The%20Thin%20Man">detective novel</a> and <a href="The%20Thin%20Man%20%28film%29">series of movies</a> of the same name. The Fat Man was round and fat, and was named after <a href="Sydney%20Greenstreet">Sydney Greenstreet</a>'s "Kasper Gutman" character in "<a href="The%20Maltese%20Falcon%20%281941%20film%29">The Maltese Falcon</a>". Little Boy came last, and was named after <a href="Elisha%20Cook%2C%20Jr.">Elisha Cook, Jr.</a>'s character in the same film, as referred to by <a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>.

A series of conferences in April and May 1943 laid out the laboratory's plan for the year. Oppenheimer estimated the critical mass of a uranium-235 gadget with a formula based on <a href="diffusion">diffusion</a> theory derived at Berkeley by Stan Frankel and E. C. Nelson. This gave a value for a uranium-235 gadget with a perfect tamper of 25 kg; but this was only an approximation. It was based on simplifying assumptions, notably that all neutrons had the same speed, that all collisions were <a href="elastic%20collision">elastic</a>, that they were scattered <a href="isotropy">isotropically</a>, and that the <a href="mean%20free%20path">mean free path</a> of neutrons in the core and tamper were the same. Bethe's T Division, particularly Serber's T-2 (Diffusion Theory) Group and Feynman's T-4 (Diffusion Problems) Groups, would spend the next few months working on improved models. Bethe and Feynman also developed a formula for the efficiency of the reaction.

No formula could be more accurate than the values put into it; the values for the cross sections were dubious, and had not yet been determined for plutonium. Measurement of these values would be a priority, but the laboratory possessed just 1 gram of uranium-235, and only a few micrograms of plutonium. This task fell to Bacher's P Division. Williams P-2 (Electrostatic Generator) Group carried out the first experiment in July 1943, when it used the larger of the two Van de Graaff generators to measure the ratio of the neutron per fission in plutonium against that of uranium-235. This involved some negotiation with the Metallurgical Laboratory to obtain 165 μg of plutonium, which was received at Los Alamos on 10 July 1943. Bacher was able to report that the number of neutrons per fission of <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> was 2.64 ± 0.2, about 1.2 times as much as uranium-235. Titterton and <a href="Boyce%20McDaniel">Boyce McDaniel</a> of Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group attempted to measure the time it took for <a href="prompt%20neutron">prompt neutron</a>s to be emitted from a uranium-235 nucleus when it fissions. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 <a href="nanosecond">nanosecond</a>. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too. Confirmation of the theorists' contention that the number of neutrons emitted per fission was the same for both <a href="neutron%20temperature">fast and slow neutrons</a> took longer, and was not completed until the autumn of 1944.

<a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a> visited the Los Alamos Laboratory in September 1943, and participated in discussions of the damage that an atomic bomb would do. He explained that while the damage done by a small explosion was proportional to the <a href="Impulse%20%28physics%29">impulse</a> (the average pressure of the explosion times its duration), the damage from large explosions such as an atomic bomb would be determined by the peak pressure, which depends on the <a href="cube%20root">cube root</a> of its energy. Bethe then calculated that a explosion would result in an overpressure of at , and therefore result in severe damage within that radius. Von Neumann also suggested that, because pressure increases when shock waves bounce off solid objects, the damage could be increased if the bomb was detonated at an altitude comparable to the damage radius, approximately .

Parsons was appointed the head of Ordnance and Engineering Division in June 1943 on the recommendation of Bush and Conant. To staff the division, Tolman, who acted as a coordinator of the gun development effort, brought in John Streib, <a href="Charles%20Critchfield">Charles Critchfield</a> and <a href="Seth%20Neddermeyer">Seth Neddermeyer</a> from the <a href="National%20Bureau%20of%20Standards">National Bureau of Standards</a>. The division was initially organized into five groups, with original group leaders being McMillan of the E-1 (Proving Ground) Group, Kenneth Bainbridge of the E-2 (Instrumentation) Group, <a href="Robert%20Brode">Robert Brode</a> of the E-3 (Fuse Development) Group, Critchfield of the E-4 (Projectile, Target, and Source) Group and Neddermeyer of the E-5 (Implosion) Group. Two more groups were added in the autumn of 1943, the E-7 (Delivery) Group under <a href="Norman%20Ramsey">Norman Ramsey</a> and the E-8 (Interior Ballistics) Group under <a href="Joseph%20O.%20Hirschfelder">Joseph O. Hirschfelder</a>.
A proving ground was established at the Anchor Ranch. The gun would be an unusual one, and it had to be designed in the absence of crucial data about the critical mass. The design criteria were that the gun would have a muzzle velocity of ; that the tube would weigh only instead of the conventional for a tube with that energy; that, as a consequence it would be made of alloyed steel; that it should have a maximum breech pressure of ; and that it should have three independent <a href="Primer%20%28firearm%29">primers</a>. Because it would need to be fired only once, the barrel could be made lighter than the conventional gun. Nor did it require <a href="rifling">rifling</a> or recoil mechanisms. Pressure curves were computed under Hirschfelder's supervision at the <a href="Geophysical%20Laboratory">Geophysical Laboratory</a> prior to his joining the Los Alamos Laboratory.

While they waited for the guns to be fabricated by the <a href="Naval%20Gun%20Factory">Naval Gun Factory</a>, various propellants were tested. Hirschfelder sent John L. Magee to the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Mines">Bureau of Mines</a>' <a href="Experimental%20Mine%2C%20U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Mines">Experimental Mine</a> at <a href="Bruceton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bruceton, Pennsylvania</a> to test the propellant and ignition system. Test firing was conducted at the Anchor Ranch with a <a href="3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun">/50 caliber gun</a>. This allowed the fine-tuning of the testing instrumentation. The first two tubes arrived at Los Alamos on 10 March 1944, and test firing began at the Anchor Ranch under the direction of Thomas H. Olmstead, who had experience in such work at the <a href="Naval%20Surface%20Warfare%20Center%20Dahlgren%20Division">Naval Proving Ground</a> in <a href="Dahlgren%2C%20Virginia">Dahlgren, Virginia</a>. The primers were tested and found to work at pressures up to . Brode's group investigated the fusing systems, testing <a href="radar%20altimeter">radar altimeter</a>s, <a href="proximity%20fuse">proximity fuse</a>s and <a href="barometric%20altimeter">barometric altimeter</a> fuses.

Tests were conducted with a <a href="frequency-modulated%20continuous-wave%20radar">frequency modulated</a> type radar altimeter known as AYD and a pulse type known as 718. The AYD modifications were made by the Norden Laboratories Corporation under an OSRD contract. When the manufacturer of 718, <a href="RCA">RCA</a>, was contacted, it was learned that a new <a href="tail%20warning%20radar">tail warning radar</a>, <a href="AN/APS-13">AN/APS-13</a>, later nicknamed "Archie", was just entering production, which could be adapted for use as a radar altimeter. The third unit to be made was delivered to Los Alamos in April 1944. In May it was tested by diving an <a href="Beechcraft%20Model%2018">AT-11</a>. This was followed by full-scale drop testing in June and July. These were very successful, whereas the AYD continued to suffer from problems. Archie was therefore adopted, although the scarcity of units in August 1944 precluded wholescale destructive testing. Testing of <a href="Silverplate">Silverplate</a> <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> aircraft with Thin Man bomb shapes was carried out at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Muroc Army Air Field</a> in March and June 1944.

At a meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had expressed a fear that the <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a <a href="Fizzle%20%28nuclear%20test%29">predetonation</a>, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron emitters like <a href="boron">boron</a> had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.
Only microscopic quantities of plutonium were available until the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at the Clinton Engineer Works came online on 4 November 1943, but there were already some worrying signs. When <a href="plutonium%20fluoride">plutonium fluoride</a> was produced at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it was sometimes light colored, and sometimes dark, although the chemical process was the same. When they managed to reduce it to plutonium metal in November 1943, the density was measured at 15 g/cm, and a measurement using <a href="X-ray%20scattering%20techniques">X-ray scattering techniques</a> pointed to a density of 13 g/cm. This was bad; it had been assumed that its density was the same as uranium, about 19 g/cm. If these figures were correct, far more plutonium would be needed for a bomb. Kennedy disliked Seaborg's ambitious and attention-seeking manner, and with <a href="Arthur%20Wahl">Arthur Wahl</a> had devised a procedure for plutonium purification independent of Seaborg's group. When they got hold of a sample in February, this procedure was tested. That month the Metallurgical Laboratory announced that it had determined that there were two different fluorides: the light colored <a href="plutonium%20tetrafluoride">plutonium tetrafluoride</a> (PuF) and the dark <a href="plutonium%20trifluoride">plutonium trifluoride</a> (PuF). The chemists soon discovered how to make them selectively, and the former turned out to be easier to reduce to metal. Measurements in March 1944 indicated a density of between 19 and 20 g/cm.

Eric Jette's CM-8 (Plutonium Metallurgy) Group began experimenting with plutonium metal after gram quantities were received at the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1944. By heating it, the metallurgists discovered five temperatures between at which it suddenly started absorbing heat without increasing in temperature. This was a strong indication of multiple <a href="allotropes%20of%20plutonium">allotropes of plutonium</a>; but was initially considered too bizarre to be true. Further testing confirmed a state change around ; it entered the δ phase, with a density of 16 g/cm. Seaborg had claimed that plutonium had a melting point of around , about that of uranium, but the metallurgists at the Los Alamos Laboratory soon discovered that it melted at around . The chemists then turned to techniques for removing light element impurities from the plutonium; but on 14 July 1944, Oppenheimer informed Kennedy that this would no longer be required.
The notion of <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> had been raised by Niels Bohr and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Archibald Wheeler</a> in their 1939 treatment of the mechanism of nuclear fission. The first attempt to discover spontaneous fission in uranium was made by <a href="Willard%20Libby">Willard Libby</a>, but he failed to detect it. It had been observed in Britain by Frisch and Titterton, and independently in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> by <a href="Georgy%20Flyorov">Georgy Flyorov</a> and <a href="Konstantin%20Petrzhak">Konstantin Petrzhak</a> in 1940; the latter are generally credited with the discovery. Compton had also heard from the French physicist <a href="Pierre%20Auger">Pierre Auger</a> that <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a> had detected what might have been spontaneous fission in <a href="polonium">polonium</a>. If true, it might preclude the use of polonium in the neutron initiators; if true for plutonium, it might mean that the gun-type design would not work. The consensus at the Los Alamos Laboratory was that it was not true, and that Joliot-Curie's results had been distorted by impurities.

At the Los Alamos Laboratory, Emilio Segrè's P-5 (Radioactivity) Group set out to measure it in <a href="uranium-234">uranium-234</a>, −235 and −238, plutonium, polonium, <a href="protactinium">protactinium</a> and <a href="thorium">thorium</a>. They were not too worried about the plutonium itself; their main concern was the issue Chadwick had raised about interaction with light element impurities. Segrè and his group of young physicists set up their experiment in an old Forest Service log cabin in Pajarito Canyon, about from the Technical Area, in order to minimize background radiation emanating for other research at the Los Alamos Laboratory.

By August 1943, they had good values for all the elements tested except for plutonium, which they were unable to measure accurately enough because the only sample they had was five 20 μg samples created by the 60-inch cyclotron at Berkeley. They did observe that measurements taken at Los Alamos were greater than those made at Berkeley, which they attributed to <a href="cosmic%20rays">cosmic rays</a>, which are more numerous at Los Alamos, which is above sea level. While their measurements indicated a spontaneous fission rate of 40 fissions per gram per hour, which was high but acceptable, the error margin was unacceptably large. In April 1944 they received a sample from the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Tests soon indicated 180 fissions per gram per hour, which was unacceptably high. It fell to Bacher to inform Compton, who was visibly shaken. Suspicion fell on <a href="plutonium-240">plutonium-240</a>, an isotope that had not yet been discovered, but whose existence had been suspected, it being simply created by a plutonium-239 nucleus absorbing a neutron. What had not been suspected was its high spontaneous fission rate. Segrè's group measured it at 1.6 million fissions per gram per hour, compared with just 40 per gram per hour for plutonium-239. This meant that reactor-bred plutonium was unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a predetonation that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass before enough plutonium reacted. A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. So too was the possibility of separating the isotopes, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.

Work on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences as a means of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a different tack, attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.

Throughout 1943, implosion was considered a backup project in case the gun-type proved impractical for some reason. Theoretical physicists like Bethe, Oppenheimer and Teller were intrigued by the idea of a design of an atomic bomb that made more efficient use of fissile material, and permitted the use of material of lower purity. These were advantages of particular attraction to Groves. But while Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, it was clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design. In July 1943, Oppenheimer wrote to John von Neumann, asking for his help, and suggesting that he visit Los Alamos where he could get "a better idea of this somewhat <a href="Buck%20Rogers">Buck Rogers</a> project".

At the time, von Neumann was working for the Navy <a href="Bureau%20of%20Ordnance">Bureau of Ordnance</a>, Princeton University, the Army's <a href="Aberdeen%20Proving%20Ground">Aberdeen Proving Ground</a> and the NDRC. Oppenheimer, Groves and Parsons appealed to Tolman and <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="William%20R.%20Purnell">William R. Purnell</a> to release von Neumann. He visited Los Alamos from 20 September to 4 October 1943. Drawing on his recent work with <a href="blast%20wave">blast wave</a>s and <a href="shaped%20charge">shaped charge</a>s used in armor-piercing shells, he suggested using a high-explosive shaped charge to implode a spherical core. A meeting of the Governing Board on 23 September resolved to approach George Kistiakowsky, a renowned expert on explosives then working for OSRD, to join the Los Alamos Laboratory. Although reluctant, he did so in November. He became a full-time staff member on 16 February 1944, becoming Parsons' deputy for implosion; McMillan became his deputy for the gun-type. The maximum size of the bomb was determined at this time from the size of the bomb bay of the B-29.
By July 1944, Oppenheimer had concluded that plutonium could not be used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed <a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>, began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion. Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by Kistiakowsky and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher. Although Teller was head of the T-1 (Implosion and Super) Group, Bethe considered that Teller was spending too much time on the Super, which had been given a low priority by Bethe and Oppenheimer. In June 1944, Oppenheimer created a dedicated Super Group under Teller, who was made directly responsible to Oppenheimer, and Peierls became head of the T-1 (Implosion) Group. In September, Teller's group became the F-1 (Super and General Theory) Group, part of the Enrico Fermi's new F (Fermi) Division.

The new design that von Neumann and T Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, devised used <a href="explosive%20lens">explosive lens</a>es to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives. A visit by Sir Geoffrey Taylor in May 1944 raised questions about the stability of the interface between the core and the <a href="depleted%20uranium">depleted uranium</a> tamper. As a result, the design was made more conservative. The ultimate expression of this was the adoption of Christy's proposal that the core be solid instead of hollow. The design of lenses that detonated with the proper shape and velocity turned out to be slow, difficult and frustrating. Various explosives were tested before settling on <a href="composition%20B">composition B</a> as the fast explosive and <a href="baratol">baratol</a> as the slow explosive. The final design resembled a soccer ball, with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about . Getting the detonation just right required fast, reliable and safe electrical <a href="detonator">detonator</a>s, of which there were two for each lens for reliability. It was therefore decided to use <a href="exploding-bridgewire%20detonator">exploding-bridgewire detonator</a>s, a new invention developed at Los Alamos by a group led by <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a>. A contract for their manufacture was given to <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>.

To study the behavior of converging <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a>s, Robert Serber devised the <a href="RaLa%20Experiment">RaLa Experiment</a>, which used the short-lived <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a> <a href="lanthanum-140">lanthanum-140</a>, a potent source of <a href="gamma%20radiation">gamma radiation</a>. The gamma ray source was placed in the center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an <a href="ionization%20chamber">ionization chamber</a>. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests. In his history of the Los Alamos project, <a href="David%20Hawkins%20%28philosopher%29">David Hawkins</a> wrote: "RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design".

Within the explosives was the thick aluminum pusher, which provided a smooth transition from the relatively low density explosive to the next layer, the thick tamper of natural uranium. Its main job was to hold the critical mass together as long as possible, but it would also reflect neutrons back into the core. Some part of it might fission as well. To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of boron.
A polonium-beryllium <a href="modulated%20neutron%20initiator">modulated neutron initiator</a>, known as an "urchin" because its shape resembled a sea urchin, was developed to start the chain reaction at precisely the right moment. This work with the chemistry and metallurgy of radioactive polonium was directed by <a href="Charles%20Allen%20Thomas">Charles Allen Thomas</a> of the <a href="Monsanto%20Company">Monsanto Company</a> and became known as the <a href="Dayton%20Project">Dayton Project</a>. Testing required up to 500 <a href="curies">curies</a> per month of polonium, which Monsanto was able to deliver. The whole assembly was encased in a <a href="duralumin">duralumin</a> bomb casing to protect it from bullets and flak.

The ultimate task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with <a href="alpha%20particles">alpha particles</a>, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a <a href="plutonium%E2%80%93gallium%20alloy">plutonium–gallium alloy</a>, which stabilized the δ phase and could be <a href="Hot%20pressing">hot pressed</a> into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.

The work proved dangerous. By the end of the war, half the experienced chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine. A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site. The hemispheres for the first plutonium <a href="Pit%20%28nuclear%20weapon%29">pit</a> (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.

Following Oppenheimer's reorganization of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, the work on the uranium gun-type weapon was concentrated in <a href="Francis%20Birch%20%28geophysicist%29">Francis Birch</a>'s O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched uranium could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>.
After repeated slippages, the first shipment of slightly enriched uranium (13 to 15 percent uranium-235) arrived from Oak Ridge in March 1944. Shipments of <a href="highly%20enriched%20uranium">highly enriched uranium</a> commenced in June 1944. Criticality experiments and the Water Boiler had priority, so the metallurgists did not receive any until August 1944. In the meantime, the CM Division experimented with <a href="uranium%20hydride">uranium hydride</a>. This was considered by T Division as a prospective active material. The idea was that the hydrogen's ability as a neutron moderator would compensate for the loss of efficiency, but, as Bethe later recalled, its efficiency was "negligible or less, as Feynman would say", and the idea was dropped by August 1944.

<a href="Frank%20Spedding">Frank Spedding</a>'s <a href="Ames%20Project">Ames Project</a> had developed the <a href="Ames%20process">Ames process</a>, a method of producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but <a href="Cyril%20Stanley%20Smith">Cyril Stanley Smith</a>, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, and he wanted to avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched <a href="uranium%20tetrafluoride">uranium tetrafluoride</a>.

Two types of gun design were produced: Type A was of high alloy steel, and Type B of more ordinary steel. Type B was chosen for production because it was lighter. The primers and propellant were the same as those previously chosen for Thin Man. Scale test firing of the hollow projectile and target insert was conducted with the 3-inch/50 caliber gun and a <a href="20%20mm%20Hispano%20cannon">Hispano cannon</a>. Starting in December, test firing was done full-scale. Amazingly, the first test case produced turned out to be the best ever made. It was used in four test firings at the Anchor Ranch, and ultimately in the Little Boy used in the <a href="bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">bombing of Hiroshima</a>. The design specifications were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let to build the components. Three different plants were used so that no one would have a copy of the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target, case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in <a href="Center%20Line%2C%20Michigan">Center Line, Michigan</a>; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in <a href="Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit, Michigan</a>.

Birch's tidy schedule was disrupted in December by Groves, who ordered Oppenheimer to give priority to the gun-type over implosion, so that the weapon would be ready by 1 July 1945. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left <a href="Hunters%20Point%20Naval%20Shipyard">Hunters Point Naval Shipyard</a>, California, on 16 July aboard the <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> , arriving 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.

Although all of its components had been tested in target and drop tests, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before Hiroshima. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was insufficient uranium-235. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at <a href="Wendover%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wendover</a>, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.

The danger of accidental detonation made safety a concern. Little Boy incorporated basic safety mechanisms, but an accidental detonation could still occur. Tests were conducted to see whether a crash could drive the hollow "bullet" onto the "target" cylinder resulting in a massive release of radiation, or possibly nuclear detonation. These showed that this required an impact of 500 times that of gravity, which made it highly unlikely. There was still concern that a crash and a fire could trigger the explosives. If immersed in water, the uranium halves were subject to a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a> effect. While this would not have caused an explosion, it could have created widespread <a href="radioactive%20contamination">radioactive contamination</a>. For this reason, pilots were advised to crash on land rather than at sea.

The Water Boiler was an <a href="aqueous%20homogeneous%20reactor">aqueous homogeneous reactor</a>, a type of nuclear reactor in which the <a href="nuclear%20fuel">nuclear fuel</a> in the form of soluble <a href="uranium%20sulfate">uranium sulfate</a> is <a href="dissolution%20%28chemistry%29">dissolved</a> in water. Uranium sulfate was chosen instead of <a href="uranium%20nitrate">uranium nitrate</a> because sulfur's neutron capture cross section is less than that of nitrogen. The project was proposed by Bacher in April 1943 as part of an ongoing program of measuring critical masses in chain-reacting systems. He saw it also as a means of testing various materials in critical mass systems. T Division were opposed to the project, which was seen as a distraction from studies related to the form of chain reactions found in an atomic bomb, but Bacher prevailed on this point. Calculations related to the Water Boiler did take up an inordinate amount of T Division's time in 1943. The reactor theory developed by Fermi did not apply to the Water Boiler.

Little was known about building reactors in 1943. A group was created in Bacher's P Division, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group, under the leadership of <a href="Donald%20Kerst">Donald Kerst</a>, that included Charles P. Baker, <a href="Gerhart%20Friedlander">Gerhart Friedlander</a>, Lindsay Helmholtz, Marshall Holloway and <a href="Raemer%20Schreiber">Raemer Schreiber</a>. Robert F. Christy from the T-1 Group provided support with the theoretical calculations, in particular, a calculation of the critical mass. He calculated that 600 grams of uranium-235 would form a critical mass in a tamper of infinite size. Initially it was planned to operate the Water Boiler at 10 kW, but Fermi and <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a> visited in September 1943, and went over the proposed design. They pointed out the danger of decomposition of the uranium salt, and recommended heavier shielding. It was also noted that radioactive <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a> would be created that would have to be chemically removed. As a consequence, it was decided that the Water Boiler would only run at 1 kW until more operating experience had been accumulated, and features needed for high power operation were shelved for the time being.

Christy also calculated the area that would become contaminated if an accidental explosion occurred. A site in Los Alamos Canyon was selected that was a safe distance from the township and downstream from the water supply. Known as Omega, it was approved by the Governing Board on 19 August 1943. The Water Boiler was not simple to construct. The two halves of the stainless steel sphere that was the boiler had to be <a href="arc%20welding">arc welded</a> because <a href="solder">solder</a> would be corroded by the uranium salt. The CM-7 (Miscellaneous Metallurgy) Group produced <a href="beryllia">beryllia</a> bricks for the Water Boiler's tamper in December 1943 and January 1944. They were hot pressed in <a href="graphite">graphite</a> at at for 5 to 20 minutes. Some 53 bricks were made, shaped to fit around the boiler. The building at Omega Site was ready, if incomplete, by 1 February 1944, and the Water Boiler was fully assembled by 1 April. Sufficient enriched uranium had arrived by May to start it up, and it went critical on 9 May 1944. It was only the third reactor in the world to do so, the first two being the <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a> reactor at the Metallurgical Laboratory and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works. Improved cross-section measurements allowed Christy to refine his criticality estimate to 575 grams. In fact, only 565 grams were required. The accuracy of his prediction surprised Christy more than anyone.

In September 1944, the P-7 (Water Boiler) Group became the F-2 (Water Boiler) Group, part of Fermi's F Division. On completion of the planned series of experiments in June 1944, it was decided to rebuild it as a more powerful reactor. The original goal of 10 kW power was discarded in favor of 5 kW, which would keep the cooling requirements simple. It was estimated that it would have a <a href="neutron%20flux">neutron flux</a> of 5 x 10 neutrons per square centimeter per second. Water cooling was installed, along with additional control rods. This time uranium nitrate was used instead of uranium sulfate because the former could more easily be decontaminated. The tamper of beryllia bricks was surrounded with graphite blocks, as beryllia was hard to procure, and to avoid the (γ, n) reaction in the beryllium, in which <a href="gamma%20rays">gamma rays</a> produced by the reactor-generated neutrons:
The reactor commenced operation in December 1944.

From the first, research into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a fission bomb, the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient to keep it going. The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. An important contribution was made by <a href="Emil%20Konopinski">Emil Konopinski</a>, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases five times as much energy as a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a fission bomb, but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.
By September 1943, the values of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion reaction could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could be spared to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would spend the rest of the war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added <a href="Stanislaw%20Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, Jane Roberg, <a href="Geoffrey%20Chew">Geoffrey Chew</a>, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the <a href="Compton%20scattering">inverse Compton cooling</a>, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. <a href="Maria%20Goeppert">Maria Goeppert</a> joined the group in February 1945.

Teller argued for an increase in resources for Super research on the basis that it appeared to be far more difficult than anticipated. The board declined to do so, on the grounds that it was unlikely to bear fruit before the war ended, but did not cut it entirely. Indeed, Oppenheimer asked Groves to breed some tritium from deuterium in the X-10 Graphite Reactor. For some months Teller and Bethe argued about the priority of the Super research. In June 1944, Oppenheimer removed Teller and his Super Group from Bethe's T Division and placed it directly under himself. In September, it became the F-1 (Super) Group in Fermi' s F Division. Over the following months, Super research continued unabated. It was calculated that burning of liquid deuterium would release the energy of , enough to devastate . The Super Group was transferred back to T Division on 14 November 1945.

A colloquium on the Super was held at the Los Alamos Laboratory in April 1946 to review the work done during the war. Teller gave an outline of his "Classic Super" concept, and <a href="Nicholas%20Metropolis">Nicholas Metropolis</a> and <a href="Anthony%20L.%20Turkevich">Anthony L. Turkevich</a> presented the results of calculations that had been made concerning thermonuclear reactions. The final report on the Super, issued in June and prepared by Teller and his group, remained upbeat about the prospect of the Super being successfully developed, although that impression was not universal among those present at the colloquium. Work had to be curtailed in June 1946 due to the loss of staff. By 1950, calculations would show that the Classic Super would not work; that it would not only be unable to sustain thermonuclear burning in the deuterium fuel, but would be unable to ignite it in the first place.

Because of the complexity of an implosion-style weapon, it was decided that, despite the waste of fissile material, an initial test would be required. Groves approved the test, subject to the active material being recovered. Consideration was therefore given to a controlled fizzle, but Oppenheimer opted instead for a full-scale <a href="nuclear%20test">nuclear test</a>, codenamed "Trinity". In March 1944, responsibility for planning the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a professor of physics at Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge selected the <a href="Alamogordo%20Bombing%20Range">bombing range</a> near <a href="Alamogordo%20Army%20Airfield">Alamogordo Army Airfield</a> as the site for the test. Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a> and a <a href="commissary%20%28store%29">commissary</a>.

Groves did not relish the prospect of explaining the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed "Jumbo" was constructed to recover the active material in the event of a failure. Measuring long and wide, it was fabricated at great expense from of iron and steel by <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox">Babcock & Wilcox</a> in Barberton, Ohio. Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors. By the time it arrived, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.
A pre-test explosion was conducted on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments. A wooden test platform was erected from Ground Zero and piled with of TNT spiked with <a href="nuclear%20fission%20product">nuclear fission product</a>s in the form of an irradiated uranium slug from the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a>, which was dissolved and poured into tubing inside the explosive. This explosion was observed by Oppenheimer and Groves's new deputy commander, Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20Farrell%20%28general%29">Thomas Farrell</a>. The pre-test produced data that proved vital for the Trinity test.

For the actual test, the device, nicknamed "the gadget", was hoisted to the top of a steel tower, as detonation at that height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber. Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target, and generated less <a href="nuclear%20fallout">nuclear fallout</a>. The gadget was assembled under the supervision of <a href="Norris%20Bradbury">Norris Bradbury</a> at the nearby <a href="McDonald%20Ranch%20House">McDonald Ranch House</a> on 13 July, and precariously winched up the tower the following day. Observers included Bush, Chadwick, Conant, Farrell, Fermi, Groves, Lawrence, Oppenheimer and Tolman. At 05:30 on 16 July 1945 the gadget exploded with an <a href="TNT%20equivalent">energy equivalent</a> of around 20 kilotons of TNT, leaving a crater of <a href="Trinitite">Trinitite</a> (radioactive glass) in the desert wide. The shock wave was felt over away, and the <a href="mushroom%20cloud">mushroom cloud</a> reached in height. It was heard as far away as <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>, so Groves issued a cover story about an ammunition magazine explosion at Alamogordo Field.

Project Alberta, also known as Project A, was formed in March 1945, absorbing existing groups of Parsons's O Division that were working on bomb preparation and delivery. These included Ramsey's O-2 (Delivery) Group, Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group, Bainbridge's X-2 (Development, Engineering, and Tests) Group, Brode's O-3 (Fuse Development) Group and George Galloway's O-4 (Engineering) Group. Its role was to support the bomb delivery effort. Parsons became the head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his scientific and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate. In all, Project Alberta consisted of 51 Army, Navy and civilian personnel. The 1st Technical Service Detachment, to which the personnel of Project Alberta were administratively assigned, was commanded by <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Peer de Silva, and provided security and housing services on Tinian. There were two bomb assembly teams, a Fat Man Assembly Team under Commander Norris Bradbury and Roger Warner, and a Little Boy Assembly Team under Birch. <a href="Philip%20Morrison">Philip Morrison</a> was the head of the Pit Crew, <a href="Bernard%20Waldman">Bernard Waldman</a> and <a href="Luis%20W.%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a> led the Aerial Observation Team, and Sheldon Dike was in charge of the Aircraft Ordnance Team. Physicists Robert Serber and <a href="William%20Penney">William Penney</a>, and US Army <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-3%29">Captain</a> James F. Nolan, a medical expert, were special consultants. All members of Project Alberta had volunteered for the mission.
Project Alberta proceeded with the plan to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August, and the first Fat Man ready for use as soon as possible after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive <a href="pumpkin%20bomb">pumpkin bomb</a>s, versions of the Fat Man with the explosives, but not the fissile core. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> <a href="Leonard%20Cheshire">Leonard Cheshire</a>. Four Little Boy pre-assemblies, L-1, L-2, L-5 and L-6 were expended in test drops. The Little Boy team had the live bomb completely assembled and ready for use on 31 July. The final item of preparation for the operation came on 29 July 1945. Orders for the attack were issued to <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Carl%20Spaatz">Carl Spaatz</a> on 25 July under the signature of General <a href="Thomas%20T.%20Handy">Thomas T. Handy</a>, the acting <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief of Staff of the United States Army</a>, since <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army">General of the Army</a> <a href="George%20C.%20Marshall">George C. Marshall</a> was at the <a href="Potsdam%20Conference">Potsdam Conference</a> with <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>. The order designated four targets: <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, <a href="Kokura">Kokura</a>, <a href="Niigata%2C%20Niigata">Niigata</a>, and <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a>, and ordered the attack to be made "as soon as weather will permit after about 3 August".

Assembly of a Fat Man unit was a complex operation involving personnel from the High Explosive, Pit, Fusing and Firing teams. To prevent the assembly building from becoming overcrowded and thereby causing an accident, Parsons limited the numbers allowed inside at any time. Personnel waiting to perform a specific task had to wait their turn outside the building. The first Fat Man pre-assembly, known as F13, was assembled by 31 July, and expended in a drop test the next day. This was followed by F18 on 4 August, which was dropped the next day. Three sets of Fat Man pre-assemblies, designated F31, F32, and F33, arrived on B-29s of the <a href="509th%20Composite%20Group">509th Composite Group</a> and <a href="216th%20Army%20Air%20Forces%20Base%20Unit">216th Army Air Forces Base Unit</a> on 2 August. On inspection, the high explosive blocks of F32 were found to be badly cracked and unserviceable. The other two were assembled, with F33 earmarked for a rehearsal and F31 for operational use.
Parsons, as the weaponeer, was in command of the Hiroshima mission. With <a href="Second%20Lieutenant">Second Lieutenant</a> <a href="Morris%20R.%20Jeppson">Morris R. Jeppson</a> of the 1st Ordnance Squadron, he inserted the Little Boy's powder bags in the "<a href="Enola%20Gay">Enola Gay</a>"s bomb bay in flight. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored its circuits. Four other members of Project Alberta flew on the Hiroshima mission. <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a>, <a href="Harold%20Agnew">Harold Agnew</a> and <a href="Lawrence%20H.%20Johnston">Lawrence H. Johnston</a> were on the instrument plane "<a href="The%20Great%20Artiste%20%28B-29%29">The Great Artiste</a>". They dropped "Bangometer" canisters to measure the force of the blast, but this was not used to calculate the yield at the time. Bernard Waldman was the camera operator on the <a href="Necessary%20Evil%20%28aircraft%29">observation aircraft</a>. He was equipped with a special high-speed Fastax movie camera with six seconds of film in order to record the blast. Unfortunately, Waldman forgot to open the camera shutter, and no film was exposed. Other members of the team flew to <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> in case "Enola Gay" was forced to land there, but this was not required.

Purnell, Parsons, <a href="Paul%20Tibbets">Paul Tibbets</a>, Spaatz and <a href="Curtis%20LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a> met on Guam on 7 August, the day after the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have a Fat Man bomb ready by 11 August, as originally planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to do so. For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">Lieutenant</a> Philip M. Barnes, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as assistant weaponeer on the B-29 "<a href="Bockscar">Bockscar</a>". Walter Goodman and Lawrence H. Johnston were on board the instrumentation aircraft, "The Great Artiste". Leonard Cheshire and William Penney were on the observation plane "<a href="Big%20Stink%20%28B-29%29">Big Stink</a>". Robert Serber was supposed to be on board but was left behind by the aircraft commander because he had forgotten his parachute.

A medical program was established at Los Alamos under Captain James F. Nolan of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">United States Army Medical Corps</a>. Initially, a small five-bed infirmary was established for civilians, and a three-bed infirmary for military personnel. More serious cases were handled by the Army's Bruns General Hospital in Santa Fe, but this was soon regarded as unsatisfactory due to the loss of time due to the long trip, and security risks. Nolan recommended that the infirmaries be consolidated and expanded into a 60-bed hospital. A 54-bed hospital was opened in 1944, staffed by Army personnel. A dentist arrived in March 1944. A <a href="Veterinary%20Corps%20%28United%20States%20Army%29">Veterinary Corps</a> officer, Captain J. Stevenson, had already been assigned to look after the guard dogs.

Laboratory facilities for medical research were limited, but some research was conducted into the effects of radiation, and the absorption and toxic effects of metals, particularly plutonium and beryllium, mainly as a result of accidents. The Health Group began conducting urine tests of laboratory workers in early 1945, and many of these revealed dangerous levels of plutonium. Work on the Water Boiler also occasionally exposed workers to dangerous fission products. There were 24 fatal accidents at Los Alamos between its opening in 1943 and September 1946. Most involved construction workers. Four scientists died, including Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin in <a href="criticality%20accident">criticality accident</a>s involving the <a href="demon%20core">demon core</a>.

On 10 March 1945, a Japanese <a href="fire%20balloon">fire balloon</a> struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the Manhattan Project's reactors at the Hanford site to be temporarily shut down. This generated great concern at Los Alamos that the site might come under attack. One night found everyone staring at a strange light in the sky. Oppenheimer later recalled this demonstrated that "even a group of scientists is not proof against the errors of suggestion and hysteria".

With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special <a href="Counter%20Intelligence%20Corps">Counter Intelligence Corps</a> detachment was formed to handle the Manhattan Project's security issues. By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. The most successful Soviet spy was <a href="Klaus%20Fuchs">Klaus Fuchs</a> of the British Mission. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of <a href="Harry%20Gold">Harry Gold</a>, <a href="David%20Greenglass">David Greenglass</a> and <a href="Ethel%20and%20Julius%20Rosenberg">Ethel and Julius Rosenberg</a>. Other spies like <a href="Theodore%20Hall">Theodore Hall</a> remained unknown for decades.

After the war ended on 14 August 1945, Oppenheimer informed Groves of his intention to resign as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but agreed to remain until a suitable replacement could be found. Groves wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Norris Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who liked the fact that as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis. Groves announced this at a meeting of division leaders on 18 September. Parsons arranged for Bradbury to be quickly discharged from the Navy, which awarded him the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> for his wartime services. He remained in the Naval Reserve, though, ultimately retiring in 1961 with the rank of captain. On 16 October 1945, there was a ceremony at Los Alamos at which Groves presented the laboratory with the <a href="Army-Navy%20%26quot%3BE%26quot%3B%20Award">Army-Navy "E" Award</a>, and presented Oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation. Bradbury became the laboratory's second director the following day.
The first months of Bradbury's directorship were particularly trying. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It soon became clear that this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> into law until 1 August 1946, and it did not become active until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, Groves' legal authority to act was limited.

Most of the scientists at Los Alamos were eager to return to their laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher's G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, <a href="George%20Placzek">George Placzek</a> for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. Z Division was created in July 1945 to control testing, stock piling, and bomb assembly activities. It was named after <a href="Jerrold%20R.%20Zacharias">Jerrold R. Zacharias</a>, its leader until 17 October 1945, when he returned to MIT, and was succeeded by Roger S. Warner. It moved to <a href="Sandia%20Base">Sandia Base</a> between March and July 1946, except for its Z-4 (Mechanical Engineering) Group, which followed in February 1947.

The number of personnel at the Los Alamos Laboratory plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in substandard temporary wartime accommodation. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a>, the nuclear tests in the Pacific. <a href="Ralph%20A.%20Sawyer">Ralph A. Sawyer</a> was appointed the Technical Director with Marshall Holloway from B Division and Roger Warner from Z Division as associate directors. Two ships were assigned for Los Alamos Laboratory personnel, the and . Operation Crossroads cost the Los Alamos Laboratory over one million dollars, and the services of 150 personnel (about one-eighth of its staff) for nine months. As the United States had only about ten atomic bombs in mid-1946 about one fifth of the stockpile was expended.

The Los Alamos Laboratory became the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Scientific%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory</a> in January 1947. The contract with the University of California that had been negotiated in 1943 allowed the University to terminate it three months after the end of hostilities, and it served notice. There were concerns about the university operating a laboratory outside the state of California. The university was persuaded to rescind its notice, and the operating contract was extended until July 1948. Bradbury would remain director until 1970. The total cost of Project Y up to the end of 1946 was $57.88 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

Allied logistics in the Kokoda Track campaign

During the Second World War, <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> logistics in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> played a crucial role in bringing the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a> to a successful conclusion. "The great problem of warfare in the Pacific", <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> declared, "is to move forces into contact and maintain them. Victory is dependent upon solution to the logistic problem."

Although identified early as a vital strategic outpost, <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a>, the most significant Papuan town, had just two airfields and basic port facilities in early 1942. An enormous amount of work was required to transform it into a major base for both air and land operations against the Japanese. This was done in the face of frequent Japanese air raids. During the course of the Kokoda Track campaign, the two original airfields were improved, and five new airfields were developed. To make them operational, the engineers had to construct more than just runways; <a href="taxiway">taxiway</a>s, <a href="hardstand">hardstand</a>s, facilities and access roads all had to be built. The operation of the base depended on shipping, but the port facilities were limited. To increase the capacity of the port, a causeway was built to <a href="Tatana%20Island">Tatana Island</a>, where pontoon docks were emplaced. Engineers also built roads, warehouses, and a water treatment plant. They ran the town's electricity and water supply, and quarried stone for the roads and airstrips.

The Allies were confronted with an interior covered with <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> and tall mountains where wheeled vehicles could not operate. The Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The techniques and technologies to deliver supplies by air were in their infancy. There were few aircraft available, and these were of a variety of different types, complicating maintenance. Air operations in New Guinea were restricted by the weather. Transport aircraft were vulnerable in the air, and required fighter escorts. They were also subject to destruction on the ground by Japanese air raids. The loss of the airstrip at <a href="Kokoda">Kokoda</a> led to the adoption of air dropping. Due to a shortage of parachutes, supplies often had to be dropped without them, and loss due to breakages and unrecoverable goods was high.

Thousands of Papuans were conscripted to help the war effort. Trucks and jeeps carried stores, ammunition and rations only part of the way; pack animals and a <a href="Flying%20fox%20%28cablecar%29">flying fox</a> (zip-wire) took them a bit further. The rest of the journey was completed on the backs of Papuan carriers, who struggled over the mountains lugging heavy loads. The environment posed the danger of endemic tropic diseases, particularly <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, <a href="scrub%20typhus">scrub typhus</a> and <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. Medical units had to combat these, while caring for the sick and wounded, many of whom had to walk back to the base area along the <a href="Kokoda%20Track">Kokoda Track</a>. Often the Papuan carriers had to carry the wounded on the way back, earning them the <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a> of "<a href="Fuzzy%20Wuzzy%20Angels">Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels</a>".

In 1942, <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> was a territory of Australia. Around in area, it occupied the south eastern part of the island of New Guinea. The vegetation is largely <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>; higher altitudes are covered in moss. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. Tropical diseases, including <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="scrub%20typhus">scrub typhus</a>, <a href="hookworm">hookworm</a> and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> were endemic. The native population also suffered from <a href="tropical%20ulcer">tropical ulcer</a>s, <a href="yaws">yaws</a> and vitamin deficiencies, mainly <a href="beri%20beri">beri beri</a>.

The population was about 300,000, of whom 1,800 were Europeans; there were very few Asians owing to <a href="White%20Australia%20policy">Australia's immigration policy</a>. The main exports were <a href="copra">copra</a> and <a href="natural%20rubber">natural rubber</a>, of which it contributed about one-eighth of Australia's supply. There had been little development and it was largely devoid of infrastructure except around the administrative centre of <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> on the southern coast, which had two airfields and basic port facilities. Port Moresby was relatively dry, with a rainfall of less than per annum, mostly as a result of the north eastern monsoon that comes between December and April. By air, it was from the nearest Allied airbase at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, although there was a small airfield on <a href="Horn%20Island%2C%20Queensland">Horn Island</a> in the <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a>, whereas the Japanese airfields at <a href="Lae">Lae</a> and <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a> were less than away.

The <a href="Kokoda%20Track">Kokoda Track</a> is a foot track that runs roughly south west from Kokoda overland through the <a href="Owen%20Stanley%20Range">Owen Stanley Range</a> toward Port Moresby. It was used before the war as a mail route. While there is a main track that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The track reaches a height of . The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to . This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are flat areas, particularly around <a href="Myola">Myola</a>. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level resulting in fog.

In the first six months of the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a> Japanese forces <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">overran the Dutch East Indies</a>. <a href="Battle%20of%20Rabaul%20%281942%29">Rabaul was captured</a> on 23 January 1942, <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">Singapore fell</a> on 15 February, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae">Lae and Salamaua were occupied</a> on 8 March, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Java%20%281942%29">Java surrendered</a> on 9 March. <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="George%20Brett%20%28general%29">George Brett</a>, the American commander in Australia, feared that the Japanese would invade north western Australia. The Australian Chiefs of Staff disagreed. In an appreciation drafted by <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a>, then the Australian <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a>, on 5 March they argued that the Japanese would attempt to cut Australia's communications with the United States by moving against Port Moresby, <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> and Fiji. By mid-April, Allied intelligence was warning of an imminent Japanese seaborne attack on Port Moresby, which was repulsed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Battle of the Coral Sea</a> on 5–8 May.

<a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> arrived in Australia on 17 March, and was appointed <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Commander</a> of the newly established <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area">South West Pacific Area</a> (SWPA) on 18 April. <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> intelligence picked up Japanese plans for an overland advance on 19 May, and on 9 June he informed the commander of Allied Land Forces, <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, that the evidence was mounting that the Japanese might attempt to attack Port Moresby overland from <a href="Buna%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buna</a> via Kokoda. On 20 June, Blamey ordered <a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> <a href="Basil%20Morris">Basil Morris</a>, the commander of the <a href="8th%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">8th Military District</a>, in charge of all the troops in Papua and New Guinea, to prevent such an attempt. In the wake of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a> on 4–7 June, MacArthur began planning to recapture Rabaul. On 15 July, the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> ordered the first phase of the advance, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">capture of Guadalcanal</a>, despite MacArthur's warning that inadequate aircraft, airbases and shipping resources on hand made the operation extremely risky. A first step was to secure the Buna area, where airfields could be established from whence the Japanese bases could be attacked without aircraft having to overfly the Owen Stanley Range.

The Australian Chiefs of Staff identified Port Moresby as an important outpost early in the war. A <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company</a> of the <a href="15th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">15th Infantry Battalion</a> was sent to Port Moresby in July 1940 and in October was transferred to the <a href="49th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">49th Infantry Battalion</a>. In February 1941, the Chiefs of Staff decided to reinforce the garrison by sending the rest of the 49th Infantry Battalion, a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> unit, but specially enlisted for service in the tropics.
On 8 December, warned that the Japanese might attack Rabaul and Port Moresby, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Vernon%20Sturdee">Vernon Sturdee</a> decided to reinforce the garrison, sending the <a href="39th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">39th</a> and <a href="53rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">53rd Infantry Battalions</a>, and other units of the <a href="30th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">30th Infantry Brigade</a>, and the guns of the <a href="13th%20Field%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">13th Field Regiment</a> and the 23rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery. In January 1942, the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) at Port Moresby consisted of six <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Hudson</a> <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s, four <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">Wirraway</a> general purpose aircraft and two <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Catalina</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s. No <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> were available.

The first Japanese air raid on Port Moresby occurred on 3 February 1942, and the anti-aircraft gunners shot down their first Japanese aircraft on 28 February, during a raid in which two RAAF Catalinas were destroyed. The February 1942 raids touched off panic, disorder and looting which Morris did not have the <a href="Provost%20%28military%20police%29">provost</a> resources to control. The first fighter aircraft, <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Kittyhawks</a> of <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron RAAF</a> under the command of <a href="Squadron%20Leader">Squadron Leader</a> <a href="John%20Francis%20Jackson">John Francis Jackson</a>, reached Port Moresby on 21 March, flying by way of Horn Island because they lacked the range to fly directly from Townsville. They soon became involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Port%20Moresby">Battle of Port Moresby</a>, taking heavy losses, and were relieved by the <a href="Bell%20P-39%20Airacobra">Bell P-39 Airacobra</a>s of the US <a href="35th%20Fighter%20Squadron">35th</a> and <a href="36th%20Fighter%20Squadron">36th Fighter Squadron</a>s on 30 April. Port Moresby experienced its one-hundredth air raid on 23 January 1943.

The first unit of the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) to arrive, the 2/3rd Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, disembarked on 11 April 1942, having returned to Australia from the Middle East just four weeks before. The US 101st Coast Artillery (Anti-Aircraft) Battalion followed on 5 May, and its commander, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Joseph%20Bacon%20Fraser">Joseph B. Fraser</a>, took charge of Port Moresby's anti-aircraft defences. Morris's command became <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a> on 15 April. By the end of June the ground forces in New Guinea consisted of 1,098 AIF, 12,273 Militia and 2,208 American troops.

On 24 June, Morris ordered the 39th Infantry Battalion (less one company) and the <a href="Papuan%20Infantry%20Battalion">Papuan Infantry Battalion</a>, as <a href="Maroubra%20Force">Maroubra Force</a>, to defend Kokoda. The Japanese landed in the Buna area on 21 July. At this point, B Company of the 39th Infantry Battalion was at Kokoda, with C Company advancing along the track, departing Ilolo on 23 July. The remainder of the battalion was poised to move and most of it had arrived at Deniki by 4 August. Maroubra Force was run out of Kokoda on 29 July. MacArthur was sanguine about this, believing that the landings on Guadalcanal on 8 August would cause the Japanese to withdraw to Buna. Blamey was not so sure, and ordered the AIF <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a>, under the command of Major General <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur Allen</a>, to Port Moresby to reinforce Maroubra Force.

On 12 August 1942, Rowell assumed command of New Guinea Force. Morris remained as commander of the <a href="Australian%20New%20Guinea%20Administrative%20Unit">Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit</a> (ANGAU), which was responsible for <a href="civil%20affairs">civil affairs</a> in Papua and <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Services%20of%20Supply">United States Army Services of Supply</a> (USASOS) units in Papua were initially part of Base Section 2 in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a>, but on 20 August 1942, the US Advanced Base, New Guinea, was established under the command of Colonel A. J. Matthews. At first there was no Australian equivalent. Blamey suggested that one was required. Rowell demurred, but agreed to a Port Moresby Base Sub Area commander with a small staff. He emphasised that what he wanted was not some "officer wallah type" but a "practical man with commonsense". So Blamey sent Major <a href="Charles%20Moses">Charles Moses</a>, who possessed the requested attributes, being a former officer of the <a href="8th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">8th Division</a> who had escaped from Singapore.

Blamey superseded Rowell in command of New Guinea Force on 23 September. MacArthur visited Blamey in Port Moresby on 4 October 1942 and the two agreed to establish a Combined Operations Service Command (COSC) to co-ordinate logistical activities. To command it, MacArthur appointed <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Dwight%20Johns">Dwight Johns</a>, the deputy commander of <a href="USASOS">USASOS</a> in SWPA, an expert on airbase construction. He was given an Australian deputy, Brigadier <a href="Victor%20Secombe">Victor Secombe</a>, who had directed the rehabilitation of the port of <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> in 1941. All Australian and American logistical units were placed under COSC, which also controlled a fleet of small craft and <a href="lugger">lugger</a>s.

Since New Guinea is an island, logistic support of the defenders ultimately depended on shipping. Australia started the war at a disadvantage because the Bruce-Page government sold the Government Line at a loss in 1928, leaving the country without shipping under national control. Australian ships were requisitioned by the Shipping Control Board, and by the end of 1942 almost all Australian coastal vessels had been taken up by the Board, the armed services, or the Americans. The Board resorted to <a href="Chartering%20%28shipping%29">chartering</a> ships, but few were obtainable, as the British <a href="Ministry%20of%20War%20Transport">Ministry of War Transport</a> and the American <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> were in control of almost all the world's shipping. Some 24 ships were on charter on 1 January 1942; 22 were on 1 January 1943. Some "refugee" ships—ships from occupied countries—reached Australian ports in 1942, although many of these were already on charter.

An important role in the upcoming campaign was played by 21 Dutch <a href="Koninklijke%20Paketvaart-Maatschappij">Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij</a> (KPM) refugee ships of . These, along with two other refugee ships and six vessels originally intended for the Shipping Control Board, were transferred to American control. During 1942, of cargo was carried by chartered ships, of which was coastal cargo. Lacking other options, resort was made to using ships on overseas voyages to carry coastal cargo. Between April and November 1942, this averaged each month. In addition, the Australian Army operated five <a href="troopship">troopship</a>s: the and , which could each carry 1,500 troops; and the smaller "Gorgon", and "Ormiston", which carried between 590 and 650 troops each. Having separate American and Australian shipping organisations saved the two armies from having to learn each other's procedures while still trying to master their own, but it created inefficiencies through the need for coordination.

Twenty merchant ships were lost in <a href="Axis%20naval%20activity%20in%20Australian%20waters">Axis naval activity in Australian waters</a> in 1942. In an air raid on Port Moresby on 17 June 1942, the was hit and set ablaze; three crewmen and a member of the Army working party were killed. A second air raid the following day scored more direct hits on the ship, which burned fiercely, and was a total loss. Five more members of the crew were killed and one fatally injured. Another 63 men were injured in the attack, including the master, Captain James Campbell. Two ships were attacked by Japanese submarines in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Papua">Gulf of Papua</a>. The sank the by gunfire on 6 August 1942, and machine gunned survivors in the water. Of "Mamutu"s 142 passengers and crew, 114 were lost. "RO-33" struck again on 29 August, torpedoing the MV "Malaita", which was returning to <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> after delivering troops and supplies to Port Moresby. Although listing 10 degrees to starboard, "Malaita" remained afloat, and was taken in tow by and . Their escort, the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> , picked up an <a href="ASDIC">ASDIC</a> contact on the "RO-33", and delivered a series of <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> attacks that sank it.
Port Moresby became congested in September 1942. This represented a dangerous situation, as ships there were subject to Japanese air attacks, so procedures were instituted whereby ships would wait at Townsville until called forward. Due to lack of capacity at Port Moresby, it made no sense for ships to travel in convoy, so they sailed to and from Port Moresby individually or in small groups. Convoys to New Guinea did not commence until December 1942. Turnaround time for ships from Townsville to Port Moresby was 11 to 13 days, of which 5 to 7 days was spent awaiting discharge in Port Moresby. Some 125 ship voyages were made to Port Moresby between May and November 1942. During 1942, 3,033 vehicles, 199 guns and of stores were shipped to New Guinea.

The standard ocean-going cargo ship was the <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a>. They were not ideal for logistical purposes. With a maximum speed of , they were slow, but this was considered less important than their ability to be turned out cheaply and in large numbers. They were deliberately built small, which reduced the loss when one was sunk, but limited the cargo capacity to . Critically, their <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> was when fully laden. They had five small holds, each with its own hatch. Their curved sides made them wider at the top than the bottom, and wider amidships than fore and aft. Containerisation of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were <a href="break%20bulk%20cargo">break bulk cargo</a>, with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as to wedge everything together tightly, as items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize.

Loading at Australian ports was frequently disorganised and sloppy. <a href="Manifest%20%28transportation%29">Manifests</a> were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force did not know the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took time for them to learn about military cargoes and procedures.

In early 1942 Port Moresby had only one deepwater <a href="wharf">wharf</a> and two small <a href="jetty">jetties</a>. Another pre-war wharf had existed at <a href="Bootless%20Inlet">Bootless Inlet</a> but in the panic, had been demolished and the inlet mined without recording the location of the mines. The timber wharf had an approach that was long and wide and a T-section long and wide. As such, it could accommodate only one Liberty ship at a time. The jetties, one stone and one timber, were just long, and could only be used by lighters and shallow draft vessels.

To increase the rate of discharge, the Tug and Lighter Company, a unit which had served in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Tobruk">Siege of Tobruk</a>, was sent to Port Moresby. On arrival on 23 August, it found only two lighters and no <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a>s. It improvised, repairing the wharf's crane and salvaging tackle from the wreck of the "Macdhui". Harbour craft arrived on Liberty ships over the next couple of months, but no more than one tug and ten lighters were available at any time during 1942. The African-American 611th Port Company arrived in June, and the Australian 2/1st Docks Operating Company in mid-September. Major R. C. Ballantyne, who had been in charge of wharf operations at Tobruk, was appointed Docks Superintendent. Unloading was still slowed by the lack of storage space in the wharf area. The dumps had been dispersed in the hills up to from Port Moresby, the roads were poor, and there was a serious shortage of trucks to move stores from the wharf to the dumps.
Eight ships bound for Port Moresby were lying idle off Townsville or Cairns on 12 October, waiting to be called forward. General Headquarters (GHQ) SWPA estimated that at the current rate of discharge it would take two weeks before they were called forward. Ironically, five of them were carrying equipment and stores needed to upgrade the port facilities. Extending the wharf required piling and heavy timber that was not immediately available. Matthews decided on a bold plan. <a href="Tatana%20Island">Tatana Island</a>, about west of Port Moresby, had deep water off its northwest side. About offshore, it was separated from the mainland by shallow water with a coral reef bottom. He proposed taking the 2nd Battalion, 96th General Service Regiment off its work on aerodrome maintenance and refuelling and rearming aircraft, and use them to construct a causeway from the mainland to Tatana Island, where pontoon docks could be built. The materials required were immediately available, but doubts were expressed about whether a causeway could withstand the force of storms and tides. Lacking boats for a hydrographic survey, one was conducted by wading during an exceptionally low tide in late September.

Work commenced on 5 October. Equipment and personnel were ferried across to Tatana Island so it could proceed from both ends. Some of fill totalling was required to establish a roadway long and wide above the high tide mark. Work was completed on 30 October and the first ship berthed there on 3 November. Port capacity was increased from per day. However, the project did not proceed without controversy. A heavy downpour on 21 October confirmed the airmen's worst fears, and Lieutenant General <a href="George%20C.%20Kenney">George C. Kenney</a>, the commander of Allied Air Forces (AAF), sent a letter to MacArthur on 26 October informing him that while work to upgrade the airfield runways before the wet season was nearly completed, aircraft could not operate from them without <a href="taxiway">taxiway</a>s, <a href="hardstand">hardstand</a>s, facilities and access roads, all of which were far from ready. He warned that he might have to withdraw at least two squadrons back to Australia. Major General <a href="Richard%20Sutherland">Richard Sutherland</a>, MacArthur's chief of staff at GHQ, and Brigadier General <a href="Hugh%20J.%20Casey">Hugh J. Casey</a>, his chief engineer, reassured Kenney everything possible would be done to keep the airfields operational in the wet season. Additional engineer units were ordered to Port Moresby, and work on the port and the Nine Mile Quarry was handed over to the Australians.
On 31 March—just a fortnight after his arrival in Australia—MacArthur sent Casey and his air officer, Brigadier General <a href="Harold%20H.%20George">Harold H. George</a> to survey the situation in Port Moresby. They drew up plans to develop it into a base to support future operations. They recognised that to secure the area required work far beyond its environs. They called for the airfield at Horn Island to be upgraded, and new airfields to be constructed on the <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> north of Townsville around <a href="Mareeba">Mareeba</a>, <a href="Cooktown">Cooktown</a> and <a href="Coen%2C%20Queensland">Coen</a>. This would allow ships to have fighter cover crossing the Torres Strait. To protect Port Moresby's eastern flank, GHQ decided to establish an airstrip in the <a href="Abau%20District">Abau</a>–<a href="Mullins%20Harbour">Mullins Harbour</a> area. <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a> was subsequently determined to be a better location, and a garrison was sent by sea from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip, at <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a> on the south coast of <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Dutch New Guinea</a>, was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank.

The airfields in the Port Moresby area were initially known by their approximate distance from Port Moresby. In April 1942, there were only two operational airfields: <a href="Jacksons%20International%20Airport">Seven Mile Drome</a>, an airfield developed by the RAAF with a single runway, and Three Mile Drome (also known as <a href="Kila%20Airfield">Kila Airfield</a>), a pre-war civilian airfield. Work had commenced on two more: <a href="Schwimmer%20Airfield">Fourteen Mile</a>, also known as Laloki, and <a href="Wards%20Airfield">Five Mile</a>, which had originally been developed as an emergency landing strip. Four more were subsequently developed: Twelve Mile, Fourteen Mile, <a href="Durand%20Airfield">Seventeen Mile</a> and Thirty Mile.

On 10 November, the Port Moresby airfields, except for Kila, were renamed after men who had been killed defending them. Seven Mile was renamed after Jackson, who was shot down over Port Moresby on 28 April; Fourteen Mile after Charles Schwimmer, one of four American P-39 pilots who was lost in an attack on Lae on 4 May; and Five Mile after Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward, the commander of the 53rd Infantry Battalion, who was involved in its construction, and was killed in the fighting on the Kokoda Track on 27 August. Twelve Mile was renamed Berry after Major Jack W. Berry, the commander of the 39th Fighter Squadron, who was killed on a practice bombing mission on 4 August when his bomb exploded directly underneath his aircraft, causing it to flip and crash into the sea. Seventeen Mile was renamed Durand after First Lieutenant Edward D. Durand, the first American fighter pilot shot down over New Guinea. After being forced down near Salamaua on 30 April, he was captured and executed by the Japanese. Thirty Mile Drome, also known as Rorona, was renamed Rogers after Major Floyd (Buck) Rogers, the commander of the <a href="8th%20Bombardment%20Squadron">8th Bombardment Squadron</a>, whose <a href="A-24%20Banshee">A-24 Banshee</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a> was shot down over <a href="Gona">Gona</a> on 29 July.
Engineer units in Port Moresby at the end of April were the 7th Field Company, 1st Army Troops Company, the field stores section of the 61st Field Park Company, a section of the 1st Mechanical Equipment Company, and the 1st Bomb Disposal Section. The 14th Field Company arrived with the <a href="14th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">14th Infantry Brigade</a> in May. The first US troops to be stationed in New Guinea were an advance party of the African-American <a href="96th%20Engineer%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">96th Engineer Battalion</a> on 28 April, but the battalion was not complete until June. They were followed by Company E of the <a href="43rd%20Engineer%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">43rd Engineer General Service Regiment</a> and a dump truck section of the 576th Engineer Company. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived in July. The 96th Engineer Battalion was reorganised as the 96th Engineer General Service Regiment in September. In response to Kenney's 26 October warning to MacArthur, the <a href="46th%20Engineer%20Battalion%20%28United%20States%29">46th</a> and <a href="91st%20Engineer%20General%20Service%20Regiment">91st Engineer General Service Regiment</a>s and the rest of the 576th Dump Truck Company were ordered to move to Port Moresby in November.
The main mission of the 96th was patching Jackson Drome's runways after Japanese bombing, but they also assisted with refuelling aircraft and loading them with bombs, and unloading ships in the harbour. It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the holes with rubble. They would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, which had to be compacted, rolled and re-surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments over the runways that could cause punctures and <a href="Blowout%20%28tire%29">blowouts</a> in airplane tyres, resulting in accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments had to be made after each bombing raid.

The engineers discovered that they had much to learn about airfield construction in Papua, particularly the importance of proper drainage. The arrival of the 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion permitted extensive rehabilitation work on Jackson. The runway had been sealed with an excess of <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a>, which became soft in the heat, and parked aircraft tended to sink into it. When the bitumen was removed to be re-laid, hydroscopic clay under parts of the runway became supersaturated through seepage, and springs developed. The engineers were forced to install underground drains, and put down a new base of crushed rock, which was sealed with bitumen. Although air operations were curtailed, the airfield remained operational.

Kila Drome was originally considered too poorly-located to be more than an emergency strip, because a high ridge from one end of the runway, restricted air operations. However, the airfield was seldom fogged in, and could often operate when all the other airfields were closed. It was therefore decided to increase the runway to . The first coat of bitumen was applied in November 1942, but before the final coat could be applied, heavy rains came and saturated the <a href="subgrade">subgrade</a>. The runway rutted and became more hazardous than ever. The 96th Engineer General Service Regiment dug a ditch along the length of the runway, but this became another aviation safety hazard. The ditch was then filled in with rock to create a <a href="French%20drain">French drain</a>.
Bulldozers carved Schwimmer Drome out of the jungle. Only a few feet above the normal level of the Laloki River, it was susceptible to periodic flooding. The base material used for the runway was laid over alluvial sand and gravel, and <a href="Marston%20Mat">Marston Mat</a> used for the surface. The resulting runway was not capable of all-weather operation, so a second runway was constructed parallel to the first. This time gravel dredged from the Laloki River was used as a base. It was spread while wet and then rolled to form a firm base. Marston Mat was removed from the original to provide a surface for the new all-weather runway, which was ready for use in November 1942. A low <a href="trestle%20bridge">trestle bridge</a> over the Laloki River provided access. It was understood that the bridge might be washed away by floods, so pontoon equipment was provided for this eventuality. This was needed; a downpour on 21 October swept away the bridge, and rendered Three Mile, Seven Mile and Thirty Mile non-operational. The bridge was replaced by a high steel structure.

Berry was located on higher ground south east of Schwimmer. Casey and George assigned it a high priority, and the 96th Engineer General Service Regiment was assigned to the task. The existing dry weather strip was cleared and <a href="Grubbing">grubbed</a> for a runway. The short runway restricted air operations to fighters and transports, but it could not be extended without extensive earth removal. It was ultimately surfaced with of crushed rock and gravel.
To enable heavy four-engine bombers to fly long-range missions, longer all-weather airfields were required. Casey designated two sites for development: the emergency airstrip at Wards, and a new site at Seventeen Mile. The work at Wards was assigned to <a href="No.%201%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF</a>, which had been working on Wards since 17 August, surfacing it with gravel. It received its orders to construct a new runway west of the old one on 11 September. The runway was provided with a compacted gravel surface to hold the weight of heavy bombers. As the squadron also had to construct a water pipeline from the <a href="Waigani">Waigani</a> Swamp, the schedule slipped. Following a visit on 3 November by Colonel <a href="Leif%20Sverdrup">Leif Sverdrup</a> from GHQ and Matthews, now the head of construction at COSC, additional resources were allocated. B Company of the <a href="2/1st%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/1st Pioneer Battalion</a> arrived on 13 November to assist with laying the Marston Mat and the water pipes. The 46th Engineer General Service Regiment assisted with the dispersal areas and <a href="Revetment%20%28aircraft%29">revetments</a>. The original runway was then upgraded to all-weather standard too. The other site designated for heavy bombers was Seventeen Mile. The 808th Engineer Aviation Battalion cleared and grubbed the area, and laid out the runway. This was surfaced with of clay-bound shale, and sealed with <a href="tar">tar</a> to create an all-weather surface. This did not prove satisfactory, and Marston Mat had to be laid down.

The Thirty Mile site on Galley Reach, an inlet north west of Port Moresby was accessible by water transport through a channel through the coral reef. A dry weather airstrip was constructed by Company E, 43rd Engineer General Service Regiment, with help from large numbers of Papuan labourers who loaded the river gravel into trucks. This was ready for use on 20 July, but to make it into an airbase required the construction of two docks on Galley Reach. In September, work was halted by the tactical situation, with Japanese patrols reported not far from Rorona. Air warning equipment was removed, and Marston Mat earmarked for Thirty Mile was allocated to other projects. By the end of November, the runway had been extended to , with sections at each end topped with Marston Mat. Work continued on all the other airfields in 1943, but Rogers was abandoned.

The 1st Army Troops Company was responsible for Port Moresby's utilities: the power house, freezers, electrical installations, lighting and water supply. By June 1942 the water supply was close to its maximum capacity, with the pumping station at Bomana pumping water from the Laloki River 24 hours a day. The main water main ran under the south eastern end of the Jackson Drome, a prime target for Japanese air raids, and the water pipe was consequently prone to damage. From one cause or another there were 40 to 50 breaks per month. By October 1942 the reservoir level was falling, indicating that usage was exceeding pumping capacity. A new intake and pumping station was constructed near Schwimmer Drome to bring water from the Laloki River to a treatment plant and concrete reservoir on Twin Peaks Mountain. The 1st Army Troops Company assumed responsibility for its operation upon its completion in March 1943.

Depots were established inland rather than in the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A speed limit was imposed to minimise damage to the main road. This was covered with of dust that turned to mud when it rained. The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for one-way traffic and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one storeman on hand to receive it. Soon, no one knew what lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile.
The depots and airbases depended on an efficient road network, so the engineers gave this a high priority. A major effort was made to bring the roads up to all-weather standard before onset of the 1942 wet season. New roads were also built. One of the first was the By Pass Road, which was designed to divert traffic from the main road, which ran around the south eastern end of Jackson Drome, and was therefore an operational hazard. The By Pass Road ran between Jackson and Wards Dromes, and was later extended to Berry, Schwimmer and Durand Dromes. The opening of the new wharf at Tatana Island in October caused a sudden jump in road traffic, so a new Barune Road was opened in November that provided a loop to Jackson and Wards Dromes. Fortunately, the local red shale contained clay and rock fragments, and when laid on a prepared subgrade and watered, either by sprinklers or rain, became hard like concrete. This could take motor vehicle traffic, although it became dusty when dry and slippery when wet. Surfacing material was obtained from the Nine Mile Quarry. Wood was found to be unsuitable for <a href="culvert">culvert</a>s, as it was quickly destroyed by the action of climate and insects. Oil drums were found to be superior, but they rusted, and using them for culverts depleted the drum supply.

There were no facilities in Port Moresby for the bulk storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in <a href="44-gallon%20drum">44-gallon drum</a>s, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the <a href="imperial%20gallon">imperial gallon</a>. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from <a href="Rheem">Rheem</a> in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.

Crucial to road and airfield development was the output of the Nine Mile Quarry. Initially it was run by the 1st Army Troops Company, which installed suspended electric lighting, allowing the quarry to be worked around the clock from 30 April 1942. Companies A and C of the 96th Engineer Battalion took over the running of the quarry in June. In turn, they were relieved by C Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion in November. Work went on in three eight hour shifts per day, seven days a week. The face of the quarry was drilled from the top and dropped to the floor by blasting. Knapping hammers were used to break the stone into small pieces that could be lifted onto trucks by hand. There were two rock crushers on hand; an old model and a modern mobile diesel crusher supplied by the US Army.

When the campaign began, the Kokoda Track started at McDonald's Corner, just beyond Ilolo. From there, the track slowly rose about to what later became known as Owers' Corner. The road from Port Moresby was sealed as far as Seven Mile, and from there a gravel surface was laid to provide an all-weather road as far as <a href="Sogeri">Sogeri</a>, roughly from Port Moresby. On 24 June, GHQ queried whether it would be possible to upgrade the track to one that could handle animal transport or, better still, motor vehicles. There were multiple tracks leading to Kokoda, and in addition to the main track, there was interest at New Guinea Force HQ in a route along the Brown River that had been partially surveyed in 1912.

On 5 July, there were 1,140 motor vehicles with New Guinea Force. Of these, 300 had arrived with the garrison in 1941, 120 were local vehicles that had been taken over, and 600 had arrived in April and May. The state of the available motor vehicles at this time was poor. Many of the impressed vehicles were odd types for which spare parts were scarce. Most vehicles had been in constant use, and maintenance had been neglected. Many were missing log books or had never had them, so what maintenance had been performed was uncertain. Moreover, the 30th Brigade had no light aid detachment (LAD) to work on them. Major P. A. Billis, the Deputy Assistant Director of Ordnance Services (DADOS) for Engineering recommended that 200 new vehicles be sent as a matter of urgency. More vehicles arrived with the 7th Division, and the 21st Brigade section of the 2/7th Division Workshop established itself at Ilolo on 19 August, mainly to service engineer equipment used for road work.

Owers' Corner was named after Lieutenant Noel Owers, who was given the task of surveying a new route from Ilolo to Nauro. The project of constructing a <a href="Willys%20MB">jeep</a> track to Nauro was pushed aggressively by the Chief Engineer at New Guinea Force, Brigadier John Main. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Bleechmore was placed in charge, and was given the 7th and 2/14th Field Companies and a section of the 2/1st Mechanical Equipment Company. Work commenced on 19 August. Removing the trees allowed the sun to dry out the ground, and by adding drainage, a track was created passable by light vehicles, allowing plant and equipment to be brought up. Owers' Corner was reached in early September.

At this point the route Owers surveyed departed from the mule track. The track descended down the ridge on a grade too steep for motor vehicles, so the road then proceeded along the ridge line. The 7th Field Company then encountered of rock, which had to be drilled and blasted. The jeep track was abandoned at this point, but work continued on a mule track, which was advanced about per day until mid-September, when the engineer units were withdrawn to Port Moresby due to the deteriorating tactical situation, with the Japanese <a href="Battle%20of%20Ioribaiwa">closing in on Ioribaiwa</a>. Work resumed on 28 September, but was abandoned in early October. Units working on the road were supplied by pack transport. Improvements to the road allowed 3-ton trucks to reach Owers' Corner on 28 September. The jeeps were then moved to a new line of communications running from Itiki through Subitana.

The 1st Independent Light Horse Troop was a small mounted unit consisting of one officer and 20 other ranks. It was raised at <a href="Koitaki">Koitaki</a> on 1 April 1942, using the horses from the station there. It was originally engaged in patrolling and locating crashed aircraft around Port Moresby, but on 26 June it was assigned to the pack transport role on the Kokoda Track. A remount sub section of 6 men impressed <a href="mule">mule</a>s, horses and pack <a href="saddlery">saddlery</a> from the plantations around Sogeri, and rounded up and broke <a href="brumby">brumbies</a> from the Bootless Inlet area. It was found that the mules were best-suited for the task, with the brumbies next. Because the tracks were narrow, they trained the animals to walk in single file, led by a mounted rider at the front and trailed by one at the rear of the column. Each animal carried of stores, which were packed in bags to facilitate their transfer to Papuan carriers. The Goldie River was bridged on 2 July, and the mule track was extended to Uberi. Pack transport hauled of supplies in June, between 3 and 16 July, between 17 July and 16 August, and between 17 and 29 August.
The steep descent near Owers' Corner to the Goldie River crossing at Uberi involved a steep ascent for the animals on the return trip. The 2/6th Field Company constructed a <a href="Flying%20fox%20%28cablecar%29">flying fox</a>, which went into operation on 26 September. Descending , it was long, with an intermediate station. The empty tackle was returned by the weight of the cargo, which was up to . In late August, the 1st Light Horse Troop was reorganised as a pack transport section, with six sub sections. One prepared the loads, weighing them to ensure that there was on each side. The other five were each under the command of a <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>, with 5 other ranks, 3 riding horses and 10 to 12 pack horses or mules. With a call for more supplies to be delivered, the remount unit was recalled, and 29 other ranks were added from the 55th Infantry Battalion in September, bringing the total strength to 1 officer, 81 other ranks, 39 mules and 63 horses, and allowing four more sub sections to be formed. The 1st Independent Light Horse Troop struggled with epidemics of <a href="strangles">strangles</a> and infectious nasal <a href="catarrh">catarrh</a> among horses imported from Australia, and the saddlery became increasingly worn until 60 new saddles arrived from Australia in September.

Meanwhile, the 1st Pack Transport Company was formed at <a href="Royal%20Park%2C%20Melbourne">Royal Park</a> in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> on 25 August. It had entrained for Queensland on 25 September, and arrived in Port Moresby on 7 October. In late October it began relieving the 1st Light Horse Troop. By the end of October, the 1st Pack Transport Company had one officer and 110 other ranks with 43 mules and 135 horses working on the track. The 1st Light Horse Troop was relieved on 5 November, and was reorganised as the New Guinea Force Pack Transport Company. It was later renamed the 7th Pack Transport Company. In all, some of supplies were moved forward of the jeephead by animal transport.

The acting Commander, 7th Division <a href="Australian%20Army%20Service%20Corps">Australian Army Service Corps</a> (AASC), Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Richardson, assumed control of logistics on the track on 10 September. Supplies were then brought from the Base Supply Depots at Sogeri and Ilolo to Newton's Depot in 3-ton trucks by the 2/5th AASC Company. The 2/4th AASC Company moved them by jeep to the roadhead at Owers' Corner. The flying fox was used to take them to the floor of the Goldie River Valley, from whence the 1st Independent Light Horse Troop carried them to Uberi. From there, they were carried on the backs of Papuan porters, known as carriers. If there were more stores than the animals could carry, they would assist with that too.

Since the number of pack animals and carriers was limited, the requirements for stores and supplies of all types, including rations, ammunition, ordnance, signals equipment and medical supplies, were submitted to 7th Division headquarters, which allocated movement priorities. One of Richardson's first actions was to obtain more saddlery for the pack horses. He also acquired five more American jeeps to augment the five that had been working the jeep track. The original five were found to be in poor condition, and needed overhaul. While the <a href="25th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">25th Infantry Brigade</a> was conducting operations in the Imita Ridge area, the carry was short, and despite the fact that there were no suitable air dropping zones, the supply situation was good. As the Australians began advancing toward Kokoda again in October, the supply line became steadily longer, and the demand for carriers more acute.

From Uberi, the track ran to Ioribaiwa. The first involved a gruelling climb. Sappers cut steps to create what became known as the "Golden Stairs". In many ways this made it harder, as it forced the walker to lift his feet higher. This was especially so for the Papuans who were the most frequent users of the track, and who were not used to stairs. The technique would not be used in 1943. The Papuan carriers moved supplies forward from Uberi, often under arduous conditions. The pre-war plantation economy of the Australian territories of Papua and New Guinea was based on a system of indentured labour. On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort.

About 800 Papuan civilians were working in the Port Moresby area in April 1942. Responding to increasing calls for carriers, ANGAU conscripted 2,033 Papuans in June, 3,354 in July, and 4,947 in August. On 9 October, ANGAU was maintaining 9,270 Papuan workers. Casting such a wide net created problems. Although all spoke <a href="Motu%20language">Motuan</a>, the prevalence of different dialects meant that they could not all communicate with one another. ANGAU representatives sorted them into groups that spoke the same dialect. Taking away so many able-bodied men caused hardship for their families and villages, as jobs they normally performed went undone, and food production fell away. However, atrocities committed by the Japanese against Papuan and New Guinea civilians proved a persuasive recruiting tool.
A carrier could carry about 13 days' worth of food, and traversing the track took eight days. A carrier load was assessed at , but the water-logged wrapping caused it to weigh more. Since the carriers could not carry more, ANGAU had to take this into account when preparing the loads. The initial movement of the 39th Infantry Battalion to Kokoda was supported by 600 carriers under Lieutenant <a href="Herbert%20Thomson%20Kienzle">H. T. (Bert) Kienzle</a> from ANGAU. Along the track, Kienzle and Sergeant Major Maga of the <a href="Royal%20Papuan%20Constabulary">Royal Papuan Constabulary</a> established way stations, which they stocked with food gathered locally, and were manned by ANGAU, who were responsible for both the carriers and the stores.

The 39th Infantry Battalion was able to travel light because it did not have to carry heavy stores or equipment. Morris arranged for an old Thursday Island <a href="schooner">schooner</a>, the "Gili Gili", to take of stores and equipment by sea. These included <a href="Vickers%20machine%20gun">Vickers machine gun</a>s and <a href="Lewis%20gun">Lewis gun</a>s. "Gili Gili" departed Port Moresby on 4 July, and arrived at Buna on 19 July. Captain Tom Grahamslaw, the local ANGAU District Officer, arranged for 1,500 carriers to take the stores to Kokoda.

The Allied retreat from Kokoda in August and September was a trying time for the carriers, who were pushed to their limit, hauling supplies up to the front, and then carrying the wounded back. Not only did it take eight men to move each casualty, but they moved far more slowly, taking three times as long to traverse the track. It was intended that there would be separate carrier lines for supply and casualty evacuation, but this could not be adhered to. Each non-walking casualty meant three fewer bundles of supplies delivered per day for each carrier employed evacuating wounded. By 30 August, all the carriers had been drafted into evacuating the wounded except those reserved for carrying the <a href="Ordnance%20ML%203%20inch%20mortar">3-inch mortars</a>. The retreat and the sight of the wounded depressed the morale of the carriers, who repeatedly asked Kienzle why the Australians could not defeat the Japanese.

On 13 September, there were 310 carriers working in the forward area, and 860 at Uberi. Overwork and illness took its toll on them. Captain Geoffrey (Doc) Vernon, a deaf veteran of the <a href="Great%20War">Great War</a>, was sent by ANGAU as medical officer for the carriers. He was greatly disturbed at what he saw in August: 
Newspaper reports, photographs, and newsreel films soon appeared of Papuan carriers tending to Australian wounded while struggling over towering mountains and across raging torrents of rivers. This produced an outpouring of gratitude among the civilian population in Australia, who called them "<a href="Fuzzy%20Wuzzy%20Angels">Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels</a>"; it would affect the way that Australians viewed their neighbour for many decades to come.

The first air transport unit in SWPA was the Air Transport Command, a <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) unit which was formed at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a> in Queensland on 28 January 1942. It was equipped with five <a href="C-53">C-53</a>s originally bound for the Philippines, and two <a href="Douglas%20B-18%20Bolo">B-18s</a> and a <a href="Douglas%20C-39">C-39</a> that had escaped from there. Only two of the original 14 pilots were fully qualified on transports; the remaining 12 had to be retrained. Of the 19 airmen, 12 were trained as aircrew members. It was redesignated the US <a href="21st%20Airlift%20Squadron">21st Transport Squadron</a> on 3 April. On the same date, the US <a href="22nd%20Airlift%20Squadron">22nd Transport Squadron</a> was formed at <a href="Essendon%20Airport">Essendon Airport</a> in Victoria with former <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Indies%20Airways">Royal Netherlands Indies Airways</a> (KNILM) and <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20East%20Indies%20Army%20Air%20Force">Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force</a> (RNEIAAF) aircraft that had arrived in Australia from Java. The two squadrons were redesignated the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons on 26 July.
On 21 May, the 21st Transport Squadron had a B-18, two C-39s, a <a href="C-47">C-47</a>, three C-53s, two ex-KNILM <a href="DC-2">DC-2</a>s, two ex-KNILM <a href="DC-3">DC-3</a>s, three ex-KNILM <a href="Douglas%20DC-5">DC-5s</a>, two ex-KNILM <a href="Daimler%20L14">L14s</a>, and three <a href="O-47">O-47</a>s. The 22nd Transport Squadron had a <a href="B-17">B-17</a>, two C-39s, a C-47, a B-18, an ex-KNILM L-14, and eleven ex-RNEIAAF <a href="C-56%20Lodestar">C-56s</a>. The 21st Transport Squadron flew its first mission in New Guinea on 22 May, flying from Port Moresby to <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a> and <a href="Bulolo">Bulolo</a> with supplies for <a href="Kanga%20Force">Kanga Force</a>, the small Australian garrison there. Thereafter missions were frequently flown; but the two squadrons were still based in Queensland, not Port Moresby, and would not relocate there until the following year. The RAAF formed four transport squadrons in February and March 1942, and <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron RAAF</a> began flying a regular passenger and freight service from Townsville to Port Moresby on 5 March. It received <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>s in September and a detachment was sent to Port Moresby the following month. Aircraft of <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 36 Squadron RAAF</a> also made occasional trips to New Guinea in 1942, and twenty RAAF pilots were seconded to US troop carrier squadrons.

The difficulties of operating in New Guinea soon became apparent. Two attempts to reach Wau on 23 May 1942 failed due to bad weather. On 26 May, five transports were flying to Wau when they were attacked by 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a>es, which were engaged by the escorting P-39s of the 35th, 36th and <a href="39th%20Fighter%20Squadron">39th Fighter Squadron</a>s. The transports delivered their loads successfully, but one P-39 was lost. The transports always took off in daylight; weather reports were not available before dawn, and the fighter escort could not operate in darkness. Weather was a constant hazard over the Owen Stanley Range, and clouds could build up faster than an aircraft could climb. Poor flying weather, either over Port Moresby or over the target, could ground the transports for a week or more at a time.

Weather and rough airstrips increased the amount of maintenance required to keep the planes flying. So too did the climate. The high humidity encouraged the growth of fungus which shorted out electrical components; metal surfaces were subject to corrosion; and lubrication oils evaporated in the high temperatures. Critical spare parts were often out of stock, and their delivery was an important role of the intra-theatre air transport. Availability did not just mean the transports; there was also the fighter escorts, which were normally based at another field. If they could not fly, or were required for another mission, then the transports could not fly. For planning purposes, a C-39 planeload was reckoned at with of fuel, while that of the larger C-53 was reckoned at with of fuel; but loading charts were not available in 1942, and aircraft were sometimes overloaded.

The first air transport mission to the Kokoda front was flown on 26 July, when a DC-3 from the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron landed 15 troops of the 39th Infantry Battalion and some stores. A C-53 followed that afternoon with another 15 men and some stores. The flight time to Kokoda was about 20 minutes. An air supply run the following day by a C-53 and a DC-2 found the airstrip barricaded. The barricades were removed, but the aircraft were recalled by a radio message that the Kokoda Drome could not be held. The loss of the airstrip meant a switch to air dropping supplies. An aircraft was sent that afternoon, but was recalled. On 28 July, a DC-5, a DC-3 and a DC-2 dropped supplies near Kokoda. Three transports dropped supplies near Kagi on 29 July, and one on 30 July. No more missions were flown until 6 August.

Morris formed a good working relationship with the air commander in New Guinea, Brigadier General <a href="Martin%20F.%20Scanlon">Martin F. Scanlon</a>, but in early August Scanlon was replaced by Brigadier General <a href="Ennis%20C.%20Whitehead">Ennis C. Whitehead</a>, who sent the two DC-3-type transport aircraft back to Australia. By 18 August, some of vital supplies had piled up in Townsville, awaiting air transport to Port Moresby. This left only a single DC-2 at Port Moresby; a Lodestar arrived on 8 August. An urgent message from Morris to Advance LHQ resulted in GHQ despatching four DC-3-type aircraft to Port Moresby. Advance LHQ reminded New Guinea Force of the procedure for requesting transport aircraft, to which Colonel <a href="Frederick%20Oliver%20Chilton">Frederck Chilton</a>, the <a href="GSO1">GSO1</a> at New Guinea Force HQ, protested that it was "too slow and has already cost us Kokoda".
Techniques for air dropping had yet to be developed. Following the loss of the airstrip at Kokoda, the AAF concluded that the only way to get supplies to A Company, 39th Infantry Battalion in the Kokoda area was to adopt a suggestion from the Army to put them in fighter drop tanks. The tanks were slit, along the bottom, and they were filled with supplies. The first attempt on 11 August was called off due to bad weather, but four fighters dropped a total of on 12 August. By then it was too late; the area was in Japanese hands. A forward supply dump was established at Myola, in a dry lake bed that Kienzle found on 3 August. The lake bed was flat and treeless, making it a good candidate for a supply drop zone. Several days of good weather after 9 August allowed the transport aircraft to concentrate on dropping at Myola.

When he assumed command, Rowell was informed that 25 days' supply of food and ammunition for 2,000 men was stored there, but on checking it was found that there were only four days' rations, with two days' reserves held forward of Myola. The official historian, Dudley McCarthy, suggested that "the rations were never dropped at all, and that the explanation lay in faulty work by an inexperienced staff". In his memoirs, Rowell maintained that the missing rations had been sent, and must have fallen outside the target area. On 21 August, Kienzle discovered a second, much larger, dry lake bed at Myola. The two lake beds came to be called Myola 1 and 2, but the maps issued to air crews showed only one. Drops may have been made at the wrong one.

But there are other explanations for the missing rations. The inexperienced New Guinea Force staff assumed that the supplies they despatched would arrive, but this was far from the case with air dropping, the techniques for which had yet to be properly developed. Kienzle picked what he thought were good drop zones, but the air crews sometimes found them restricted or dangerous. The aircraft had to fly low over the drop zone, at about , and slow, at about . They had to take the wind into account, as it might cause parachuted packages to miss the drop zone. The load would be placed in the doorway, and three or four men would push it out when the pilot gave the signal. The pilot would fly level or with the nose slightly down, so that cargo would not hit the tail of the aircraft. The pilot would retract the landing gear if it was down, and climb to gain altitude. Multiple passes over the drop zone might be required. Heavy loads were not practical for air dropping missions, since the aircraft had to arrive low and slow over the drop zone, but higher speed was required for greater weight. Nor could an overloaded aircraft climb or dive quickly. The 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons were still based in Queensland and not at Port Moresby, so the aircrew were there on short rotations. Their learning process was therefore fitful and slow. Men from various Army and RAAF units assisted the aircrew in the task of pushing stores out of the aircraft.

Packaging was primitive and inadequate in 1942, even for normal handling under New Guinea conditions. Cardboard boxes disintegrated, cans rusted,
and wooden boxes rotted or were eaten by insects. Parachutes for air dropping were in short supply. Orders for parachutes were placed in Australia, the United States and India. A request for 5,000 cargo parachutes with containers was made to Washington on 21 July. On 22 September it was decided to send 1,000 without containers by air, while the rest went by sea. Due to the shortage of parachutes, most supplies had to be "free-dropped"—dropped without parachutes—so the rate of breakage was high. As the contents of the packaging usually burst, they were encased in two or more sacks, the outer being much larger than the inner, so it could contain the contents when the inner burst, and prevent them from scattering. Three layers was found necessary. Items such as sacks and blankets were preferred as packaging, as these were useful to the troops. About 12,000 blankets were used in the five weeks up to 12 October. The earlier adoption of blankets as packaging would not only have saved supplies from breakage, but would have also increased the volume of supplies delivered over the track, as thousands of blankets were sent by carrier. Without a well-organised recovery effort, less that 50 percent of what was dropped was recovered, and perhaps 70 per cent of what was recovered was found to be in a usable condition.
On 16 August, Whitehead promised to deliver of ammunition, of rations and of supplies, a total of , to Maroubra Force daily to maintain three battalions in the Kokoda area; but the following day there was a disastrous air raid on Jackson Drome. A large force of Japanese 25 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi G4M</a> (Betty) bombers escorted by 22 Zero fighters reached Port Moresby undetected. No air raid warning was sounded and no fighters took off to intercept before the attack. They caught ten <a href="Martin%20B-26%20Marauder">Martin B-26 Marauder</a>s of the <a href="22nd%20Bombardment%20Group">22nd Bombardment Group</a> on the ground armed and fuelled. Four were destroyed, as were three transports of the 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons, a DC-5 and two C-56s. Another eight aircraft were badly damaged: four B-26s, a C-39, a C-49 and two C-53s. The two C-53s were patched up and flown back to Australia for more extensive repairs.

Rowell pressed Blamey for more aircraft. He wanted to build up 20 days' reserves over and above Maroubra Force's daily requirement of , which would require the movement of another of stores and ammunition. Even spread over 20 days, this would require an additional 2,000 carriers. Blamey went to MacArthur, who arranged for six <a href="A-24%20Dauntless">A-24 Dauntless</a> dive bombers, a B-17 and two transports to be made available. MacArthur reminded Blamey that:
MacArthur and Kenney did prevail on Washington to provide more troop carrier aircraft. In July, SWPA was given a high priority for transport aircraft, with six additional squadrons earmarked to bring it up to two <a href="Group%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">groups</a>. They were scheduled to arrive in November and December, but their movement was expedited, and the first new squadron, the <a href="6th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron">6th Troop Carrier Squadron</a>, reached Port Moresby on 14 October. Part of the <a href="33rd%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron">33rd Troop Carrier Squadron</a> was held up in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific Area</a>, which also had urgent needs. In the meantime, ten DC-3s were converted into C-49s and C-50s at the <a href="Sacramento%20Air%20Depot">Sacramento Air Depot</a> and flown out to Australia, where they were allocated to the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron in September. Ten <a href="C-60%20Lodestar">C-60 Lodestar</a>s were also despatched, which joined the 22nd Troop Carrier Squadron.

When the 17 August raid occurred, two battalions of the <a href="21st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">21st Infantry Brigade</a> under Brigadier <a href="Arnold%20Potts">Arnold Potts</a> were moving forward to retake Kokoda and prepare for operations to recapture Buna. On being informed by Potts that only 10,000 instead of the anticipated 40,000 rations were at Myola, Rowell took immediate steps to ease the supply situation. He held back the third battalion of Potts' brigade, the <a href="2/27th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/27th Infantry Battalion</a>, and ordered Allen to return the 39th Infantry Battalion to Port Moresby. Kienzle had 933 Papuans working between Myola and Isurava. Not all were carriers; some collected supplies from the drop area, and others were engaged in other work, such as building huts and shelters. Rowell turned down a request from Potts for 800 more carriers to move supplies forward from Myola, allowing him only another 300 from the Port Moresby-Myola carrier line until stocks at Myola were built up. Potts' role was to be a defensive one until then, and the 2/14th and 2/16th were to remain in the Myola area. On 23 August, an aircraft dropped rations, medical supplies, two 3-inch mortars and 120 mortar bombs. Another four loads were dropped the following day before clouds closed in over Myola. Allen reported that 5,000 emergency rations and 1,500 balanced rations had been dropped, along with of biscuits and of other ration components, and 21,000 quinine tablets. Some 237,000 rounds of <a href=".303%20British">.303</a> ammunition for the rifles, 140,000 rounds of <a href=".45%20ACP">.45</a> for the <a href="Thompson%20submachine%20gun">Thompson submachine gun</a>s, and 1,050 <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>s had been sent to Myola.

The Japanese <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">landing at Milne Bay</a> on 25 August caused Allen to retain the 2/27th Infantry Battalion in the Port Moresby area in case of a seaborne attack, and he ordered Potts to expedite the return of the 39th Infantry Battalion. As late as 25 August, Potts still intended to recapture Kokoda with the 2/14th, but his plans were overtaken by events. The Japanese <a href="Battle%20of%20Isurava">attacked at Isurava</a>, and although his force, which still included the 39th Battalion, slightly outnumbered the Japanese, Potts was defeated. Myola was lost on 5 September, along with 10,000 rations. In his report, Potts noted that due to the delay caused by the shortage of supplies at Myola, "at no time were the 2/14th and 2/16th Australian Infantry Battalions ever intact and available for a concerted operation, wholly and solely due to delays occasioned by supply".

From 16 September, the AASC officer at each depot reported the stock levels at 18:00 each day. Demands for supplies were forwarded from the Q Branch at New Guinea Force headquarters to the Deputy Director of Supplies and Transport. This was matched up with the number and type of available aircraft. Trucks drew the stores from the depots, where they were packaged and prepared for dropping, and took them to the aerodrome, usually Jackson or Kila. As time went by, standard load lists were developed. Packages of rations were "balanced"–arranged so they contained a complete set of commodities—so that the loss of some packages would not result in surpluses of one commodity and shortages of another. One truck was allocated to each plane, plus one additional truck in case another aircraft became available. Each plane would be loaded with the contents of one truck. Planes might return with some or all of their load, or not take off at all. At the end of the day, stores remaining on aircraft would be loaded back onto the trucks, and would be returned to the depots. Some were despatched by air supply in August, in September, and in October. New drop zones were developed around Efogi, Nauro and Manari. Myola was recaptured on 14 October, and Myola 1 and 2 were developed as drop zones.

The first medical unit to arrive was the <a href="3rd%20Field%20Ambulance%20%28Australia%29">3rd Field Ambulance</a>, which left <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> on 25 December 1941, and moved into the Murray Barracks in Port Moresby on 3 January 1942. The base hospital became the 46th Camp Hospital, and moved to King's Hollow, a site on the Laloki River from Port Moresby. A Red Cross convalescent home at Rouna became the 113th Convalescent Depot. On 3 June the hospital ship brought the 14th Field Ambulance and the 5th Casualty Clearing Station.

The 2/9th General Hospital arrived from South Australia on the hospital ship "<a href="Manunda">Manunda</a>" on 23 August. It moved to a site at Rouna, from Port Moresby. It was the only general hospital in New Guinea until the 2/5th General Hospital arrived in January 1943. Due to the prospect that Port Moresby might fall, it was sent without its nurses or <a href="Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Women%27s%20Service">Australian Army Medical Women's Service</a> physiotherapists. Staffed as a 600-bed hospital, it held 732 patients on 6 October. Its commanding officer, Colonel A. H. Green, suggested that it be expanded to a 1,200-bed hospital, or that another 600-bed hospital be sent from Australia. Authorisation was given to expand to 800 beds on 29 September, and the nurses and physiotherapists were sent. Between when it opened in September and the end of December, the 2/9th General Hospital admitted 10,083 patients.

Malaria was a concern, as it was endemic in New Guinea. There was no <a href="plasmoquine">plasmoquine</a> to cure it, and the main drug used to combat it was <a href="quinine">quinine</a>, which was not fully effective. The recommended dosage of per day was found to be insufficient to give protection against the disease in highly malarious areas. Quinine was also in short supply, as Java, which had been overrun by the Japanese, accounted for 90 per cent of the world's supply. Moreover, many failed to take the required dose with regularity, insect repellents were not available or not used, protective clothing was not issued to all the troops, and some still went around at night in short sleeves and shorts.

Colonel <a href="Neil%20Hamilton%20Fairley">Neil Hamilton Fairley</a>, the Australian Army's Director of Medicine, and Major <a href="Ian%20Murray%20Mackerras">Ian Murray Mackerras</a> visited Port Moresby in June 1942. Both were experts on tropical medicine. They noted that the garrison had suffered 1,184 cases of malaria, an infection rate of 149 per thousand. They recommended that to conserve quinine, men could be taken off it during the dry season, and observed for relapses. Fortunately, the climate in the Owen Stanley Range was not favourable to mosquitoes, and most cases were relapses by men infected in Port Moresby or Syria. Potts therefore decided on 24 August that anti-malarial precautions were no longer necessary.

An epidemic of dysentery broke out on the Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected in the early stages of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Edward%20Ford%20%28physician%29">Edward Ford</a>, the Assistant Director of Pathology at New Guinea Force headquarters, arranged for supplies of a new drug, <a href="sulphaguanidine">sulphaguanidine</a>, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.

Scrub typhus was spread by mites that lived in the soil. Soldiers walking through mite-infested areas were fairly safe, but if they sat or lay down or stood still for long enough, the mites could attach themselves. Although the incidence of typhus was much less than that of malaria or dysentery, it was more lethal. Of 2,839 Australian servicemen affected in SWPA, 9.05% died. Scrub itch, a skin irritation caused by mite bites, was a more common but far less serious ailment. <a href="Tinea">Tinea</a> was also a problem, due to the inability of men to keep their clothes or boots dry, or to wash them. A shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables caused vitamin-deficiency-related problems. To save weight and simplify the distribution of rations, the 7th Division staff cut back the number of commodities in the ration from thirteen (bully beef, biscuits, tea, sugar, salt, dried fruit, jam, butter, milk, cheese, tinned fruit, tinned vegetables and bacon) to just the first six. Inevitably, both the troops and the carriers began to suffer from vitamin deficiencies as well as exhaustion and illness. To supplement the carriers' <a href="vitamin%20B">vitamin B</a> intake, <a href="marmite">marmite</a> was air dropped for them, but only was available.
Major J. R. Magarey, the Senior Medical Officer of the 2/6th Field Ambulance, initially instituted an unusual casualty evacuation plan, under which casualties were evacuated forward instead of rearward, as Potts expected to be able to recapture the airstrip at Kokoda, which would allow casualties to be flown out. In forward areas where the carriers could not go, the men of the Papuan Infantry Battalion pitched in, making four teams of stretcher bearers available. During Potts' retreat to Ioribaiwa, casualty evacuation had to be along the track. Medical care was available at each way station. Magarey recalled that:

<a href="War%20correspondent">War correspondent</a> <a href="Osmar%20White">Osmar White</a> saw wounded men on the track: 

Those with more serious injuries had to be carried down the track. The usual decision as to whether it was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.

When Myola was recaptured in October, a Main Dressing Station (MDS) was established there, manned by the 2/4th Field Ambulance and a surgical team from the 2/9th General Hospital. On 1 November, 438 patients were held at Myola. Three days later, Kokoda was back in Australian hands and an MDS established there. It was hoped that aircraft could land at Myola and evacuate the sick and wounded, but Myola was above sea level, and the pilots reported that a fully loaded aircraft would not be able to take off or land at that altitude, and would have trouble clearing the surrounding hills. Risking the precious transports seemed inadvisable. Five light aircraft were made available: three <a href="Stinson%20L-1%20Vigilant">Stinson L-1 Vigilant</a>s, a <a href="De%20Havilland%20DH.50">De Havilland DH.50</a>, and a <a href="Ford%20Trimotor">Ford Trimotor</a>. Two Stinsons evacuated 35 patients, and the Ford another eight from Myola, but the Ford and a Stinson crashed while attempting to land at the Port Moresby end of the lake bed, which had become soft after recent rains, on 22 and 24 November respectively. Over time, more than 200 patients recovered sufficiently to return to their units. Walking wounded were sent down the track, while those unable to walk were carried to Kokoda by Papuan carriers, and flown out from there. The last seven walking cases left for Ilolo on 16 December, and the last four stretcher cases for Kokoda on 18 December; the MDS at Myola closed the following day.<ref name="2/6 Field Ambulance War Diary">War Diary, 2/6th Field Ambulance, Australian War Memorial, Canberra, AWM52 11/12/15</ref>

The Australian Army had entered the Second World War with inadequate resources due to severe cutbacks at the hands of conservative governments in the 1920s and 1930s. This was compounded by a lack of interest and appreciation of logistics on the part of its civilian and military leadership. There was an assumption that the Australian Army would form part of an expeditionary force that would fight overseas in a larger British force. This was indeed the case in the Great War, and again in the Second World War in the Middle East and Malaya, but not in SWPA, where the Australian Army not only had to provide its own logistic support, but support to its Allies as well.

In an environment where motor transport could not operate, the Australian Army was forced to rely on air transport and native carriers, two modes of transportation that it had never used before. The Australian Army had many lessons to learn, but it proved capable of adapting to the circumstances it found itself in. The fighting along the Kokoda Track was but the start of the effort to drive the Japanese from New Guinea that would continue in 1943.

Jacob Gens

Jacob Gens (1 April 1903 – 14 September 1943) was a <a href="Lithuanian%20Jew">Lithuanian Jew</a>ish head of the <a href="Vilnius%20Ghetto">Vilnius Ghetto</a>. Originally from a merchant family, he joined the <a href="Lithuanian%20Army">Lithuanian Army</a> shortly after the <a href="Act%20of%20Independence%20of%20Lithuania">independence of Lithuania</a>, rising to the rank of captain while also securing a college degree in law and economics. He married a non-Jew and worked at several jobs, including as a teacher, accountant, and an administrator.

When <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Germany invaded Lithuania</a>, Gens headed the Jewish hospital in Vilnius before the formation of the ghetto in September 1941. He was appointed chief of the ghetto police force and in July 1942 the Germans appointed him head of the ghetto Jewish government. He attempted to secure better conditions in the ghetto and believed that it was possible to save some Jews by working for the Germans. Gens and his policemen helped Germans in rounding up the Jews for deportation and execution in <a href="Ponary%20massacre">Ponary</a> in October–December 1941 and in liquidating several smaller ghettos from late 1942 to early 1943. His policies, including the attempt to save some Jews by surrendering others for deportation or execution, continue to be a subject of debate and controversy.

Gens was shot by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> on 14 September 1943, shortly before the ghetto was liquidated and most of the residents sent either to labor camps or to execution at an <a href="extermination%20camp">extermination camp</a>. His Lithuanian wife and daughter escaped the Gestapo and survived the war.

Gens was born on 1 April 1903 in near <a href="%C5%A0iauliai">Šiauliai</a> in what was then the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> and is now <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>. His father was a merchant and Gens was the oldest of four sons. Gens attended a Russian-language primary school and then a secondary school in Šiauliai. He was fluent in <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a>, <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, German, and <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a>, and knew some <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, and English. In 1919, Gens enlisted in the newly formed <a href="Lithuanian%20Army">Lithuanian Army</a>. He was sent to officers' school and completed the training as a <a href="junior%20lieutenant">junior lieutenant</a>. N. Karni, who was a cadet with Gens, said that he "had great personal charm. I do not remember him ever being in a bad mood." Karni also felt Gens had "leadership qualities, he had personality, he was a man of principles". Gens' participation in the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20War">Polish–Lithuanian War</a> and the completion of his secondary schooling earned Gens a promotion to <a href="senior%20lieutenant">senior lieutenant</a>.

Gens was transferred into the army reserves in 1924 and moved to <a href="Ukmerg%C4%97">Ukmergė</a> to teach physical education and the Lithuanian language at a Jewish school. In 1924, Gens married Elvyra Budreikaitė, a non-Jewish Lithuanian. He appears to have wanted to transfer from the infantry into the <a href="Lithuanian%20Air%20Force">Lithuanian Air Force</a>, but at the time it was only accepting unmarried men. The couple had a daughter, Ada, in 1926, and moved to <a href="Kaunas">Kaunas</a> the following year. Gens studied at <a href="Kaunas%20University">Kaunas University</a> and worked as an accountant at the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28Lithuania%29">Ministry of Justice</a>. He graduated in 1935 with a degree in law and economics. He was called back to the regular army in the late 1930s and promoted to captain. He worked for the <a href="Shell%20Oil%20Company">Shell Oil Corporation</a> for two years from 1935, then took a job with , a Lithuanian co-operative.

Gens was a <a href="Zionist">Zionist</a>, and was a follower of the <a href="Revisionist%20Zionism">Revisionist Zionism</a> school, which called for most European Jews to immediately emigrate to create the State of Israel in what were then the <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a>s of <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine%20%28legal%20instrument%29">Palestine</a> and <a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Trans-Jordan</a>. He belonged to <a href="Brith%20ha-Hayal">Brith ha-Hayal</a>, a Jewish organization for military reservists.

After the formation of the <a href="Lithuanian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> in July 1940, Gens was fired from his job. He was unable to secure a work permit nor was he allowed to continue to live in Kaunas. He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to <a href="Gulag">Soviet labor camps</a>, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the <a href="Political%20commissar">political officer</a> attached to the hospital did not need to be informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the <a href="June%20deportation">Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia</a>, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.

The German Army entered Vilnius on 24 June 1941, as part of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">their invasion of Russia</a> in World War II. After their arrival, Gens was put in charge of the Jewish hospital. The occupying authorities ordered the creation of the <a href="Judenrat">Judenrat</a>, or Jewish Council, with community-selected members. In early September 1941, the Germans murdered most of the Judenrat, which left the Jewish community leaderless before and during the relocation of the Jews into two ghettos in Vilnius. During this period, the hospital sheltered several prominent Jews from Vilnius. When the ghettos were formed, the Jewish hospital was included within the confines of the larger ghetto, an unusual arrangement for a Nazi-period ghetto. Most ghettos were organized to exclude any Jewish hospitals, forcing the inhabitants to either do without a hospital or set up a makeshift one.

In September 1941, Gens was named the commander of the <a href="Jewish%20Ghetto%20Police">Jewish policemen</a> for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, <a href="Anatol%20Friend">Anatol Friend</a>. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the occupiers as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.

The police force comprised around 200 men at the start, and Gens appointed <a href="Salk%20Dessler">Salk Dessler</a> as his deputy commandant. Other chief subordinates included <a href="Joseph%20Muszkat">Joseph Muszkat</a> and <a href="Meir%20Levas">Meir Levas</a>. Dessler was a Revisionist Zionist, and Muszkat and Levas had been members of the <a href="Betar">Betar</a>, the youth movement of the Revisionist Zionists. The police force included many other former Betar members, and this may have been because Gens favored people coming from his own political leanings. This led to a conflict with the <a href="General%20Jewish%20Labour%20Bund%20in%20Lithuania%2C%20Poland%20and%20Russia">Bund</a>, another Jewish political group. The Bund appears to have wanted the police force to be more of a <a href="militia">militia</a>, with Gens and his supporters wishing it to be a more conventional police force. After some initial political wrangling, Gens' faction won, but the Bundists remained strong in the Judenrat.

The smaller ghetto was liquidated in mid-October 1941, which left the larger one. From late October to December 1941, the ghetto was subject to "Aktions", selections of people for <a href="Deportation%23Deportation%20in%20the%20Holocaust">deportation</a> and execution in <a href="Ponary%20massacre">Ponary</a>. Gens was afraid that the actions of the Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police round up the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>s, who argued Gens was acting against <a href="Halakha">Jewish law</a>. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.

During the deportations, he tried to secure more work permits from the Germans but they refused to issue them. He attempted to protect those he could. During the "Aktion" on 3–5 November, in which the paperwork of everyone in the ghetto was checked, holders of work passes – which allowed the holder to protect a spouse and only two children under 16 – were checked and anyone not listed on someone's work permit was sent to Ponary. At one point, while Gens was checking permits, a family with three children went through the checkpoint, and Gens pulled aside the third child. Shortly afterwards, a family with only one child passed through the checkpoint. Gens began berating the father for losing track of his second child, and pushed the third child from the first family into the second family. This incident took place under the supervision of German officials, who did not intervene.

All those removed from the ghetto were taken to Ponary where they were killed. The last deportation took place on 21 December 1941, leaving between 12,500 and 17,200 residents in the ghetto. Of those, about 3,000 were "illegal", or residents without a work permit. At least 60,000 Jews had lived in Vilnius when the <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Lithuania%20during%20World%20War%20II">German occupation</a> began.

Gens and the Judenrat in the larger ghetto were aware of the executions in Ponary by the end of September 1941, when survivors began returning to the ghetto. The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in the ghetto by late December 1941 or early January 1942.

After the "Aktions" in late 1941, no further large-scale deportations or other massacres took place in the Vilnius Ghetto. This period of calm lasted throughout 1942 and early 1943. During this period, Gens' department oversaw the three police precincts the ghetto had been divided into, as well as the ghetto's prison. The police force in early 1942 had about 200 policemen.

During early 1942, Gens became involved in a power struggle with the head of the Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Friend had not been involved in Vilnius' Jewish organizations prior to the German invasion, and did not have much support from the ghetto's inhabitants. Gens was viewed favorably by the ghetto residents, partly because he lived in the ghetto when he could have escaped. Over time, Gens and the police force encroached on the functions of the Judenrat. The Germans backed Gens' efforts to secure more power, and implied that he was not responsible to the Judenrat, and that the Judenrat had no power over Gens or the Jewish policemen.

In February, the Germans allowed the Judenrat to set up a judicial system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.

Gens had a dispute with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a tailoring workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts to go through the Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Hingst">Hans Hingst</a>, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.

Gens also came into conflict with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which would not be the case if there were German guards at the gates.

On 10 July 1942, the Judenrat of the Vilnius Ghetto was dissolved by <a href="Franz%20Murer">Franz Murer</a>, the German deputy for Jewish Affairs, for incompetence and ineffectiveness. Gens was appointed as head of the ghetto; he retained his position as chief of the Jewish police force, and took the title of "chief of the ghetto and police in Vilnius". Dessler was named Gens' deputy for police functions and Friend was Gens' deputy for administration. Gens asked the rest of the Judenrat to remain in the administration as heads of the various ghetto departments, which they did.

Inhabitants of the ghetto referred to Gens derisively as "King Jacob the First". The historian <a href="Lucy%20Dawidowicz">Lucy Dawidowicz</a> describes him as one of a group of "strong, even dictatorial" leaders who were "the policy and decision makers in their ghettos, the strategical thinkers on the ghetto's possibilities for survival". Gens thought that labor would provide a way for the inhabitants to survive. Along with several other ghetto leaders, he hoped to preserve some of the ghetto inhabitants and outlast the Nazi occupation. Historian <a href="Michael%20Marrus">Michael Marrus</a> describes Gens' leadership style as "intensely authoritarian" and Marrus argues that Gens came to "believe that [he] alone could save a portion of the ghetto inmates". This belief has made Gens a controversial figure both at the time and to this day. He sought to save at least some of the population by working for the Germans and to do that he relied on the police force. As part of his efforts to secure support, he held a "political club" of sorts in his home, bringing together some of the community leaders for colloquia to discuss Jewish history, recent events, and the fate of the Jews.

In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens to give up 500 children and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. This suggestion was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.

In late 1942, the Germans consolidated some small ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at <a href="Oszmiana%20Ghetto">Oszmiana</a>, <a href="%C5%A0ven%C4%8Dionys%20Ghetto">Švenčionys</a>, <a href="Soly%20Ghetto">Soly</a>, and <a href="Michaliszki%20Ghetto">Michaliszki</a>. During one of these consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed <a href="Martin%20Weiss%20%28Nazi%20official%29">Martin Weiss</a>, commander of the <a href="Ypatingasis%20b%C5%ABrys">Ponary killing squad</a>, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius as well as some Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains under the supervision of the Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.

Gens' relations with the various Jewish resistance groups were strained. He allowed some resistance members to escape the ghetto, but opposed the plans for resistance because he felt they would threaten the entire ghetto's existence. Gens promised to provide aid to the resistance groups and may have promised to join them in a revolt if the time was right. He did provide money, taken from the various Judenrat funds, to the <a href="Fareynikte%20Partizaner%20Organizatsye">Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye</a> (FPO), a resistance group in the ghetto. Because of the need for secrecy, the FPO did not have a way to directly solicit money from the ghetto inhabitants. Gens provided funds to another resistance group, the "Struggle Group" established by Boris 'Borka' Fridman. It later merged with the "Yechiel Group", established by Yechiel Sheinbaum, to form the "Yechiel's Struggle Group". He provided a pistol to the Struggle Group, its first. The FPO tried to prevent the formation of other resistance groups in the ghetto, mainly because they feared that it would increase the chances of German discovery as well as competition for scarce resources. Gens' support for the Struggle Group appears to have led to friction between himself and the FPO.

On 26 June 1943, Gens ordered the arrest of <a href="Josef%20Glazman">Josef Glazman</a>, who had previously worked for Gens but now was a leader of the FPO. Glazman was arrested but, while being escorted towards a labor camp, was freed by a group of FPO members. Gens then negotiated with the FPO and secured Glazman's rearrest in return for assurances of Glazman's safety.

In July 1943, "Oberscharführer" <a href="Bruno%20Kittel">Bruno Kittel</a> demanded that Gens hand over <a href="Yitzhak%20Wittenberg">Yitzhak Wittenberg</a>, a leader of the FPO. Although Wittenberg was arrested, he was freed by FPO members. Gens' reaction to this was to spread word that unless Wittenberg turned himself in, the Germans would destroy the ghetto. The ghetto residents supported Gens in this dispute. On 16 July, Wittenberg turned himself in. What happened next is unclear: some sources report that Wittenberg committed suicide while in custody, possibly with a <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> pill provided by Gens; others state that Wittenberg was poisoned by Gens then turned over to the Gestapo, or that he was tortured to death by the Gestapo and given a cyanide pill by Gens' second-in-command.

While Gens was in control of the ghetto, he continued to oversee the sanitary and health efforts in the ghetto, running that part of the ghetto administration like a military operation. Although conditions were very crowded and often unsanitary, the ghetto never suffered a major epidemic and there were fewer deaths due to disease than in other ghettos. A network of children's homes was set up in March 1942 on Gens' orders. These homes were for orphans or those with parents who could not care properly for them. A department of the ghetto administration was in charge of supervising bosses who employed children under the age of 16.

In May 1942, Gens secured German permission for residents of the ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with <a href="gentile">gentile</a>s outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept more than half the value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and bring it back to the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.

Gens started a theater in the ghetto, where poetry readings as well as the production of new and old plays took place. Gens continued the policy of supporting the ghetto library and in March 1943 he ordered that all ghetto residents should turn their privately owned books over to the library, except for textbooks and prayer books. He also set up a ghetto publishing house. Nothing was ever published, but the authors were paid for their manuscripts. An archive of historical documents relating to the ghetto was set up. The ghetto had a symphony orchestra, the formation of which owed some impetus to Gens and his police force. Gens justified these cultural activities by claiming that the Jewish administration "wanted to give man the chance to be free of the ghetto for a few hours, and we succeeded in this. Our days here are harsh and grim. Our body is here in the ghetto, but they have not broken our spirit."

Gens' wife and daughter at first went to Kaunas but, after the formation of the ghetto, they returned to Vilnius and lived near the ghetto's perimeter. His wife used her maiden name rather than Gens'. According to Leonard Tushnet, there were unfounded rumors that the couple had divorced. Gens did not refute the rumors, as he thought they would help protect his family. Other sources state that the two were divorced to protect Elvyra and Ada. Elvyra Gens was opposed to her husband taking a leading role in the government of the ghetto and urged him to "<a href="Passing%20%28racial%20identity%29">pass</a>" as a Lithuanian. It is not clear exactly why Gens went into the ghetto, but in a letter to his wife, Gens said "This is the first time in my life that I have to engage in such duties. My heart is broken. But I shall always do what is necessary for the sake of the Jews in the ghetto."

Gens' mother and brother, Solomon, were both imprisoned in the Vilnius Ghetto. Another brother, Ephraim, was head of the ghetto police in the <a href="%C5%A0iauliai%20Ghetto">Šiauliai Ghetto</a>, and was the only Gens brother to survive the Holocaust.

The Germans allowed Gens some privileges not accorded to other Vilnius Jews. He was not required to wear the <a href="yellow%20badge">yellow badge</a> of the <a href="Star%20of%20David">Star of David</a> on the front and back of his clothes; instead he wore a white and blue armband with the Star of David. He was allowed to enter and leave the ghetto at any time, and his daughter was not required to live in the ghetto, even though other <a href="mischling">half-Jews</a> were confined within the ghetto. Gens and the Jewish policemen were allowed to carry pistols.

On 13 September, the Germans ordered him to report to the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> headquarters on the following day. He was urged to flee but chose to go, telling others that if he fled "thousands of Jews will pay for it with their lives". Gens was shot by Obersturmfuhrer Rolf Neugebauer, head of the Vilnius Gestapo, on 14 September 1943. The Gestapo said that he was killed for funneling money to the FPO. Dessler was named as Gens' successor as ghetto chief, but was soon replaced with a council which included Friend and Gens' brother, Solomon.

The ghetto was liquidated between 22 and 24 September 1943. Three thousand six hundred residents went to labor camps (including 2,000 sent to labor camps in Vilnius); 5,000 women and children went to Majdanek, where they were gassed to death; and a few hundred elderly and sick were sent to Ponary and shot. The few Jews who remained in Vilnius were shot just before the Soviet Army arrived. A few FPO members escaped to the nearby forests.

Gens' wife and daughter were living near the ghetto on the day he was shot. A Jewish policeman informed them that Gens had been shot and that the Gestapo was looking for them. They fled and managed to stay in hiding until <a href="Red%20Army">Soviet troops</a> arrived. In 1945, they obtained papers for <a href="Polish%20population%20transfers%20%281944%E2%80%9346%29">repatriation to Poland</a>. From there they moved to <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> as Jewish <a href="aliyah">aliyah</a>. They emigrated to Australia in 1948 and to the United States in 1953.

The role of the Judenrats has been controversial. Both <a href="Raul%20Hilberg">Raul Hilberg</a> and <a href="Hannah%20Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a>, early historians of the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, argued that without the help of the Judenrats, the Germans would have been hampered in their extermination efforts. Arendt went further and condemned those Jews who served as leaders in the ghettos for helping destroy their own people. More recent historians have recognized that the situation facing the Jewish leaders was more complex – they faced conflicting sets of goals and had essentially no power to change the demands the Germans made of them.

Gens himself has been called "one of the most controversial Jewish ghetto leaders". <a href="Chaim%20Lazar">Chaim Lazar</a>, a member of the FPO, wrote of Gens that "It may be charged that his course was harmful, but everyone knows that he was never a traitor. All that he did during his tenure as Chief of the Ghetto was for his people". <a href="Yitzhak%20Arad">Yitzhak Arad</a>, in his history of the Vilnius Ghetto, says that Gens "erred in his fundamental conception – that the German administration regarded the existence of the ghetto and its inhabitants vital for economic reasons" and that "the policy laid down by Jacob Gens was the only one that afforded hope and some prospect of survival". Vadim Altskan, of the <a href="United%20States%20Holocaust%20Memorial%20Museum">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>, states that "... Holocaust historiography treated people such as ... Jacob Gens ... as instruments of destruction in the hands of the Nazi killing machine. ... Applied retrospectively, these charges for the most part are judgmental and add very little to our understanding of the events. Neither Jewish functionaries nor 'ordinary' Jews had any practical or psychological experience in dealing with the grim reality of the Nazi occupation, because never before in their long history of persecution had the Jews experienced an assault of such magnitude and careful design." Regarding the charge of collaborating with the Germans, Dawidowicz opined, "to say that [Gens and others like him] 'cooperated' or 'collaborated' with the Germans is semantic confusion and historical misrepresentation". The Israeli Zionist poet <a href="Nathan%20Alterman">Nathan Alterman</a> investigated the history of the Vilnius Ghetto, including interviewing survivors such as <a href="Abba%20Kovner">Abba Kovner</a>, and stated "Had I been in the ghetto, I would have been on the side of the Judenrat."

Gens is one of the main characters in <a href="Joshua%20Sobol">Joshua Sobol</a>'s plays "<a href="Ghetto%20%28play%29">Ghetto</a>" and "Adam". They depict him as a complex, morally ambiguous character forced to choose between two evils.

The Boat Races 2017

The Boat Races 2017 (also known as The Cancer Research UK Boat Races for the purposes of sponsorship) took place on 2 April 2017. Held annually, <a href="the%20Boat%20Race">the Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> race between crews from the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> along a tidal stretch of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. For the second time in the history of the event, the men's, <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race">women's</a> and both <a href="Reserve%20team">reserves</a>' races were all held on the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a> on the same day.

In the men's reserve race, Cambridge's <a href="Goldie%20%28Cambridge%20University%20Boat%20Club%29">Goldie</a> were beaten by Oxford's Isis, their seventh consecutive defeat. In the women's reserve race, Cambridge's Blondie defeated Oxford's Osiris, their second consecutive victory. In the women's race, Cambridge won by a large margin following a disastrous start by the Oxford boat. Their second win in the past ten years, it took Cambridge's advantage in the overall standings to 42–30. The Oxford men's boat won their race after leading from the start, their fourth victory in five years and taking the overall record in the event to 82–80 in Cambridge's favour.

The races were watched by around a quarter of a million spectators live, more than five million domestic television viewers, and were broadcast around the world by a variety of broadcasters. The two main races were also available for the first time as a live stream using <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>.

<a href="The%20Boat%20Race">The Boat Race</a> is a <a href="Rowing%20%28sport%29%23Side%20by%20side">side-by-side rowing</a> competition between the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues") and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues"). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the <a href="The%20Championship%20Course">Championship Course</a>, between <a href="Putney">Putney</a> and <a href="Mortlake">Mortlake</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> in south-west London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the men's race as champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202016">2016 race</a> by a margin of two and a half lengths, and leading overall with 82 victories to Oxford's 79 (excluding the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201877">1877 race</a>, officially a dead heat though claimed as a victory by the Oxford crew).

It was the second time in the history of the Boat Race that all four senior races – the men's, women's, men's reserves' and women's reserves' – were held on the same day and on the same course along the <a href="Tideway">Tideway</a>. Prior to 2015, the women's race, which <a href="Women%27s%20Boat%20Race%201927">first took place in 1927</a>, was usually held at the <a href="Henley%20Boat%20Races">Henley Boat Races</a> along the course. However, on at least two occasions in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, the women competed on the Thames between <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a> and <a href="Kew">Kew</a>. The Oxford women went into the race as reigning champions, having won the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202016%23Main%20races">2016 race</a> by 24 lengths, with Cambridge leading 41–30 overall. For the fifth year, <a href="The%20Bank%20of%20New%20York%20Mellon">BNY Mellon</a> sponsored the men's race, while Newton Investment Management, a Mellon subsidiary, sponsored the women's race. In January 2016, it was announced that the sponsors would be donating the title sponsorship to <a href="Cancer%20Research%20UK">Cancer Research UK</a> and that the 2016 event was retitled "The Cancer Research UK Boat Races". There is no monetary award for winning the race, as the journalist <a href="Roger%20Alton">Roger Alton</a> notes: "It's the last great amateur event: seven months of pain for no prize money".

The autumn reception was held at the <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> in London on 3 November 2016. As Oxford's women had won the previous year's race, it was Cambridge's responsibility to offer the traditional challenge to the Oxford University Women's Boat Club (OUWBC). To that end, Ashton Brown, President of Cambridge University Women's Boat Club (CUWBC), challenged Isabell Von Loga, her Oxford counterpart. Cambridge's victory in the men's race meant that Michael Di Santo, President of Oxford University Boat Club (OUBC), challenged Lance Tredell, President of Cambridge University Boat Club (CUBC).

The men's race was umpired for the second time by the Olympic gold medallist <a href="Matthew%20Pinsent">Matthew Pinsent</a>, who won the Boat Race himself with Oxford in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201990">1990</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201991">1991 races</a> before losing (as President) in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201993">1993 race</a>. Pinsent was the assistant umpire in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202012">2012 race</a> and umpired the OUBC victory in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%202013">2013 race</a>. The umpire for the women's race was <a href="Sarah%20Winckless">Sarah Winckless</a>, who became the first woman to umpire a Boat Race on the Tideway. Winckless won a bronze medal in the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202004%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Women%27s%20double%20sculls">women's double sculls</a> at the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a> and umpired the men's reserve's race in 2016.

The event was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, and received a viewership of 5.5 million. Numerous broadcasters worldwide also showed the main races, including <a href="SuperSport%20%28South%20African%20TV%20channel%29">SuperSport</a> across Africa, the <a href="European%20Broadcasting%20Union">EBU</a> across Europe, <a href="Sky%20M%C3%A9xico">Sky México</a> across Central America, <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">TSN</a> in Canada and <a href="Fox%20Sports%20%28Australia%29">Fox Sports</a> in Australia. It was also streamed live on <a href="BBC%20Online">BBC Online</a>. For the first time, the men's and women's races were streamed live on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>.

The Cambridge men's crew coaching team was led by their chief coach <a href="Steve%20Trapmore">Steve Trapmore</a>. Trapmore, a gold medal-winning member of the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics%23Men%27s%20events">men's eight</a> at the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a>, was appointed to the post in 2010. He was assisted by <a href="Richard%20Chambers%20%28rower%29">Richard Chambers</a>, silver medallist in the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202012%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20lightweight%20coxless%20four">men's lightweight coxless four</a> at the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. Donald Legget, who rowed for the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201963">1963</a> and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201964">1964 races</a>, acted as a supporting coach, along with coxing coach Henry Fieldman (who steered Cambridge in the 2013 race) and the medical officer Simon Owens. Sean Bowden was chief coach for Oxford, having been responsible for the senior men's crew since 1997, winning 11 from 17 races. He is a former Great Britain Olympic coach and coached the Light Blues in the 1993 and <a href="The%20Boat%20Race%201994">1994 Boat Races</a>. His assistant coach was Andy Nelder, who has coached the senior boat since 2006.

Ali Williams, the former Canadian international cox, was OUWBC's chief coach, a new role for her; she had been head coach at the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>. She was assisted by Jamie Kirkwood. Cambridge's women were coached by the former Goldie coach Rob Baker who was assisted by Paddy Ryan and Nick Acock, along with the former Light Blue cox Peter Rudge.

Dates for the trials, where crews are able to simulate the race proper on the Championship Course, were announced on 16 November 2016. Oxford's two senior crews rowed on 30 November, while Cambridge's crews raced on 12 December.

Oxford's women's trials took place on a section of the Championship Course on 30 November 2016, between the Oxford boats, "Heather" and "Helen", named after the gold-medal-winning British Olympic pairing of <a href="Heather%20Stanning">Heather Stanning</a> and <a href="Helen%20Glover%20%28rower%29">Helen Glover</a>. In cold conditions, the women's race was overseen by Winckless, who soon warned "Helen" for encroachment after "Heather" took a slim early lead. "Helen" took the lead around Fulham before "Heather" accelerated away at the Mile Post, and were two lengths ahead by St Paul's boathouse. Both crews were warned by the umpire as they approached Barnes Bridge, and "Helen" began to narrow the gap. Closing in on Chiswick Bridge, the finishing line, the boats began to overlap and in a sprint finish, "Helen" won "a narrow victory".

Cambridge's women's trials were held on 12 December 2016, on a stretch of the Championship Course. The trial boats were named "Hallam" and "Needs" after former coaches Ed Hallam and Ron Needs, both of whom had died earlier in the year. "Hallam" took an early lead and were nearly a length up by Fulham. Both crews were warned for encroachment before "Hallam" extended their lead to two lengths by the time the boats passed below Barnes Bridge. Both "Needs" and "Hallam" increased their rate in the final 500 m of the race, but "Hallam" pulled further away to pass the finish line at the University Post by four lengths.

Oxford's men's trials took place on a section of the Championship Course on 30 November 2016, between the Oxford boats, "Acer" and "Daniel", named after their former cox <a href="Acer%20Nethercott">Acer Nethercott</a> and their long-term coach <a href="Daniel%20Topolski">Daniel Topolski</a>, both of whom had died from cancer. The race was umpired by Pinsent. "Acer" took an early lead but "Daniel" was level by Barn Elms boathouse. "Acer" continued to pull away despite multiple warnings from Pinsent, and were almost a length up at Fulham. The gap narrowed as "Daniel" pushed on and by Hammersmith Bridge, the crews converged, and blades clashed. "Daniel" crew handled the situation the better and took a half-length lead by Chiswick Eyot. By Barnes the lead was three lengths, with "Daniel" crossing the finish line at the University of London boathouse four lengths ahead.

The Cambridge men's trial boats were named "One T" and "Two G's" in honour of their coach Donald Legget who had served the club for fifty years. "One T" took the lead and were length ahead by the end of the boathouses. "Two G's" pushed on and closed the gap to a quarter of a length by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge. In rough conditions, "One T" extended their lead to a length by Barnes Bridge. A sprint finish ensued, with "Two G's" closing the gap to half a length, before "One T" pulled away again to lead by lengths by the time the boats passed the finishing line at the University Post.

OUWBC faced a crew from <a href="Oxford%20Brookes%20University%20Boat%20Club">Oxford Brookes University Boat Club</a> (OBUBC) in two races along the Championship Course on 19 February. The first piece, from <a href="Putney%20Bridge">Putney Bridge</a> to <a href="Hammersmith%20Bridge">Hammersmith Bridge</a>, saw OBUBC make the better start, but OUWBC took the lead at <a href="Craven%20Cottage">Craven Cottage</a>. A length ahead at the Mile Post, the Dark Blues were comfortable winners. The second race, from Hammersmith to Barnes Bridge followed a similar pattern with OBUBC taking an early lead, and OUWBC pushing through for the win. On 19 March, the Dark Blues took on a crew from <a href="Molesey%20Boat%20Club">Molesey</a> in two races on the Tideway. A tight start during which Winckless, the umpire, warned both crews, Molesey took a marginal lead. OUWBC were back on level terms by the Mile Post and in calmer conditions, pushed away from Molesey to be a length up by Harrods. Pulling further ahead, the Dark Blues won by three lengths. The second race saw Molesey take the lead once again, and were soon a length up. Oxford's attempts to reduce the deficit came to no avail and Molesey won by just short of one length.

Cambridge took on <a href="University%20of%20London%20Boat%20Club">University of London Boat Club</a> (UL) on 19 February along two sections of the Championship Course. CUWBC won the first piece, from Putney to Hammersmith, convincingly. Leading almost from the start, the Light Blues passed below Hammersmith Bridge more than three lengths ahead. The second race, from Chiswick Steps to the Finishing Post saw UL given a clear-water headstart. Despite that, CUWBC rowed strongly throughout to win by at least three lengths.

The first race in the build-up to The Boat Races for CUBC was against OBUBC on 29 January 2017 along two sections of the Championship Course. The first race was from Putney Bridge to Chiswick Eyot; OBUBC took an early lead before Cambridge led at Hammersmith. A final push from OBUBC resulted in a drawn race. The second race, from Chiswick Eyot to the University Post, was a one-sided affair with OBUBC leading from the start and gradually pulling away to win by two lengths. Goldie also faced an Oxford Brookes crew over two pieces, losing them both. Cambridge faced an Italian national crew on 18 March in two pieces on the Championship Course. The first race saw the Italians make the better start, and despite steering off-course, they maintained their lead in rough weather under Hammersmith Bridge. CUBC pushed hard but were unable to catch the Italians, losing by one quarter of a length. The second piece was conducted in blustery conditions between Chiswick Eyot and Chiswick Bridge. A close start saw both crews level after a minute, but the Light Blues pulled away after Barnes Bridge, and won by four lengths.

Oxford started their preparations on 26 February with a two-piece contest against OBUBC. In poor weather conditions, OUBC comfortably won the first section, leading from beginning to end. OUBC won the much closer second race "by a seat". On 18 March, OUBC faced <a href="Leander%20Club">Leander</a> in a race from start of the Championship Course to the Chiswick Steps. The Dark Blues made a good start, leading by a length at Craven Cottage. At the Mile Post, Oxford started to move across in front of Leander and by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge, the Dark Blues were fully in front and maintained their lead. Oxford responded to numerous pushes by Leander and crossed the finish line with "a lead of several lengths".

The official weigh-in for the crews took place at the <a href="Francis%20Crick%20Institute">Francis Crick Institute</a> on 14 March 2017, presented by BBC sports reporter <a href="Andrew%20Cotter">Andrew Cotter</a>.

The Cambridge crew weighed an average of , per rower more than their opponents. Oxford's president, German rower Isabell von Loga, withdrew from the race as a result of a shoulder injury, while Cambridge's president, Canadian rower Ashton Brown, made her third consecutive appearance in the race. Holly Hill and Myriam Goudet also had Boat Race experience for CUWBC, while no Blues returned for OUWBC.

The Cambridge crew weighed an average of , per rower more than their opponents. Cambridge's number three, James Letten, was the heaviest man in the race, weighing . All but two (Dutchman <a href="Olivier%20Siegelaar">Olivier Siegelaar</a> and American Matthew O'Leary) of the Dark Blue crew were British; Siegelaar won a bronze medal at the <a href="2016%20Summer%20Olympics">2016 Summer Olympics</a> as part of the <a href="Rowing%20at%20the%202016%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20eight">men's eight</a>. Conversely, just two of the CUBC rowers were British. Oxford's bow man, William Warr, became the third individual to row in the Boat Race for both universities, having competed for the Light Blues in the <a href="The%20Boat%20Races%202015">2015 event</a>. Two members of the Cambridge crew had Boat Race experience, including Ben Ruble (who rowed in the 2015 and 2016 races) and president Lance Tredell (2016). Oxford featured three former Blues; <a href="Jamie%20Cook%20%28rower%29">Jamie Cook</a> made his third appearance in the event, while <a href="Michael%20di%20Santo">Michael di Santo</a> (who opted to compete at the 2016 Summer Olympics instead of in the Boat Race) and Joshua Bugajski featured in their second race.

The day before the races were scheduled to take place, an unexploded Second World War bomb was discovered near Putney Bridge. Although this threatened to postpone the event, the device was successfully removed and did not disrupt the race programme.

The Queen's barge <a href="Gloriana%20%28barge%29">"Gloriana"</a> led a procession of traditional craft along the course. These included the <a href="waterman%27s%20cutter">waterman's cutter</a>s used for the Oxbridge Waterman's Challenge – a race of these craft was held ahead of the main events.

The races were held on Sunday 2 April. Weather conditions were very favourable, with calm water and low windspeeds. Around a quarter of a million people lined the length of the course to watch the race.

In the women's reserve race, Osiris won the toss and selected the Surrey side of the river, handing the Middlesex station to Blondie. The Cambridge crew made the better start and by the Mile Post were more than two lengths ahead. With a clear water advantage, Blondie made the most of the racing line and extended their lead throughout the race; they passed the finishing post about 13 lengths ahead of Osiris, in a time of 19 minutes, 6 seconds. It was Blondie's second consecutive victory, and took the overall tally (since 1968) to 23–20 in Cambridge's favour.

In the men's reserve race, Oxford's Isis won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. Goldie were late to the start and received a warning from the umpire Judith Packer. Rowing into a slight headwind, Goldie made the better start and held a slight lead by the Crabtree boathouse. Both crews were warned for encroachment as they passed Barn Elms, and at the Mile Post, Isis were a canvas-length down. By Thames Wharf, Isis had edged into the lead and by Hammersmith led by a length. Passing below the bridge, Oxford held a clear water advantage and moved across in front of Goldie, and were two lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps. Making a final push, Isis passed the finish line two and a half lengths ahead, in a time of 17 minutes, 17 seconds. It was Isis' seventh consecutive victory and took the overall tally in the event to 29–24 in Cambridge's favour.

The women's race started at 4:35 p.m. <a href="British%20Summer%20Time">British Summer Time</a>. Cambridge won the <a href="coin%20flipping">toss</a> and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford. The Oxford crew fell behind immediately when Rebecca Esselstein <a href="Glossary%20of%20rowing%20terms%23The%20stroke">caught a crab</a> at the start. Cambridge maintained their commanding lead throughout the race and won in a record time of 18 minutes and 33 seconds. The time beat the previous record by a minute, and the winning margin was around 11 lengths. It was Cambridge's first victory since 2012 and only their second win in ten years, and took the overall record in the event to 42–30 in their favour.

The men's race was scheduled to begin at 5:35 p.m. and got underway about five minutes late. Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station. Oxford led from the start, and were one length ahead by Craven Cottage. The boats closed in on each other, prompting warnings from the umpire Matthew Pinsent, to avoid a clash of oars. OUBC pushed away on the approach to Hammersmith Bridge and held a clear water advantage soon after, moving across to row directly in front of Cambridge. Despite that, CUBC stayed in touch throughout the race, even recovering some of the deficit. Nevertheless, Oxford won in a time of 16 minutes 59 seconds with a margin of one and a quarter lengths. It was Oxford's fourth victory in five years, and took the overall record in the event to 82–80 in Cambridge's favour.

San Junipero

"San Junipero" is the fourth episode in series three of British science fiction <a href="anthology%20series">anthology series</a> "<a href="Black%20Mirror">Black Mirror</a>". Written by showrunner <a href="Charlie%20Brooker">Charlie Brooker</a> and directed by <a href="Owen%20Harris%20%28director%29">Owen Harris</a>, it premiered on <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> on 21 October 2016, with the rest of series three.

The episode is set in a beach resort town named San Junipero, where the introverted Yorkie (<a href="Mackenzie%20Davis">Mackenzie Davis</a>) meets the more outgoing Kelly (<a href="Gugu%20Mbatha-Raw">Gugu Mbatha-Raw</a>). The town is part of a <a href="simulated%20reality">simulated reality</a> the elderly can inhabit, even after death. "San Junipero" was the first episode written for series three of "Black Mirror"; initial drafts were based on nostalgia therapy and designed as a 1980s period piece, featuring a heterosexual couple and an unhappy ending. Filming took place in <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> across a few weeks. The soundtrack interweaves 1980s songs with an original score by <a href="Clint%20Mansell">Clint Mansell</a>.

The episode has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for Mbatha-Raw's and Davis's performances, its simulated reality plot twist, and its uplifting tone and visual style. It had higher critical ratings than the show's other episodes, and some critics considered it one of the best television episodes of 2016. In addition to several other accolades, "San Junipero" won two <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award">Primetime Emmy Award</a>s in the <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Television%20Movie">Television Movie</a> and <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Writing%20for%20a%20Limited%20Series%2C%20Movie%2C%20or%20Dramatic%20Special">Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special</a> categories.

In 1987, a shy woman named Yorkie (<a href="Mackenzie%20Davis">Mackenzie Davis</a>) visits the nightclub Tucker's in San Junipero. Kelly (<a href="Gugu%20Mbatha-Raw">Gugu Mbatha-Raw</a>), a vivacious party girl, ditches Wes (<a href="Gavin%20Stenhouse">Gavin Stenhouse</a>), a man she previously had sex with, to talk to Yorkie. Kelly and Yorkie dance, but Yorkie becomes uncomfortable and leaves the club. Kelly follows and sexually propositions Yorkie, who declines, saying she is engaged. The following week, Yorkie returns to the bar and observes Kelly flirting with another man. Yorkie and Kelly reunite in the bathroom and have sex at Kelly's beach house. Yorkie confesses that it was her first time having sex, and Kelly reveals that she was once married.

The next week, Yorkie visits another nightclub, the Quagmire, looking for Kelly. Wes advises her to "try a different time". Yorkie eventually finds Kelly in 2002, but Kelly rebuffs Yorkie's advances. After Yorkie leaves, Kelly follows and confesses that she is dying; Kelly had avoided Yorkie because she feared developing feelings for her. The two have sex again, and Yorkie reluctantly tells Kelly her real-life location so that they can meet.

San Junipero is revealed to be a <a href="simulated%20reality">simulated reality</a> where the deceased can live and the elderly can visit, all inhabiting their younger selves' bodies. Back in the physical world, the elderly Kelly (<a href="Denise%20Burse">Denise Burse</a>) visits Yorkie (Annabel Davis). She learns from Yorkie's nurse, Greg (Raymond McAnally), that Yorkie was paralysed at age 21 after crashing her car when her parents reacted poorly to her <a href="coming%20out">coming out</a>. Yorkie wishes to be <a href="euthanasia">euthanised</a> so that she can live in San Junipero permanently, but her family objects; she intends to marry Greg so that he can consent for her. Kelly visits San Junipero and offers to marry Yorkie instead. Once Yorkie enthusiastically accepts, Kelly authorises Yorkie's euthanasia.

During Kelly's next visit to San Junipero, Yorkie asks her to stay full-time. Though Kelly does not believe in an afterlife, she plans to die without being uploaded to the simulation. Kelly's husband Richard chose to die in the same way because of the death of their daughter Alison at age 39 before San Junipero was available. Yorkie and Kelly argue, and Kelly leaves in her car, which she crashes on purpose. Yorkie catches up to her just as Kelly disappears, her visiting time over for the week.

Time passes, and Kelly decides that she is ready to enter San Junipero permanently. She is euthanised and buried alongside her husband and daughter, and she happily reunites with Yorkie inside San Junipero.

"San Junipero" is the fourth episode of series three of "<a href="Black%20Mirror">Black Mirror</a>"; all six episodes in this series were simultaneously released on <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> on 21 October 2016. Whilst series one and two of "Black Mirror" were shown on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> in the UK, Netflix commissioned the series for 12 episodes (split into two series of six episodes) in September 2015 with a bid of $40 million, and in March 2016, Netflix outbid Channel 4 for the right to distribute series three in the UK. Due to its move to Netflix, the show had a larger budget than in previous series, and a larger episode order which allowed the show to vary its genre and tone more than previous series. Alongside series three episode "<a href="Nosedive%20%28Black%20Mirror%29">Nosedive</a>", "San Junipero" was first shown in 2016 ahead of its Netflix release at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>.

"San Junipero" was the first script produced for series three, written by <a href="Charlie%20Brooker">Charlie Brooker</a> as a "conscious decision to change the series". The show previously focused on technology's negative effects; this episode served as proof that uplifting "Black Mirror" episodes are possible.

Brooker initially envisioned an episode in which technology is used to investigate whether an afterlife exists, thinking of the genres of horror and supernatural fiction. He later became inspired by <a href="nostalgia%20therapy">nostalgia therapy</a> for older people. Brooker and executive producer Annabel Jones felt that their concept of virtual consciousness, established in the episode "<a href="White%20Christmas%20%28Black%20Mirror%29">White Christmas</a>", had more potential. One of Brooker's original concepts was based on the episode "<a href="Be%20Right%20Back">Be Right Back</a>", in which deceased persons' personalities are uploaded into artificial entities in a theme park that relatives can visit. This idea was scrapped with the 2016 broadcast of "<a href="Westworld%20%28TV%20series%29">Westworld</a>", in which androids run around a theme park. He then recalled the 2010 <a href="BBC">BBC</a> series "The Young Ones", in which older celebrities live in a home decorated in the fashion of the 1970s and find themselves rejuvenated by the setting. Having repeatedly thought of writing an episode set in the past, Brooker wrote "San Junipero" as a <a href="historical%20period%20drama">period</a> episode.

Brooker has said that he wrote the script for the episode in four days. In the initial draft, the love story was about a <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> couple, but Brooker changed it to give the episode an extra resonance, as <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a> was not legal in 1987. He has said that having a twist makes the writing process easier, as "when you know that 85 percent of what's happening you can't reveal till later on, it actually sort of narrows your options in a useful way". One draft of the episode contained a scene where Kelly visits a kindergarten in San Junipero, full of children who had died, but it was removed because "it was too sad and too poignant of a note to hit in that story". Brooker chose the setting of <a href="California">California</a>, a location in America rather than Britain, as a way to "upend" people's preconceptions of "Black Mirror". One reviewer noted that all of the characters in "San Junipero" are American.

The episode was originally to have an unhappy ending. Brooker told "<a href="The%20Daily%20Beast">The Daily Beast</a>" that in the rough <a href="film%20treatment">treatment</a>, the episode ended with the scene where Kelly and Yorkie meet in the hospital, but "when I sat down to actually write it, I was enjoying it so much that I thought, "No, I'm going to keep going"!" He conceived of Yorkie's euthanasia and expanded on Kelly's backstory, writing her emotional speech to Yorkie in one sitting. The ending came about when Brooker heard "Heaven is a Place on Earth" off a streaming playlist while writing the script, and wanted to license the song for the episode. After listening to the song and lyrics several times, he came to the final shot, which shows a bank of computer servers with flashing lights, giving literal weight to the song's title. An unused idea for the ending had the audience see Kelly and Yorkie in many different eras, such as the 1920s.

Following the episode's release, Brooker was asked about a <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a> post speculating that Kelly is simulated for Yorkie's benefit, rather than really there; he replied "Wrong! They are together", and commented that "[t]hey have the happiest ending imaginable. [...] it's not a big rainbow sandwich, but what appears to be happening there, is happening there."

The nightclub settings featured arcade games, which Brooker took an interest in choosing as he was a teenager during the 1980s and has worked as a video game journalist. Director <a href="Owen%20Harris%20%28director%29">Owen Harris</a> described the 1980s as a "period in life that was really optimistic". He chose the year 1987 "fairly arbitrarily" and mentioned "very specific movie posters" in the script. Brooker put together a playlist of music from 1987 on <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a>. Some songs, such as <a href="Belinda%20Carlisle">Belinda Carlisle</a>'s "<a href="Heaven%20Is%20a%20Place%20on%20Earth">Heaven Is a Place on Earth</a>" and <a href="the%20Smiths">the Smiths</a>' "<a href="Girlfriend%20in%20a%20Coma%20%28song%29">Girlfriend in a Coma</a>", hint at the episode's <a href="plot%20twist">plot twist</a>, as do arcade games "<a href="Time%20Crisis">Time Crisis</a>" and "<a href="The%20House%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28video%20game%29">The House of the Dead</a>". Each song had to be <a href="music%20licensing">cleared</a> for roughly 15 years for Netflix. Every song was successfully cleared except one by <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>.

"Heaven Is a Place on Earth" plays at the episode's beginning and over the <a href="end%20credits">end credits</a>. Brooker first heard it while running, and believed it would be perfect for the final scene, admitting in an interview he would have been "absolutely distraught" if they had been unable to use it. "Girlfriend in a Coma" features in the episode "for about five seconds", yet cost "an outrageous amount of money", Brooker said. Jones said the song's inclusion "was indulgent but at the same time, it was so important that we set up that era so it felt different". <a href="Robbie%20Nevil">Robbie Nevil</a>'s song "<a href="C%27est%20la%20Vie%20%28Robbie%20Nevil%20song%29">C'est La Vie</a>" was chosen by Harris, as it was one of the first <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> he ever purchased.

The episode also featured an original score by <a href="Clint%20Mansell">Clint Mansell</a>. Mansell was approached by Harris, and based the score around the previously chosen songs, including "Heaven Is a Place on Earth". He has said that the "calm electronic" score was influenced by <a href="John%20Hughes%20%28filmmaker%29">John Hughes</a> movies and the death of his girlfriend a year before. In December 2016, <a href="Lakeshore%20Records">Lakeshore Records</a> released the score for downloading and streaming.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who plays Kelly, had heard of the show but not seen it when she received the script, though she did watch the series two episode "<a href="Be%20Right%20Back">Be Right Back</a>" before the shoot. Mbatha-Raw read the entire script as soon as she received it, on a bus journey from <a href="Oxford%20Circus">Oxford Circus</a> to <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a>. Mackenzie Davis, who plays Yorkie, first saw the show with a friend who had <a href="internet%20piracy">pirated</a> it; they watched "<a href="The%20National%20Anthem%20%28Black%20Mirror%29">The National Anthem</a>". <a href="Denise%20Burse">Denise Burse</a> plays the elder Kelly in the real world, as using prosthetics on Mbatha-Raw was quickly discounted. Annabel Davis was cast as elder Yorkie.

The episode's director was <a href="Owen%20Harris%20%28director%29">Owen Harris</a>, who previously directed "<a href="Be%20Right%20Back">Be Right Back</a>" – an episode he described as "strangely similar" to this one as both are "relationship-led". Joel Collins served as production designer. The 1986 teen films "<a href="Pretty%20in%20Pink">Pretty in Pink</a>" and "<a href="Ferris%20Bueller%27s%20Day%20Off">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>" were considered as inspiration to anchor the audience in "a place they know". The episode was filmed in 15 days across a three-week period, with shooting split equally between <a href="London">London</a> for most of the interior shots, and <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa for most external scenes. They did not film in the United States as a cost-cutting measure. Mbatha-Raw said there was little time to rehearse, and she had little opportunity to meet Davis before shooting. Kelly's outfit was inspired by celebrities of the 1980s such as <a href="Janet%20Jackson">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>, while Yorkie's outfit "looks like her mum laid it out on her bed", according to Davis. Her clothing is constant throughout the episode to subvert a "transforming geek" trope in fiction, also allowing her change to be internal rather than external.

The first day of filming was in London for the Quagmire nightclub. For the club Tucker's, a 3D model was made, which Brooker and Harris viewed with a <a href="virtual%20reality%20headset">virtual reality headset</a>. Mbatha-Raw and Davis worked with a dance choreographer and danced to Janet Jackson's "<a href="What%20Have%20You%20Done%20for%20Me%20Lately">What Have You Done for Me Lately</a>", though <a href="Alexander%20O%27Neal">Alexander O'Neal</a>'s "<a href="Fake%20%28Alexander%20O%27Neal%20song%29">Fake</a>" was used in the final edit. The alleyway scene features rain, which Harris insisted on including despite Brooker's protestations that the simulated world would not have rain. Harris said that Cape Town "has these really rich, beautiful settings" that allowed him to craft a "slightly heightened" version of California. He noted that whilst shooting Kelly and Yorkie's argument on the beach, an "incredible mist rolled in from the ocean", which caused difficulties but led to "some really lovely texture". Mbatha-Raw said that almost every scene was shot at night or dusk, particularly the exterior scenes.

The episode contains hints leading up to the reveal of the twist. For example, the choice of the song "Girlfriend in a Coma", and the use of the arcade games "<a href="Time%20Crisis">Time Crisis</a>" and "<a href="The%20House%20of%20the%20Dead">The House of the Dead</a>" allude to the true reality of the episode. More overtly, Yorkie reacts viscerally to seeing a car accident in an arcade game, an element that Brooker was surprised was not picked up by viewers earlier. A factor considered during the <a href="video%20editing">editing</a> process was how overt the hints should be. Annabel Jones said that "there may be visual signifiers that you think were going to work and then didn't, so you need more exposition in the edit". Adjustments were also made using <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a> techniques such as <a href="sound%20effects">sound effects</a>.

The titles of the six episodes that make up series 3 were announced in July 2016, along with the release date. A trailer for series three, featuring an amalgamation of clips and sound bites from the six episodes, was released by Netflix on 7 October 2016. A short clip "Orange Is the New Black Mirror", released by Netflix in 2017, is a crossover between this episode and "<a href="Orange%20is%20the%20New%20Black">Orange is the New Black</a>", featuring characters Poussey and Taystee from the latter reunited in San Junipero.

Reviewers have described "San Junipero" as a highly optimistic, emotionally rooted love story and a work of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>. It features the first same-sex couple in "Black Mirror". Rebecca Nicholson of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that it "leaves you believing in the power of love to fight pain and loneliness". Some reviewers noted that the love story "transcends consciousness". The episode also has unhappy elements and has been called "bittersweet". It evokes nostalgia for the 1980s with its soundtrack and its style, and can be considered a <a href="period%20piece">period piece</a>. It also raises questions about death and the afterlife. "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" reviewer Emma Dibdin called it a "modern fairy tale".

At the time of its release, "San Junipero" was said to be the most different from other "Black Mirror" episodes due to its more hopeful tone. Mat Elfring of "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" described it as the only episode with "warmth to it", and "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>" reviewer Morgan Jeffery called it the "most upbeat and positive". Zack Handlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" believed that the previous episodes' sad tone heightens the effectiveness of "San Junipero", and Jacob Stolworthy of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" thought that it was consequently the show's most ambitious episode. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" critic Sonia Saraiya pointed out that technology is portrayed as good in "San Junipero", a rarity in the show. "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" reviewer David Sims noted that the episode follows the season's darkest episode, "<a href="Shut%20Up%20and%20Dance%20%28Black%20Mirror%29">Shut Up and Dance</a>".

The episode subverts a common trope in television of killing off lesbian characters: though Kelly and Yorkie die, they have a happy ending. Its <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> wins were considered by some to mark a cultural shift in relation to portrayal of lesbianism, or as proof of concept that works dealing with LGBT characters do not have to be tragic. "San Junipero" has also been cited as an example of <a href="bisexual%20lighting">bisexual lighting</a>, in which neon pink and deep blue – the colours on the <a href="bisexual%20pride%20flag">bisexual pride flag</a> – represent bisexual characters. Amelia Perrin of "<a href="Cosmopolitan%20%28magazine%29">Cosmopolitan</a>" criticised that this and the episode's nightclub setting reinforce a stereotype of bisexuality as "a 'phase' or something experimental".

The episode's plot raises many philosophical questions, including the nature of <a href="consciousness">consciousness</a> and <a href="experience">experience</a> and the consequences of digitally simulated existence, though these issues are not the focus of the episode. Reviewers have questioned what San Junipero would mean to believers in an afterlife, and what would happen to its inhabitants in case of technical malfunctions.

At the time of its release, "San Junipero" was "Black Mirror"s most popular episode among fans, which has been attributed to its emotive presentation of a love story with a happy ending. It has been favourably received by critics, garnering a score of 91% on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.04 out of 10. The episode garnered five stars out of five in the "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>" and an A in "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>". Along with "Nosedive", Benjamin Lee of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" gave the episode four stars, while "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>" gave "San Junipero" three stars. It has been described by critics as one of the "best hours" and one of the "most beautiful, cinematic episodes" of television in 2016, while Paul Tassi of "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" said Mbatha-Raw and Davis gave the best performances of the third series of "Black Mirror".

Mbatha-Raw's and Davis's performances were universally praised. Sims lauded the couple's chemistry and said the pair concisely communicate "a whole lifetime of angst and desires". Mullane commented that the strong acting keeps the audience interested prior to the plot twist. Caitlin Welsh of "<a href="Junkee">Junkee</a>" complimented the "understated, pitch-perfect" performances for making the characters' relationship feel genuine. Mbatha-Raw and Davis were praised for their emotional range, for giving "fierce and vulnerable performances", and for anchoring the episode.

Mbatha-Raw and Davis also received praise in negative reviews. Robbie Collin of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" criticised the characters' dialogue but praised that the ending is emotional due to Mbatha-Raw's "vivacity and conviction". Aubrey Page of "<a href="Collider%20%28website%29">Collider</a>" reviewed that the episode is unoriginal, but this is compensated by the perfect casting and emotion of the acting. However, Andrew Wallenstein of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" criticised Mbatha-Raw and Davis for an inability to "pack the emotional punch" needed for the episode to stand out.

The episode's plot twist, revealing that San Junipero is a simulated reality, was commended by critics. Pat Stacey of "<a href="Irish%20Independent">Irish Independent</a>" called the twist "ingenious" while Louisa Mellor of "Den of Geek" described it as "captivating". Adam Chitwood of "<a href="Collider%20%28website%29">Collider</a>" noted that there is more to the episode than its twist and praised Harris for how the story unfolds. Similarly, Alex Mullane of "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>" said the developments in the story are "refreshing" as they are not presented as twists. Handlen liked how the episode finds a balance between revealing information and making the audience care about the characters.

The episode's visual style and music, which evoke the 1980s, were well-received. <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> praised both the production design and soundtrack. Mullane called Mansell's score "wonderfully tender". "<a href="The%20Wrap">The Wrap</a>" reviewers said that the episode was "visually stunning" and its nostalgia for the 80s was "joyous".

Many critics admired the emotion the episode evokes, and how it ventured into a new genre for the show. Corey Atad of "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" and Tim Goodman of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" both opined that the story would leave viewers in tears, and Adam David of <a href="CNN%20Philippines">CNN Philippines</a> cried whilst watching it. Stacey found the episode "extremely moving". Scott Meslow of "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" called it "breathtakingly and tear-jerkingly human". Lee was surprised by the episode's poignancy, while Mellor wrote that it is "genuinely moving". Mullane said the episode demonstrated that the show can tell stories without a dark tone, and Jacob Hall of <a href="/Film">/Film</a> concurred. Wallenstein called the episode "satisfyingly daring", although he ranked it poorly in comparison to other episodes.

The episode has also received negative criticism. Collin noted that the episode's <a href="central%20conceit">central conceit</a> has been widely used within the science fiction genre. Stolworthy criticised the third act as "overloaded" and commented that "San Junipero", rather than "<a href="Hated%20in%20the%20Nation">Hated in the Nation</a>", should have been 90 minutes long.

"San Junipero" appeared on many critics' rankings of the 20 instalments in the "Black Mirror" series, from best to worst.

The episode also appears on critics' rankings of the 19 episodes from series 1 to series 4:

Instead of by quality, Proma Khosla of "<a href="Mashable">Mashable</a>" ranked the 19 episodes by tone, concluding that "San Junipero" is the second-least pessimistic episode of the show after "<a href="Hang%20the%20DJ%20%28Black%20Mirror%29">Hang the DJ</a>".

Other critics ranked the 13 episodes in "Black Mirror"s first three series.

"San Junipero" has been widely described as the best episode of series three of "Black Mirror". It has also appeared at various ranks on critics' lists of series three episodes by quality.


"San Junipero" appears in multiple critics' lists of the best episodes of television from 2016.

Other critics listed their favourite episodes of television in 2016, without giving an order. "San Junipero" appears on these lists:

In 2017, "San Junipero" won two Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as two BAFTA Television Craft Awards. It has also won or been nominated for several other accolades:
In August 2017, Brooker said there were no plans for a sequel episode to "San Junipero". He told the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" that "we want to keep [Kelly and Yorkie] happy there". In an interview with "<a href="NME">NME</a>", Brooker mentioned that some ideas for the episode were later removed, such as a scene with a kindergarten in San Junipero that "felt like a whole world in and of itself". He raised the idea of doing a sequel in "a completely different form", such as a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> or "an experience". "San Junipero" has been alluded to through <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter eggs</a> in subsequent episodes: for example, "<a href="Black%20Museum%20%28Black%20Mirror%29">Black Museum</a>" shows Kelly's and Yorkie's dresses on display in a museum, and features a hospital named Saint Juniper's.

Lancashire Fusiliers War Memorial

The Lancashire Fusiliers War Memorial is a <a href="World%20War%20I%20memorials">First World War memorial</a> dedicated to members of the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a> killed in that conflict. Outside the <a href="Fusilier%20Museum">Fusilier Museum</a> in <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury, Greater Manchester</a>, in <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a>, it was unveiled in 1922—on the seventh anniversary of the <a href="landing%20at%20Cape%20Helles">landing at Cape Helles</a>, part of the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a> in which the regiment suffered particularly heavy casualties. The memorial was designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>. Lutyens was commissioned in light of a family connection—his father and great uncle were officers in the Lancashire Fusiliers, a fact noted on a plaque nearby. He designed a tall, slender obelisk in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>. The regiment's <a href="cap%20badge">cap badge</a> is carved near the top on the front and rear, surrounded by a laurel wreath. Further down are inscriptions containing the regiment's motto and a dedication. Two painted stone flags hang from the sides.

The memorial was unveiled by Lieutenant General <a href="Beauvoir%20De%20Lisle">Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle</a> on 25 April 1922, using the novel method of pressing an electric button. The remaining funds were spent on drums and bugles for the regiment and donated to the Lancashire Fusiliers' compassionate fund. After the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated into the <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Fusiliers">Royal Regiment of Fusiliers</a> in 1968, the memorial was adopted by the new regiment and rededicated to all fusiliers killed in action. It originally sat outside the Lancashire Fusiliers' headquarters in <a href="Wellington%20Barracks%2C%20Bury">Wellington Barracks</a> but was relocated when the barracks closed in the 1970s. It was moved again in 2009, this time to sit in a public park renamed Gallipoli Gardens, outside the <a href="Fusilier%20Museum">Fusilier Museum</a>, which moved at the same time. The memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1992. It was upgraded to grade II* in 2015 (on the centenary of the Cape Helles landing), along with two other memorials related to the Gallipoli Campaign; later that year it was recognised as part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, described by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a> as "the leading English architect of his generation". Lutyens established his reputation designing <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s for wealthy clients. After the war, which had a profound effect on him, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He became a public figure through his design for <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London, which became Britain's national memorial. This, along with his work for the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a>, led to commissions for war memorials across Britain and the empire. As well as memorials for towns and cities, Lutyens was commissioned to design memorials for several private companies and regimental associations, including the <a href="Lancashire%20Fusiliers">Lancashire Fusiliers</a>. These tended to be the least controversial of Lutyens' war memorials—a site was readily available (in this case the regiment's home barracks) and fundraising was straightforward.

Lutyens' father was Captain Charles Henry Augustus Lutyens (1829–1915), formerly an officer in the Lancashire Fusiliers. Captain Lutyens, himself the son of an army officer, spent most of his military career in Canada; he served during the time of the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> but spent it as a musketry instructor in <a href="Hythe%2C%20Alberta">Hythe, Alberta</a>. The architect's great uncle, Major Engelbert Lutyens, also served in the regiment, which is noted on a plaque by the memorial. Engelbert was an orderly officer to Napoleon Bonaparte while the Lancashire Fusiliers guarded the latter during his exile in St Helena at the beginning of the 19th century. In light of his family connections with the regiment, Lutyens waived his fee for the memorial. 
The Lancashire Fusiliers (previously the 20th Regiment of Foot) was swollen by thousands of volunteers during the First World War, predominantly recruited from the towns to the north and west of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> (an area which was then in south-eastern <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> but has since become part of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>). Many of the recruits signed up with neighbours, work colleagues, social clubs, and other groups following the creation of the <a href="pals%20battalions">pals battalions</a>. By the end of the war, it had grown to 30 battalions, including <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> and <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">New Army</a> units. The 1st Battalion was stationed in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> at the outbreak of war in 1914 and was immediately shipped back to England and from there to the Mediterranean. It played a prominent role in the <a href="landing%20at%20Cape%20Helles">landing at Cape Helles</a> (part of the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, under the control of the <a href="29th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Division</a>) on 25 April 1915, during which its members famously earned "six <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>es before breakfast". The Lancashire Fusiliers' beach was later named "Lancashire Landing". The 1st was transferred to France in March 1916. The 2nd Battalion was immediately posted to France and spent the remainder of its war on the Western Front, where it was involved in intense fighting. Its first engagement was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Le%20Cateau">Battle of Le Cateau</a>. The regular battalions were joined by multiple New Army battalions, some of which joined the fighting in France and Turkey, while others were held in reserve or posted to garrison ports around Britain. Both of the regular battalions and multiple territorial and New Army units participated in some of the largest battles of the war, including (among others) <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">the Somme</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Passchendaele</a> (the Third Battle of Ypres).

By the end of the war, 13,642 Lancashire Fusiliers had been killed, including 600 at Cape Helles alone. The regiment earned 18 Victoria Crosses (including the "six before breakfast"), more than any other infantry regiment. The loss of so many men, and the losses at Gallipoli in particular, deeply affected the local community in Lancashire and especially <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a>, where the regiment was headquartered. A ceremony to commemorate the Cape Helles landing has taken place every year since 1916 in <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20the%20Virgin%2C%20Bury">the parish church</a>, which contains a memorial to the Lancashire Fusiliers' efforts at Cape Helles, placed by the crew of <a href="HMS%20Euryalus%20%281901%29">HMS "Euryalus"</a> (which carried the bulk of the 1st battalion to Gallipoli).

In light of the regiment's heavy losses, there was a strong feeling that their war efforts should be commemorated. This led Colonel George Wike to convene a meeting in <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a> on 9 January 1919, where a committee was established with the mandate to raise £30,000 for a permanent memorial and a compassionate fund for soldiers and their families. Lutyens first travelled to Bury in September 1920 at the invitation of Colonel Wike. In a letter to his wife, Emily, he described the town as a "desolate spot". He was received by Wike and a group of other colonels, and dined with several of the regiment's officers. While touring potential locations for the memorial, he proposed a site outside the regimental headquarters in <a href="Wellington%20Barracks%2C%20Bury">Wellington Barracks</a>, to which the committee agreed.

The memorial was built by John Tinline of Bury, a local stonemason. It consists of a single tall, tapering obelisk in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> (similar to the pair on Lutyens' <a href="Northampton%20War%20Memorial">Northampton War Memorial</a>) standing on a square base with a <a href="cornice">cornice</a> where the two parts meet. Below the base is a carved <a href="frieze">frieze</a> which sits on a pedestal of two rectangular blocks. The whole structure rests on a rectangular plinth and at the very bottom are two shallow circular steps. On the front and rear of the obelisk are carvings of the Lancashire Fusiliers' <a href="cap%20badge">cap badge</a> and the inscription "XX" (referring to the 20th Regiment of Foot, from which the Lancashire Fusiliers evolved) in gilded lettering, surrounded by a carved laurel wreath. On the front, below the wreath, the regiment's motto, "" ("daring in all things", awarded for the fusiliers' service in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>), is inscribed. To either side are carved, painted flags: the <a href="Military%20colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons%23United%20Kingdom">King's Colour</a> to the north (left when the memorial is viewed from the front) and the colour of 1st Battalion, the Lancashire Fusiliers to the south (right). The obelisk itself is tall and the whole memorial is tall.

The remaining inscriptions are all to the lower part of the structure. The dates of the First World War are carved just below the obelisk, and the dedication on the upper part of the pedestal. Below those, on the lower part of the pedestal and on the plinth, are later inscriptions: the dates of the Second World War and the further dedication (the latter added after the Lancashire Fusiliers' amalgamation in the 1960s). The architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> opined that the memorial is one of the few beautiful public artefacts in an otherwise "drab" group of towns, and "more moving in its modesty" compared to some of Lutyens' grander designs for municipal war memorials.

The memorial was unveiled by Lieutenant General <a href="Beauvoir%20De%20Lisle">Sir Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle</a>—commander of the <a href="29th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Division</a>, under which the 1st battalion was organised—on 25 April 1922, specifically chosen as the seventh anniversary of the Cape Helles landing. The general gave a speech in which he referenced the Gallipoli landings and the "six Victoria Crosses (VCs) before breakfast", after which he performed the unveiling by the then-novel method of an electric button. Lutyens was unable to attend the ceremony but sent a <a href="cablegram">cable</a>. Other dignitaries included several local mayors, Captain <a href="Richard%20Raymond%20Willis">Richard Willis</a> (recipient of one of the six VCs), three generals, and the Rector of Bury who led prayers. In addition to the memorial itself, spare funds were spent on drums and bugles for the regiment and donated to the fusiliers' compassionate fund out of a desire that the living benefit from the funds. The drums and bugles were formally presented to the regiment at the unveiling ceremony, at the conclusion of which the bugles were used to sound the <a href="Last%20Post">Last Post</a>. They are now on display in the <a href="Fusilier%20Museum">Fusilier Museum</a>, adjacent to the memorial's site in Bury. Lutyens designed one other obelisk as a regimental memorial, the <a href="Oxfordshire%20and%20Buckinghamshire%20Light%20Infantry%20War%20Memorial">Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry War Memorial</a> in <a href="Cowley%2C%20Oxford">Cowley, Oxford</a>, which was unveiled the year after the Lancashire Fusiliers' memorial. The two memorials are similar, though the OBLI's is more modestly decorated. 
When the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated with other fusilier regiments into the <a href="Royal%20Regiment%20of%20Fusiliers">Royal Regiment of Fusiliers</a> in 1968, the new regiment adopted the memorial and rededicated it to commemorate all fusiliers killed in the line of duty. It stood in its original location outside the regimental headquarters at Wellington Barracks for over 40 years, but the barracks closed with the amalgamation and were mostly demolished in the 1970s. As a result, the memorial was moved to the side of Bolton Road, outside the front gate of the former barracks. In 2009, Sparrow Park was redeveloped as Gallipoli Gardens and the Fusilier Museum moved there from the former regimental headquarters. The war memorial was dismantled and repaired before being re-installed next to the museum. Lutyens' grandson, <a href="Matthew%20White%20Ridley%2C%204th%20Viscount%20Ridley">Lord Ridley</a>, unveiled the memorial in its new location on 27 September (the day before the official reopening of the museum), after which the Rector of Bury, the Reverend John Findon, led a dedicatory service.

The Lancashire Fusiliers memorial was designated a grade II <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> on 2 September 1992. It was upgraded to grade II* in April 2015, along with <a href="Deal%20War%20Memorial">Deal War Memorial</a> in Kent and the <a href="29th%20Division%20War%20Memorial">memorial to the 29th Division</a> (under which the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers was organised) at <a href="Stretton-on-Dunsmore">Stretton-on-Dunsmore</a> in Warwickshire, to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landings. Historic England further recognised the Lancashire Fusiliers memorial as part of a "national collection" of Lutyens' war memorials in November 2015. Listed building status offers legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II* is reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and applied to about 5.5% of listings.

Maine Centennial half dollar

The Maine Centennial half dollar is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative coin</a> struck in 1920 by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a>. It was sculpted by <a href="Anthony%20de%20Francisci">Anthony de Francisci</a>, following sketches by an unknown artist from the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Maine">Maine</a>.

Officials in Maine wanted a commemorative <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> to circulate as an advertisement for the centennial of the state's admission to the Union, and of the planned celebrations. A bill to allow such a coin passed Congress without opposition, but then the state's centennial commission decided to sell the coins at $1, double the face value. The <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> disliked the proposed design, and urged changes, but Maine officials insisted, and de Francisci converted the sketches to plaster models, from which <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23D">coinage dies</a> could be made. 

Fifty thousand pieces, half the authorized mintage, were struck for release to the public. They were issued too late to be sold at the centennial celebrations in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland</a>, but eventually the coins were all sold, though relatively few went to coin collectors. They list for hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on condition.
Governor <a href="Carl%20Milliken">Carl Milliken</a> and the <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20Maine">council of Maine</a> wanted a <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> issued to commemorate the centennial of the state's 1820 admission to the Union. Initially, the idea was to have a circulating commemorative that could advertise the centennial celebrations in Maine. Later, after federal authorizing legislation for the coin was approved by Congress, the centennial commission decided to sell the coins for $1 each, rather than letting them pass from hand to hand in circulation.

That legislation for a Maine Centennial half dollar had been introduced in the House of Representatives by the state's <a href="John%20A.%20Peters%20%281864%E2%80%931953%29">John A. Peters</a> on February 11, 1920, with the bill designated as H.R. 12460. It was referred to the <a href="List%20of%20defunct%20United%20States%20congressional%20committees">Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures</a>, of which Indiana Congressman <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a> was the chairman. When the committee met, on February 23, 1920, Congressman Peters told members of the history of the state and citizens' desire to celebrate the centennial, including with a commemorative coin. He stated that he had spoken with the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a>, <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Baker">Raymond T. Baker</a>, who had told Peters that he and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="David%20F.%20Houston">David F. Houston</a> planned to endorse the bill, the text of which had been borrowed from the bill authorizing the 1918 <a href="Illinois%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Illinois Centennial half dollar</a>. Ohio's <a href="William%20A.%20Ashbrook">William A. Ashbrook</a> recalled that he had been a member of the committee that had approved the Illinois bill; he had favored it and now favored the Maine bill. Minnesota's <a href="Oscar%20E.%20Keller">Oscar E. Keller</a> asked Peters to confirm there would be no expense to the federal government, which Peters did. <a href="Clay%20Stone%20Briggs">Clay Stone Briggs</a> of Texas wanted to know if the Maine bill's provisions were identical to those of the Illinois act, and Peters confirmed it. On March 20, Vestal filed a report on behalf of his committee, recommending that the House pass the bill, and reproducing a letter from Houston stating that the Treasury had no objection.

Three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were considered in that order by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. After Peters addressed the House in favor of the Maine bill, Connecticut's <a href="John%20Q.%20Tilson">John Q. Tilson</a> inquired if the proposed coin would replace the existing design (the <a href="Walking%20Liberty%20half%20dollar">Walking Liberty half dollar</a>) for the rest of the year; Peters explained that it would not, and that only 100,000 coins would bear the commemorative design. <a href="John%20Franklin%20Miller%20%28representative%29">John Franklin Miller</a> of Washington state asked who would bear the expenses of the <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23D">coinage dies</a>, and Peters responded that the state of Maine would. Virginia's <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Montague">Andrew Jackson Montague</a> asked if the Treasury Department had endorsed the bill, and Peters informed him that both Houston and Baker had. Vestal asked that the bill be passed, but Ohio's <a href="Warren%20Gard">Warren Gard</a> had questions about what would happen to the coins once they entered circulation; Peters stated that they would, once issued, be treated as ordinary half dollars. In response to questions by Gard, Peters explained that although Maine would pay for the dies, they would become federal government property. Peters added that though there would be no statewide celebration in Maine for the centennial, there would be local observances. Gard had no further questions about the Maine bill (he would also quiz the sponsors of the Alabama and Pilgrim bills), and on Vestal's motion it passed without recorded dissent.

The following day, April 22, 1920, the House reported its passage of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the <a href="Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%20and%20Currency">Senate Committee on Banking and Currency</a>; on April 28, Connecticut's <a href="George%20P.%20McLean">George P. McLean</a> reported it back with a recommendation that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, fearing that though they were on the Senate's agenda for that day, they might not be reached, and believing urgent action was required. Utah Senator <a href="Reed%20Smoot">Reed Smoot</a> objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill out of turn had just been objected to by <a href="Charles%20S.%20Thomas">Charles S. Thomas</a> of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the coin bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Maine bill was enacted with the signature of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> on May 10, 1920.

On May 14, 1920, four days after Wilson signed the bill, Director of the Mint Baker sent sketches of the proposed design to the chairman of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles Moore</a>, for an opinion as to its merits. The design had been prepared by the officials in charge of the centennial commemoration, and had been given to Baker by Peters. Moore forwarded the sketches to the sculptor-member of the Commission, <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>. Having received no reply, Moore on May 26 sent a telegram to Fraser telling him that the Maine authorities wanted the coins by June 28. Fraser immediately replied by telegram, that he disliked the design as it was "ordinary", and that it was an error to approve sketches; a plaster model should be made by a sculptor. Moore expanded on this in a letter to Houston the following day, "our new silver coinage has reached a high degree of perfection because it was designed by competent men. We should not return to the low standards which have formerly prevailed."

Moore in his letter urged a change of design, stating that the sketch, if translated into a coin, "would bring humiliation to the people of Maine". However, Maine officials refused and insisted on the submitted sketches. After discussions among Peters, Moore, and various officials, an agreement was reached whereby the sketches would be converted into plaster models, and Fraser engaged his onetime student, <a href="Anthony%20de%20Francisci">Anthony de Francisci</a>, to do the work. The younger sculptor completed the work by early July, and the models were approved by the Commission on July 9. The Engraving Department at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> created the coin dies utilizing de Francisci's models. Either Chief Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>, or his assistant, future chief engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>, changed the moose and pine tree on the coin from being in relief (as in de Francisci's models), to be sunken into the coin. This was probably in an attempt to improve the striking quality of the coins, and if so, had limited success, as the full detail would not appear on many coins.

The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> of the Maine Centennial half dollar depicts the arms of Maine, based on <a href="Seal%20of%20Maine">the state's seal</a>. At its center is a shield with a pine tree, sunken <a href="incuse">incuse</a> into the coin, and below the tree a moose, lying down. The shield is flanked by two male figures, one bearing a scythe and representing Agriculture; the other, supporting an anchor, represents Commerce. Above the shield is the legend "Dirigo", Latin for "I direct", and above that a five-pointed star. Below the shield is a scroll with the state's name. Near the rim are and . The reverse contains a wreath of pine needles and cones (Maine is known as the Pine Tree State) around as well as the various mottoes required by law to be present on the coinage.

<a href="Numismatics">Numismatist</a> <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, in his history of commemorative coins, speculated that "De Francisci did not altogether favor them". According to Taxay, the two human figures on the obverse "were too small to retain their beauty after reduction [from the plaster models to coin size] and seem trivial. The reverse, with its wreath of pine cones, is eminently uninspired." Arlie Slabaugh, in his volume on commemoratives, noted that the half dollar "does not resemble the work by the same sculptor for the <a href="Peace%20dollar">Peace dollar</a> the following year [1921]."

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> deprecated the Maine half dollar, but did not blame de Francisci, as the piece "was modeled by the sculptor according to required specifications and is therefore not considered typical of his art, or indeed of any art." Vermeule stated, "it looks just like a prize medal for a county fair or school athletic day." Nonetheless, feeling that de Francisci could have insisted on a more artistic design, Vermeule found "the Maine Centennial was not his shining moment".

Celebrations for the state's centennial were held in Maine's largest city, <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland</a>, on July 4, 1920. Peters had hoped to have the half dollars available for distribution then, but because of the design controversy, they were not. He wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> on July 14, expressing his frustration at the delay and stating that though the Portland festivities had passed, the state could still get some benefit from the coins if they received them during 1920. Otherwise, "we might as well wait for the next Centennial [in 2020] which I judge would be more convenient and in accordance with the speed at which we are going". He concluded by asking that the Mint let him know of the next obstacle ahead of time. Governor Milliken also wrote, on July 20, reminding Mint officials that the coin was authorized by a special act of Congress, and asking when the first consignment would be ready.

In the late summer of 1920, a total of 50,028 Maine Centennial half dollars were produced at the Philadelphia Mint, including 28 pieces reserved for inspection and testing at the 1921 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. No special care was taken in the minting; they were ejected into bins and many display <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23B">bag marks</a>. They were sent to Maine and placed on sale through the Office of the State Treasurer at a price of $1. Thirty thousand sold immediately and they remained on sale through the treasurer's office until all fifty thousand were vended, though this did not happen until at least 1929. Bowers speculated that had the full 100,000 authorized coins been struck, most of the additional quantity would have been returned to the Mint and melted for lack of buyers. Many pieces were spent in the years after 1920 and entered circulation.

Relatively few were sold to the coin collecting community, and the majority of surviving specimens display the effects of careless handling. The 2015 deluxe edition of <a href="Richard%20S.%20Yeoman">Richard S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the coin at $140 to $685, depending on condition—an exceptional piece sold for $7,050 in 2014.

Missouri Centennial half dollar

The Missouri Centennial half dollar is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1921. It was designed by <a href="Robert%20Ingersoll%20Aitken">Robert Ingersoll Aitken</a>. The <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> wanted a <a href="commemorative%20coin">commemorative coin</a> to mark its centennial that year. Legislation for such a coin passed through Congress without opposition, and was signed on March 4, 1921 by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> on his <a href="Inauguration%20of%20Warren%20G.%20Harding">inauguration day</a>. The federal <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> hired Aitken to design the coin, which depicted <a href="Daniel%20Boone">Daniel Boone</a> on both sides. The reverse design, showing Boone with a Native American, was likely intended to symbolize the displacement of the Indians by white settlers.

To increase sales, a portion of the issue was produced with the mark 2★4, symbolic of Missouri being the 24th state. Although admired for the design, the coins did not sell as well as hoped, and almost 60 percent were returned to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> for melting. There are fewer coins with 2★4 than without, but they remain near-equal in value.

The State of Missouri, admitted to <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">the Union</a> in 1821 as part of the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a>, wanted a commemorative coin for sale at the Missouri Centennial Exposition and State Fair, to be held in <a href="Sedalia%2C%20Missouri">Sedalia</a> from August 8 to 20, 1921. Legislation for such a half dollar was introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> by that state's <a href="Selden%20P.%20Spencer">Selden P. Spencer</a> on January 20, 1921, the bill being designated S. 4893. It was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. The bill was reported to the full Senate by Connecticut's <a href="George%20P.%20McLean">George P. McLean</a> on January 25 with an amendment reducing the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 250,000 and a recommendation that it pass. Vice President <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Marshall">Thomas R. Marshall</a>, who was presiding over the Senate, asked if there was objection to its passage. The Minority Leader, Democrat <a href="Oscar%20Underwood">Oscar Underwood</a> of Alabama, said he did not think there would be objection, but that the bill should be read first. Idaho Senator <a href="William%20E.%20Borah">William E. Borah</a> stated he would object if there was to be discussion of it, as the Senate had not had <a href="morning%20business">morning business</a> in ten days. Borah asked McLean if he expected there would be objection to the bill, and McLean reassured the Idahoan. The bill, as amended, passed the Senate without recorded opposition.

An identical bill, H. R. 15767, had been introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> on January 17, 1921. On February 10, Indiana Representative <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a>, chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures (to which the bill had been referred) reported it back to the House with an amendment identical to that approved by the Senate, and with a recommendation that the bill pass. S. 4983 had been referred to that committee after its receipt by the House, and on February 24 the Coinage Committee recommended the Senate bill pass the House, noting that the two bills were identical.

S. 4893 was considered by the House of Representatives on March 2, 1921, with two days remaining in the congressional session. Ohio's <a href="Warren%20Gard">Warren Gard</a> had asked questions about previous coin bills when they passed through the House. Gard enquired of Vestal whether the Missouri bill was identical to the earlier bills, and whether it contained the same safeguards, and Vestal confirmed these. The bill was passed by the House without recorded objection, and was enacted into law with the signature of the new president, <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a>, on <a href="Inauguration%20of%20Warren%20G.%20Harding">his inauguration day</a>, March 4, 1921.

While the legislation was still pending in Congress, on January 29, 1921, Senator Spencer wrote to <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles Moore</a>, chairman of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, regarding the bill. Moore replied on February 2, advising that one of the few American sculptors capable of designing a coin be hired, and that the resulting work be subjected to the friendly criticism of other artists. Spencer put James Montgomery, chairman of the Missouri Centennial Commission, in touch with Moore, and on February 9, Moore made several proposals for the design, including a "<a href="Covered%20wagon">prairie-schooner</a> ... second, the heads of [pioneer Daniel] <a href="Daniel%20Boone">Boone</a> and [early Missouri politician Thomas Hart] <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Benton</a>; third, the state seal of Missouri; and fourth, the Indian pointing westward". The hired sculptor could choose among these concepts, Moore suggested, and decide which could be used to best effect, with Montgomery's approval and that of the Fine Arts Commission. Montgomery replied on February 16, proposing a "standing figure of Daniel Boone, coon skin cap, deer skin clothes, with an Indian sitting at his feet, the Missouri River flowing in front, with the bluffs on opposite side, with one star with the figures '24' in center of star. This would signify first, that the white man had supplanted the Indian in Missouri Territory." 

Montgomery also proposed that a star with the number "24" (Missouri being the 24th state) be included in the design, but be removed from the die after 5,000 coins were struck. These would boost proceeds, helping to pay the sculptor's fee and the cost of the die, an expense estimated at $1,750. Montgomery wrote again on March 22, proposing that the words "" appear on the coins, and if possible the centennial date of August 10 as well. 

The Fine Arts Commission hired <a href="Robert%20Ingersoll%20Aitken">Robert Ingersoll Aitken</a>, a sculptor best known in numismatic circles for his design for the $50 <a href="Panama-Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama Pacific gold pieces</a>. This was apparently not communicated to the Missouri commission as on May 17, <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, told Moore that he had heard that someone associated with the Missouri Centennial had made inquiries with the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York, aimed at hiring a sculptor. Whether Moore wrote to Montgomery is unclear, but he wrote to Spencer on May 26, advising the senator that the designs had been preliminarily approved. Commission members had suggested several changes; these were implemented and, on June 9, the Fine Arts Commission approved the design, a decision communicated by letter that day to the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a>, <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Baker">Raymond T. Baker</a>. To speed production, the Medallic Art Company produced <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> from which working dies to produce the coins could be made. These hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint on June 29, 1921.

The bust of frontiersman <a href="Daniel%20Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, who lived in Missouri for the final quarter century of his life, appears on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, note speculation that the obverse may have been inspired by <a href="Albin%20Polasek">Albin Polasek</a>'s sculptured bust of Boone in the <a href="Hall%20of%20Fame%20for%20Great%20Americans">Hall of Fame for Great Americans</a> in New York City. Boone wears a deerskin jacket and a <a href="coonskin%20cap">coonskin cap</a>. The centennial dates, the name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the bust. The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American—Swiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a shield and <a href="peace%20pipe">peace pipe</a>, apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri; Breen stated "as though this was something to brag about". The 1921 "Report of the Director of the Mint" describes the interaction as "Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man". The Missouri Centennial half dollar, which shows Boone on either side, is one of the few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides; other such depictions include Boone himself on the 1934–1938 <a href="Daniel%20Boone%20Bicentennial%20half%20dollar">Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Lafayette</a> on the 1900-dated <a href="Lafayette%20dollar">Lafayette dollar</a> and the frontiersman on the 1936 <a href="Elgin%2C%20Illinois%2C%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar</a>.

The 24 stars on the reverse convey the same message that the 2★4 on the obverse of some specimens does—that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union. The name , the site of the centennial exposition, appears in <a href="exergue">exergue</a>. Aitken's stylized monogram, , is near the rifle butt. The Missouri piece, and the <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">Columbian half dollar</a> of 1892–1893, are the only U.S. commemorative half dollars to bear none of the patriotic mottoes usually found on U.S. coinage, that is , and . The design was liked at the time of issue; several specimens were shown and admired at the 1921 American Numismatic Association convention at Boston in August, soon after the coin's release.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on U.S. coins and medals, admired Aitken's Missouri piece, writing that Aitken "became the first American medalist to apply the principles of Renaissance medallic design to a coin of the United States and the first such artist to make a frontiersman look like a Medici prince". He suggested that the figures on the reverse stand "like Roman soldiers in an Antonine relief on the Arch of Constantine or Renaissance condottieri in a large fresco of court ceremonials." Mermeule noted that "the lettering on the obverse follows the forms and system of Pisanello" and that "the coin as a whole is a work of art rather than just another way to market a silver fifty-cent piece because all three of the mottoes that usually burden and constrict America's attempts of numismatic art are omitted." The author concluded of Aitken's works, "his imagination in selecting from the past to rephrase the present worked very well in the United States commemorative coinage".

A total of 50,028 Missouri Centennial half dollars was struck at the Philadelphia Mint in July 1921, 28 being reserved for inspection and testing at the 1922 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The first coins displayed the 2★4 on the obverse; afterwards, this was ground off the dies and the remainder were struck without it. The Sedalia Trust Company distributed the coins at a price of $1 on behalf of the centennial commission, selling both varieties by mail and the plain ones at the exposition in August. There had been little advance publicity, and the exposition took place during the <a href="Recession%20of%201921">Recession of 1921</a>. All of the 2★4 coins sold, but when sales slowed of the plain variety, 29,600 were returned to the mint for melting. Early advertisements for the coin contained sketches prepared by Aitken, showing the obverse as issued, but depicting a reverse bearing the state <a href="Seal%20of%20Missouri">Seal of Missouri</a>, that Aitken had abandoned when he found it did not work well. Aitken, in a letter published in part in the December 1921 issue of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" (the journal of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>) wrote that "The illustration that you published was made from one of several drawings which I submitted to the Federal Art Commission. The Missouri committee was informed that I would work along these lines, though I was given full latitude for any change I might advise. The seal of the State did not work out well, so I developed the reverse with the two standing figures, which met with the instant approval of the Commission in Washington."

The number of coins bearing the 2★4 is uncertain. Swiatek and Breen wrote that 5,000 were struck and were sold, meaning that 15,400 of the plain ones were issued. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, adhered to these figures. Coin dealer David Bullowa wrote in 1937 that 10,000 of the 2★4 were issued, with which numismatic writer <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> concurred, noting that the two varieties are about equal in rarity. The deluxe edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2018, estimates that 9,400 of the 2★4 were issued, and 11,400 of the plain. Both varieties sold at a premium above the issue price by 1925, and at the height of the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, the 2★4 sold for $25 and the plain for $28. By 1940, the 2★4 sold for more than the plain, and at the height of the second boom in 1980, the 2★4 brought $2,600 to the plain's $2,400. Yeoman's book lists the 2★4 for between $625 and $7,250, and the plain for between $400 and $6,650, each depending on condition. An exceptional specimen of the plain variety sold at auction in 2015 for $70,500. At least one specimen in proof condition is known, sold at auction in 1992.

Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar

The Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar, sometimes called the Fort Vancouver half dollar, is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1925. The coin was designed by <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a>. Its <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts <a href="John%20McLoughlin">John McLoughlin</a>, who was in charge of <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a> (present-day <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a>) from its construction in 1825 until 1846. From there, he effectively ruled the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>, on behalf of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman standing in front of the fort.

Washington Representative <a href="Albert%20Johnson%20%28congressman%29">Albert Johnson</a> wanted a coin for Fort Vancouver's centennial celebrations, but was persuaded to accept a medal instead. But when another congressman was successful in amending a coinage bill to add a commemorative, Johnson tacked on language authorizing a coin for Fort Vancouver. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.

Fraser was engaged to design the coin on the recommendation of the <a href="United%20States%20Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">United States Commission of Fine Arts</a>. The coins were flown from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>, where they were struck, to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They sold badly; much of the issue was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure may have been a factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, the coins are valuable today.

<a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>, on the north bank of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> in what is today <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a>, lay across the river from what would become <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. It was founded in 1825 by the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> chief factor for the area, Dr. <a href="John%20McLoughlin">John McLoughlin</a>. The company sought furs and other trade goods, and was in competition with <a href="John%20Jacob%20Astor">John Jacob Astor</a>'s <a href="Pacific%20Fur%20Company">Pacific Fur Company</a>, which had an outpost at what is now <a href="Astoria%2C%20Oregon">Astoria, Oregon</a>. Fort Vancouver was named for the British sea captain <a href="George%20Vancouver">George Vancouver</a>, who also gave his name to <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> in Canada.

Until the <a href="Oregon%20Treaty">Oregon Treaty</a> of 1846 settled the disputed claims of the United States and Britain, McLoughlin was what government there was in the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>. McLoughlin's word was obeyed by white man and Native American alike, and there were no significant wars there in that time. Fort Vancouver became the trading center for a large area, and the largest settlement west of the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>. With the coming of American rule in 1846, McLoughlin resigned from the Hudson's Bay Company, going to Iive at <a href="Oregon%20City%2C%20Oregon">Oregon City</a>, which he had founded, and became its mayor in 1851, two years after becoming a U.S. citizen. He died in 1857; a century later, the <a href="Oregon%20Legislature">Oregon Legislature</a> named him the "Founder of Oregon", and Fort Vancouver is now a <a href="Fort%20Vancouver%20National%20Historic%20Site">national historic site</a>.

The Fort Vancouver Centennial Corporation hoped to sell commemorative half dollars at the planned celebration, and persuaded Representative <a href="Albert%20Johnson%20%28congressman%29">Albert Johnson</a> of Washington state to introduce legislation in the House of Representatives. In May 1924, he and Senator <a href="Wesley%20Jones">Wesley Jones</a>, also of Washington state, introduced legislation in their houses of Congress for a half dollar commemorating the centennial of Fort Vancouver. The bills were not given any hearings. Indiana Representative <a href="Albert%20Vestal">Albert Vestal</a>, the chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, met with Johnson and persuaded him to introduce a bill for a medal instead. Vestal reasoned that the Treasury Department was opposing more commemorative coin issues, as these were finding their way into circulation and confusing the public. On February 3, 1925, Jones introduced a bill for a medal, and on the 12th, Johnson did the same.

Legislation for a <a href="Vermont%20Sesquicentennial%20half%20dollar">Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar</a> had been introduced by that state's senior senator, <a href="Frank%20L.%20Greene">Frank Greene</a>, and had passed the Senate.
When that bill came to the floor of the House of Representatives on February 16, California Representative <a href="John%20E.%20Raker">John E. Raker</a> moved to amend it to provide for a <a href="California%20Diamond%20Jubilee%20half%20dollar">California Diamond Jubilee half dollar</a>. Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Vermont bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman <a href="Finis%20J.%20Garrett">Finis J. Garrett</a> of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule before considering the Vermont bill, and Vestal admitted it was hard to answer. The House voted, and the amendment was added. Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add "and Vancouver, Wash." The amendment passed, as did the bill. 

Johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued. He therefore returned to the House floor soon thereafter, asking that the bill be reconsidered, so he could couch his amendment in the same phrasing as for the other two coins. Once the bill was again being considered, Johnson added his amendment, but Vestal moved that the bill be returned to his committee. Vestal's motion failed, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no <a href="quorum">quorum</a> present. Once that was resolved, the House passed the bill again. The bill was returned to the Senate the following day. Kansas's <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> moved on behalf of Greene that the Senate agree to the House amendments, and though Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> urged President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> to veto it, the bill, authorizing all three coins, was enacted by the President's signature on February 24, 1925.

Once the coin had been approved by Congress, the Centennial Corporation submitted plaster models by an unknown artist, whose initials appeared on the obverse. They were sent to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, charged by a 1921 <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. The models showed McLoughlin on the obverse and the fort stockade with <a href="Mount%20Hood">Mount Hood</a> in the background for the reverse. These designs were likely dictated by the Centennial Corporation. On May 22, the Commission rejected the models, describing them as "interesting" but stating that an experienced medalist would be needed. It recommended <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>, but when the corporation tried to hire him, it turned out that he was traveling. The corporation instead hired the commission's second choice, <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a>, an experienced designer of commemorative coins.

Since the Centennial Corporation had decided what design elements it wanted to see on the half dollar, Fraser had to do her own interpretation of the designs SB had essayed. Hired on June 15, she completed her models by July 1, when <a href="Louis%20Ayres">Louis Ayres</a>, a member of the commission, came to view them. He was enthusiastic, and sent a letter to commission chairman Charles Moore to that effect, writing "the whole coin looks very interesting to me, and I think is mighty good." The models were approved by the commission, and then by Mellon. Dies were prepared at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, then shipped to <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco</a>, where the coins were to be struck.

The obverse features a portrait of McLoughlin, facing left. The name of his adopted country overarches him, and his name and are below him, with the centennial dates and flanking his bust. Fraser had no likenesses of McLoughlin to work with, and what she based her portrait of him on is unclear. It shows him as an older man than the 41 years he was at the time of Fort Vancouver's founding. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman, dressed in <a href="buckskins">buckskins</a>, with the stockade of Fort Vancouver behind him, and Mt. Hood in the distance. The inscription is somewhat broken up, but is intended to be read as . Numismatists have debated whether the absence of a <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> was intentional; it is the only commemorative coin issue struck at <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver</a> or San Francisco that lacks one. The artist's initials, , are at lower right on the reverse, on the other side of the circle from the date .

Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, describe Fraser's design as "better than anything [Chester] Beach could have come up with". <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on the artistry of U.S. coins and medals, deemed Fraser's half dollar "a most acceptable coin". He wrote, "the obverse tries <a href="Pisanello">Pisanello</a>'s spacing of the lettering and circumscribed roughness of the bust, while the reverse has too much scenery in the background, surrounded by too much lettering. This and the <a href="Hawaii%20Sesquicentennial%20half%20dollar">Hawaiian Sesquicentennial coin</a> of 1928 prove that background scenery or geography ought to be omitted from commemorative half dollars".

Only 50,000 of the authorized mintage of 300,000 were coined, plus 28 pieces intended to be sent to Philadelphia to be available for inspection and testing at the 1926 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The minting was done not later than August 1 at San Francisco. As a publicity stunt, the entire mintage (less the 28 assay coins) was flown by air to Vancouver, Washington, by <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a> Lieutenant <a href="Oakley%20G.%20Kelly">Oakley G. Kelly</a> on August 1; the shipment, including packaging, weighed . On arrival, the coins were received by Herbert Campbell, head of the centennial commission.

The half dollars were intended to help pay for the centennial festivities in Vancouver. These were held from August 17 to 23, with a highlight being a pageant, "The Coming of the White Man", which was "based on historical fact". The coins were sold at $1 each; several hundred were gilded, diminishing their future value as numismatic specimens; others were kept as pocket pieces, or were spent.

The poor sales caused financial problems and may have caused a suicide, for on August 22, Charles A. Watts, secretary of the Centennial Corporation and described by Campbell as the real force behind the coin, killed himself. The day before he died, he told a meeting of the corporation that there were funds enough to pay all debts, and that Fraser was not owed any money. Neither proved to be the case, and unpaid bills totaled $6,000, with no money to pay them. In fact, Fraser's fee of $1,200 was outstanding, and she tried to get paid even with the half dollars, but her bill was unsatisfied until a year later, when she was paid by check. The half dollars were not owned by the corporation, as the Vancouver National Bank had advanced money for them. Sales came to a virtual halt by the end of October. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl offered to buy the remainder of the issue at face value, but this was rejected as many people had paid $1 for their coins. A total of 35,034 pieces were sent back to the mint for redemption and melting, leaving 14,966 pieces outstanding. According to Swiatek and Breen, "given the remoteness and exclusively local nature of the celebration, it is surprising that as many as fourteen thousand coins were sold."

A sale of 1,000 coins was made to an executive of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a>, and they were placed in the <a href="Archives%20of%20Manitoba">Archives of Manitoba</a> in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, Canada. They were stolen in 1982 by a caretaker, who spent them and redeemed some for Canadian currency at a bank. Many wound up in the hands of a coin dealer, who sold them widely. At the time, the coins were worth about US$800 each. Once the theft was realized, the <a href="Province%20of%20Manitoba">Province of Manitoba</a> filed suit to recover the remaining coins, but a settlement allowed the dealer to retain them.

The coins quickly commanded a premium after their 1925 issue due to their scarcity, rising to $10 by 1928 before falling back to $7 by 1930, in <a href="coin%20grading">uncirculated condition</a>. They peaked at about $9 during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided back to the $6 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, rising to $1,600 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980. The edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" published in 2017 lists the coin for between $300 and $975, depending on condition. A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $8,225.

Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar

The Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar, sometimes called the Bennington–Vermont half dollar or the Battle of Bennington Sesquicentennial half dollar, is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1927. The coin was designed by <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a>, and on its <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts early <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> leader <a href="Ira%20Allen">Ira Allen</a>, brother of <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a>.

On January 9, 1925, Vermont Senator <a href="Frank%20L.%20Greene">Frank Greene</a> introduced legislation for commemorative coins to mark the 150th anniversary of Vermont declaring itself fully independent in 1777 and of the American victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bennington">Battle of Bennington</a> the same year. His bill passed the Senate without difficulty, but in the House of Representatives faced an array of problems. Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a> sent a letter opposing the bill and dispatched three Treasury officials to testify against it, arguing that the public was being confused as special coin issues entered circulation. The committee's resolve to have no more commemorative coins—after this one—did not impress the full House, which added two more half dollars to the legislation to mark other anniversaries. The Senate agreed to the changes, and President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> signed the authorizing act on February 24, 1925.

There was a lengthy battle over the design between the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> and the Vermont commission in charge of organizing the coin issue, as a result of which the original designer, <a href="Sherry%20Fry">Sherry Fry</a>, left the project, replaced by Keck. Although the eventual reverse design of a <a href="Cougar">catamount</a> satisfied the Fine Arts Commission, it has been severely criticized by later writers. The coins did not sell out; over a fourth of the issue was returned for redemption and melting. The coins sell for at least in the hundreds of dollars today, depending on condition.

In the days before the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the ownership of what is now the state of <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> was uncertain. New Hampshire claimed it, deeming its own western boundary to be east of the Hudson River; the colony of New York believed it owned the territory north of Massachusetts east to the <a href="Connecticut%20River">Connecticut River</a>. British authorities awarded the land to New York in 1764, but settlers felt more affinity with New Hampshire, from which they had secured land grants. When New York issued grants for the same real estate, there was conflict between the two groups of settlers, and those deriving title from New Hampshire organized the <a href="Green%20Mountain%20Boys">Green Mountain Boys</a>, a local militia. At first, the Boys concentrated on fending off unwanted settlers from New York, but after the war began in 1775, they turned their attention to the British.

Brothers <a href="Ira%20Allen">Ira</a> and <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a> were born in Connecticut, and were leaders of the Green Mountain Boys. Ethan Allen led an ill-advised raid on Montreal in 1775, was captured, and spent the remainder of the Revolutionary War a prisoner of the British. Ira Allen, besides being a military leader, was a member of the convention that declared Vermont independent in January 1777. A key player in Vermont politics in the Revolutionary War years, Allen served as state treasurer, designed the great seal, and in the 1780s surveyed several towns, three of which are named for him: <a href="Ira%2C%20Vermont">Ira</a>, <a href="Irasburg%2C%20Vermont">Irasburg</a> and <a href="Alburg%2C%20Vermont">Alburg, Vermont</a>, the last likely a shortened form of "Allenburgh". In 1791, the year Vermont was admitted to the Union, he was the principal founder of the <a href="University%20of%20Vermont">University of Vermont</a>, the first university in what is now the United States to have a religious nondiscrimination policy. Thereafter his fortunes declined: he went to France in 1796 to buy weapons for the state militia, but his ship and cargo were taken by the British. He returned to Vermont to find his land seized for taxes, and was put in jail in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Vermont">Burlington</a> for debt. He fled to Philadelphia, where he hoped to reverse his fortunes but was unable to; he died there impoverished in 1814.

In 1777, the British general, <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>, advanced south from Canada, hoping to divide the colonies by capturing the <a href="Hudson%20Valley">Hudson Valley</a> in what is called the <a href="Saratoga%20Campaign">Saratoga Campaign</a>. Low on supplies, he heard of a poorly-guarded American depot at what is now <a href="Bennington%2C%20Vermont">Bennington, Vermont</a>, and sent part of his force to secure it. Vermonters were joined by some 1,500 New Hampshire militiamen, and on August 16, 1777, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bennington">Battle of Bennington</a> took place. About 200 of the British forces were killed and 700 taken prisoner; only 40 Americans were killed. Weakened by the losses and the failure to obtain supplies, Burgoyne was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saratoga">Battle of Saratoga</a> in New York state that October, an American victory that historian <a href="Edmund%20Morgan%20%28historian%29">Edmund Morgan</a> deemed "a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance [from France] which was the last element needed for victory".

Legislation for a silver fifty-cent piece and a gold one-dollar piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversaries of the Battle of Bennington and of the independence of Vermont was introduced in the Senate by that state's <a href="Frank%20L.%20Greene">Frank Greene</a> on January 9, 1925. Greene had not always been a friend to commemorative coins: when the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar</a> was debated in 1922, he commented, "the question is whether the United States Government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." His bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. Greene, a member of that committee, reported the bill back to the Senate on January 20, with an amendment and a recommendation that it pass. The amendment deleted the proposed one-dollar piece and increased the mintage of the half dollar from 20,000 to 40,000. On January 24, New Hampshire's <a href="George%20H.%20Moses">George H. Moses</a>, acting on Greene's behalf, moved that the Senate consider the bill, and it passed that body without opposition.

After the House received the Senate-passed bill, it was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on January 30, with the chairman, Indiana Representative <a href="Albert%20H.%20Vestal">Albert H. Vestal</a>, presiding. He introduced into the record a letter from Treasury Secretary <a href="Andrew%20W.%20Mellon">Andrew W. Mellon</a>, opposing the measure. Mellon noted that many commemorative issues had failed to sell out, leaving coins in the Mint or returning them for melting. Mellon felt that the public was being confused as surplus commemoratives entered circulation. The Treasury had sent three officials, Mint Director <a href="Robert%20J.%20Grant">Robert J. Grant</a>, Assistant Director <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> and Garrard B. Winston, the assistant to the Undersecretary of the Treasury. O'Reilly, who had been with the Treasury longer than the other two, addressed the committee, warning that there were six coinage bills before Congress, and that the Mint had struck nine commemoratives in the past five years. She answered questions from the congressmen on the panel.

Vermont Representative <a href="Frederick%20G.%20Fleetwood">Frederick G. Fleetwood</a> addressed the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood stressed the importance in American history of the events that were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. For one thing, as Massachusetts' <a href="Robert%20M.%20Leach">Robert M. Leach</a> noted, President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' <a href="Morton%20D.%20Hull">Morton D. Hull</a> pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: "I believe we have been going too fast, and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on these gentlemen representing the State of Vermont this morning." Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.

The bill came to the floor of the House of Representatives on February 16. As soon as the bill was read, California Representative <a href="John%20E.%20Raker">John E. Raker</a> pressed an amendment to provide for a <a href="California%20Diamond%20Jubilee%20half%20dollar">California Diamond Jubilee half dollar</a>. He explained that Senator <a href="Samuel%20Shortridge">Samuel Shortridge</a> had gotten a bill through the Senate that was nearly identical to his amendment, and "the Senator is exceptionally anxious that it go through." Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Bennington bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Washington Representative <a href="Albert%20Johnson%20%28congressman%29">Albert Johnson</a> had agreed to withdraw his bill for <a href="Fort%20Vancouver%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">a commemorative</a> honoring the centennial of <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>, in his state. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman <a href="Finis%20J.%20Garrett">Finis J. Garrett</a> of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule "before" considering the Bennington bill, and Vestal admitted that was hard to answer. The House voted, and the California amendment was added. But Representative Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add "and Vancouver, Wash." (that is, the state of Washington) The amendment passed, as did the bill. Johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued, and returned to the House floor soon thereafter, asking that the bill be reconsidered, so he could couch his amendment in the same phrasing as for the other two coins. Once the bill was again being considered, Johnson added his amendment, but Vestal moved that the bill be returned to his committee. His motion failed, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no quorum present. Once this was resolved, the House passed the bill again. The bill was returned to the Senate the following day. Kansas' <a href="Charles%20Curtis">Charles Curtis</a> moved on behalf of Greene that the Senate agree to the House amendments, and the bill, authorizing all three coins, was enacted by Coolidge's signature on February 24, 1925. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their 1988 book on commemoratives, state that the bill would probably not have passed Congress if Coolidge had not been known to have an interest in the Bennington observances.

After the approval of the legislation, the Vermont Sesquicentennial Commission moved quickly to secure designs to be used for the half dollar. Members decided to have the coin show Ira Allen on the obverse, and the Battle of Bennington Monument on the reverse. They commissioned <a href="Sherry%20Fry">Sherry Fry</a>, who had created a statue of Allen for the University of Vermont, to design the coin. On July 1, 1925, Fry wrote to Charles Moore, chairman of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> (charged by a 1921 executive order by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins), informing him that the models would be ready in about a week.

<a href="Louis%20Ayres">Louis Ayres</a>, a member of the Fine Arts Commission, and <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a>, a former member, viewed the models before they were sent, and did not approve of them. Ayres wrote to Moore on July 15, stating that the designs were mediocre, but that it was not entirely Fry's fault, as the Sesquicentennial Commission had dictated the designs. Moore wrote to Mint Director Grant on the 18th, noting the problem, and relaying a suggestion from Ayres, that sketches be approved by the Mint before the artist spent time and effort on making plaster models, and that Fry be allowed to make designs of his own choosing. In spite of this, Fry formally submitted photographs of his models on August 9. Once the Mint had established that Fry had the authority to act, O'Reilly sent them to the Fine Arts Commission for its verdict. On September 5, Moore replied, rejecting the models on several grounds. The Fine Arts Commission questioned the choice of Allen, did not like the lettering, objected to the misspelling of Bennington as "Bennigton", and had mistaken the monument for the one erected for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Champlain">Battle of Lake Champlain</a>, and thus felt that there was an issue regarding relevance. On September 11, the chairman of the Sesquicentennial Commission, <a href="John%20Spargo">John Spargo</a>, wrote to Grant, pointing out the error and strongly defending the choices of Allen and the monument. He wrote again on the 15th, this time directly to Moore, "your commission has touched the pride of the Vermonter there, with a rather rough hand."

Moore wrote to Spargo on September 18, stating that his commission had approved the head of Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, the use of a <a href="Green%20Mountain%20Boy">Green Mountain Boy</a> would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the <a href="Minuteman">Minuteman</a> seen on the <a href="Lexington-Concord%20Sesquicentennial%20half%20dollar">Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar</a>, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a>.

It was not until March 24, 1926, that new models, by Keck, were sent to the Fine Arts Commission. Although the commission admired Keck's portrait of Allen, they disliked his choice of <a href="Catamount%20Tavern">Fay's Tavern</a> for the reverse, and also disliked his enclosing the building in a wreath. On April 2, Moore wrote to Keck, advising him to get rid of both, and to put in place of the building a <a href="Cougar">catamount</a>, which would make a coin one could admire. The animal is a reference to Fay's Tavern, that was also known as the Catamount Tavern, and was a place where the Green Mountain Boys met. A copy of the letter was sent by Keck to Spargo, who wrote to Moore on the 12th, suggesting the Fine Arts Commission was overstepping its bounds by trying to dictate the design, but to resolve the matter, he would agree to the catamount: "Life is too short to be spent in futile argument with the Commission of Fine Arts."

By the end April 1926, Keck had prepared three models, two with the catamount and a third featuring Revolutionary War memorabilia. The Commission on the 30th approved one showing a walking catamount for the reverse, and asked that the words be removed and be substituted. The Vermont commission objected, and the matter was resolved by the name being added. and also had to be added to the reverse; Keck promised completion within several days when he wrote to Grant on May 24, with photographs to be submitted to Secretary Mellon for final approval. In July, Spargo wrote to Grant, advising him of how the coins would be distributed and making arrangements to secure the first coins struck, to be used for presentations. The <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York reduced Keck's plaster models to coin-sized <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> from which dies could be made by the Philadelphia Mint.

The obverse features an idealized portrait of Ira Allen, one different from the one Fry had used in his statue and models. Allen wears a <a href="periwig">periwig</a>, and below his head appears his name. The words and surround his portrait.

The reverse features a catamount, facing and walking to the left. The animal is virtually penned in with lettering, with , and the anniversary dates above him, and below, (representing the battle's date) below its head, and the designer's initials, , between its rearmost paw and the end of its tail.

Keck's design has been widely criticized, often because of the catamount—Swiatek and Breen summed up the coin as "an almost unrecognizably idealized Ira Allen, mated with an equally unrecognizably idealized wildcat. We cannot be sure of the species: cougar? panther? puma?" <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> described the reverse as bearing "a large catlike animal of uncertain species, which had nothing to do with the history of Vermont being commemorated but was a <a href="rebus">rebus</a> for the Catamount [Fay's] Tavern, a subtlety lost on just about everyone who saw it". Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the Vermont coin "is spoiled by an excess of lettering on both sides ... It seems superfluous to have to state on the obverse that Ira Allen was 'Founder of Vermont'."

A total of 40,034 Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during January and February 1927, with the excess over the round number reserved for inspection and testing at the 1928 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. They were distributed by local banks, which charged $1 per coin, and they sold principally to Vermonters. The distribution was coordinated by the Bennington Battle Monument and Historical Association of Bennington, Vermont. Four banks in Bennington each received 2,000 coins for distribution, as did four banks in <a href="Rutland%20%28city%29%2C%20Vermont">Rutland</a>. In 1929, the Bennington group was selling the coins by mail at a charge of $1.25 per coin by registered mail and $1 per coin for ten or more if the buyer paid for conveyance by an <a href="express%20mail">express company</a>.

Sales were not as robust as hoped. In November 1928, Spargo wrote to Mint Director Grant, requesting information on how to return several thousand coins, and by 1934, a total of 11,892 pieces had been returned to the Mint for redemption and melting. Profits from the coin went to the Vermont Historical Trust, and were used to benefit museums and historical societies in the state, including the <a href="Bennington%20Museum">Bennington Museum</a>. Swiatek and Breen, alluding to the scandals that embroiled other commemorative coins, noted that "it is a testimony to something or other in Vermont that there was never the faintest breath of suspicion at any time about anything connected with the distribution of the coins."

By 1935, the coins, in <a href="coin%20grading">uncirculated condition</a>, sold for about $2, a price increased by fifty cents during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided to the $2 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, peaking at $825 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980. The 2018 edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2017, lists the coin for between $250 and $750, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $7,344.

Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar

The Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar, sometimes called the Connecticut half dollar, is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1935. The coin was designed by Henry Kreis and commemorates the 300th anniversary of the founding of <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. Its <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts the <a href="Charter%20Oak">Charter Oak</a>, where according to legend Connecticut's charter was hidden to save it from being confiscated by the English governor-general. An eagle appears on the coin's reverse side.

The Connecticut Tercentenary Commission wanted a half dollar issued, with proceeds from its sale to further its projects. A bill passed through Congress without dissent and became law on June 21, 1935, when President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed it, providing for 25,000 half dollars. Kreis's design was a <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a> project and technically in violation of the new law, which said the federal government was not to pay for its design. Nevertheless, the design was approved by the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, and then by the Treasury Department.

The <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> initially coined 15,000 pieces, but when they quickly sold, the Connecticut commission ordered the 10,000 remaining in the authorization. These were soon exhausted as well. Kreis's design has generally been praised by <a href="numismatic">numismatic</a> writers. The coins sold for $1, but have gained in value over the years and sell in the hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.

Although settlers, both English and Dutch, had been drifting in for years before then, 1635 is recognized as the year of the founding of Connecticut, for in that year <a href="John%20Winthrop%20the%20Younger">John Winthrop the Younger</a> was recognized as the first <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20governors%20of%20Connecticut">governor in the future state of Connecticut</a>. No charter was granted at that time, and Connecticut could still have been absorbed into the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a>. Following the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, Winthrop went to England where he was able to secure a <a href="History%20of%20the%20Connecticut%20Constitution%23The%20Connecticut%20Charter%20of%201662">charter for Connecticut</a>, signed by the king, dated May 10, 1662.
Following Charles' death, <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> came to the throne. In 1686, he consolidated the New England colonies into the <a href="Dominion%20of%20New%20England">Dominion of New England</a>, naming Sir <a href="Edmund%20Andros">Edmund Andros</a> as governor-general. The colonial charters were to be revoked, and when Andros came to <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, he planned to take its charter. By legend, when he announced his intent during a meeting on October 31, 1687, the candles in the room were suddenly extinguished, and Joseph Wadsworth bore the document away and hid it in a cavity in the <a href="Charter%20Oak">Charter Oak</a>, a <a href="white%20oak">white oak</a> as old as 1,000 years on the property of the Wyllys family. After the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> of 1688, which overthrew James, the charter was brought forth again. The Charter Oak was uprooted in a storm on the night of August 21, 1856.

In 1935, it was not the practice of the government to sell commemorative coins. Congress, during the <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">early years of commemorative coinage</a>, usually designated a specific organization allowed to buy them at face value and to sell them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar, the enabling legislation specified it was to be the Connecticut Tercentenary Commission, and that the proceeds were to go towards financing the commission's projects.

Legislation for a Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar was introduced in the House of Representatives by that state's <a href="Francis%20T.%20Maloney">Francis T. Maloney</a> on March 26, 1934. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported back from the committee on April 30 by New York's <a href="Andrew%20Somers">Andrew Somers</a> with a one-page report recommending that the bill pass after being amended. The most significant changes were an increase in the authorized mintage from 10,000 to 25,000 and a requirement that the Federal government not be put to any expense in the creation of the models from which dies to strike the coins could be prepared. Thus, the Tercentenary Commission was supposed to pay for a sculptor to design the coin.

The bill was considered by the House of Representatives on May 21, 1934. There was no debate; the only questions were by <a href="William%20D.%20McFarlane">William McFarlane</a> of Texas, asking if the coin would cost the federal government anything and if Connecticut was paying the expenses. Maloney assured him on these points, and the bill passed, as amended. The bill was transmitted to the Senate for its consideration and was referred to its <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Committee on Banking and Currency</a>. On June 1, Connecticut Senator <a href="Frederic%20Walcott">Frederic Walcott</a> reported the bill back to the Senate with a recommendation that it pass, and on June 13, it did so, without any recorded debate or questions. President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed the bill into law on June 21.

The design of the Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar was a <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a> project, and as such was a technical violation of the requirement that the federal government not pay for the design. The Tercentenary Commission hired <a href="Henry%20Kreis">Henry Kreis</a> to do the work, generally supervised by <a href="Paul%20Manship">Paul Manship</a>, a noted medalist. In November 1934, <a href="Samuel%20H.%20Fisher">Samuel H. Fisher</a>, head of the Tercentenary Commission, contacted <a href="Eggerton%20Swartwout">Eggerton Swartwout</a>, who was a member of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. The latter commission was charged by a 1921 executive order by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks, including coins. Swartwout set out the procedure to Fisher and told him that the commission member likely to take the leading role was sculptor <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>. Fisher sent photographs of Kreis's plaster models to Swartwout and Lawrie, as well as to Fine Arts Commission chairman Charles Moore and to Acting Director of the Mint <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a>.

Lawrie had a number of criticisms, feeling the eagle's head and feet were more like those of a hawk and that the stars between the eagle and the name of the country were so small as to be indistinguishable. Swartwout wrote to Moore on the 15th, telling him that the coin was strongly supported by art history Professor <a href="Theodore%20Sizer%20%28art%20historian%29">Theodore Sizer</a> of <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>, a member of the Tercentenary Commission. The Fine Arts Commission viewed the models on December 6 and approved them subject to Lawrie's criticisms being addressed, which they were, for the most part. Lawrie had disliked the broken branch on the right side of the Charter Oak and wanted it changed, but this was not done. The final models were approved by the Fine Arts Commission in early February, and the Treasury Department added its endorsement on February 6. The models were reduced to coin-sized <a href="glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> by the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York; these were shipped to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> and used to make dies with which to strike the coins.

The obverse of the coin depicts the Charter Oak and is based on a painting by <a href="Charles%20DeWolf%20Brownell">Charles DeWolf Brownell</a>, who had begun his work in 1855, a year before lightning felled the tree. Below the ground that surrounds the base of the tree is ; surrounding the Charter Oak are its name, and . The reverse depicts an eagle upon a rocky mound. The name of the country and the denomination of the coin surround the eagle, with to the left of the bird's legs. Thirteen stars lie between the eagle and the lettering, but are so faint as to be invisible on some strikings.

Stuart Mosher, in his 1940 book on commemoratives, described the Connecticut piece as "among the most handsome of the entire series. The very simplicity with which the artist has portrayed the massive oak is pleasing to the most critical." In anticipation of a complaint that the leaves on the oak were proportionately larger than they should be, Professor Sizer had told Swartwout that they needed to be enlarged to show at all, something that Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their 1988 book on commemorative coins, call "perfectly good grounds". The cavity in the oak is also exaggerated in size. <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, in his book on commemorative coins, describes the eagle as being "of starkly modernistic form (somewhat similar to the eagle motifs used in Germany at the time)". Kreis would use a very similar eagle when he designed the 1936 <a href="Bridgeport%20half%20dollar">Bridgeport half dollar</a>.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on the artistry of U.S. coins and medals, stated that Kreis "used the great oak ... as a most effective composition on the obverse, and a massive eagle, thrusting like a rocket, on the reverse". He noted, "all elements of the Connecticut Tercentenary coin blend superbly, the mottos and aphorisms disappearing amid the leafy clusters on the obverse and the balance of the opposite side as successful as for the <a href="Indian%20Head%20eagle">Eagle of 1907</a> (by <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>)".

Initially, only 15,000 of the authorized quantity of 25,000 were struck at the Philadelphia Mint, as this was the quantity the Tercentenary Commission at first ordered. These were struck not later than April 10, 1935, and were sent at the commission's request to the Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, distributing agent for the coin. Placed on sale on April 21, they were rapidly exhausted, and on April 25, Fisher ordered the remaining 10,000. The commission had enquired as to the possibility of having the coins struck at different mints and in <a href="proof%20coin">proof condition</a>, but was told that the heavy volume of work at the Mint forbade having those done. The price per coin was $1. In addition to the coins sent to Hartford, the Mint struck 18 pieces, reserved for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Post%20Office%20Department">United States Post Office Department</a> issued a three-cent stamp for the anniversary on April 26, 1935, also depicting the Charter Oak.
Six banks in Connecticut distributed the coin through their branches, placing them in small boxes that bear the selling bank's name. Mail orders were taken through the Hartford National Bank's Main Street branch. The coins sold mostly to residents of Connecticut; the coin collecting community took only a few thousand. By July 1935, they were sold out but for a few the Tercentenary Commission was reserving for presentation to dignitaries; even those few were apparently gone by September. According to Q. David Bowers, "there was never any problem concerning profiteering, exploitation, or anything else connected with this issue". Swiatek, in his later book on commemoratives, noted, "the Connecticut Tercentenary Commission did a fantastic job in distributing a large percentage of this issue to Connecticut residents."

The coins quickly commanded a premium after their 1935 issue, rising to $6 during the commemorative coin boom of 1936. They had subsided back to the $2.50 level by 1940, but thereafter increased steadily in value, rising to $730 during the second commemorative coin boom in 1980.

Hudson Sesquicentennial half dollar

The Hudson, New York, Sesquicentennial half dollar, sometimes called the Hudson Sesquicentennial half dollar, is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1935. The coin was designed by <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>. Its <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts the "<a href="Halve%20Maen">Half Moon</a>", flagship of <a href="Henry%20Hudson">Henry Hudson</a>, after whom the city of <a href="Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Hudson</a> is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with <a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">Neptune</a> riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.

Although the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.

Most of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase in the 80-plus years since it was struck.

<a href="Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Hudson, New York</a>, the seat of <a href="Columbia%20County%2C%20New%20York">Columbia County</a>, lies on the east bank of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, south of <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing. Originally a trading post for the <a href="Manor%20of%20Rensselaerswyck">Rensselaer family</a>, it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s, and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents.

In 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson.

A bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman <a href="Philip%20A.%20Goodwin">Philip A. Goodwin</a> on April 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. Goodwin was the longtime president of the <a href="Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York">Greene County</a> Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson. A report was issued by Missouri's <a href="John%20J.%20Cochran">John J. Cochran</a>, acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands. On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20half%20dollar">Old Spanish Trail half dollar</a>, it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the "<a href="Congressional%20Record">Congressional Record</a>".

The bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator <a href="Robert%20F.%20Wagner">Robert F. Wagner</a> issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended. When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's <a href="Jesse%20H.%20Metcalf">Jesse H. Metcalf</a> moved to amend it so that the bill would also provide for the issuance of a <a href="Rhode%20Island%20Tercentenary%20half%20dollar">Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar</a>. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate.

Because the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments, and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of "probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement".

On the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28city%20planner%29">Charles Moore</a>, chairman of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore suggested <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a> as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>, <a href="Paul%20Manship">Paul Manship</a>, <a href="Francis%20H.%20Packer">Francis H. Packer</a> and <a href="Chester%20Beach">Chester Beach</a>. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if <a href="John%20Flanagan%20%28sculptor%29">John Flanagan</a>, who had recently designed the <a href="Washington%20quarter">Washington quarter</a>, would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.

Wise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of <a href="Henry%20Hudson">Henry Hudson</a> on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other. Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the "<a href="Halve%20Maen">Half Moon</a>", would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>, the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau</a> a week later.

The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> of the coin shows the "<a href="Halve%20Maen">Half Moon</a>", Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the <a href="Cargo%20ship">merchantman</a>'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust"></a>" and , and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, , may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with <a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">Neptune</a> holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">triton</a> in the background blows into a conch shell. The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> from the ocean. The motto ("Both the honor and the reward of the righteous") is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with <a href="E%20pluribus%20unum"></a> above the dates.

<a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as "a rather whimsical composition"; Beach had deemed it "rather amusing" and had hoped the new coins "will be a little more interesting than the others I have done". Swiatek and Breen referenced "the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'." They suggested that the position of the moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse "straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars", though he found the name "" beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse. The reverse based on the city seal was to him "a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi–federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792". Vermeule noted "the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name".

On June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a>, the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it. But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and <a href="registered%20mail">registered mail</a> fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called "[i]nfuriated collectors" that the coins were sold out. Coin dealer Julius Gruttag, of New York City's Gruttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, with Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, believed to have bought 1,000. In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>.

The uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the <a href="Daniel%20Boone%20Bicentennial%20half%20dollar">Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar</a> came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980. The 2017 edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition. A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.

California Pacific International Exposition half dollar

The California Pacific International Exposition half dollar, sometimes called the California Pacific half dollar or the San Diego half dollar, is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1935 and 1936. <a href="Robert%20I.%20Aitken">Robert I. Aitken</a> designed the coin. Its <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a> and other elements of the <a href="Seal%20of%20California">Seal of California</a>; the reverse shows buildings from the <a href="California%20Pacific%20International%20Exposition">California Pacific International Exposition</a> (held 1935–1936), which the coin was issued to honor.

Legislation for the half dollar moved through Congress without opposition in early 1935, and Aitken was hired to design it. Once his creation was approved, the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> produced 250,000 coins, but expected sales did not materialize. Left with over 180,000 pieces they could not sell, the Exposition Commission went back to Congress for further legislation so it could return the unsold pieces and have new coins, dated 1936, hoping for greater sales in the second year of the fair's run. Although the Commission was successful in getting the legislation passed, it was less so in selling the coins, and 150,000 1936-dated pieces were returned to the Mint. The coins, of either date, sell in the low hundreds of dollars today.

The <a href="California%20Pacific%20International%20Exposition">California Pacific International Exposition</a> was a <a href="world%27s%20fair">world's fair</a> held in San Diego's <a href="Balboa%20Park%20%28San%20Diego%29">Balboa Park</a> in 1935 and 1936. One of the largest expositions of its kind, it was held on of land, and cost $20 million. The fair attracted some 3.75 million visitors during its two-year run.

At that time, <a href="commemorative%20coin">commemorative coin</a>s were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and sell them to the public at a premium. In the case of the California Pacific Exposition half dollar, it was the California Pacific International Exposition Co.

California's <a href="George%20Burnham">George Burnham</a> introduced a bill for a California Pacific Exposition half dollar into the House of Representatives on February 19, 1935. It was referred to the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Coinage%2C%20Weights%2C%20and%20Measures">Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures</a>. <a href="John%20J.%20Cochran">John J. Cochran</a> of Missouri, acting chairman of that committee, reported back to the House on April 12 with the recommendation that it pass after small technical amendments were made. The bill called for the issuance of a maximum of 250,000 half dollars. Cochran noted that Congressman Burnham had appeared before the committee, representing that there would be no expense to the government, and sent a letter (reproduced in the report) stating the same. Burnham had also written that the Exposition had considerable participation by the federal government, and its officials expected 7 to 10 million people to attend. The following day, Cochran had the bill considered by the House, which passed the recommended amendment and then the bill itself without any debate.

The Senate received the bill on April 15, and referred to its <a href="U.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Banking and Currency Committee</a>. On April 23, the committee, through its chairman, <a href="Duncan%20U.%20Fletcher">Duncan U. Fletcher</a> of Florida, recommended that the bill pass, with a report similar to that of the House. On April 26, the bill passed the Senate on Fletcher's motion without any discussion or dissent. President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed it on May 3, 1935.

California Senator <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a>, former Secretary of the Treasury under <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, wrote to the incumbent Treasury Secretary, <a href="Henry%20Morgenthau%20Jr.">Henry Morgenthau</a>, proposing that the late president appear on the half dollar; Morgenthau wrote back calling the idea "interesting" and suggested it be directed to the Exposition Commission, which was responsible for securing designs. The January 1935 issue of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" (the journal of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>), which went to press before the congressional actions, reported that there were plans for 50,000 silver dollar and 150,000 half dollar coins depicting President Roosevelt.

Sculptor <a href="Robert%20Ingersoll%20Aitken">Robert Aitken</a>, creator of other commemorative coins including the $50 <a href="Panama-Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama-Pacific issue</a>, was hired to design the California Pacific half dollar. He submitted plaster models to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>, charged by a 1921 executive order by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with making recommendations regarding public artworks, including coins. Commission sculptor-member <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a> took the lead in examining the models, and they were approved on July 5, 1935, though Lawrie questioned the legality of having coins omitting the mottoes and . Aitken subsequently added to the obverse. After final approval, the models were shipped to the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York for reduction to coin-sized <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a>, which were then sent to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>, where the working dies were made. These dies were in turn were shipped to the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>.
Aitken's obverse shows elements of the <a href="California%20State%20Seal">California State Seal</a> with a seated depiction of <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>. She wears a helmet and holds a staff with her right hand, her left rests on a shield with on it. On the shield is an <a href="aegis">aegis</a>, with the head of <a href="Medusa">Medusa</a> affixed; between goddess and shield is a <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a> overflowing with produce, symbolic of California's vast resources. A <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> is to the left of Minerva. Behind them, in the distance, is a sailing ship and gold miner, with the hills of the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Mountains%20%28California%29">Sierra Madre</a> as background. The name of the issuing country and the denomination surround the central design, with under Minerva. The reverse shows two buildings constructed for the Exposition, and part of the California State Buildings at the fair, the California Tower and Chapel of St. Francis (today the <a href="San%20Diego%20Museum%20of%20Man">San Diego Museum of Man</a>). The outline which surrounds the buildings is said to suggest <a href="Spanish%20Mission%20architecture">Spanish Mission architecture</a> but Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their book on commemorative coins, identify it as a <a href="tressure">tressure</a>, found on a some medieval gold coins. The name of the exposition surrounds the design, with the date, (under which the <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> is found) and among the buildings.
Numismatic author <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> called the half dollar "a very distinguished coin artistically," and said of its reverse, "I cannot think of another architectural motif that has been treated so successfully on a United States coin." Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> liked the California Pacific half dollar, deeming the Minerva "one of the most powerful uses of the facing figure in American numismatic art". He deemed Aitken's design influenced by the pediments and other works he had sculpted during the 1920s and 1930s, including the pediment for the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court%20Building">United States Supreme Court Building</a>. He felt the depiction of the buildings on the reverse was "good enough for what it pretends to show," and noted that the monogrammatic style of the artist's initials was imitated by <a href="Gilroy%20Roberts">Gilroy Roberts</a> when signing his obverse of the <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a> (1964). Vermeule noted that the lettering "confirms the strength and balance of the total visual experience".

250,132 coins were minted in San Francisco in August 1935. 132 were sent to Philadelphia and held for inspection and testing at the 1936 annual meeting of the <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The 250,000 remaining coins were sent from San Francisco to the <a href="Bank%20of%20America">Bank of America</a> branch in San Diego, which handled distribution, and placed on sale at the fair on August 12 at $1 each. Despite considerable publicity, only some 68,000 sold, 2,000 being held by the Exposition authorities.

Although commemorative coin collecting (and investing) was becoming popular in 1935, the mintage of a quarter million coins, far in excess of some other issues of the era, meant that investors were indifferent to the California Pacific issue. With sales of the 1935–S half dollar coming to a standstill, the Exposition Commission was well aware of this problem. Thus, they sought relief from Congress in the form of an act allowing them to return unsold half dollars for new ones, dated 1936. Coin collectors would view this as a new <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23V">variety</a> and possibly buy both, and melting the returned coins would decrease the supply and (hopefully) increase the attractiveness of the remaining 1935-S specimens.
Accordingly, on January 6, 1936, Congressman Burnham introduced legislation to accomplish this. On February 17, the committee reported back through New York's <a href="Andrew%20Somers">Andrew Somers</a>, noting that the bill provided that the exchange would take place without expense to the United States, and recommending that it pass. When Burnham brought the matter to the House floor on March 16, Michigan's <a href="Jesse%20Wolcott">Jesse Wolcott</a> asked how the exchange would be done without expense to the government, and Burnham affirmed that the Exposition Commission would meet all expenses. He explained that the coins had been received so late in the year there had not been time to sell many. There were no further questions, and the bill passed the House without objection.

The Senate committee reported on April 17, adding provisions requiring that the coins be dated 1936, regardless of when struck, and that they be produced at only one mint, chosen by the Director of the Mint, in line with other commemorative coin bills that committee had been reporting. Early numismatic author David M. Bullowa noted these provisions, designed to prevent the creation of varieties, were thus inserted in a bill that itself created a new variety. The Senate considered the bill on April 24, and it was amended and passed without debate or opposition. As the two versions passed were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where, on April 27, that body at Burnham's motion, without debate or opposition, agreed to the Senate amendments. President Roosevelt signed the bill on May 6.

<a href="G.%20Aubrey%20Davidson">G. Aubrey Davidson</a>, chairman of the Exposition Commission, wrote to Acting Director of the Mint <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> on May 16, 1936, asking that the coins (which were to be struck at the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a> and bear its mint mark "D") be minted as quickly as possible, as heavy attendance was expected at the fair around <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> at the end of May. The production at the Denver Mint made the California Pacific half dollar the first commemorative to be struck at San Francisco and at Denver, but not at Philadelphia. It is the only pre-1954 commemorative with that distinction. A total of 180,092 of the 1936-D were produced, representing the number returned (the maximum allowed) plus 92 assay coins. The new coins were placed on sale at $1.50 each.
There was a spike in prices for many commemorative coins in 1936, but due to the relatively high mintages of both the 1935-S and 1936-D, the California Pacific coins sold badly, and when the Exposition closed in late 1936, fewer than 30,000 of the 1936-D had been sold. On January 27, 1937, Davidson wrote to the Director of the Mint, <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, asking her to allow the return of some 150,000 coins for refund, the glut blamed on having a relatively short period to sell them. Once the Mint had granted permission, the Exposition Commission placed the 1935-S and 1936-D pieces it withheld from the melting pot on sale at $3 each. Swiatek, in his 2012 volume on commemoratives, stated that the price increase was "to create the appearance of demand and future rarity. This didn't work."

In 1938, Emil Klicka, treasurer of the Exposition, offered the 1936-D for sale at $1 each, with a limit of ten. The 1935-S coins were available at $2. Large hoards of both dates were held by insiders for decades, including one holding of 31,050 of the 1935-S, amounting to nearly half the extant mintage. These were gradually dispersed from the 1960s to the 1980s. In 1962, the 1935-S was worth $9 in <a href="uncirculated%20coin">uncirculated</a> condition, and the 1936-D was worth $11. The edition of the "Red Book" ("<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>") published in 2018 lists the 1935-S for between $100 and $160, depending on condition, with the 1936-D from between $100 and $225. A near-pristine 1935-S sold at auction in 2014 for $4,994.

Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar

The Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar (sometimes called the Providence, Rhode Island, Tercentenary half dollar) is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">fifty-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1936. The coin was designed by <a href="John%20Howard%20Benson">John Howard Benson</a> and Arthur Graham Carey. Its obverse depicts <a href="Roger%20Williams">Roger Williams</a>, founder of the <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>. It was intended to honor the 300th anniversary of <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, although it bears no mention of the city.

Members of Rhode Island's congressional delegation sought a coin for the 300th anniversary of Providence, and Senator <a href="Jesse%20Metcalf">Jesse Metcalf</a> added authorization for one to a bill for another commemorative coin that had already passed the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. The amended bill was approved by both houses of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a>, and it was signed by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. A total of 50,000 coins were struck at the three mints then in operation.

The coins went on sale on March 5, 1936, and the quantity made available to the public sold out in a matter of hours. Rhode Island insiders were holding back quantities for later sale once prices rose. That conduct incensed coin collectors, and the abuses led Congress to move toward banning commemorative coins. The coins are listed for hundreds of dollars today, depending on condition.

<a href="Roger%20Williams">Roger Williams</a> was born in Britain around 1603. He was ordained as a minister, became a <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a>, and moved to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> where he became the minister of the church in <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>. Colonial authorities began to take issue with some of the teachings that he imparted to his congregation, such as the separation of church and state and fair dealings when purchasing land from American Indians. He was banished from the colony in 1635, and attempts were made to send him back to Europe. Instead, he escaped on foot and found refuge with <a href="Massasoit">Massasoit</a>, sachem of the <a href="Narragansett%20people">Narragansett people</a>. He bought a parcel of land from Massasoit in 1636 and established <a href="Providence%20Plantations">Providence Plantations</a>. Providence Plantations eventually merged with settlements on <a href="Aquidneck%20Island">Rhode Island</a> to form the <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>, which became the State of <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a>.

A committee was established in 1931 to mark the tercentenary of Williams' founding of Providence. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> claim in their volume on commemoratives that the moving forces behind the Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar were Senators <a href="Jesse%20H.%20Metcalf">Jesse H. Metcalf</a> and <a href="Peter%20Gerry">Peter Gerry</a> and Representative <a href="John%20Matthew%20O%27Connell">John Matthew O'Connell</a>, all of whom applied political pressure to authorize the coin. In 1936, commemorative coins were not sold by the government. Congress usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value from the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> and sell them to the public at a premium, and the Providence Tercentenary Commission was chartered for the Tercentenary coin.

A bill had passed the House of Representatives on April 3, 1935 for a <a href="Hudson%20Sesquicentennial%20half%20dollar">Hudson Sesquicentennial half dollar</a>, and it had been recommended for passage in the Senate by the Committee on Banking and Currency. When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Senator Metcalf moved to amend it to provide for a Providence Tercentenary half dollar to be issued, as well. There was no objection or debate, and the bill passed the Senate. It was then returned to the House of Representatives which agreed to the Senate amendments, and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>.

John Howard Benson was one of the artists who designed the coin, and he wrote a letter to <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a> of the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> on December 12, 1935 which provides information on the design process. Benson related that <a href="Royal%20B.%20Farnum">Royal B. Farnum</a> of the <a href="Rhode%20Island%20School%20of%20Design">Rhode Island School of Design</a> had assigned the coin design to him and Arthur Graham Carey because they had cut dies for small medals.

The Tercentenary Commission's coin committee originally proposed seven stars from an early version of Providence's seal for one side of the new coin, with the anchor from Rhode Island's seal and the state motto "Hope" on the other. Benson told Lawrie that the committee had then changed its mind, wanting to picture Roger Williams on the obverse side being greeted by Narragansetts, and they decided to open the design to a public competition. Benson and Carey persevered, made the changes, and entered the competition—and they were selected.

The Providence artist wrote that he was anxious to receive the opinion of the Fine Arts Commission. Lawrie forwarded the letter to Commission chairman Charles Moore the same day, noting: "I don't know just what his troubles are. ... It won't make a great coin but the models are I think equal to some others we approved." The full Commission approved the designs on December 20, and reductions were made from plaster models to coin-sized <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23H">hubs</a> were by the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York.

The obverse is based on the seal of Providence showing Roger Williams kneeling in a canoe, his hand raised in signal of friendship. The Narragansett Indian who greets him has his hand extended, palm down, meant as a native sign for "good". Behind the Narragansett is a stalk of corn as a reference to the help and friendship which the Indians had shown to the <a href="Mayflower%20Pilgrims">Mayflower Pilgrims</a> in establishing <a href="Plymouth%20Colony">Plymouth Colony</a>. The Bible in Williams' other hand symbolizes the colonists' contribution to America. The sun is rising in the background, symbolic of Rhode Island being the first colony where religious liberty was guaranteed. is the theme of the design and appears over their heads. <a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust"></a>, , and the tercentenary dates surround the scene.

The reverse depicts the Anchor of Hope, taken from Rhode Island's state seal. The motto symbolizes the authority of the state government, while <a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum"></a> evokes that of the federal government, as it is a national motto. The name of the country and the coin's denomination surround the reverse design.

Nowhere on the coin is the name of Providence, which was left off in the final alterations required by the Coin Committee. According to Swiatek, "this issue's obverse does not rate very high among collectors. The image of Roger Williams has the look of a robot from the old <a href="Flash%20Gordon%20serial">Flash Gordon serial</a>." The two designers later became partners in a stonecutting firm in <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>, which accounts for the sculptural look of the coin, according to Swiatek. According to <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, "no significant criticisms were ever mounted of the design". Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> writes that the bands of lettering overwhelm the designs. "Roger Williams in his canoe looks like <a href="Elpenor">Elpenor</a> amid the bulrushes on a Greek vase of about 440 with a scene of the dialogue of Orpheus in the Underworld." He notes that "the Indian and Williams are blocked out with a childlike charm of conceptualism", but "the coat-of-arms is so simple as to defy analysis, or even comment."

A total of 20,000 half dollars arrived in Providence from the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> by February 20, 1936; an additional 15,000 each were expected from the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>s, but they had not been received. Those coins had been struck in January (Philadelphia and Denver) and February (San Francisco) 1936. In addition to the quantities sent to Providence, 13 pieces from Philadelphia, 10 from Denver, and 11 from San Francisco were held at Philadelphia for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>.

Swiatek and Breen noted, "March 5 proved to be a day of immense noise and confusion". The new coins went on sale through various Rhode Island banks amid considerable publicity at $1 per coin, with the Rhode Island Hospital National Bank taking the lead as depository. Out-of-staters could write to Grant's Hobby Shop in Providence, owned by Horace M. Grant, a well-known numismatist. Within hours of the coins going on sale, banks were allegedly out of them, and the issue was supposedly sold out within six hours. Yet ample supplies proved to be available at higher prices from insiders, including Horace Grant.

Low-mintage commemoratives were sometimes held back from sale by the distributor in anticipation of skyrocketing prices in those days, and Grant ran an advertisement in the April 1936 issue of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" offering the coins for $7.50 per set of three by <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a>, or $2.75 individually. By June, he was offering to exchange the Rhode Island half dollars for other coins or sell them for $9 per set of three. On June 24, the Tercentenary Commission announced that it would sell the first 100 from each mint in sets of three by matched numbers, by sealed-bid auction, but none of these sets has been identified.

There was widespread anger among coin collectors, and lawsuits were filed against the commission. Among those who litigated was Texas coin dealer L.W. Hoffecker, but he dropped the suit in exchange for 90 sets of three coins. In the years that followed, he complained to other dealers about the ethics of Grant and the Rhode Island officials. Hoffecker was influential in Congress and complained to Senator Metcalf about the situation. Metcalf suggested another act for another 50,000 coins, but Hoffecker advised against it unless some neutral party handled the distribution, lest they be hoarded. He complained that "every bank in Rhode Island is making a lot of money, instead of distributing the coins".

Congress ended the authorization for outstanding commemorative coin issues in 1939; the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a>, for example, had been issued for over a decade. Hoffecker was elected president of the American Numismatic Association that same year, and he wrote to numismatist Walter P. Nichols in November expressing concerns about Grant's ethics. By then, the Rhode Island Tercentenary Committee had been dissolved, having shown a profit of $24,000 on the 50,000 coins issued. About two-thirds of that went towards a memorial to Roger Williams. The deluxe 2015 edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (the Red Book) notes that the distribution of the coin "was wrapped in controversy—phony news releases reported that the coin was sold out when it was indeed not, and certain dealers procured large amounts at low prices only to resell for tidy profits."

By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $4.50 per set of three, but it then rose steadily and reached $975 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980. The 2017 Red Book lists the coin between $325 and $675 per set of three, depending on condition, with single coins about a third of that. A near-pristine specimen from the San Francisco Mint sold at auction in 2014 for $6,463.

Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar

The Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar was a commemorative <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> designed by <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a> and struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1936, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the 1786 incorporation of <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg, Virginia</a>. The <a href="obverse">obverse</a> of the coin depicts former <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> and U.S. Senator <a href="Carter%20Glass">Carter Glass</a>, a native of Lynchburg. The reverse depicts a statue of the goddess Liberty, with Lynchburg sites behind her, including the <a href="Independent%20city%20%28United%20States%29%23Virginia">city's</a> Confederate monument.

Glass sponsored legislation for the half dollar, which passed Congress without difficulty. The <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> proposed that the coin should bear the portrait of <a href="John%20Lynch%20%281740%E2%80%931820%29">John Lynch</a>, founder of Lynchburg, on the obverse, but no portrait of him was known. Instead, the Lynchburg Sesqui-Centennial Association decided Senator Glass should be on the coin. Despite his opposition, Glass became the third living person to appear on a U.S. coin, and the first to be shown alone. 

The coins sold well when placed on sale in the late summer of 1936, and sales to out-of-towners were limited. The entire issue sold out, with some put aside for the sesquicentennial celebrations in October. Issued for $1, the coins have appreciated over the years, with 2018 estimates of value ranging between $225 and $365, depending on condition.

The Lynchburg Sesqui-Centennial Association desired to have a commemorative <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollar</a> honoring the anniversary of the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a>'s 1786 recognition of Lynchburg as an incorporated municipality; it became a <a href="independent%20city%20%28Virginia%29">city</a> in 1852. In 1936, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization with exclusive rights to purchase them at face value and vend to the public at a premium. In the case of the Lynchburg half dollar, the responsible group would be the Sesqui-Centennial Association.

The year 1936 saw Congress authorize 15 new commemorative coin issues, and pieces authorized in prior years were struck again, dated 1936. That year saw a major boom in commemorative coin prices, and the new issues helped fuel the market. Some of these new issues, like the <a href="Cincinnati%20Musical%20Center%20half%20dollar">Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar</a>, were controlled by insiders for private profit. The Lynchburg piece, on the other hand, would defray the cost of the anniversary celebrations, and was motivated by pride in the city and its history. Lynchburg was a supply center for the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>; a <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> attempt to take the city was beaten back in 1864 by Confederate General <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>. In 1858, <a href="Carter%20Glass">Carter Glass</a>, later <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> and a representative and senator from Virginia, was born there, and lived there in 1936.

Glass introduced the bill for a Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar in the Senate on April 8, 1936; it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 22, <a href="Alva%20B.%20Adams">Alva B. Adams</a> of Colorado reported it back to the Senate. In its report, the committee noted that the bill included the standardized language it advocated because of past commemorative coin abuses: including that they be issued by only one mint and no fewer than 5,000 at a time, have only one design, be struck within a year of enactment, and bear the date 1936 even if struck later. The committee recommended the bill pass. 

On April 24, Adams brought the bill before the Senate, and moved that the authorized quantity of the coins be increased from 10,000 to 20,000. Both the amendment and the bill were agreed to without debate or recorded opposition. The bill then went to the House of Representatives where on May 22, Virginia's <a href="Clifton%20A.%20Woodrum">Clifton A. Woodrum</a> brought it to the floor. <a href="Robert%20F.%20Rich">Robert F. Rich</a> of Pennsylvania, a Republican, took the floor long enough to note that "this is, perhaps, the thirtieth bill of this kind to come in here this session of Congress. It is surely the beginning of Democratic inflation, and I warn the Members of the House to beware." Following laughter and applause, the bill passed without objection, and with the signature of President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> on May 28, 1936, became a law authorizing 20,000 half dollars.

On May 25, 1936, with the Lynchburg bill close to enactment, the secretary of the Sesqui-Centennial Association, Fred McWane, wrote to <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles S. Moore</a>, chairman of the federal <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a>. The commission was charged by a 1921 <a href="executive%20order">executive order</a> by President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins. Moore replied on the 26th, suggesting that the coin should bear the portrait of <a href="John%20Lynch%20%281740%E2%80%931820%29">John Lynch</a>, founder of Lynchburg, on the obverse. McWane replied the following day, stating that there was no known portrait of Lynch, and that the Sesqui-Centennial Association was considering other possible obverses. For the reverse, McWane proposed the city's Memorial Terrace, long the first sight there that greeted visitors arriving by rail.

On June 3, McWane wrote stating that the Sesqui-Centennial Association was considering <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a> and <a href="John%20David%20Brcin">John David Brcin</a> to sculpt the coin; Moore in his reply on the 9th, praised both men, but praised Keck more. Keck had designed the 1915 <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama-Pacific gold dollar</a> and the <a href="Vermont%20Sesquicentennial%20half%20dollar">Vermont Sesquicentennial half dollar</a> in 1927. The Sesqui-Centennial Association took the hint and McWane notified Moore of Keck's hiring on July 1. He also advised Moore that his commission had decided Senator Glass should appear on the obverse.

Glass protested at the idea of his face appearing on a coin, but this was to no avail. He telephoned the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> in the hope a law might forbid himself, as a living person, from appearing on a coin, but was told that none did. The senator stated, "I had hoped there would be an avenue of escape." According to <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins, "though [Glass was] the most influential man in Lynchburg, and honorary president of the Sesquicentennial Association, he found himself hopelessly outvoted". On July 28, <a href="Mary%20Margaret%20O%27Reilly">Mary Margaret O'Reilly</a>, the Assistant Director of the Mint, forwarded Keck's models to the Fine Arts Commission; they were approved the following day. Moore wrote to Glass on the 31st, predicting that the senator's depiction was one "that both your friends and posterity will approve". Keck's models were sent to the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York, which reduced them to coin-sized <a href="Glossary%20of%20numismatics%23D">dies</a>.

The obverse contains a representation of Senator Carter Glass, making the Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half dollar the third U.S. coin to depict a living person, and the first to show one alone—the earlier two, the <a href="Alabama%20Centennial%20half%20dollar">Alabama Centennial half dollar</a> (1921) and the <a href="United%20States%20Sesquicentennial%20coinage">U.S. Sesquicentennial half dollar</a> (1926), depict <a href="jugate">jugate</a> busts of a living person, a governor or president, with a deceased predecessor. Glass also became the first person to have his signature on U.S. currency (during his term as Treasury Secretary) and his portrait on a coin. Having headed the Treasury Department, he was aware of the custom that living people did not appear on U.S. coinage; its waiver in his case did not attract unfavorable criticism, as it was deemed well-deserved. 

The reverse depicts a statue of the goddess <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a>, her arms outstretched in welcome. In the background is seen a portion of Monument Terrace, with the Old <a href="Lynchburg%20Courthouse">Lynchburg Courthouse</a> also depicted. Before the building is the city's Confederate monument. According to Anthony Swiatek in his 2012 volume on commemorative coins, "the Confederacy receives prominent recognition on this coin". Amid the debate over the <a href="Removal%20of%20Confederate%20monuments%20and%20memorials">removal of Confederate monuments</a> in the United States, the question of whether to displace that statue, dedicated in 1900, has been raised, but as of 2017, it remains in place.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on U.S. commemorative coins and medals, deemed Keck's half dollar, "a successful but not startling combination of conservative elements". He described the figure of Liberty on the reverse as "a Greco-Roman, actually Greek imperial, frontal Liberty placed before local landmarks". Vermeule suggested that the tall, thin lettering on the reverse indicates that Keck was less influenced by <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>, under whom he studied, than by <a href="Chief%20Engraver%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Chief Engraver of the United States Mint</a> <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> (served 1880–1917) and his successor <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a> (1917–1925). Further, Vermeule tied Keck's Liberty to coins and medals designed by the two chief engravers, including their work on <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission%23Medals">medals for the Assay Commission</a>. He concluded that Keck's "style, as manifest in the Lynchburg Sesquicentennial half-dollar, was a recollection of the fashions perpetuated by Barber and Morgan".

In September 1936, the Philadelphia Mint struck 20,000 Lynchburg half dollars, plus 13 extra that would be held for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. The new coins came on the market during the price boom in commemorative coins, and readily sold at a price of $1 each. There was an order limit of 10 per person, though this might be waived if there was a written explanation. Orders were accepted in advance, and the August 1936 issue of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" (the journal of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>) contained a statement from the Sesqui-Centennial Association that orders for 2,000 had been received. Once 15,000 had been sold, the remainder was held to allow local residents the opportunity to buy them. On September 2, McWane wrote to a potential out-of-state buyer stating that they had all been purchased. They were formally placed on sale on September 21. Some were put aside for sale at the sesquicentennial celebration, held in Lynchburg from October 12 to 16, where they sold, mainly to local residents.

The coins increased in price after 1936, their value helped by the wide distribution of the mintage, with no known hoards. By 1940, the value in uncirculated condition was $2, and by 1970 $40. At the height of the later commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $550, dropping back to $375 by 1985. The deluxe edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", published in 2018, lists the coin for between $225 and $365, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold in 2008 for $4,830.

Baltimore railroad strike of 1877

The Baltimore railroad strike of 1877 involved several days of work stoppage and violence in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, in 1877. It formed a part of the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike%20of%201877">Great Railroad Strike of 1877</a>, during which widespread civil unrest spread nationwide following the <a href="Long%20Depression">global depression</a> and economic downturns of the mid-1870s. Strikes broke out along the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (B&O) on July 16, the same day that 10% wage reductions were scheduled.

Violence erupted in Baltimore on July 20, with police and soldiers of the <a href="Maryland%20Army%20National%20Guard">Maryland National Guard</a> clashing with crowds of thousands gathered throughout the city. In response, President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> ordered federal troops to Baltimore, local officials recruited 500 additional police, and two new national guard regiments were formed. Peace was restored on July 22. Between 10 and 22 were killed, more than 150 were injured, and many more were arrested.

Negotiations between strikers and the B&O were unsuccessful, and most strikers quit rather than return to work at the newly reduced wages. The company easily found enough workers to replace the strikers, and under the protection of the military and police, traffic resumed on July 29. The company promised minor concessions at the time, and eventually enacted select reforms later that year.

The <a href="Long%20Depression">Long Depression</a>, sparked in the United States by the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, had extensive implications for US industry, closing more than a hundred railroads in the first year and cutting construction of new rail lines from of track in 1872 to in 1875. Approximately 18,000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875, production in <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="steel">steel</a> dropped as much as 45 percent, and a million or more lost their jobs. In 1876, 76 railroad companies went bankrupt or entered <a href="receivership">receivership</a> in the US alone, and the economic impacts rippled throughout many <a href="economic%20sector">economic sector</a>s throughout the industrialized world.

In mid-1877, tensions erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would become known as the <a href="Great%20Railroad%20Strike">Great Railroad Strike</a> or the Great Strikes. Violence began in <a href="Martinsburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Martinsburg, West Virginia</a> and spread along the rail lines through <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> and on to several major cities and <a href="Transport%20hub">transportation hubs</a> of the time, including <a href="Reading%20Railroad%20massacre">Reading</a>, <a href="Scranton%20General%20Strike">Scranton</a> and <a href="1877%20Shamokin%20uprising">Shamokin</a>, Pennsylvania; a bloodless <a href="1877%20St.%20Louis%20general%20strike">general strike in St. Louis, Missouri</a>; and a short lived <a href="Chicago%20railroad%20strike%20of%201877">uprising in Chicago, Illinois</a>. In the worst case, <a href="Pittsburgh%20railway%20riots">rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a> left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand <a href="Railroad%20car">rail cars</a> destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of <a href="Trade%20union">organized labor</a> attracted the masses of discontented and unemployed workers spawned by the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the turmoil as it spread along the rail lines from city to city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.

In early July 1877, the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (B&O) announced it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings of railroad employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.

Most workers accepted the reduction in pay, but the <a href="Fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">firemen</a> and those who ran the <a href="Rail%20freight%20transport">freight trains</a> resolved to stop work in protest. The number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing to the ongoing economic problems, that the company had no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.

On July 16, the day the reduction was to go into effect, about 40 men gathered at Camden Junction, from Baltimore, and stopped traffic. Newspapers reported a meeting held by rail workers who were sympathetic to the strike, which by that day included <a href="brakemen">brakemen</a> and <a href="Railroad%20engineer">engineers</a> as well as firemen.

That same day in Baltimore, hundreds of manufacturing workers declared a strike, and the box-makers and sawyers walked out, demanding a ten percent increase in wages. Newspaper reports counted 140 of the union's 180 members who went on strike. <a href="Tin%20can">Tin can</a> makers in the city had already been striking for higher wages for a week at this point, and their number amounted to 800, while not more than 100 can makers in the city remained at work according to reports by "The Sun".

At around 2:00am on July 17, the first act of violence in Baltimore emerged. According to the newspaper reports the following day, a westbound train was thrown from the tracks at a <a href="Railroad%20switch">switch</a> in a suburb south of the city. The switch had been opened and locked by an unknown person. The <a href="Locomotive">engine</a> caught fire, and the engineer and the fireman aboard were severely injured.

That afternoon violence broke out in Martinsburg, West Virginia, between workers and militia guarding a train, prompting the governor of West Virginia to appeal to the President for aid. Strikers occupied stations at <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland, Maryland</a>; <a href="Grafton%2C%20West%20Virginia">Grafton, West Virginia</a>; <a href="Keyser%2C%20West%20Virginia">Keyser, West Virginia</a>, and elsewhere, and halted the movement of freight. Newspaper reports counted 400–500 men who had joined the rail strike, and in Martinsburg, 75 trains with 1,200 rail cars sat idle.

That day, "The Sun" reported the situation in the city:

One by one the shops have become wholly or partly silent, and very many men, especially in South Baltimore, are without work or the means of providing for their families. This state of affairs is confined not alone to railroad shops, but to other workshops, and a great deal of distress exists among the workingmen of all kinds.

On July 18, the railroad strikers in Baltimore printed and circulated a list of their grievances:

They had submitted to three reductions of wages in three years; that they would have acquiesced in a moderate reduction; that they were frequently sent out on a trip to Martinsburg, and there detained four days at the discretion of the company, for which detention they were allowed pay but two day's time; that they were compelled to pay their board during the time they were detained, which was more than the wages they received; that they had nothing left with which to support their families; that it was a question of bread with them; that when times were dull on the road they could not get more than fifteen day's work in a month; that many sober, steady economical men became involved in debt last winter; that honest men had their wages attached because they could not meet their expenses; that by a rule of the company any man who had his wages attached should be discharged; that this was a tyranny to which no rational being should submit, and that it was utterly impossible for a man with a family to support himself and family at the reduced rate of wages.

By the end of July 19, the strike had spread through major cities from Baltimore to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. It involved multiple rail companies, and had grown to include a variety of mechanics, artisans, and other laborers. General violence threatened to break out in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> and the city was <a href="blockade">blockade</a>d.

Numerous meetings and conferences of discontented workers continued across the country. A committee representing the strikers (including engineers, <a href="Conductor%20%28rail%29">conductors</a>, firemen, and brakemen) departed Baltimore to ensure solidarity along the line in demanding $2 per day. According to the edition of July 20 of "The Sun", the city was peaceful, but anxious, as many awaited word of the happenings in Martinsburg, which was seen as the central point of the movement.

By Friday, July 20, about 250 trains sat idle in Baltimore as a result of the strike. <a href="John%20W.%20Garrett">John W. Garrett</a>, president of the B&O, requested that Maryland Governor <a href="John%20Lee%20Carroll">John Lee Carroll</a> move state troops from Baltimore to Cumberland, where the situation had deteriorated. At 4:00pm Brigadier General <a href="James%20R.%20Herbert">James R. Herbert</a> was ordered by Governor Carroll to muster the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments, Maryland National Guard, to their respective <a href="National%20Guard%20Armory">armories</a> in preparation. With the knowledge that groups of workers had been dispersed along the lines to impede traffic, including the movement of troops, he issued a simultaneous declaration to the people of the state:

I ... by virtue of the authority vested in me, do hereby issue this my proclamation, calling upon all citizens of this State to abstain from acts of lawlessness, and aid lawful authorities in the maintenance of peace and order.

Crowds gathered at four different points in the city, and along the route it was believed the soldiers would take in order to embark on their trains. Mayor <a href="Ferdinand%20Claiborne%20Latrobe">Ferdinand Latrobe</a> issued a proclamation, reciting the <a href="Militia%20Acts%20of%201792">riot act</a> and ordering the crowds to disperse, but to no effect. He later sent correspondence to the governor, asking that the garrison not be taken from the city given the current state of affairs. Police commissioners ordered the closing of all <a href="bar">bar</a>rooms and saloons.

At 6:35pm, as many workers in the city were finishing their <a href="Shift%20work">shifts</a>, the alarm was sounded to gather the troops of the 5th and 6th Regiments. This was the first time such an alarm had been used in the city, and it caused a great deal of excitement, and attracted yet more citizens into the streets to witness events.

Between 135 and 250 men of the <a href="175th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Regiment</a>, <a href="Maryland%20Army%20National%20Guard">Maryland National Guard</a> mustered at their armory on the corner of Fifth and Front streets. Each man was equipped with full uniform, a Springfield <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech loading rifle</a>, and twenty rounds of ammunition. At 7:00pm the group began its march toward <a href="Camden%20Station">Camden Station</a>, with the intention to board a train to Cumberland.

Onlookers had gathered to watch the procession, and the soldiers were attacked on <a href="Eutaw%20Street">Eutaw Street</a> by crowds throwing bricks and stones. No serious damage was done, and they continued until again, on Eutaw near Camden Street, they were stopped by the crowd, who injured several with their missiles.

The order was given and the group formed up across the entire street, from curb to curb. They fixed <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a>s and advanced. Shots were fired at the troops, but they successfully moved through the crowd and into the station.

Around 6:30pm the soldiers of the 6th Regiment began assembling. Their armory, located on Front Street across from the <a href="Phoenix%20Shot%20Tower">Phoenix Shot Tower</a>, consisted of the second and third floors of a warehouse, with the only exit being a narrow stairway through which no more than two men could walk abreast.

The men were met with jeers by a crowd of 2,000 to 4,000. This escalated into <a href="Pavement%20%28architecture%29">paving</a> stones thrown through the door and windows of the building. Soldiers who subsequently arrived were beaten and driven away. Additional police were sent for in hopes of clearing the way and <a href="Relief%20%28military%29">relieving</a> the troops of the need to use force against the crowd, but those who arrived were unable to effect any order, and were forced to shelter in the armory along with the soldiers.

Shortly after 8:00pm, Colonel Peters ordered three companies of 120 men of the 6th to move as commanded by the governor and General Herbert to Camden Station. As they exited, they were assaulted by stones from the crowd, believing those of the 6th Regiment were armed only with <a href="Blank%20%28cartridge%29">blank cartridges</a>. The troops returned fire, with live ammunition as they were equipped, and the frightened crowd retreated west across Fayette Street Bridge.

Given the ongoing clashes, the men of the 6th Regiment, Company B, being the last of the formation to leave the armory, marched south, by way of Front Street, and then west along Baltimore Street, in order to avoid the crowds.

The crowd regained their resolve and, as the body marched near Harrison and Frederick streets, they were attacked in the rear and made to halt by the pressing of the crowd. Without orders, some soldiers fired on the crowd, killing one and wounding between one and three. The crowd shrank back and the soldiers were allowed continue until they had advanced to the offices of the "<a href="Baltimore%20American">Baltimore American</a>" newspaper, near Holliday Street, where an order was given to halt and two <a href="Volley%20fire">volleys</a> fired into the crowd. They were forced to halt a third time as they turned onto <a href="Charles%20Street%20%28Baltimore%29">Charles Street</a>, and again fired on the crowd near <a href="Maryland%20Route%202">Light Street</a>. There two men and one boy were killed. From there they followed Charles to Camden Street and on to the station.

Around 8:30pm, the men of the 5th and 6th regiments met at Camden Station along with about 200 police officers. As reported by "The Sun", Governor Carroll and Mayor Latrobe were present at the station, along with B&O vice president King, General Herbert and his staff, and a number of police commissioners. Here they decided that conditions were too dangerous to send any troops away to Cumberland.

The train intended for the transportation of the troops consisted of 11 cars, and the engine was steamed and ready for departure. The crowd fell upon the engine, assailing it with stones, disabling it, and driving off both its engineer and fireman. At 9:15pm another train was sent down the tracks by some from the crowd, with no one aboard, to wreck itself into yet another train. According to "The Sun", the tracks were torn up from Lee Street, along Ohio Avenue to Cross Street, as well as elsewhere in the suburbs. By 10:00pm the mob that had gathered at the station, and filled the streets for several blocks, numbered as many as 15,000.

The soldiers and police worked to keep the mob at bay, and drove them to the far end of the station near Lee Street. There the mob assailed the buildings of the depot with stones. At 10:30pm the rioters set fire to passenger cars, the <a href="Train%20dispatcher">dispatcher</a>'s office, and the <a href="Railway%20roundhouse">roundhouse</a>. Some firefighters dispatched to the scene were driven off, and others had their hoses cut when they attempted to set up their pumps, but, under the protection of the police and soldiers, the flames were extinguished. "The Sun" reported the fires damaged one passenger car and engine, destroyed the dispatcher's office, and damaged the roof of the depot's shed. Two subsequent fires were started in the south of the city, but were dealt with without major damage.
That night Governor Carroll requested federal assistance from President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, convinced that the state forces were insufficient. Hayes ordered General <a href="William%20Farquhar%20Barry">William Barry</a>, commander at <a href="Fort%20McHenry">Fort McHenry</a>, to hold all available forces in readiness.

The men of the 5th and 6th stayed at the depot throughout the night and into the next morning. If any needed to leave, they did so in civilian clothes and unarmed, for fear of the crowd should they be discovered to be a member of the militia. Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.

Sources differ on the total casualties that day. By Stover's account, only 59 men of the 6th reached their destination, and the group suffered 10 killed, more than 20 seriously wounded, and several dozen more with minor injuries. By Stowell's account, only one militiaman was killed, but as many as half of their number <a href="Desertion">deserted</a> along the march. In their struggle to enter Camden Station, the 5th suffered 16 to 24 injuries, but none seriously wounded or killed. Between 9 and 12 civilians were killed, and 13-40 injured.

Through the early hours of that Saturday, July 21, many from the 6th Regiment deserted, until only 11 were left, who were then incorporated into the ranks of the 5th. As Governor Carroll recalled: "... the slender force at my command was incompetent to protect the city, or to carry a sense of security to those who had a right be secured ..." That morning, all business remained suspended. The bars in Baltimore remained closed, and a guard of soldiers and police protected workers as they set about the task of repairing the tracks and restoring the station to operating order. Toward nightfall, a battery of artillery was stationed at the depot.

President Hayes released a proclamation in which he admonished:

all good citizens ... against aiding, countenancing, abetting or taking part in such unlawful proceedings, and I do hereby warn all persons engaged in or connected with said domestic violence and obstruction of the laws to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes on or before twelve o'clock noon of the 22d day of July

After dark, a mob of 2,500–3,000 gathered at Camden Station, jeering the soldiers. The crowd grew increasingly restless until the soldiers guarding the area around the depot were again assaulted with stones and pistol fire. The sentinels were called in, the soldiers assembled, and the command given to "Load, ready, aim!" at the mob was given. The crowd, by then familiar with what was likely to follow, dispersed, and the regiment was not ordered to fire. On Eutaw Street, where the sentinels had remained, the men fixed bayonets, and briefly struggled with the crowd as they attempted and failed to break the <a href="Line%20%28formation%29">line</a>.
Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm the guards enacted a strategy whereby the police officers, backed by the bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm the area around the station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.

At the <a href="foundry">foundry</a> near the Carey Street Bridge, a crowd of more than 100 gathered and threatened to set fire to the area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired over the heads of the crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B&O transportation barge at <a href="Fell%27s%20Point%2C%20Baltimore">Fell's Point</a>. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining <a href="garrison">garrison</a> there.

Just before midnight, 120–135 marines arrived at the station and reported to the governor, who ordered them to set about capturing the leaders of the mob. Governor Carroll telegraphed and advised President Hayes that order had been restored in the city.
Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, the peace was again broken and fire alarms began to ring throughout the city. To the west, at the <a href="Mount%20Clare%20Shops">Mount Clare Shops</a> of the B&O, a 37-car train of coal and oil had been set on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those burning, and by the time the flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned. Between $11,000 and $12,000 in damage was sustained.

At 4:00am another alarm sounded: the <a href="planing%20mill">planing mill</a>s and <a href="lumber%20yard">lumber yard</a> of J. Turner & Cate near the <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Wilmington%20and%20Baltimore%20Railroad">Philadelphia Wilmington & Baltimore</a> rail depot, had been set on fire. The entire property, extending over a full city block, was destroyed. Realizing the severity of the situation, the firefighters concentrated their efforts on trying to save the surrounding structures.

According to news reports, the first passenger trains left the city at 9:00am, and continued running throughout the day. Around 10:00am, General <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">W. S. Hancock</a> arrived and was followed by 360–400 federal troops from New York and Fort Monroe, who relieved those guarding Camden Station. They brought with them two <a href="Canon%20obusier%20de%2012">12 pounder</a> artillery pieces. From that point on, the men of the 5th and the federal troops took turns guarding the station.
Around noon, General <a href="Henry%20Larcom%20Abbot">Henry Abbot</a> arrived at President Street with a battalion of 99 to 114 engineers. As the group advanced toward the armory of the 6th Regiment where they were to be quartered, they were met by a crowd of 500. Jeers from the crowd turned to missiles until one soldier, Private Corcoran, was struck in the head and wounded. Abbot gave orders that his men were to halt and fix bayonets, at which point the crowd scattered.

Throughout the day and the previous, as many as 500 new special police were sworn in, doubling the size of the police force. Each was provided with a <a href="Badge">star</a>, a <a href="revolver">revolver</a> and <a href="espantoon">espantoon</a>. The recently arrived regulars brought the garrison of federal troops in the city to between 700 and 800. The vessels <a href="USS%20Powhatan%20%281850%29">"Powhatan"</a> and <a href="USS%20Swatara%20%281873%29">"Swatara"</a> had also been ordered to the city, along with their 500 marines.

News reports recalled court held that day in the southern district, where 195 charges of riot and 17 charges of drunkenness were resolved. That night the city was quiet. A telegram was dispatched from Adjutant General <a href="Edward%20D.%20Townsend">Edward D. Townsend</a> to General Hancock, who had just arrived in the city earlier that day. He was directed to move his men to Pittsburgh, where riots were ongoing.

Following the cessation of open violence, the city set about forming two new regiments of national guard to expand available forces. The local news recounted on the 24th, that Abbot's engineer corps had re-purposed the armory of the 5th Regiment for use as a recruiting station, toward the goal of forming the newly authorized 8th Regiment, to include a company of artillery. They brought with them from the armory of the 6th, two <a href="howitzers">howitzers</a>, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and 250 <a href="musket">musket</a>s. The Governor and <a href="Adjutant%20General">Adjutant General</a> put out a call for volunteers to fill each regiment with 1,000 men. General <a href="James%20Howard%20%28general%29">James Howard</a> was chosen to command the 7th, and General Charles E. Phelps the 8th.

According to reports in "The Sun", the following day at 3:00pm, those who were left of the original 6th Regiment disbanded. No official order was given to this effect, but their duties had by this point been entirely assumed by federal troops, the soldiers of the 5th, and the newly formed 7th and 8th. The armory of the 6th remained guarded by a single police officer.

On Thursday, July 26, a committee from the engineers, firemen, brakemen, and conductors met with Governor Carroll, as recounted in the following day's newspapers. They presented him with a list of their unanimously adopted demands. The governor informed them that he had no power to satisfy them, which was a matter for the railroad, but assured them he intended to enforce the law and put down violence by any means necessary. The committee in turn maintained they had no connection with the violence, but merely intended to stop work until their demands were met. Carroll's reply was published in the local papers:

You have more to do than simply abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the destruction of property. You are responsible for the violence that has been done, whether you were actually engaged in it or not. You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.

The next day, it was reported that some railways throughout the country resumed traffic, though the B&O remained idle. B&O vice president King published a reply to the demands of the strikers, saying that they could not be met for lack of work and low prices for hauling freight. He wrote that the choice of the company was to either <a href="lay%20off">lay off</a> many men and retain only those for whom they had work, or to spread what work was to be done among its employees; they chose the latter as the more humane. He continued:

The experience of the last ten days must satisfy everyone that if freight trains are stopped on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the city of Baltimore is not only deprived of the great commercial advantages which she has heretofore enjoyed, but the entire community is made to feel that all business must be seriously crippled and the price of all kinds of family supplies greatly increased.

Later that evening, second vice president Keyser, upon the request of the strikers, addressed a workingmen's meeting at Cross Street Market Hall, and presented the company's written response reprinted in the papers for the public. The letter, signed by both King and Keyser, stated the company's position as follows: the company would not negotiate on the matter of the 10 percent wage reduction, but it would "be pleased to address itself to the investigation of any of the minor grievances of which the men complained". The "Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser" reported a general hope that, owing to the imminent increase in traffic due to the transport of harvested crops, the firemen would be able to make daily round trips, thus avoiding layovers, and that the company could arrange for them to return home on passenger trains when this was not feasible.

Keyser's reprinted response advised that the ten percent cut was "forced upon the company", but that he was confident they would be able to provide more full employment, and thus increase wages, due to an abundance of freight to be moved. He said that a system of passes would be arranged to address the issue of idle time caused by delays. He entreated the men that if the situation could not be resolved, it must "bring want and suffering upon all; suffering from which you and your families cannot hope to be exempt." He asserted that, although 90 percent of rail workers had accepted the reduction, the whole business of the railroad and city had been halted due to the 10 percent rejecting them, and resolving to not allow the rest of the men to continue work. He said the rescinding of the wage cuts were "entirely out of the question" and requested the men either return to work, or allow those who would to resume working. As "The Sun" reported: "A vote was taken, and the proposition of the company was rejected unanimously."

The force gathered at Camden Station at 8:30am on Saturday, July 29, included 250 federal troops, 250 men of the 5th Maryland Regiment, and 260 policemen. Under this guard, freight traffic once again resumed in and out of Baltimore. That day between 8 and 34 trains were dispatched in total.

The newspapers reported the resumption of business and the glut of stalled products pouring through the city, including:


Between the 30th and the 1st, "The Sun" reported that the remaining strikers had declared they would not interfere, but were confident the company would be unable to find sufficient workers without them, and that by remaining united, they could yet see their terms met. Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had little trouble in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.

On Wednesday, August 1, "The Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser" summarized the situation as it then stood:

The strikers have gained absolutely nothing by the movement. The ten per cent reduction has been enforced by the four trunk lines, and the only concessions were those that might have been had for asking, without the loss of a single day's work. Such of the strikers as were caught committing criminal acts are now under arrest, and the great majority of the rest are most anxious to resume their places. Some of the railroad companies have discharged every man that took part in the strike, while others have only dropped the ringleaders, and have held out inducements to the others to return to work.

By the time peace was completely restored in the city, the cost to the state for suppression of the mob was between $80,000 and $85,000. Later that year, the B&O agreed to a number of reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than an hour before a train's departure, crews were to be paid a quarter of a day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B&O Employees Relief Association was established.

The first <a href="Military%20parade">parade</a> of the 5th Regiment through the city following the crisis was on October 15. They marched that day with, according to contemporary accounts, 400 counted among their ranks. In 1901, a <a href="Fifth%20Regiment%20Armory">new armory</a> for the 5th was completed on West Hoffman Street, and is now included on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historical%20Places">National Register of Historical Places</a>.

The following year, Governor Carroll addressed the <a href="Maryland%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly of the Maryland Legislature</a>, and offered his appraisal of what had occurred in Baltimore:

<poem>Undoubtedly the extraordinary depression which has existed for the past four years in all branches of business, compelled the great railway lines to make reductions in their expenditures, and thus the numbers of unemployed have been constantly added to.

The want and suffering produced by such a condition of the working classes is always an evil greatly to be deplored, but one, unfortunately, that cannot be reached by immediate legislation. The great and only remedy for unemployed labor, is the revival of business, and the encouragement of a judicious political system by which it will be brought about.</poem>

In 2013, a historical marker was placed on the Howard Street side of Camden Station. It was state-funded and coordinated by the <a href="Maryland%20Historical%20Trust">Maryland Historical Trust</a> and the <a href="Maryland%20State%20Highway%20Administration">Maryland State Highway Administration</a>. The text of the marker was proposed by Bill Barry, Director of Labor Studies at the <a href="Community%20College%20of%20Baltimore%20County">Baltimore County Community College</a>.

Hawker Hurricane in Yugoslav service

In late 1937, the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Air Force</a> (, VVKJ) placed an order with <a href="Hawker%20Aircraft">Hawker Aircraft</a> for twelve <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> Mk I <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, the first foreign purchase of the aircraft. The <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Air Force</a> (VVKJ) operated the British <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> Mk I from 1938 to 1941. Between 1938 and 1940, the VVKJ obtained 24 Hurricane Mk Is from early production batches, marking the first foreign sale of the aircraft. Twenty additional aircraft were built by <a href="Zmaj%20aircraft">Zmaj</a> under licence in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. When the country was drawn into <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> by the <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">German-led Axis invasion</a> of April 1941, a total of 41 Hurricane Mk I's were in service as fighters. They achieved some successes against "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" aircraft, but all Yugoslav Hurricanes were destroyed or captured during the 11-day invasion.

In mid-1944, the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a> formed two <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> squadrons, Nos. <a href="No.%20351%20Squadron%20RAF">351</a> and <a href="No.%20352%20Squadron%20RAF">352</a>, which both operated Hurricane <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>s. No. 351 Squadron flew Hurricane Mk IICs during training and was later equipped with Hurricane Mk IVs, and No. 352 briefly flew Hurricane Mk IICs during training before re-equipping with <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> Mk Vs. Both squadrons operated as part of <a href="No.%20281%20Wing%20RAF">No. 281 Wing RAF</a> of the <a href="Balkan%20Air%20Force">Balkan Air Force</a>, conducting ground attack missions in support of Partisan operations until the end of the war. Hurricanes remained in service with the post-war <a href="Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Yugoslav Air Force</a> until the early 1950s.

In early 1938, the <a href="Royal%20Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Royal Yugoslav Air Force</a> (, VVKJ) placed an order with <a href="Hawker%20Aircraft">Hawker Aircraft</a> for twelve <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> Mk I <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, the first foreign purchase of the aircraft. The British government was willing to supply excess Hurricanes to nations that were likely to oppose German expansion because the rate of production of the aircraft slightly exceeded the capability of the RAF to introduce it at the time. The first of these aircraft destined for Yugoslav service was No. 205 (formerly L1751), which was flown from the United Kingdom to <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a> via France and Italy, arriving on 15 December 1938. The first batch of aircraft were fitted with a <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Merlin">Rolls-Royce Merlin</a> II engine driving a two-blade wooden <a href="Propeller%20%28aeronautics%29">propeller</a>. The initial order was followed by a second order of twelve (N2718–N2729), which were fitted with Merlin III engines driving a three-blade <a href="variable-pitch%20propeller">variable-pitch propeller</a>, and were delivered in February and March 1940. At the same time, the Yugoslav government applied to build more under licence. Once the negotiations were successfully concluded, production lines were established at the <a href="Rogo%C5%BEarski">Rogožarski</a> plant in Belgrade and the <a href="Zmaj%20aircraft">Zmaj</a> factory in nearby <a href="Zemun">Zemun</a>. The two plants were expected to build forty and sixty of the aircraft respectively, at a rate of twelve per month. Of the locally built aircraft, only twenty were completed by Zmaj; the Rogožarski plant did not produce any. A total of 44 aircraft were put into service with the VVKJ.

Once in service, Hurricane Mk Is were used to equip the 52nd Fighter Group of the 2nd Fighter Regiment based at <a href="Kni%C4%87">Knić</a>, and the 33rd and 34th Fighter Groups of the 4th Fighter Regiment based at <a href="Lakta%C5%A1i">Bosanski Aleksandrovac</a>. Hurricanes were also operated by the Independent Fighter Squadron of the 81st Bomber Group and by the Air Training School, both based at <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a>. All of these aircraft were deployed in the fighter/interceptor role. Immediately prior to the German-led Axis <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion of Yugoslavia</a> in April 1941, 41 of the original 44 Hurricanes were serviceable. They were allocated as follows:
At 06:45 on 6 April 1941, the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" launched <a href="Operation%20Retribution%20%281941%29">Operation Retribution</a>, a series of concerted bombing attacks on Belgrade that coincided with air and ground attacks throughout the country. Several waves of German aircraft approached Belgrade during the day, initially <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive-bomber">dive-bomber</a>s escorted by fighters. About 08:00, Hurricanes of the 52nd Fighter Group engaged the second wave as it departed after bombing the city; one of the dive-bombers was shot down by three pilots from the 163rd Squadron. For the remainder of the first day of the invasion, the Hurricanes of the VVKJ saw little action, despite constant patrolling between <a href="%C4%8Ca%C4%8Dak">Čačak</a>, <a href="Kraljevo">Kraljevo</a>, and <a href="Kragujevac">Kragujevac</a>. Few of the aircraft had radio sets, so the fighters usually arrived too late to take part in the fighting. Two 4th Fighter Regiment machines were tasked with escorting <a href="Bristol%20Blenheim">Bristol Blenheim</a> Mk I <a href="light%20bomber">light bomber</a>s to attack targets in Austria, but they lost sight of the bombers in cloud cover. One of the pilots then attempted to intercept some German <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> fighters.

The following day, the 2nd Fighter Regiment continued to patrol over central Serbia, protecting factories at Kraljevo and Kragujevac from potential German air attacks that never occurred. The 4th Fighter Regiment was also active, patrolling over Bosnia and Croatia, but saw little action except for attempts to intercept German reconnaissance aircraft. Two of the Air Training School Hurricanes scrambled to intercept a small formation of <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> bombers as they flew over Mostar towards <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a>. They were both hit by return fire, wounding one pilot and forcing him to crash land. The other pilot continued pursuing the bombers when he was attacked by a group of German Bf 109s. He was severely wounded, <a href="Parachute">bailed out</a>, and eventually died from loss of blood. Another Hurricane was also claimed by the Germans on 7 April.

On 8 April, the main VVKJ effort was directed towards a German ground thrust through the <a href="Ka%C3%A7anik">Kačanik</a> gorge in southern Kosovo. By this time, the VVKJ had lost over 60 per cent of its aircraft; 70 aircraft from the remnants of various bomber and fighter units were assembled for the attack. Hurricanes of the 52nd Fighter Group made up the last wave of attacks on the of closely packed convoys. Flying beneath low cloud in very poor weather, both squadrons strafed the Germans. One Hurricane was hit and crash-landed by the road, its pilot evading capture. In the north of the country, patrolling Hurricanes of the 4th Regiment clashed with German fighters on several occasions, without result. Other 4th Regiment Hurricanes escorted another bomber mission against targets in southern Austria. The remaining five Hurricanes of the 105th Squadron relocated to <a href="Veliki%20Radinci">Veliki Radinci</a>, where other surviving aircraft had also concentrated.

The following day, heavy snow fell in some areas of Yugoslavia, grounding the 52nd Fighter Group Hurricanes at Knić. In the north, a major air battle developed between <a href="Rovine%2C%20Gradi%C5%A1ka">Rovine</a> and Bosanski Aleksandrovac, involving Hurricanes of both the 106th and 108th Squadrons. The Yugoslavs shot down one or two Bf 109s, but lost two Hurricanes in the process. By 10 April, the VVKJ was disintegrating quickly in the face of the successful German onslaught, but Hurricanes of the 105th Squadron were able to get airborne despite the continuing poor weather, patrolling for and engaging German aircraft without result. At Knić, rumours of the approach of German ground forces led the 164th Squadron to attempt to fly its Hurricanes to a safer airfield. Five machines got into the air, but almost immediately two of them collided, and another flew into a mountain wreathed in fog. The two surviving pilots returned safely to Knić. Meanwhile, the Hurricanes of the 163rd Squadron had been rendered unserviceable by their crews to prevent their capture and use by the Germans. When it became clear that the rumours of approaching German forces were unfounded, desperate attempts were made to return the aircraft to flying condition. The same day, Hurricanes of the 4th Regiment scored a victory over a Bf 109 while chasing reconnaissance aircraft over Bosnia.

On 11 April, 4th Regiment Hurricanes successfully shot down a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> heavy fighter over <a href="Nova%20Gradi%C5%A1ka">Nova Gradiška</a>. The following day, two or three of the remaining 105th Squadron Hurricanes were burned by ground crews at Veliki Radinci, while other machines from the same squadron flew to <a href="Bijeljina">Bijeljina</a>, where other aircraft had concentrated. This move had only just been completed when a large formation of German Bf 110s swept over the airfield and destroyed over two dozen aircraft, including all but one of the 105th Squadron Hurricanes. At Knić, approaching German vehicles caused the last two 163rd Squadron Hurricanes to scramble, flying to Zemun. The first pilot landed safely, but was immediately captured by armed "<a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Volksdeutsche</a>". The other pilot, seeing that Zemun was not safe, broke off and tried to fly to Bjeljina, but ran out of fuel and was killed when he tried to crash-land near <a href="Valjevo">Valjevo</a>. Even at this late stage, the 4th Regiment still had five or six airworthy Hurricanes. They continued to chase reconnaissance aircraft throughout the day, shooting down one Ju 88 near <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a>. When German bombers again attacked the airfields around Mostar, the one remaining Hurricane of the Air Training School attacked a Ju 88 but was hit by return fire, forcing the pilot to bail out.

The following day saw 4th Regiment Hurricanes again patrolling over Bosnia, downing another Bf 110, this time over Banja Luka. One aircraft was destroyed on 13 April, the pilot being badly wounded. On 14 April, one Hurricane was still serviceable at <a href="Nik%C5%A1i%C4%87">Nikšić</a> in Montenegro. This aircraft clashed with Italian fighters on 14 or 15 April and was hit 37 times. Despite this, it was still airworthy on 16 April when its pilot attempted to fly it to Greece, but he was forced to return due to poor weather, after which the aircraft was abandoned. At least two Hurricanes were captured intact by the invading forces, but this marked the end of the Hawker Hurricane in VVKJ service, as all opposition to the Axis invaders ceased on 18 April, following the Yugoslav Supreme Command's unconditional surrender the previous day.

The raising of <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisan">Yugoslav Partisan</a>-manned squadrons within the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) was discussed between the Partisan leader <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> and the head of the British mission to the Partisans, Brigadier <a href="Sir%20Fitzroy%20Maclean%2C%201st%20Baronet">Fitzroy Maclean</a>, on 12 March 1944. As a result of this discussion, an agreement was concluded later that month for the RAF to train Yugoslav personnel who would man two squadrons, one of fighters and one of <a href="fighter-bomber">fighter-bomber</a>s. After completing training, these two squadrons were to conduct operations exclusively over Yugoslavia. It was agreed that the new squadrons would largely be staffed by former VVKJ personnel who had fled the country during the invasion and had later agreed to join the Partisans. The first squadron was raised at an airfield near <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>, Libya, as <a href="No.%20352%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 352 (Yugoslav) Squadron RAF</a>. Members took their Partisan oaths on 21 May 1944. Until late June, this squadron was equipped with <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">Harvard</a> training aircraft and Hurricane Mk IICs, which were then replaced by <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> Mk Vs, which it operated until the end of the war. The Hurricane Mk IICs were handed over to a second Partisan-manned squadron, raised as <a href="No.%20351%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 351 (Yugoslav) Squadron RAF</a>, which was also established as a fighter-bomber unit in Libya on 1 July 1944.

During its work-up training, No. 351 Squadron was re-equipped with Hurricane Mk IVs. It completed training, including ground-attack practice runs, by 23 September. By 2 October, the squadron had been transferred to an airfield near <a href="Cannae">Cannae</a> in Italy to join <a href="No.%20281%20Wing%20RAF">No. 281 Wing RAF</a> of the <a href="Balkan%20Air%20Force">Balkan Air Force</a>, a combined Allied organisation. The move was accompanied by complaints from the Partisan Supreme Command that the Hurricane was inferior to the Spitfire now being flown by No. 352 Squadron, and also the <a href="Hawker%20Typhoon">Hawker Typhoon</a>. The complaints were ignored by the RAF, and the squadron operated Hurricane Mk IVs until the end of the war, as did <a href="No.%206%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 6 Squadron RAF</a>, a British-manned squadron that also flew missions over Yugoslavia, even though the aircraft had been taken out of frontline service in the European theatre in March 1944. No. 351 Squadron was cleared for combat operations on 13 October, and from 18 October the squadron generally had 4–8 aircraft based at an airfield on the now Allied-held island of <a href="Vis%20%28island%29">Vis</a> in the Adriatic.

No. 351 Squadron flew its first mission on 13 October 1944; it involved six aircraft attacking an Axis supply convoy near the village of <a href="Ar%C5%BEano">Aržano</a>. On 20 October, aircraft from the squadron, supported by Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, conducted rocket and strafing attacks on enemy columns near <a href="Metkovi%C4%87">Metković</a> that were withdrawing in the face of the advancing Partisan <a href="26th%20Dalmatian%20Division">26th Dalmatian Division</a>. The mission was a success, but one aircraft was lost to ground fire.

Nine days later, Hurricanes, escorted by a pair of Spitfires from No. 352 Squadron, flew a patrol over the island of <a href="Rab">Rab</a> and adjacent areas of the Adriatic, but were unable to positively identify any targets. On 4 November, aircraft from No. 351 Squadron, again escorted by two Spitfires, were tasked with <a href="Interdiction">interdicting</a> road communications between <a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a> and <a href="Knin">Knin</a>. One aircraft developed engine trouble and had to return to base, but the rest continued with the mission. They ran into heavy anti-aircraft fire near Knin, and one aircraft was shot down, the pilot bailing out and being captured by the Germans. The next mission, on 9 November, was hampered by extremely poor weather over the target area near <a href="Trebinje">Trebinje</a>. One aircraft flew into a mountain, killing the pilot, and another suffered engine trouble and crash-landed near Trebinje, the pilot escaping unhurt.

On 3 December 1944, No. 351 Squadron carried out a successful rocket attack against Axis coastal defences on the Island of <a href="Lo%C5%A1inj">Lošinj</a>, launching from Vis. This was followed by a period of scouting and reconnaissance over several Yugoslav regions, hitting targets of opportunity, sometimes escorted and supported by the Spitfires of No. 352 Squadron. No. 351 Squadron ranged widely, interdicting rail and road routes in eastern and western Bosnia and throughout <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, and attacking Axis maritime traffic off the Adriatic coast and islands. As the year drew to a close, operations became severely hampered by the worsening weather.

In January and February 1945, much better co-ordination was achieved between the two RAF squadrons and Partisan ground and maritime forces. This was done through the deployment of aviation liaison sections with the main Partisan formations, initially with the <a href="8th%20Corps%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">8th Corps</a> and then also the <a href="5th%20Corps%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">5th Corps</a>. On 4 January, four Hurricanes flew from Vis to attack an enemy convoy travelling between Mostar and Sarajevo. The convoy was located near <a href="Jablanica%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Jablanica</a> and seven trucks were destroyed. The aircraft went on to attack the railway station in Jablanica, damaging one locomotive and ten wagons. One Hurricane was damaged by anti-aircraft fire during the mission. On 22 January, Hurricanes escorted by Spitfires attacked a ship of off the island of Rab, firing sixteen rockets. Due to the minimal "Luftwaffe" presence over much of Yugoslavia, in many cases the Spitfire escorts from No. 352 Squadron were not needed to protect against enemy aircraft, so they also engaged ground and maritime targets alongside the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron.

In February, both squadrons provided support for the liberation of major towns, including <a href="%C5%A0iroki%20Brijeg">Široki Brijeg</a>, <a href="Nevesinje">Nevesinje</a> and Mostar, and patrolled and attacked targets of opportunity across Bosnia and Dalmatia. Specifically, they supported the <a href="Mostar%20operation">Mostar operation</a> of the 8th Corps, the work of the <a href="11th%20Corps%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">11th Corps</a> clearing the enemy from islands in the northern Adriatic, and also 5th Corps operations. Despite the presence of liaison sections with ground forces, procedures were not yet streamlined, and several <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> incidents occurred during the Mostar operation. In support of 11th Corps operations, Hurricanes attacked German headquarters, defences and naval traffic on and around the islands of <a href="Pag%20%28island%29">Pag</a> and <a href="Krk">Krk</a>. On 7 February, Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron were supporting 4th and 11th Corps and attacked a column of German trucks and wagons on the road between <a href="Gospi%C4%87">Gospić</a> and Bihać when two of the aircraft collided, causing minor damage. Both aircraft crash-landed in friendly territory and were written off, but the pilots escaped unharmed. During February, No. 351 Squadron re-deployed to <a href="Zemunik%20Donji">Zemunik</a> on the mainland near <a href="Zadar">Zadar</a>.

In early March, the formation of the <a href="4th%20Army%20%28Socialist%20Yugoslavia%29">4th Army</a> was accompanied by the development of even closer coordination and liaison with the two squadrons. Air marker panels began to be used to show the <a href="Front%20line">forward line of friendly troops</a> and to identify friendly vehicles, and liaison teams were deployed with the commanders of lower-level formations to communicate directly with supporting aircraft. Operations continued across Bosnia and Dalmatia in March, and were extended to include support to advances in the <a href="Lika">Lika</a> region and during the capture of Sarajevo and Bihać. As Axis forces withdrew west towards <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>, the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron continued to harry them, ambushing convoys and rocketing artillery positions. Between 1 January and 31 March 1945, the Hurricanes of No. 351 Squadron not only flew from Cannae and Vis, but also from the airfields at Zemunik and <a href="%C5%A0kabrnja">Prkos</a> on the mainland. In the same period the squadron lost four aircraft and suffered damage to fifteen others. Of the lost aircraft, two were destroyed as a result of a collision, one was lost after engine failure, and only one was lost to anti-aircraft fire. Four aircraft were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, the remainder being damaged by fragments from their own rockets.

From the beginning of April 1945, the combat operations of No. 351 Squadron were focussed on supporting the offensives by the 4th Army in the Lika and <a href="Gorski%20kotar">Gorski kotar</a> regions, along the Croatian coastline and in <a href="Istria">Istria</a>. In particular, there was hard fighting in the islands of the northern Adriatic. On 5 April, one Hurricane was lost near <a href="Babin%20Potok%2C%20Donji%20Vakuf">Babin Potok</a> when it flew into a mountain while supporting the <a href="19th%20Dalmatian%20Division%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">19th Dalmatian Division's</a> attack on elements of the <a href="11th%20Usta%C5%A1e%20Division">11th Ustaše Division</a>, resulting in the death of the pilot. During this period, all operations of No. 351 Squadron were carried out from the airfield at Zemunik. Two aircraft were destroyed and eighteen damaged. Between 2 and 8 May, which proved to be the last week of the war, the RAF did not permit the squadron to operate due to political considerations regarding the future status of <a href="Trieste">Trieste</a>.

During its existence, No. 351 Squadron flew 227 combat missions: 119 ground attack sorties, 87 reconnaissance missions, 19 maritime interdictions, and two search-and-rescue missions. Of the 23 pilots that passed through the squadron, four were killed and one captured. The squadron lost nine aircraft, and 38 others suffered damage, mainly from anti-aircraft fire. The squadron was released from RAF control on 16 May 1945.

After the war, the Balkan Air Force's 16 surviving Hurricanes continued to be used by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Air%20Force">Yugoslav Air Force</a> (; JRV), the air arm of Tito's new communist government. The Hurricanes flew with the <a href="1st%20Fighter%20Regiment%20%28Yugoslavia%29">1st Fighter Regiment</a> in 1945, followed by the <a href="103rd%20Reconnaissance%20Aviation%20Regiment%23Reconnaissance%20Aviation%20Regiment">Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment</a> in 1947–1948, and the <a href="103rd%20Reconnaissance%20Aviation%20Regiment">103rd Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment</a> between 1948 and 1951. Hurricanes remained in service with the post-war Yugoslav Air Force until the early 1950s.

A Hawker Hurricane Mk IV that flew as part of No. 351 Squadron is on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Aviation%2C%20Belgrade">Museum of Aviation</a> in Belgrade. This aircraft, serial number 20925, was manufactured in 1943, and remained in operation until it was withdrawn from service on 18 August 1952.

Lazarus (comics)

Lazarus is a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> comic book series created by writer <a href="Greg%20Rucka">Greg Rucka</a> and artist <a href="Michael%20Lark">Michael Lark</a>. The two began developing the idea in 2012 and partnered with <a href="colorist">colorist</a> Santi Arcas to finish the art. <a href="Image%20Comics">Image Comics</a> has been publishing the book since the first issue was released on June 23, 2013. Other creators were brought in later to assist with <a href="Letterer">lettering</a> and <a href="Inker">inking</a>. A six-issue spin-off <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited series</a>, "Lazarus: X+66", was released monthly in 2017 between issues 26 and 27 of the regular series. Rucka initially said the series could run for up to 150 issues, but later reduced the estimate by half. "Lazarus" is being collected into paperback and hardcover editions, which sell better than the monthly issues.

In the series, the world has been divided among sixteen rival families, who run their territories in a <a href="Feudalism">feudal system</a>. The main character is Forever Carlyle, the military leader of the Carlyle family. The major themes of "Lazarus" are the meaning of "family" and <a href="nature%20versus%20nurture">nature versus nurture</a>. Critics have given it mostly positive reviews and have praised its <a href="worldbuilding">worldbuilding</a>, although it is sometimes criticized for slow pace. It has received particular attention for its political themes, and comparisons have been drawn between elements of the story and the presidency of Donald Trump.

"Lazarus" is being adapted into other media. <a href="Green%20Ronin%20Publishing">Green Ronin Publishing</a> is using the plot as a <a href="campaign%20setting">campaign setting</a> for their "Modern AGE" <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> in 2018. A television adaptation is in development with <a href="Legendary%20Entertainment%23Legendary%20Television%20and%20Digital%20Media">Legendary Television</a> and <a href="Amazon%20Studios">Amazon Studios</a>.

American writer <a href="Greg%20Rucka">Greg Rucka</a> and artist <a href="Michael%20Lark">Michael Lark</a> had previously collaborated on the comic series "<a href="Gotham%20Central">Gotham Central</a>" for <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> between 2002 and 2004 and various small projects for <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a> in the years following. Lark wanted to work with Rucka on a <a href="creator%20owned">creator-owned</a> comic because he felt he was at his best drawing the kind of stories Rucka writes.

In June 2012, Rucka was in Dallas as part of a book-signing tour. He had dinner with Lark, who lived nearby, and shared an idea for a scene involving a woman who had been shot rising from the dead and pursuing her attackers. Lark liked the story and committed to drawing the comic as soon as a full script was ready. Although Rucka had previously published his creator-owned material through <a href="Oni%20Press">Oni Press</a>, his friend <a href="Ed%20Brubaker">Ed Brubaker</a> had been pushing him to work with <a href="Image%20Comics">Image Comics</a>. When they contacted Image's <a href="Eric%20Stephenson%20%28comics%29">Eric Stephenson</a> and pitched the project as ""<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>" meets "<a href="Children%20of%20Men">Children of Men</a>"", he immediately expressed interest. The project, titled "Lazarus", was officially announced at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic%20Con">San Diego Comic Con</a> on July 14, 2012. The announcement was accompanied by promotional artwork colored by American Elizabeth Breitweiser and featured a prototype logo design and typeface.

Image Comics provided David Brothers to serve as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautmann, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European <a href="colorist">colorist</a> to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a Spanish colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.

Rucka and Lark developed the setting for "Lazarus" by looking at the <a href="Occupy%20movement">Occupy movement</a> and the underlying economics, then asking themselves "What happens if it goes horribly wrong?" They decided how the story would end before work began on the first issue. They initially gave their lead character the name Endeavor, but Rucka changed the name to Forever to avoid a conflict with a different comic being developed at the same time about a young <a href="Inspector%20Morse%20%28TV%20series%29">Inspector Morse</a>. Lark based her body type on the soccer player <a href="Hope%20Solo">Hope Solo</a>.

Lark was disappointed by the first script as he felt none of the characters were likable, and the scene described to him over dinner was not included. In response, Rucka wrote a new draft restoring the missing opening scene. Lark began drawing the first issue in January 2013, basing the opening scene on the reconstruction sequence in 1997 film "<a href="The%20Fifth%20Element">The Fifth Element</a>".

When writing a new script, Rucka tries to follow the world-building model used by <a href="William%20Gibson">William Gibson</a> in his 1984 novel "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>" and provide information about the environment through context instead of exposition. His biggest struggle is delivering details while maintaining a proper <a href="Pace%20%28narrative%29">narrative pace</a>. He sometimes self-censors "exceptionally dark" material because he does not want to make Lark draw it. After Lark receives a new script, the collaboration between them is "immediate and constant". Lark questions Rucka about characterization and the direction of the story, leading Rucka to rewrite scripts resulting in what he believes is a better final product. Lark refuses to read scripts in advance so he will stay focused on what is in front of him, not what he will be drawing next. Rucka says Lark intuitively knows what is happening in the story even when it isn't clearly scripted.

Rucka and Lark have an ongoing conversation about how to show the injustice in the way Forever is treated without being complicit in it themselves. For example, medics must remove Forever's clothes to treat her wounds. Lark wanted to avoid sexualizing the images, but also avoid being "coy" by simply blocking parts of her body with another character's arm. The script gives Lark no direction for aspects like architecture, clothing, or vehicle design. Designing these technical details involves research into prototype technology and takes almost as long as drawing the actual pages for the comics. The time required to create the sets is the primary reason Lark sometimes falls behind schedule.

Lark works on "Lazarus" ten or more hours per day. He uses photo references and digital tools in the early stages of his art, but the layouts and drawing are done with traditional tools. He is more involved with the coloring on "Lazarus" than any other comic he has illustrated. The logo design was finalized by Trautmann and Lark. Lark initially did all of the <a href="Letterer">lettering</a> and <a href="Inker">inking</a> for "Lazarus", but doing so made it impossible to release new issues on a regular schedule. To give him more time to focus on drawing, some of the smaller tasks like logo and type design were given to other people. Brian Level assisted with inking on issues three through ten, when he was replaced by Tyler Boss. Beginning with issue ten, Jodi Wynne took over the lettering duties and Owen Freeman started creating the cover art. Fake advertisements found on the back covers and many of the computer screens and holographic images in the artwork are created by Trautmann. Lark and Rucka often discuss whether to use sound effects in scenes or limit their use. Lark does not want to rely on them to convey information because they may become a "crutch" in place of including important details in the art.

Issue fifteen features a silent, thirteen-page fight between two characters. Rucka, who used to be a <a href="choreographer">choreographer</a>, filmed himself acting out the battle with a friend. Lark used the film for reference as he drew.

Following the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016 US Presidential Election</a>, the creators' vision for the comic shifted. Rucka, who had used the <a href="Comic%20book%20letter%20column">letter columns</a> in the series to discuss his concerns about then-candidate <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>, told <a href="Oregon%20Public%20Broadcasting">Oregon Public Broadcasting</a> that after the election results "Lazarus" had changed from a dystopian science fiction story to a documentary. During a discussion panel at the 2017 <a href="Chicago%20Comic%20%26amp%3B%20Entertainment%20Expo">Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo</a>, Rucka described "Lazarus" as being "about the blood red rage that leads to a Trump administration" before joking that he had "tried to warn you three years ago!" Although the overall plan for "Lazarus" did not change, Rucka said he had a growing interest in writing about a brighter future instead.

Brubaker advised Rucka to create a four-page "<a href="Trailer%20%28promotion%29">trailer</a>" to promote the book, a strategy Brubaker had used with "<a href="The%20Fade%20Out">The Fade Out</a>". Rucka was not initially interested, but Lark liked the idea. The trailer debuted at the 2013 <a href="Emerald%20City%20Comic%20Con">Emerald City Comic Con</a> before appearing online and in "Previews", the catalog for <a href="Diamond%20Distribution">Diamond Distribution</a>. The scene was not reproduced in any issue of the series.

Most comics sold to specialty stores in the <a href="direct%20market">direct market</a> are non-returnable. To reduce the financial risk for retailers who were uncertain about its sales potential, unsold copies from qualifying orders of the first three issues of "Lazarus" could be returned to the publisher. The first issue went on sale on June 26, 2013 and sold out of its approximately 48,000 copy print run at the distributor level. A second printing was announced to coincide with the release of issue two. After a second sellout, it was added to the "Image Firsts" program, a line of discounted first-issue reprints continuously available for retailers to order. By the end of 2013, the first issue had sold an estimated 50,200 copies. The second issue, which also went through multiple printings, sold an estimated 30,600 copies. Over the next two years, sales fell steadily to about 14,500 copies.

Because of scheduling issues, Rucka and Lark were behind on the series from the start. The problems were exacerbated by illness and poor communication during the "Lift" arc, causing issue 9 to be delayed by more than a month. Further late issues led retailers to reduce their orders for new issues. In fall 2015, the team announced a four-month hiatus between issues 21 and 22 to allow Lark to get ahead of schedule. They said they would not solicit any more issues until the next <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a <a href="sourcebook">sourcebook</a> providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. The sourcebook was created with input from Robert Mackenzie and David Walker, who had been providing annotations for the series at NerdSpan. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the "Cull" arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.

In the letter column of issue 26, Rucka announced a six-issue <a href="Limited%20series%20%28comics%29">limited series</a> titled "Lazarus: X+66" would be released monthly beginning July 2017. The series was written by Rucka and Trautmann, and each issue focused on different supporting characters from the main series. Lark was involved as a consultant, but each issue was drawn by a new artist. This decision gave Lark time to work on something unrelated to "Lazarus", which had been his only project since the series began. A four-page preview of the first installment, drawn by <a href="Steve%20Lieber">Steve Lieber</a>, was included with the book's solicitation in "Image Plus" #16. A third source book, this time covering the Vassalovka family, was released one week after the limited series ended. Lark returned to "Lazarus" in April 2018 with issue 27.

In the letter column of issue 27, Rucka announced the series would change to a 64-page quarterly format beginning with issue 29 in September 2018. He said it would feature 44 pages of comic story and 20 pages will be a variety of prose material. When the proposed issue 29 was solicited, it was retitled and renumbered as ""Lazarus: Risen" #1" for the larger format issues.

At the start of the "Lazarus", Rucka estimated it would take between 100 and 150 issues to reach the ending. In May 2016, he revised his estimate downward, saying "Lazarus" was "25–30% complete at issue 21".

The series has been compiled in five <a href="trade%20paperback%20%28comics%29">trade paperbacks</a> and two hardcovers. The first paperback collection appeared on the <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a> <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller">Best Seller List</a> for Paperback Graphic Books in eighth position for two weeks in November 2013. The second appeared in the tenth spot for one week in August 2014. The hardcovers include introductions from notable comic creators like <a href="Warren%20Ellis">Warren Ellis</a> and behind-the-scenes material not otherwise available. Rucka and Lark take the extra content in them "very seriously" because hardcovers are expensive. In 2015, Rucka said sales of single issues "aren't great", but went on to say the series is selling better in a collected format. That year, the first paperback collection sold close to the same number of copies to <a href="Direct%20Market">comic specialty shops</a> as it did in 2013, the year it was released. "Lazarus" has been translated into several European languages by Italian publisher <a href="Panini%20Comics">Panini Comics</a> and released in hardcover formats containing the same material as the English paperbacks.

"Lazarus" is a <a href="coming%20of%20age">coming of age</a> story for a young woman named Forever Carlyle who is questioning her identity. Its major themes are the meaning of "family" and <a href="nature%20versus%20nurture">nature versus nurture</a>. It is set in a bleak future where the world has been divided into sixteen large land areas, each led by one family. Each family rules their region in a feudal system that divides people into three tiers: "family", "serfs" (skilled labors), and "waste" (everyone else). The families have formed alliances to protect themselves from other families, and each family has a chosen warrior known as a "Lazarus" who represents them in combat. Forever is the Lazarus for the Carlyle family, which controls the western half of North America. She obeys the family patriarch, Malcolm Carlyle, and has four siblings: Steven, Beth, and twins Jonah and Johanna. The original source of the Carlyle's fortune and power is from their various developments in genetic technology. Among other advancements, their modified seeds provide food for most of the world. The Carlyles have also altered their own genetics, which has allowed all of them to grow old without suffering the consequences of age.

"Lazarus" has received positive reviews since its debut. According to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> Comic Book Roundup, critics gave the first issue an average score of 8.7/10 based on 32 reviews. The series as a whole averages 8.6/10 based on 284 reviews. Critics and fans often praise the world-building in "Lazarus", but Lark and Rucka see it as secondary and think it receives too much focus. "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" said Forever's "fascinating complexity" made "Lazarus" stand out from other graphic novels. Writing for <a href="Comics%20Alliance">Comics Alliance</a>, KM Bezner said every character, including the diabolical ones, displayed humanity and "[blurred] the lines between shades of morality". On "<a href="Broken%20Frontier">Broken Frontier</a>", Tyler Chin-Tanner described "Lift", the series' second story arc, as "a moving tale of family sacrifice". The series has appeared on many comic critics' "best of" lists. Since the series debut, the slow pace has been a common point of criticism.
Many critics compared "Lazarus" with other genre works. The timeliness of Rucka's premise made the series stand out among dystopian fiction for "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" reviewer Melissa Grey. Garrett Martin wrote in "<a href="Paste%20Magazine">Paste Magazine</a>" that the series was unlike other contemporary class warfare genre fiction like the novels "<a href="Hunger%20Games">Hunger Games</a>" or "Blackacre" because it is told from the oppressors' point of view. Oliver Sava reviewed the series for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" and said it stood out from Image's other science fiction comics "because it's more grounded in current political and economic trends". Rucka specifically addressed fan-drawn parallels to the television series "<a href="Game%20of%20Thrones">Game of Thrones</a>", saying he had not read the books and purposely avoids watching the show to avoid unintentionally borrowing ideas from it. Lark thinks the comparison to "Game of Thrones" works to some extent, but points out that "Lazarus" concentrates more on a single character.

Lark was praised for being equally good at depicting violence and introspection, and Martin said it was Lark's finest work. According to Lark, the characters in "Lazarus" rarely say what they mean, and some vital story beats are depicted by wordless art. Arcas received notice for adding texture and depth to Lark's art and using <a href="color%20scheme">pallette</a> changes to help tell the story.

Because of its economic themes, Bezner warned that the political elements of "Lazarus" would not be for everyone. In "<a href="The%20Jersey%20Journal">The Jersey Journal</a>", critic William Kulesa believed the "deeply considered speculation on society, technology, and the future" is what made the series high-quality science fiction. While "<a href="Newsarama">Newsarama</a>" reviewer Vanessa Gabriel felt "Lazarus" "engages the reader with plausibility", Chin-Tanner found it to be a character driven story even though it dealt with political and scientific issues. Following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016, "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" writer Mark Peters called the series "newly relevant" and compared Trump to the Carlyle family.

In an in-depth review of the series for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Review%20of%20Books">Los Angeles Review of Books</a>" in 2017, Evan McGarvey praised the research and thought that went into "Lazarus", but expressed concern that the visual requirements of the art conflicted with the political themes. He specifically noted the ruling families and their soldiers "simply look cooler" than the waste with whom the audience is meant to identify, and concluded that this dissonance may skew the real message Rucka and Lark want to send. McGarvey went on to compare the Carlyles to the <a href="Robert%20Mercer%20%28businessman%29">Mercer family</a> and the lift to China's <a href="National%20Higher%20Education%20Entrance%20Examination">Gaokao</a>.

<a href="Legendary%20Entertainment%23Legendary%20Television%20and%20Digital%20Media">Legendary Television</a> bought the rights to adapt "Lazarus" following a competitive bidding war in March 2015. Rucka and Lark will be executive producers along with David Manpearl and <a href="Matt%20Tolmach">Matt Tolmach</a>. A pilot script written by Rucka entered its final draft in late 2015 and Legendary began looking for a network willing to purchase it. During the hiatus between issues 21 and 22, Rucka and Lark were able to devote more time to developing the adaptation. Rucka said the development process for "Lazarus" has been better than any of his previous Hollywood experiences, and that he hopes the show will be able to explore characters more deeply using scenes cut from the book.

In September 2017, "<a href="Deadline%20Hollywood">Deadline Hollywood</a>" reported the adaptation was being developed as a potential series for <a href="Amazon%20Studios">Amazon Studios</a>, who made a "significant production investment" in it. In the letter column of "Lazarus X+66" #4 (November 2017), Rucka said this announcement included some inaccuracies, and emphasized the show is still a long way from being released. He said the casting process had not yet begun.

In the Spring of 2017, <a href="Green%20Ronin%20Publishing">Green Ronin Publishing</a> announced "The World of Lazarus", a <a href="campaign%20setting">campaign setting</a> in their "Modern AGE" <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>. Although initially planned for a November 2017 release, it was delayed until 2018 to allow more time for development. Rucka said role playing games had an important part of his development as a writer, and that having one of his ideas turned into one "might just possibly be the greatest compliment I could ever receive."

Illinois Centennial half dollar

The Illinois Centennial half dollar is a <a href="Early%20United%20States%20commemorative%20coins">commemorative</a> <a href="Half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">50-cent piece</a> struck by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1918. The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a>, depicting <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, was designed by <a href="Chief%20Engraver">Chief Engraver</a> <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>; the reverse, based on the <a href="Seal%20of%20Illinois">Seal of Illinois</a>, was by his assistant and successor, <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>. Morgan's obverse is based on the statue by <a href="Andrew%20O%27Connor%20%28sculptor%29">Andrew O'Connor</a>.

A commemorative was wanted by the <a href="State%20of%20Illinois">State of Illinois</a> to mark the centennial of its 1818 admission to <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">the Union</a>, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this. It met no opposition, though several amendments were made during the legislative process. After it passed, the two engravers produced designs, but Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a> required changes, not all of which were made.

The coins were minted in August 1918, and were sold to the public for $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial celebrations or to help those in need because of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Later writers have generally admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.

The State of Illinois wanted a commemorative coin to be issued for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> on January 16, 1918 by that state's <a href="Loren%20E.%20Wheeler">Loren E. Wheeler</a>. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which he was not a member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary <a href="William%20G.%20McAdoo">William G. McAdoo</a> and Mint Director <a href="Raymond%20T.%20Baker">Raymond T. Baker</a>. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer of Illinois and so there would be no returns. <a href="James%20L.%20Slayden">James L. Slayden</a> of Texas asked what the cost to the federal government would be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916–1917 <a href="McKinley%20Birthplace%20Memorial%20dollar">McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar</a>, and Ohio's <a href="William%20A.%20Ashbrook">William A. Ashbrook</a>, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of the dies had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed amending the bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in <a href="executive%20session">executive session</a>.

On March 12, Ashbrook submitted a report on behalf of his committee recommending passage of the bill once it had been amended to reduce the authorized mintage from 200,000 to 100,000 and to add a statement that the United States government would not be responsible for the cost of the dies.

Wheeler presented the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's <a href="Claude%20Kitchin">Claude Kitchin</a>, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition%20dollar">Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar</a> and the <a href="Panama-Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama-Pacific commemorative coins</a>). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.

H. R. 8742 was transmitted to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That committee's chairman, Oklahoma's <a href="Robert%20L.%20Owen">Robert L. Owen</a>, reported it back with an amendment to the full Senate, where the bill was considered on May 21, 1918. The House-passed bill had said the laws relating to the minor coinage of the United States (the cent and nickel) would apply to the coin; this was changed to state that the laws relating to the subsidiary silver coinage (which the half dollar was) would apply. The bill was passed as amended without objection. Later in the day, Illinois Senator <a href="James%20Hamilton%20Lewis">James Hamilton Lewis</a> made a statement which was inserted in the "<a href="Congressional%20Record">Congressional Record</a>" at this point, applauding the passage of the honor to his home state, and noting that "more than a hundred thousand of her sons" were then being deployed to the battlefields of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Since the versions the two houses had passed were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's <a href="Carl%20Hayden">Carl Hayden</a> successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment. The Speaker, <a href="Champ%20Clark">Champ Clark</a>, felt that the title of the bill might have to be changed for reasons he did not explain, but Hayden disagreed and Clark did not press his point. The bill passed the House, and was enacted by the signature of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> on June 1, 1918.

The designs were prepared internally in the Engraving Department at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>. The obverse design, depicting <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, was created by Chief Engraver <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">George T. Morgan</a>. The Chief Engraver worked from a photograph of a statue of Lincoln designed by <a href="Andrew%20O%27Connor%20%28sculptor%29">Andrew O'Connor</a> and unveiled in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield</a> (the city where Lincoln lived for much of his adult life) in August 1918. Lincoln is shown beardless, as he was when living in Illinois before he was elected president in 1860. He was chosen to be on the coin as Illinois' most famous resident. The obverse also contains the mottoes and , as well as an inscription noting the centennial.

The reverse was designed by the assistant engraver who would succeed Morgan on his death in 1925, <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>. It is an adaptation of the <a href="Seal%20of%20Illinois">Seal of Illinois</a>, an eagle perched on a rock mound, with the rising sun beyond it. The bird holds in its beak a scroll with the Illinois state motto, and it clutches the Federal shield. An <a href="olive%20branch">olive branch</a> is seen, but without any arrows representing war, even though these symbols are often paired on U.S. coins. Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a> suggested "their presence on a coin designed during the concluding months of World War I might have been considered just a bit raw". The reverse also bears the legends, , (the national motto, meaning "out of many, one") and .

Secretary McAdoo had originally rejected the submissions. Acting Mint Director <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> wrote to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on June 24, 1918, relaying the Treasury Secretary's concerns. McAdoo "specifically direct[ed]" that the Illinois state motto be deleted from the scroll in the eagle's beak on the reverse, to be replaced with the national one. Joyce was told to follow the provisions of the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a> requiring that on one side there be the word , a design emblematic of it, and the year of striking, with the other side an eagle with the name of the country and the denomination of the coin. Despite McAdoo's order, the Illinois inscription was retained on the scroll. <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a>, in his book on commemoratives, speculated it might have been the Illinois Centennial Commission that had insisted on this.

Later commentators have praised the coin. Taxay deemed the obverse "undoubtedly the finest work Morgan ever did in his forty-eight years with the Mint. The head is not merely well drawn, there is in it a depth of feeling, and introspective mood that almost makes the observer feel he is intruding on the great man." Writers on commemorative coins, including Arlie Slabaugh and David M. Bullowa, also admired the Illinois piece. <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> deemed Sinnock's reverse "the finest work he ever did for a legal tender coin", not excluding the <a href="Roosevelt%20dime">Roosevelt dime</a> (1946) and <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a> (1948, posthumous). Bowers noted that the border of both sides of the coin consists of beads and pellets, "an attractive substitute for denticles".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his 1971 book on the artistry of American coins and medals, wrote that "Morgan's interpretation has captured the restless plasticity of [O'Connor's] bust, yet another indication of the benefits for coin design of good monumental models in sculpture". He noted of Sinnock's reverse, "the little burst of sun at the right is almost a bow to the Roty–Saint-Gaudens–Weinman developments outside the Philadelphia Mint in American numismatic taste and iconography in the generation following 1900. Sinnock's composition can be called conventional, but the entire aura of the coin reflects American art after the Civil War, and this is perhaps truly appropriate for the only [pre-1954] commemorative coin to honor Abraham Lincoln."

A total of 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number reserved for inspection and testing at the 1919 meeting of the annual <a href="Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium to help pay for local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.

The coins were also sold by the Springfield Chamber of Commerce at $1 each, though some were eventually vended for less: Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl purchased several thousand at just over <a href="face%20value">face value</a>. A local bank held 30,000 of them for 15 years, and sold them during the <a href="Emergency%20Banking%20Act">1933 Bank Holiday</a> for a slight advance on par. This temporarily flooded the market, but they were absorbed during the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, though the price did not then rise from the $1.25 they had sold for since about 1925. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, <a href="coin%20grading">uncirculated</a> specimens sold for about $300. The edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" published in 2017 lists the coin for between $130 and $685, depending on condition. An <a href="Sheldon%20scale">exceptional specimen</a> sold at auction in 2014 for $7,040.
