First inauguration of Barack Obama

The first inauguration of Barack Obama as the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">44th</a> <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> took place on Tuesday, January 20, 2009. The <a href="Inauguration%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">inauguration</a>, which set a record attendance for any event held in Washington, D.C., marked the commencement of the first four-year term of <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> as President and <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> as Vice President. Based on the combined attendance numbers, television viewership, and Internet traffic, it was among the most-observed events ever by the global audience.

"A New Birth of Freedom", a phrase from the <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a>, served as the inaugural theme to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the birth year of <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. In his speeches to the crowds, Obama referred to ideals expressed by Lincoln about renewal, continuity and national unity. Obama mentioned these ideals in his speech to stress the need for shared sacrifice and a new sense of responsibility to answer America's challenges at home and abroad.

Obama and others paid homage to Lincoln in the form of tributes and references during several of the events, starting with a commemorative train tour from <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, to Washington, D.C. on January 17, 2009. The inaugural events held in Washington from January 18 to 21, 2009, included concerts, a national day of community service on <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.%20Day">Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a>, the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith <a href="Prayers%20at%20United%20States%20presidential%20inaugurations">inaugural prayer service</a>. The <a href="Oath%20of%20office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential oath</a> as administered by <a href="Supreme%20Court%20Chief%20Justice">Supreme Court Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Roberts">John Roberts</a> to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 strayed slightly from the oath of office prescribed in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, which led to its re‑administration the next day.

In addition to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the <a href="Presidential%20Inaugural%20Committee">Presidential Inaugural Committee</a> increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations. For the first time, the committee opened the entire length of the <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a> as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony, breaking with the tradition of past inaugurations. Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.
By definition, the inauguration marked the formal culmination of the <a href="presidential%20transition%20of%20Barack%20Obama">presidential transition of Barack Obama</a> that began when he won the United States <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">presidential election</a> on <a href="Election%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">November 4, 2008</a> and became the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a>. In accordance with of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, Obama resigned from the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> effective November 16, 2008. He was formally elected by the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> on December 15, 2008. The results were certified by a joint session of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> on January 8, 2009.
Obama, who originally campaigned using the slogan "Change We Can Believe In" and later "Change We Need", was widely celebrated as the first <a href="African%20American">African American</a> president of the United States and a symbol of change from his <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> predecessor, <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Obama also represented a generational change as the first man elected President who was born in the 1960s. He inherited what <a href="Peter%20Orszag">Peter Orszag</a> termed an "economic mess" that became known as the <a href="late-2000s%20financial%20crisis">late-2000s financial crisis</a>. According to a <a href="CNN">CNN</a> poll, he embodied youthful energy and transition at a time of economic despair, and inspired more confidence than his immediate predecessors.

The inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the <a href="United%20States%20Congress%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20Inaugural%20Ceremonies">Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies</a> and the 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee. Although the election was scheduled for November 4, 2008, the congressional committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 24, 2008.

The swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a> Obama and Vice President-elect Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a>s <a href="Dianne%20Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a>, committee chair, <a href="Bob%20Bennett%20%28politician%29">Bob Bennett</a> and <a href="Harry%20Reid">Harry Reid</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Representative">United States Representative</a>s <a href="John%20Boehner">John Boehner</a>, <a href="Steny%20Hoyer">Steny Hoyer</a> and <a href="Nancy%20Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>. The committee is overseen by the <a href="U.S.%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Rules%20and%20Administration">U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration</a>.

The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies chose the inaugural theme, "A New Birth of Freedom", a phrase from Abraham Lincoln's <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a> from the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> era. The theme, which was selected by the committee to mark the inaugural occasion and honor the 200th anniversary year of Lincoln's birth, expressed "Lincoln's hope that the sacrifice of those who died to preserve the United States would lead to 'a new birth of freedom' for the nation.'" In his reliance on the inaugural theme, Obama wanted "to give Americans reassurance that today, as in Lincoln's time, the country would find its way through any crisis".

The congressional committee released the full schedule of the January 20 inaugural events on December 17, 2008. The inauguration schedule referred to the President‑elect as "Barack H. Obama", although Obama specified previously that he intended to use his full name for his swearing-in ceremony, including his middle name <a href="Husayn">Hussein</a>. Obama decided to use his full name "Barack Hussein Obama" to "follow the tradition, not trying to make a statement one way or the other" for the inaugural ceremony. During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">election</a> campaign, Obama's detractors tried to use his middle name to imply falsely that he was a Muslim.

The <a href="Council%20of%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia City Council</a> passed legislation to enable bars and restaurants to stay open around‑the‑clock to provide hospitality services to the inaugural festivities attendees. After reaching an agreement with the congressional committee, District of Columbia Mayor <a href="Adrian%20Fenty">Adrian Fenty</a> signed legislation to temporarily allow bars and restaurants to operate 24 hours during the weekend leading up to the inauguration, but with 4:00 am EST as the cut‑off for alcoholic beverage service. The Hotel Association of Metropolitan Washington agreed to pay for extended train service provided by the <a href="Washington%20Metropolitan%20Area%20Transit%20Authority">Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority</a> on January 19 to accommodate visitors attending inaugural events and workers providing support for those events.

The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration‑related events at the direction of the President‑elect and Vice President‑elect of the United States, such as the train ride, concerts, parade, balls and prayer service. The co-chairs of the committee were <a href="William%20M.%20Daley">William Daley</a>, <a href="Penny%20Pritzker">Penny Pritzker</a>, <a href="John%20W.%20Rogers%2C%20Jr.">John Rogers</a>, <a href="Pat%20Ryan%20%28executive%29">Patrick Ryan</a> and <a href="Julianna%20Smoot">Julianna Smoot</a>.

For the first time in history, the Presidential Inaugural Committee opened the full length of <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a>, which extends from the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> to the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a>, as the public viewing area for the swearing-in ceremony. The presidential committee set aside a section of the mall close to the U.S. Capitol for people holding reserved tickets for the inaugural event. The committee directed the opening of the entire National Mall to make the event "'the most open and accessible in history,' allowing those who [could not] get the [reserved] tickets to the swearing-in ceremony on the Capitol grounds to fill the mall". To enable people in attendance to see and hear the swearing-in ceremony, the committee arranged for placement of <a href="JumboTron">JumboTron</a>s at points along the entire mall.

Despite criticism that such a large event could not be <a href="carbon%20footprint">carbon-friendly</a>, the presidential committee incorporated <a href="Zero%20waste">environment-friendly</a> measures in its planning of the inaugural events. The environmental measures included the use of recyclable carpet for the platform, retrieval of recyclable items from outdoor areas after an event, and the use of recycled paper for invitations and inaugural ball tickets.

The 2009 Presidential Inaugural Committee attempted to raise more individual contributions in smaller dollar amounts compared with the <a href="second%20inauguration%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush">second inauguration of George W. Bush</a> in 2005. The 2009 contribution limit was set at $50,000 for donations by individuals, whereas individuals and companies were able to give a maximum of $250,000 apiece for the 2005 event. As of January 30, 2009, the presidential committee raised more than $53 million, with at least 458 people giving the committee-imposed maximum of $50,000, including celebrity donors such as <a href="George%20Soros">George Soros</a>, <a href="Halle%20Berry">Halle Berry</a>, <a href="Jamie%20Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a> and <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>. Emphasizing a change from business as usual, the committee set stringent guidelines for campaign contributions, barring donations from corporations, <a href="political%20action%20committee">political action committee</a>s, registered federal <a href="lobbying">lobbyists</a>, <a href="labor%20unions">labor and trade unions</a>, <a href="Foreign%20Agents%20Registration%20Act">registered foreign agents</a> and non-<a href="United%20States%20nationality%20law">U.S. citizens</a>. The committee did accept donations from people with active lobbying interests before the federal government, but not registered as federal lobbyists, such as <a href="Google">Google</a> executive <a href="Eric%20Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> executive <a href="Steve%20Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a>.

Based on its fundraising efforts and crowd estimates for the Obama inauguration, the presidential committee set its budget at $160–$170 million for the inauguration, including about $45 million for the gala events. The <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a> contributed about $49 million, including $1.2 million to cover the actual swearing-in ceremony. The District of Columbia and the neighboring states of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> projected costs to provide support for inaugural events at more than $75 million alone for police, fire and medical services. To help fund the efforts, President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> declared a federal <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> as a precaution so that funds could be sought from <a href="Federal%20Emergency%20Management%20Agency">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>.

The Presidential Inaugural Committee and members of the <a href="111th%20United%20States%20Congress">111th U.S. Congress</a> distributed invitations and color-coded tickets to both <a href="Very%20Important%20Person">dignitaries</a> and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections on or near the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">U.S. Capitol</a> grounds to view the swearing-in ceremony. <a href="Invitations%20to%20the%20inauguration%20of%20Barack%20Obama">Invitations</a> and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses, but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S. politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry. <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‑come, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event.

Because of high demand and limited availability of the reserved tickets, some people planned to offer their tickets for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services. Sales offers for tickets reached as high as $1,750 each for the reserved standing room section behind the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol%20Complex">Capitol Reflecting Pool</a>, $5,500 each for the reserved standing room section in front of the Reflecting Pool and $20,000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds. In one case, a former legislative aide to Representative <a href="Ted%20Poe">Ted Poe</a> was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used <a href="Craigslist">Craigslist</a> and e‑mail to offer five tickets to the buyer for $4,500.

Federal and state officials became concerned about <a href="ticket%20resale">ticket scalping</a> and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, <a href="StubHub">StubHub</a> and <a href="eBay">eBay</a> agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S. Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill to die in the closing days of the <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29%23United%20States">lame duck</a> legislative session.

On January 17, 2009, Obama hosted a <a href="whistle%20stop%20train%20tour">whistle stop train tour</a> in honor of the 200th anniversary of the birth year of Abraham Lincoln. Obama reenacted the final part of Lincoln's 1861 train tour from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C. to capture the mood of the 1861 <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield</a> to Washington train tour traveled by Lincoln to his own <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%201861%20presidential%20inauguration">inauguration</a>. For his train ride to the nation's capital, Obama rode in the <a href="Georgia%20300">Georgia 300</a>, a vintage railroad car used by past presidents and the same one he used for touring Pennsylvania during his <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">presidential primary campaign</a>. On the tour, Obama was accompanied by his wife Michelle, their daughters Malia and Sasha, and a host of friends and guests.
For the train ride to Washington, Obama invited 41 "everyday Americans" that he met during his presidential campaign to accompany him on the tour and attend other inaugural events, including the swearing-in ceremony, the parade and an inaugural ball. The group of citizens who joined the tour had shared stories with then-candidate Obama about themselves and their families during the presidential campaign, and included Matt Kuntz and <a href="Lilly%20Ledbetter">Lilly Ledbetter</a>. Kuntz, who lost his own step‑brother to <a href="suicide">suicide</a> after returning home from the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, dedicated his efforts to improve mental health screening for <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> veterans. Ledbetter, who learned years later that her employer had discriminated against her in pay based on gender, lost her case before the Supreme Court because she did not file her claim within 180 days of the discriminatory act. Nine days after his inauguration, Obama as president signed into law the <a href="Lilly%20Ledbetter%20Fair%20Pay%20Act%20of%202009">Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</a>, allowing claims filed against employers not only within 180 days of the pay discrimination, but also restarting the 180-day period for claims upon receiving any paycheck based on a discriminatory pay action.

Obama commenced the tour in Philadelphia by holding a town hall meeting at <a href="30th%20Street%20Station">30th Street Station</a> with a few hundred supporters. At the first stop in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a> Vice President‑elect Biden and his family joined the tour. Biden, dubbed "Amtrak Joe" for his daily commutes on <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> between Wilmington and Washington, built a reputation as a supporter of increased funding for U.S. commuter <a href="rail%20transport">rail transport</a>ation. The train continued to <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>, its second stop, where Obama spoke to a crowd of about 40,000 people.

During his speeches to the crowds, he emphasized the theme "A New Birth of Freedom" using phrases associated with Lincoln such as "better angels" and "a new declaration of independence". Obama referred to <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">patriotic</a> forebearers in his speech when he reminded the crowds that "we should never forget that we are the heirs of that first band of patriots, ordinary men and women who refused to give up when it all seemed so improbable; and who somehow believed that they had the power to make the world anew." Thousands of well‑wishers gathered at various points along the train route taking pictures, cheering and waving <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20United%20States">American flags</a> and homemade signs, with Obama reciting his trademark rejoinder "I love you back" to the enthusiastic crowds. The one-day train tour concluded at <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Union Station</a> in Washington, D.C.

On January 18, 2009, the day after Obama arrived in Washington, D.C., an inaugural concert, "We Are One", took place at the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a>. The concert featured performances and readings of historical passages by more than three dozen celebrities. Attendance at the concert was free to the public, and <a href="HBO">HBO</a> broadcast the concert live on an open feed, enabling anyone with cable television to watch the event. An estimated 400,000 people attended the concert at the Lincoln Memorial. The <a href="Washington%20Metro">Washington Metro</a> recorded 616,324 passenger trips during the day, breaking the old Sunday ridership record of 540,945 passenger trips set on July 4, 1999.

The eve of the Inauguration Day, January 19, 2009, fell on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, a U.S. federal holiday in recognition of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Dr. King</a>'s birthday. Obama called upon communities everywhere to observe the King Day of Service, a day of citizen volunteer service honoring the human rights leader. More than 13,000 community service events took place across the nation on the day, the largest participation in the 14 years since Congress passed the King Holiday and Service Act and more than double the previous year's events.

Obama spent an hour at <a href="Walter%20Reed%20Army%20Medical%20Center">Walter Reed Army Medical Center</a> meeting privately with the families of troops who were recovering from wounds sustained in the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> and the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>. After visiting the medical center, he, along with <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20III">Martin Luther King, III</a>, headed to the Sasha Bruce House <a href="homeless%20shelter">homeless shelter</a> for teens to participate with others in service activities.

Joe Biden hung <a href="drywall">drywall</a> at a <a href="Habitat%20for%20Humanity">Habitat for Humanity</a> home in <a href="Northeast%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">N.E. Washington, D.C.</a> Biden's wife, <a href="Jill%20Biden">Jill</a>, their daughter, Ashley Biden, <a href="Michelle%20Obama">Michelle Obama</a> and the Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, spent the morning at <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20Stadium">Robert F. Kennedy Stadium</a> where they helped thousands of volunteers prepare more than 85,000 <a href="care%20package">care package</a>s destined for U.S. troops overseas. Later that evening, the President-elect hosted three separate bipartisan dinners to honor the service of <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, <a href="Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a> and Joe Biden.

On the evening of January 19, 2009, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden hosted the "Kids' Inaugural: We Are the Future" event at the <a href="Capital%20One%20Center">Verizon Center</a>. <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href="Demi%20Lovato">Demi Lovato</a>, and the <a href="Jonas%20Brothers">Jonas Brothers</a> honored military families in concert. The show was broadcast live on the <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney Channel</a> and on <a href="Radio%20Disney">Radio Disney</a>. Other celebrity participants included <a href="Bow%20Wow%20%28rapper%29">Bow Wow</a>, <a href="George%20Lopez">George Lopez</a>, <a href="Corbin%20Bleu">Corbin Bleu</a>, <a href="Queen%20Latifah">Queen Latifah</a>, <a href="Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> and <a href="Jamie%20Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a>. In keeping with the service theme of the day, Michelle Obama issued a call for children to become engaged in public service by volunteering in homeless shelters, visiting elderly people or writing letters to U.S. troops.

The Washington Metro recorded 866,681 passenger trips on January 19, breaking the single day ridership record of 854,638 passenger trips set on July 11, 2008.

The inaugural ceremony took place at the West Front of the United States Capitol on January 20, 2009. The ceremony opened with the playing of pre‑recorded music and a live performance by <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Band">"The President's Own" United States Marine Band</a>, followed by live performances by the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Boys%20Chorus">San Francisco Boys Chorus</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Girls%20Chorus">San Francisco Girls Chorus</a>. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the first woman to preside over a U.S. presidential inauguration, acted as the day's <a href="Master%20of%20Ceremonies">Master of Ceremonies</a>.
<a href="Evangelicalism">Evangelical</a> pastor <a href="Rick%20Warren">Rick Warren</a> delivered the <a href="invocation">invocation</a> for the inaugural ceremony, followed by a performance by vocalist <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>, who sang "<a href="My%20Country%2C%20%27Tis%20of%20Thee">My Country, 'Tis of Thee</a>". The program featured a performance of <a href="John%20Williams">John Williams</a>' composition "<a href="Air%20and%20Simple%20Gifts">Air and Simple Gifts</a>", which was both pre-recorded and performed live synched with the recording by cellist <a href="Yo-Yo%20Ma">Yo-Yo Ma</a>, violinist <a href="Itzhak%20Perlman">Itzhak Perlman</a>, pianist <a href="Gabriela%20Montero">Gabriela Montero</a> and clarinetist <a href="Anthony%20McGill%20%28musician%29">Anthony McGill</a>. <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a> described the performance by the quartet as "a transporting moment that moved many with its beauty and calm", while "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called it the "classical-music equivalent of lip-syncing". Aretha Franklin made a fashion statement by wearing a hat with a distinctive <a href="Swarovski">Swarovski</a> crystal-studded bow.

Vice President‑elect Biden took his oath from <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Associate Justice</a> <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a>. After he completed his oath of office, Biden received in his honor as the new Vice President the first playing of four <a href="ruffles%20and%20flourishes">ruffles and flourishes</a> and the march "<a href="Hail%2C%20Columbia">Hail, Columbia</a>" by members of the armed forces. After the performance of "Air and Simple Gifts", <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20G.%20Roberts">John Roberts</a> administered the <a href="Oath%20of%20office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">oath of office</a> to President‑elect Obama shortly after noon. The inaugural ceremony ran longer than scheduled, which delayed the administering of the oath so that it finished around 12:05 pm EST (17:05 UTC). However, Obama assumed the presidency at the expiration of President Bush's term at noon under the <a href="Twentieth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. After he completed the presidential oath, Obama received in his honor as the new President the <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a>, and the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Chief">Hail to the Chief</a>" by members of the armed forces.

Obama delivered his inaugural address to the crowds as the President of the United States following his swearing-in ceremony. Poet <a href="Elizabeth%20Alexander%20%28poet%29">Elizabeth Alexander</a> then delivered the inaugural poem, "<a href="Praise%20Song%20for%20the%20Day">Praise Song for the Day</a>", and civil rights activist <a href="Joseph%20Lowery">Joseph Lowery</a>, minister of the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a>, delivered the <a href="benediction">benediction</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Band">United States Navy Band "Sea Chanters"</a> chorus concluded the ceremony with a performance of the United States national anthem, "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>".

Chief Justice <a href="John%20Roberts">John Roberts</a> administered the <a href="Oath%20of%20office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">oath of office</a> to Obama. Michelle Obama held the <a href="Lincoln%20Bible">Bible</a>, which was used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration, as Barack Obama placed his hand on the Bible and recited the presidential oath. Nearly four years earlier, then-Senator Obama had been one of 22 Senators to vote against Roberts during <a href="John%20Roberts%20Supreme%20Court%20nomination">Roberts' Supreme Court nomination</a>; the inauguration marked the first time a Chief Justice administered the oath to a President-elect who had previously voted against the Chief Justice's confirmation.

Roberts and Obama made several mistakes as they recited the oath. The proper wording for the oath of office is prescribed in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>:
Roberts had practiced for the ceremony carefully. However, a memo noting his planned pauses in the recitation of the oath failed to reach Obama's staff before the swearing-in. As a result, Obama inadvertently interrupted Roberts during the first phrase, stating "I, Barack" while Roberts was finishing "do solemnly swear". Obama then correctly repeated the entire phrase "I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear."

Roberts, who was not using notes, rendered the next phrase as "that I will execute the office of president to the United States faithfully," misplacing the word "faithfully" and saying "president to" instead of "president of". Obama repeated, "that I will execute", then paused. Roberts attempted to correct the wording, but stumbled: "the off– faithfully the pres– the office of President of the United States." Obama then repeated Roberts' initial incorrect wording.

Roberts ended the presidential oath by appending the phrase "so help you God" to the end of the constitutionally prescribed oath, and Obama responded "<a href="Oath%20of%20office%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States%23%26quot%3BSo%20help%20me%20God%26quot%3B">so help me God</a>" when he was prompted. Obama had asked previously to include "so help me God" after the oath. Roberts then congratulated Obama as the new President.

Much public discussion arose about the errors in administering and reciting the oath. Several constitutional scholars said that Obama should retake the oath. <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> constitutional scholar Jack Beermann suggested that while the courts would likely never even consider a challenge, he would still advise Obama to retake the oath if he were his lawyer since "the Constitution says what he's supposed to say."
Although <a href="Robert%20Gibbs">Robert Gibbs</a>, <a href="White%20House%20press%20secretary">White House press secretary</a>, indicated at first that President Obama did not plan to retake the oath, Chief Justice Roberts agreed to re-administer the oath at the request of <a href="White%20House%20counsel">White House counsel</a> <a href="Greg%20Craig">Greg Craig</a>. The second oath ceremony took place on the evening of January 21, 2009 in the <a href="Map%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">Map Room</a> of the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> before a small audience of presidential aides, reporters and a White House photographer. Craig said that the White House ultimately decided to re-administer the oath out of an abundance of caution. Craig added that "the oath of office was administered effectively and ... the President was sworn in appropriately ... But the oath appears in the Constitution itself." No Bible was present during the retake of the inauguration.

A central theme of President Obama's inaugural address was a call to restore responsibility—both in terms of accountability in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.

Obama concluded the second paragraph of his address by saying, "we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents." The speech reinforced words such as "legacy" and "heritage", as well as values such as "honesty", "courage" and "patriotism", which "are old" values. Near the end of the speech, Obama referred to words written by <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a> in "<a href="The%20American%20Crisis">The American Crisis</a>", which were ordered by <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> to be read to his troops: "Let it be told to the future world ... that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive ... that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet [it]." Because Obama's <a href="Barack%20Obama%20presidential%20campaign%2C%202008">campaign</a> message focused on the need for change, Mackin noted that Obama sought to reassure Americans that he would operate as President within the margins of the nation's traditions.

Obama's goal for his Inaugural speech was to stir the following response among Americans: "This is why I want to go into public service and be a better politician. This is why I want to go home and be a better parent, better worker, better citizen." 

As part of Obama's call for responsibility, he said "what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility—a recognition, on the part of every American" and "those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account." Obama quoted the lyrics of the <a href="Jerome%20Kern">Jerome Kern</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Fields">Dorothy Fields</a> song "<a href="Pick%20Yourself%20Up">Pick Yourself Up</a>" from the <a href="musical%20film">musical</a> <a href="comedy%20film">comedy</a> <a href="Swing%20Time%20%281936%20film%29">"Swing Time"</a>, saying that "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America." In an article for "The New York Times", columnist and former drama critic <a href="Frank%20Rich">Frank Rich</a> noted the link to the lyric in Field's song from the movie, writing that Obama offered in his address "one subtle whiff of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>".

Obama's speech contained several <a href="bible">biblical</a> references and was compared to oratory of the "<a href="black%20church">black church</a> tradition." Obama also highlighted the United States' religious diversity, referring to the country's "patchwork heritage" as a strength and saying, "We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and non-believers." This was the first time a United States President acknowledged <a href="Irreligion%20in%20the%20United%20States">American non-believers</a> in an inaugural address.

Obama's inaugural address received mixed reviews, with some describing the tone of the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents George W. Bush and <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a>. <a href="David%20E.%20Sanger">David E. Sanger</a>, chief Washington correspondent for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a>'s call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about the tone of the speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while <a href="Rahm%20Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a>, Obama's <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a>, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.

Obama's selections of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren had a history of vocal opposition to <a href="same-sex%20marriage">same-sex marriage</a>, and Lowery had a background as a <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for "forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes even when we differ.'" Warren mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that "as we leave this mountaintop, help us to hold on to the spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day "when <a href="brown%20people">brown</a> can stick around, when <a href="Mongoloid%20race">yellow</a> will be mellow, when the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">red man</a> can get ahead man and when <a href="Caucasian%20race">white</a> would embrace what is right".

After the inaugural ceremony, President Obama, <a href="First%20Lady">First Lady</a> <a href="Michelle%20Obama">Michelle Obama</a>, Vice President Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden escorted former President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and former First Lady <a href="Laura%20Bush">Laura Bush</a> to a departure ceremony on the east side of the U.S. Capitol. Before the luncheon and in keeping with tradition, President Obama signed his first <a href="Executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">presidential orders</a> in the President's Room at the Capitol, and then signed the guest book for the luncheon. The first order signed by Obama was a proclamation declaring his Inauguration Day a "National Day of Renewal and Reconciliation", in which he called "upon all of our citizens to serve one another and the common purpose of remaking this Nation for our new century". Next, Obama signed orders to officially present the nominations for his <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">Cabinet</a> and several sub‑Cabinet officials to the U.S. Congress for its approval. The Obamas and Bidens then attended an inaugural luncheon at the U.S. Capitol before traveling from there to the presidential reviewing stand at the White House to watch the parade.

As former President and Mrs. Bush began their journey to their <a href="Texas">Texas</a> home, the Obamas and Bidens joined several congressional guests for the inaugural luncheon in <a href="National%20Statuary%20Hall">National Statuary Hall</a> at the U.S. Capitol. Guests included top Washington lawmakers as well as former Presidents and Vice Presidents. Commemorating the <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%20Bicentennial">Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial</a>, the red and white china used during the luncheon were <a href="replica">replica</a>s of those used in the Lincoln White House.
A luncheon at the U.S. Capitol has been part of the inaugural program since 1953 (before that time, the luncheon was usually held at the White House and hosted by the outgoing President and First Lady). The menu for the 2009 inaugural luncheon, which often features dishes representative of the home states of the new President and Vice President, included seafood stew, duck and <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a> entrees with <a href="Pinot%20noir">Pinot noir</a> wine, and a dessert of apple cinnamon <a href="sponge%20cake">sponge cake</a> with sweet cream <a href="Candied%20fruit">glacé</a>. Since 1985, a painting has served as a backdrop for the head table. For the 2009 inaugural luncheon, the featured painting was <a href="Thomas%20Hill%20%28painter%29">Thomas Hill's</a> 1865 "View of the Yosemite Valley", a painting that commemorated Abraham Lincoln's 1864 signing of the <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park%23Yosemite%20Grant">Yosemite Grant</a>, which was the first time the federal government protected park lands for public use.

During the luncheon, Senator <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a> collapsed after suffering a <a href="Non-epileptic%20seizure">seizure</a>, and he was transported to a hospital for medical treatment. Early reports about the medical emergency suggested erroneously that Senator <a href="Robert%20Byrd">Robert Byrd</a>, the oldest member of the Senate, also fell ill during the luncheon. These reports were later denied, and Byrd, a longtime friend of Kennedy, eventually explained that the Kennedy incident disturbed him and caused him to leave.

The inaugural parade route ran along <a href="Pennsylvania%20Avenue%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Pennsylvania Avenue</a>, <a href="Northwest%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">N.W.</a> from the U.S. Capitol, ending at the north face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama traveled in the new armored <a href="Presidential%20State%20Car%20%28United%20States%29">limousine</a> because of potential security threats. The President and First Lady twice exited their limousine, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the parade. Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the parade route at several points with their children <a href="Beau%20Biden">Beau</a>, Hunter and Ashley.

The parade lasted more than two hours during the afternoon and early evening following the inaugural ceremony. Parade participants included 15,000 people, 240 horses, a <a href="mariachi">mariachi</a> band, dozens of marching bands, the <a href="Virginia%20Military%20Institute">Virginia Military Institute</a> corps of cadets, and two drum and bugle corps: <a href="The%20Cadets%20Drum%20and%20Bugle%20Corps">The Cadets</a> and the <a href="Colts%20Drum%20and%20Bugle%20Corps">Colts</a>. Obama invited the marching band from <a href="Punahou%20School">Punahou School</a>, his high school in Hawaii, to perform in the parade along with the marching unit of its <a href="Junior%20Reserve%20Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps</a>.

Vice President Joe Biden invited several groups from Delaware to march in the parade. The Delaware section was led by the <a href="Delaware%20Volunteer%20Firemen%27s%20Association">Delaware Volunteer Firemen's Association</a> of which Biden is an honorary member, the Fightin' Blue Hen Marching Band, The Pride of Delaware, from Biden's alma mater, the <a href="University%20of%20Delaware">University of Delaware</a>, and the <a href="Delaware%20State%20University">Delaware State University</a> Hornets Approaching Storm marching band.

<a href="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="astronaut">astronaut</a> <a href="Rex%20J.%20Walheim">Rex J. Walheim</a> marched in the parade carrying an American flag and wearing a prototype of NASA's next generation <a href="spacesuit">spacesuit</a>. Astronaut <a href="Michael%20L.%20Gernhardt">Michael L. Gernhardt</a> drove a prototype <a href="lunar%20rover">lunar rover</a> in the parade. In addition to Astronauts Walheim and Gernhardt, the crew of the <a href="STS-126">STS-126</a> <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Endeavour">Space Shuttle "Endeavour"</a> mission also marched in the inaugural parade.

President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended 10 official inaugural balls during the evening of January 20, 2009. Barack Obama wore a new <a href="Black%20tie">tuxedo</a> made by <a href="Hart%20Schaffner%20Marx">Hart Schaffner Marx</a>, a <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a>-based menswear company. He also wore a white bow tie, instead of the conventional black. Traditionalists considered this a fashion faux pas, as a white tie is conventionally only worn with a white waistcoat and tails. Michelle Obama wore a white, one-shouldered, sleeveless gown designed by 26-year-old <a href="Manhattan">New York</a>-based designer <a href="Jason%20Wu">Jason Wu</a>, breaking with the recent practice set by former first ladies Laura Bush and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who showcased designers from their hometowns.

The Neighborhood Inaugural Ball, one of six balls held at the <a href="Walter%20E.%20Washington%20Convention%20Center">Walter E. Washington Convention Center</a>, was the first stop of the evening for the President and First Lady. The Obamas danced their first song as <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles">Beyoncé Knowles</a> serenaded them with her rendition of the <a href="Glenn%20Miller">Glenn Miller</a> classic "<a href="At%20Last">At Last</a>". According to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball was the first ball ever with free or affordable tickets, a contrast to recent history in which "inaugural balls generally have been closed to everyday Americans, populated instead by an exclusive circle of dignitaries and donors." A portion of the tickets for the ball was reserved for Washington D.C. residents.

The nine other official inaugural balls attended by the Obamas that evening included:

President Obama and the First Lady also attended one inaugural ball during the evening of January 21, 2009.

After they made their formal visits to the circuit of January 20 inaugural balls, the Obamas hosted an after-midnight gathering at the White House for 70 of their earliest supporters, close friends and family. Guests who attended the after hours celebration at the White House included <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, <a href="Valerie%20Jarrett">Valerie Jarrett</a>, <a href="David%20Axelrod%20%28political%20consultant%29">David Axelrod</a>, Chicago Mayor <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard Daley</a>, Representatives <a href="Artur%20Davis">Artur Davis</a> of the state of Alabama and <a href="Neil%20Abercrombie">Neil Abercrombie</a> of the state of Hawaii, and Michelle Obama's brother <a href="Craig%20Robinson%20%28basketball%20coach%29">Craig Robinson</a>. Members of the Illinois congressional delegation also attended the after hours event, including Senator <a href="Dick%20Durbin">Dick Durbin</a> and Representatives <a href="Melissa%20Bean">Melissa Bean</a>, <a href="Jan%20Schakowsky">Jan Schakowsky</a>, <a href="Luis%20Gutierrez">Luis Gutierrez</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Costello">Jerry Costello</a>.

On January 21, 2009, President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, gathered at the <a href="Washington%20National%20Cathedral">Washington National Cathedral</a> for a national day of prayer. At the prayer service, the Obamas and Bidens were joined in the front pew by former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, who was sworn in as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> later that day. The prayer service was attended by about 3,200 other invited guests, including members of the U.S. Congress, diplomats and other dignitaries.
The theme of the interfaith worship service reflected inclusiveness and religious diversity, with a mix of <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> pastors, female <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> and <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> religious leaders, rabbis and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> and <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal</a> bishops who delivered scripture readings and prayers throughout the service. Prayers for the service drew from passages from the <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20George%20Washington">1789 inauguration</a> prayer service of George Washington and the 1865 inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln, including phrases such as "with malice toward none, with charity for all". The featured sermon for the inaugural prayer service was delivered by Reverend Sharon E. Watkins, general minister and president of the <a href="Christian%20Church%20%28Disciples%20of%20Christ%29">Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)</a> and the first woman to deliver the sermon for the inaugural prayer service. In her sermon, Watkins integrated passages from a variety of sources, such as passages summoned from sources rooted in the Hindu, <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a>, Muslim and <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> faiths.

In addition to the official events, groups and supporters held an array of gatherings and celebrations throughout Washington, D.C. and the surrounding region in the days before and the evening following the inauguration. One such event, a newly created "People's Inaugural Ball" was held for economically and physically disadvantaged people from across the United States who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Earl W. Stafford, a businessman from <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County</a>, Virginia, spent an estimated $1.6 million through his family's foundation to bring approximately 300 guests to Washington, D.C., hosting the ball on January 19, 2009 for a total of about 450 people. Clothing, shoes, tuxedos and hotel rooms for attendees were provided as part of the invitation.

Former Presidents <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a>, <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a>, <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> and former Vice Presidents <a href="Walter%20Mondale">Walter Mondale</a>, <a href="Dan%20Quayle">Dan Quayle</a>, <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a> and <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>, along with their respective wives, attended the inauguration, including <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who had been Obama's main opponent in the Democratic primaries (Clinton was attending as a former <a href="First%20Lady">First Lady</a>, not as the losing candidate.) Cheney was in a <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a> because of an injury that he suffered while moving boxes.

Congressman <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28Georgia%29">John Lewis</a>, the only living speaker from the historic 1963 rally at the <a href="March%20on%20Washington">March on Washington</a>, was present on the stage during the inauguration. More than 180 of the <a href="Tuskegee%20Airmen">Tuskegee Airmen</a> attended as invited guests for the inauguration. The five-person crew of <a href="US%20Airways%20Flight%201549">US Airways Flight 1549</a> attended the swearing-in ceremony, including <a href="Chesley%20Sullenberger">Chesley Sullenberger</a>, the pilot who <a href="Water%20landing%23Commercial%20aircraft">landed</a> the aircraft in the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> near <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> after losing both engines due to a <a href="bird%20strike">bird strike</a> just after departing <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">LaGuardia Airport</a>.

Eighty-seven-year-old <a href="Sarah%20Onyango%20Obama">Sarah Obama</a> led a group of Obama's <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>n relatives from his father's home village of <a href="Kogelo">Kogelo</a>. Other relatives who traveled from Kenya as guests included Obama's aunt, Maggie Obama, his uncle, <a href="Sayid%20Obama">Sayid Obama</a>, as well as his half-brother <a href="Malik%20Obama">Malik Obama</a>. Also, Kenya youth activist and Chair of the Martin Luther King, Jr Africa Foundation, Mwangi Mukami, attended the Inaugural events. Mwangi Mukami had served as Chair of the <a href="https%3A//www.reuters.com/article/2008/06/06/us-usa-politics-kenya-idUSL0651198320080606">Obama Worldwide Supporters Campaign</a> though it was unrelated to the official campaign. Joe Biden's son, <a href="Beau%20Biden">Beau</a>, <a href="Delaware%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General for the state of Delaware</a> and an officer and <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%27s%20Corps">Judge Advocate</a> in the <a href="Delaware%20Army%20National%20Guard">Delaware Army National Guard</a>, received a special furlough from serving in <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq</a> to participate in the ceremonies.

Celebrity guests included the actors <a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>, <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a> and <a href="Denzel%20Washington">Denzel Washington</a>, talk show host <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, singer <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles">Beyoncé Knowles</a>, director <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, boxer <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a>, and golfer <a href="Tiger%20Woods">Tiger Woods</a>.

No official count was taken of the number of people attending the inaugural ceremony, although multiple sources concluded that the ceremony had the largest audience of any event ever held in Washington, D.C. Government agencies and federal officials, who coordinated security and traffic management, determined the attendance count to be 1.8 million people based on information collected by several cameras and individuals on the ground. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reported the <a href="crowd%20size%20estimation">estimated crowd size</a> for the inaugural ceremony, and the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> said it did not contest the estimate.

<a href="Stephen%20Doig">Stephen Doig</a>, a professor at <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a>, estimated that 1.1 million people attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken a little less than 45 minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. Despite his crowd estimate, Doig stated that "if I had to bet, I would say the [Barack] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [Johnson] or any of the other things ... I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd." Approximately 1.2 million people had attended the <a href="second%20inauguration%20of%20Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson</a> in 1965.

Amid the massive crowds that arrived at the U.S. Capitol for the inauguration, about 4,000 ticket holders were unable to gain entry to reserved areas on the Capitol grounds after security personnel closed the gates at the start of the formal ceremony. Many ticket holders were stuck in underground tunnels where pedestrian traffic was directed to and from the <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a>. People dubbed one such tunnel "the <a href="Purple%20Tunnel%20of%20Doom">Purple Tunnel of Doom</a>", after the purple tickets that would-be viewers held. Others remained stuck in long lines as they waited to gain entry to the reserved areas. Senator Dianne Feinstein, in her capacity as chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, launched an investigation to address complaints by the affected ticket holders. The committee later announced that ticket holders who were unable to enter the Capitol grounds to view the ceremony would receive a copy of the swearing-in invitation and program, photos of President Obama and Vice President Biden and a color print of the inaugural ceremony.

Inauguration Day broke several records for the Washington Metropolitan Transit system. The 1,120,000 estimated Metrorail riders broke the record of 866,681 trips set the day before (which had broken the record set on July 11, 2008), and marked the first million trip day in the system's history. Metro also provided 423,000 bus trips and 1,721 MetroAccess trips for a total of 1,544,721 trips, the highest ridership day ever in the transit authority’s history. As of October 2018, the inauguration day crowd is still the largest in Metrorail history, but the <a href="2017%20Women%27s%20March">2017 Women's March</a> has the highest counted, not estimated, single day ridership of 1,001,613. In addition, the Sunday events helped Metro set a Sunday single-day record of 616,324 that is still largest Sunday crowd.

As with the 54th and 55th Presidential Inaugurations, in 2001 and 2005, respectively, the 56th Presidential Inauguration in 2009 was designated as a <a href="National%20Special%20Security%20Event">National Special Security Event</a> (NSSE), resulting in the United States Secret Service being the lead Federal agency for the development and implementation of the overall security plan; the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) being the lead Federal agency for counter terrorism, intelligence, and criminal investigation; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) being the lead Federal agency for crisis management in the aftermath of any terrorist attack, natural disaster or other catastrophic incident. The United States Capitol Police had primary responsibility for security and emergency response within the Capitol Complex to include the Inaugural Platform and the Inaugural Luncheon. The NSSE designation was made by Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, on December 10, 2008. The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington, D.C. for the inaugural activities, planners raised concerns about public safety and security. <a href="U.S.%20Army">Army</a> <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> Richard Rowe, head of the joint military task force for the Washington, D.C. area, explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats, especially in light of the <a href="2008%20Mumbai%20attacks">Mumbai attacks</a> in <a href="India">India</a> that occurred in November 2008. Attention was heightened by terrorist threats.
The police presence in the District of Columbia temporarily doubled, augmented by the addition of 8,000 police officers from around the United States. The police force was assisted by 1,000 <a href="FBI">FBI</a> agents to provide security for the event, and the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> <a href="Countersniper">Countersniper</a> team was assigned to hidden locations throughout the area. The <a href="Transportation%20Security%20Administration">Transportation Security Administration</a> had over 300 officers from its National Deployment Force on hand to assist the Secret Service with security inspections of attendees entering the National Mall. Ten thousand <a href="National%20Guard%20of%20the%20United%20States">National Guard</a> troops were on site, with 5,000 troops providing security duty in a ceremonial capacity and 1,300 unarmed troops aiding <a href="United%20States%20Park%20Police">Park Police</a> in crowd control at the National Mall. C Company of the 1–175 <a href="Infantry">Infantry</a> provided security between the first and second public viewing areas of the National Mall at the 7th Street, N.W. intersection, while the remaining members performed other security functions. The <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> implemented additional airspace restrictions over Washington, D.C. between 10:00 am and 6:00 pm on January 20, 2009. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Robert%20Gates">Robert Gates</a> was chosen as the <a href="designated%20survivor">designated survivor</a> to ensure <a href="continuity%20of%20government">continuity of government</a> in case of catastrophe, and he spent Inauguration Day at a U.S. military installation outside of the Washington, D.C. area.

No one from the crowds at the swearing-in ceremony or parade was arrested on Inauguration Day. According to a senior federal agent associated with managing security, the fact that no arrests were made by any agency during the inaugural events was unheard of for a record crowd of nearly two million gathering in Washington, D.C. In the 2009 book "<a href="In%20the%20President%27s%20Secret%20Service">In the President's Secret Service</a>", author and journalist <a href="Ronald%20Kessler">Ronald Kessler</a> said intelligence officials received information that individuals associated with <a href="Al-Shabaab%20%28Somalia%29">Al-Shabaab</a>, a <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>-based <a href="Islamism">Islamist</a> insurgency group, might try to disrupt the inauguration. More than a dozen counter-sniper teams were stationed along the inauguration parade route in response, and the criminal records of nearby employees and hotel guests were scrutinized, but no such attack took place. Kessler also reported a number of perceived inadequacies in the security during the inauguration, including an instance in which more than 100 major campaign donors and VIPs were able to board "secure" buses without being checked.

<a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen television ratings</a> indicated that 29.2% of televisions in the 56 largest <a href="United%20States%20metropolitan%20area">media markets</a> in the United States were tuned to the inauguration, the largest audience since <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s first <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%201981%20presidential%20inauguration">inauguration in 1981</a> and nearly double the <a href="viewership">viewership</a> of the 2005 inauguration of George W. Bush. The Raleigh-Durham market had the largest TV audience with more than 51% of households tuned into the day's events, a number attributed in part to a snowstorm that kept people inside and in part to the large African American population in that community. Of the top 10 media markets in terms of viewership, four were in North Carolina, two were in Virginia and one was in Maryland, with the Washington D.C. market ranking second highest in television viewership. In addition, schools and workplaces across the country allowed viewing of the inauguration because the event occurred on a weekday.

As measured between 10:00 am and 5:00 pm EST, U.S. television viewership for the Obama inaugural events achieved an average of 37.8 million across 17 broadcast and cable channels, not including <a href="online">online</a> viewers who watched live streaming video of the events. Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S. television viewership of 37.8 million across both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S. television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8 million across the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> and <a href="NBC">NBC</a> broadcast networks alone.

Measurements of television viewership in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> showed that <a href="Germany">Germany</a> drew the largest audience for the Obama inauguration at 11 million viewers, followed by <a href="France">France</a> at 7 million and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> at 5.1 million.
According to the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC), 6.5 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched highlights of the inauguration during its early evening news program.

The Obama inauguration resulted in a surge of Internet traffic to news and social networking websites and a record number of <a href="video%20streams">video streams</a>. <a href="CNN">CNN</a> reported that it generated more than 21 million video streams by 3:30 pm EST that day—an all-time record, in addition to receiving 136 million <a href="page%20view">page view</a>s that day. At one point during the surge of <a href="Web%20traffic">traffic</a> to view the Obama inauguration, the BBC reported downtime during its own live video feed at its website. The heavy website traffic caused the BBC video feed to cut out for 30 minutes, with web visitors seeing the message "Please come back later" instead of the live video footage.

The technology company <a href="Akamai%20Technologies">Akamai</a> reported that 5,401,250 web users logged on news sites in less than one minute, the fifth highest peak among news websites since the company started tracking data in 2005. During at-peak usage, news websites served seven million simultaneous video streams, which was the highest number of simultaneous video streams in Akamai's history. The Obama inaugural ceremony not only achieved the highest Internet viewership for a U.S. presidential inauguration, the inaugural event was the first to feature a live audio description of a swearing-in ceremony and the first to include <a href="closed%20captioning">closed captioning</a> in the live <a href="webcast">webcast</a> of the event.

The <a href="international%20community">international community</a> paid unprecedented attention to the inauguration of Barack Obama. Millions of people, including citizens of numerous countries around the world and American <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a>s living in those countries, watched the Obama inauguration live on television and on the Internet. In some countries, the Obama inauguration garnered as much viewership as the <a href="opening%20ceremony">opening ceremony</a> of the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a>.

Celebrations surrounding the inauguration, praise of the event's significance and congratulations to Obama on his inauguration were internationally diverse. In <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, the home country of Obama's father, people celebrated the inauguration as a public holiday. <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>ns and Americans in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> watched the inauguration at a free midnight ball featuring performances by students from <a href="State%20Elementary%20School%20Menteng%2001">State Elementary School Menteng 01</a>, the school that Obama attended as a child. The city of <a href="Obama%2C%20Fukui">Obama</a> in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> celebrated the event with fireworks, bell-ringing and hula-dancing at the Hagaji Temple. <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="Micha%C3%ABlle%20Jean">Michaëlle Jean</a> and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a> of <a href="Canada">Canada</a> extended congratulations on behalf of Canadians, while <a href="President%20of%20Mexico">Mexican President</a> <a href="Felipe%20Calder%C3%B3n">Felipe Calderón</a> wished Obama "great success in the work as the new President of the United States". <a href="Israeli%20President">Israeli President</a> <a href="Shimon%20Peres">Shimon Peres</a> described Obama's inauguration as a "great day" for the United States, and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> noted that "The whole world is watching the inauguration of President Obama, witnessing a new chapter in both American history and the world's history."

Leaders of some countries reserved enthusiasm for the Obama inauguration, with coverage of the event even muted in some places. <a href="President%20of%20Cuba">Cuban President</a> <a href="Ra%C3%BAl%20Castro">Raúl Castro</a>, brother of former Cuban president <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a>, declared that "[Obama] looks like a good man, I hope he is lucky", while <a href="Ricardo%20Alarc%C3%B3n">Ricardo Alarcón</a>, president of the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20People%27s%20Power">Cuban legislature</a>, admitted in his comments about Obama that "the incoming [U.S.] president 'is a big question mark.'" <a href="Foreign%20Minister%20of%20Iran">Iranian Foreign Minister</a> <a href="Manouchehr%20Mottaki">Manouchehr Mottaki</a> expressed hope for openness for a new direction, noting that "if Obama chooses the right path, compensates the past, lifts hostility and U.S. hegemony, and revises the previous political mistakes, we will have no hostility." State-owned <a href="Channel%20One%20Russia">Channel One Russia</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>'s flagship early evening news show, covered Obama's presidential inauguration as a minor news story, devoting much of the day's airtime instead to the gas war with Ukraine. The <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> covered the Obama inauguration live on its state‑controlled <a href="China%20Central%20Television">China Central Television</a>, providing simultaneous translation into <a href="Standard%20Mandarin">Mandarin Chinese</a> with a brief delay to allow <a href="Censorship%20in%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">censoring</a> of Obama's comments. When President Obama mentioned "earlier generations faced down <a href="fascism">fascism</a> and <a href="communism">communism</a>", Chinese state television officials cut away abruptly from the televised speech and switched to a discussion in the studio. State-controlled print, radio and television media in <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a> provided no coverage or mention of the Obama inauguration in the hours after the event, opting instead to cover news about <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a> welcoming the North Korean ambassador.

Ordinary citizens in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> even viewed the new president with cautious optimism. One Iraqi citizen opined that "If [Obama] can do as well as he talks, then all our problems are over", adding a belief that "[Obama] is a good man, but many people in Iraq believe all American presidents are the same and that we are a playground for their interests." Another citizen noted that "Obama won't get the same treatment,' ... 'But he won't have too long to prove himself to us.'"

William Barley

William Barley (1565?–1614) was an English bookseller and publisher. He completed an apprenticeship as a <a href="draper">draper</a> in 1587, but was soon working in the London book trade. As a freeman of the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Drapers">Drapers' Company</a>, he was embroiled in a dispute between it and the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Stationers%20and%20Newspaper%20Makers">Stationers' Company</a> over the rights of drapers to function as publishers and booksellers. He found himself in legal tangles throughout his life.

Barley's role in <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> music publishing has proved to be a contentious issue among scholars. The assessments of him range from "a man of energy, determination, and ambition", to "somewhat remarkable", to "surely to some extent a rather nefarious figure". His contemporaries harshly criticised the quality of two of the first works of music that he published, but he was also influential in his field.

Barley became the <a href="assignment%20%28law%29">assignee</a> of <a href="Thomas%20Morley">Thomas Morley</a>, who as well as being a composer held a <a href="printing%20patent">printing patent</a> (a monopoly of music publishing). He published <a href="Anthony%20Holborne">Anthony Holborne</a>'s "Pavans, Galliards, Almains" (1599), the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England. His partnership with Morley enabled him to claim rights to music books, but was short-lived. Morley gave work to the printer <a href="Thomas%20East">Thomas East</a>, and died in 1602. Some publishers ignored Barley's claims, and many music books printed during his later life gave him no recognition.

In a deposition of 1598, Barley refers to his age as "xxxiii yeeres or thereabowt", placing his date of birth around 1565. Evidence suggests that Barley may have been born in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>. Little else is known about his early life. Barley was in London by 1587, having completed an apprenticeship with the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Drapers">Drapers' Company</a> in that year. He trained as a bookseller under Yarath James, a small-time publisher. James operated out of a shop in Newgate Market, near Christ Church Gate, in the 1580s. His interest in ballads was shared by Barley, who published a number of them during his lifetime. By 1592, Barley had opened his own shop in the parish of <a href="St%20Peter%20upon%20Cornhill">St Peter upon Cornhill</a>, whose register recorded his marriage to a Mary Harper on 15 June 1603 and christenings and burials of people associated with his family. He conducted business out of this shop for the next twenty years.

Barley is probably the same William Barley who opened a branch office in <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. This action brought him into conflict with the authorities. Barley most likely relied on his assistant, William Davis, to run the Oxford shop while he maintained the business at St Peter upon Cornhill. Davis was arrested in 1599 because Barley had failed to register as a bookseller with <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>. The two redeemed themselves though, and in 1603, Barley and Davis were admitted as "privileged persons" of Oxford University. Privileged status at Oxford allowed tradesmen to practice their trade free from the jurisdiction of the town's authorities.

Barley ran afoul of London authorities as well. In September 1591, a warrant was issued for his arrest, although the charge is unknown. Barley also found himself in the midst of a longstanding feud between the Drapers' Company and the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Stationers%20and%20Newspaper%20Makers">Stationers' Company</a>. At the time, the latter held a monopoly over the publishing industry; the Drapers' Company wanted its members to be able to function as publishers and booksellers as well, insisting that it was the "custom of the City" to grant its freemen the right to engage in the book trade.

From 1591 to 1604, Barley was associated with at least 57 works. The exact nature of his involvement is, at times, hard to identify. Some works were printed "for" him, others were "to be sold by" him, and two state that they were printed "by" him. He partnered with notable printers and publishers during this period, including <a href="Thomas%20Creede">Thomas Creede</a>, <a href="Abel%20Jeffes">Abel Jeffes</a>, and <a href="John%20Danter">John Danter</a>. With Creede, Barley was involved in the publication of "<a href="A%20Looking%20Glass%20for%20London%20and%20England">A Looking Glass for London and England</a>" (1594) and "<a href="The%20True%20Tragedy%20of%20Richard%20III">The True Tragedy of Richard III</a>" (1594). During this period, Barley entered none of these works in the <a href="Stationers%27%20Register">Stationers' Register</a> (by entering a title into the register, a publisher recorded their rights to the work). This is probably due to the Stationers' feud with the Drapers'; the Stationers' viewed the ability of non-members to enter works into the register as a special privilege. Thus, Barley relied on others, such as Creede, Jeffes, and Danter, to enter these titles. Whether Barley merely acted as a bookseller for the enterers or, in private agreements with them, actually retained the rights to some of the works remains unclear.

In 1595, the Stationers' Company fined Barley 40 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s for illicitly publishing a number of works. Three years later, the organisation sued him and a fellow draper, Simon Stafford, for allegedly publishing <a href="Printing%20patent">privileged books</a>. A raid on Barley's former premises found 4,000 copies of the "Accidence", a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> grammar book protected by monopoly. Despite pleading his innocence in court, Barley, along with Stafford, Edward Venge, and <a href="Thomas%20Pavier">Thomas Pavier</a> (who was Barley's apprentice), was found guilty and sentenced to prison. The lawsuit affirmed the Stationers' Company's control over the Elizabethan book trade. Stafford, Pavier, and other draper-booksellers joined the company within a few years so that they could continue their trade. Curiously, Barley did not join them until 1606. The reasons for the delay are debated among scholars. <a href="Bibliography">Bibliographer</a> J. A. Lavin suggests that the Stationers' Company rejected Barley because he had no experience in the printing business. Gerald D. Johnson believes that his partnership with <a href="Thomas%20Morley">Thomas Morley</a>, who held a royal patent on music publishing, allowed him to circumvent any legal obstacles. The Stationers' Company could not interfere with the publication of works under royal grant.

In Elizabethan England, music printing was regulated by two royal patents issued by the queen: one for <a href="metrical%20psalter">metrical psalter</a>s (<a href="psalm">psalm</a>s set to music) and one for all other types of music and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly—only they or their assignees could legally print music. After printer <a href="John%20Day%20%28printer%29">John Day</a>'s death in 1584, the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son <a href="Richard%20Day%20%28printer%29">Richard Day</a> and was administered by his assignees, who were members of the Stationers' Company. The more general one was awarded to composers <a href="Thomas%20Tallis">Thomas Tallis</a> and <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a> in January 1575. Despite the monopoly, Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of <a href="Latin">Latin</a> <a href="motet">motet</a>s called "Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur" failed to sell and was a financial disaster. After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding the patent, producing works with his assignee, <a href="Thomas%20East">Thomas East</a>. The monopoly expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley to take advantage of the resulting power vacuum.

In 1596, despite not having access to a proper music <a href="font">fount</a>, Barley (using the services of Danter and his wood blocks) published "The Pathway to Music", a <a href="music%20theory">music theory</a> book, and "A New Booke of Tabliture", a tutor for the <a href="lute">lute</a> and related instruments that included compositions by <a href="John%20Dowland">John Dowland</a>, <a href="Philip%20Rosseter">Philip Rosseter</a>, and <a href="Anthony%20Holborne">Anthony Holborne</a>. Both featured numerous errors, and for the latter, Barley seems not to have gained prior publishing approval from the composers. Dowland disowned "A New Booke of Tabliture", calling his lute lessons "falce and unperfect", while Holborne complained of "corrupt coppies" of his work being presented by a "meere stranger". Modern <a href="musicologist">musicologist</a>s have labelled the publication "exasperating" and "seedy". Morley criticised "The Pathway to Music", stating that the author should be "ashamed of his labour", and that "[v]ix est in toto pagina sana libro" ("there is scarcely a page that makes sense in the whole book"). Despite their flaws, both works seem to have been instrumental in introducing music tutor books to the London market.

Two years later, Morley was awarded the same printing monopoly that Byrd had held. Morley's pick of Barley as an assignee (rather than experienced printers such as East or <a href="Peter%20Short%20%28printer%29">Peter Short</a>, both of whom had previously worked with Morley) is surprising. Morley may have been looking for help in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees. At that time, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly. Barley, however, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley published "The Whole Booke of Psalmes" and <a href="Richard%20Allison%20%28composer%29">Richard Allison</a>'s "Psalmes of David in Metre". The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East's 1592 publication of the same name. This work, although pirated and filled with small errors, provides some evidence of Barley's editorial skill; musicologist Robert Illing notes that if Barley "is to be discredited for roguery, he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination" for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket-sized production. In Allison's work, the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter. Duly provoked, Day sued. The outcome of his lawsuit is not known, but neither Barley nor Morley ever published another metrical psalter.

Under Morley, Barley published eight books. The covers of each indicated that they were "printed by" Barley, but examination of the typography reveals this to be unlikely. At least two of the works contain designs that seem to belong to a device used by London printer Henry Ballard. Significant among these eight works is Holborne's "Pavans, Galliards, Almains" (1599), the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England, and the first edition of Morley's influential "The First Booke of Consort Lessons" (1599).

Barley's relationship with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley had turned to East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable to rely on the protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came under increasing pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds</a>. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.

Barley evidently decided that it was futile to continue resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the <a href="copyright">copyright</a>s on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into <a href="Stationers%27%20Register">the Company's register</a>, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books without the consent of East or his wife.

Despite the settlement recognising his claim to Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly found it difficult to enforce his rights, even with his new role as a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took <a href="Thomas%20Adams%20%28publisher%29">Thomas Adams</a> to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.

Barley himself published four books under his patent. In March 1612, one of Barley's servants died, possibly from <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>. After receiving charitable remuneration from the Stationers' Company, Barley moved, first to the parish of <a href="St%20Katherine%20Cree">St Katherine Cree</a>, and later to a house on <a href="Bishopsgate">Bishopsgate</a>. Records from <a href="St%20Botolph-without-Bishopsgate">St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate</a> indicate his burial on 11 July 1614. His widow, Mary, and their son, William, were legatees of the will of Pavier. Mary Barley, who later remarried, transferred five of her husband's patents to printer John Beale. Some of Barley's remaining copyrights may have also been passed to the printer <a href="Thomas%20Snodham">Thomas Snodham</a>.

Dustbin Baby (film)

Dustbin Baby is a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television film directed by <a href="Juliet%20May">Juliet May</a>, based on <a href="Jacqueline%20Wilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a>'s 2001 <a href="Dustbin%20Baby">novel of the same name</a>. It was first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> on 21 December 2008. The film stars <a href="Dakota%20Blue%20Richards">Dakota Blue Richards</a> as April, a troubled teenager who was abandoned in a <a href="dustbin">dustbin</a> as an infant, and <a href="Juliet%20Stevenson">Juliet Stevenson</a> as Marion Bean, April's adoptive mother. <a href="David%20Haig">David Haig</a> stars as Elliot, Marion's friend and colleague. The screenplay was written by <a href="Helen%20Blakeman">Helen Blakeman</a>, and the film was produced by <a href="Kindle%20Entertainment">Kindle Entertainment</a>. "Dustbin Baby" deals with themes including <a href="maternal%20bonding">maternal bonding</a>, <a href="bullying">bullying</a>, and <a href="Juvenile%20delinquency">youth crime</a>. The story revolves around April running away on her fourteenth birthday, while Marion searches for her. April's life is recounted in <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> as she meets people and visits places that are significant to her.

Both Wilson and critics responded positively to the film, with Wilson saying she thought it was the best film adaptation of any of her works. It was released on DVD on 12 January 2009. "Dustbin Baby" was awarded the <a href="International%20Emmy">International Emmy</a> in the Children and Young People category at the 2009 ceremony. Helen Blakeman won a <a href="Children%27s%20BAFTA%23British%20Academy%20Children%27s%20Awards">Children's BAFTA</a> for the screenplay, while the film itself was shortlisted for a Children's BAFTA in the Drama category and shortlisted for the Kids' Vote award. The film was also awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for Best One-off, Special, or TV movie aimed at a Family Audience and the KidScreen Award for Best Acting.

On April's fourteenth birthday, Marion, her adoptive mother, gives her earrings, not the mobile phone she wanted. They argue, and April leaves for school. After lying to her friends, claiming she has a phone and is going to the dentist's, April chooses to be truant. While at work at a <a href="stately%20home">stately home</a>, Marion hears that April has not arrived at school. She talks to her friend and colleague Elliot, who unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her from leaving. April visits the home of Pat Williams, who cared for her as a baby. Pat remembers April and gives her a newspaper cutting telling the story of her discovery as a baby in a dustbin behind a pizza parlour. 

In a flashback, a five-year-old April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship was an <a href="domestic%20abuse">abusive</a> one, that lead to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realizes that they were lied to. April leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to visit Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and meets Elliot in a shopping center. April visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. 

In a flashback, an eight-year-old April lives at the Sunnyholme and is cared for by a woman, Mo. April befriends an older girl, Gina, and is introduced to Pearl, a girl her own age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April when Mo is not around. Gina wakes April up one night to join in on a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water. Pearl also tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, and pushes her down a flight of stairs. She is reprimanded by Mo. A <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a> from 14-year-old April says Gina was then "moved on", and, eventually, April is also moved on.

The flashback jumps forward to April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Marion Bean. A Homework project on family trees leads to a fight. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and when she learns about her history, she apologizes for the family tree incident. 

Banned from going out on a Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. 

April goes to the alley where she was found as a baby, and stands among the trash bins. Marion opens April's cell phone and calls Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number on the side of a dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.

The film's screenplay was based on <a href="Jaqueline%20Wilson">Jaqueline Wilson</a>'s 2001 novel "<a href="Dustbin%20Baby">Dustbin Baby</a>", and was written by <a href="Helen%20Blakeman">Helen Blakeman</a>, who had previously worked on "<a href="Pleasureland">Pleasureland</a>". "Dustbin Baby" was co-commissioned by <a href="CBBC">CBBC</a> and <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>, and was produced by <a href="Kindle%20Entertainment">Kindle Entertainment</a>, a production company specialising in children's television. According to "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", the film was billed as "a key part of BBC1's Christmas family line-up". Blakeman said that when she had read the novel, she "knew it was something [she] had to write". The film's executive producers were Anne Brogan and Melanie Stokes for Kindle, with Sue Nott as executive producer for CBBC. The producer was Julia Ouston. Director <a href="Juliet%20May">Juliet May</a>, at the time of filming, had 14-year-old twins, and so found "the fact that the lead, April, is 14 years old ... very interesting" as she felt she could "kind of understand 14-year-old children".

Though the "gritty realism" of Wilson's novels was different from <a href="Dakota%20Blue%20Richards">Dakota Blue Richards</a>'s first role as <a href="Lyra%20Belacqua">Lyra Belacqua</a> in "<a href="The%20Golden%20Compass%20%28film%29">The Golden Compass</a>", she was happy to take on the character of April. She said she "can really relate to the characters" in Wilson's novels, but found that April was "a really different person" to her. Wilson, who had previously seen Richards in "The Golden Compass", was "over the moon to hear she was going to be in "Dustbin Baby". Richards was to play the 14-year-old April, but other actresses were required to play younger versions of the character. Lucy Hutchinson, who was five at the time of filming, played the youngest April. Director Juliet May described her as "one of the most remarkable five year olds I have ever met", saying that "it's like she's not acting at all". Alex Hewitt was selected to play the "middle April". May described her as having "utter truth in her acting". Though ten years old, Hewett plays April at eight.

Juliet Stevenson said she was attracted to the part of Marion as "it's very boring playing versions of yourself", and because she did at the time have a 14-year-old daughter. David Haig filmed "Dustbin Baby", along with three other television appearances that summer, to earn money to help support his family while he appeared in the play "<a href="Loot%20%28play%29">Loot</a>". He described his role as a "snug cameo with a purpose". "Dustbin Baby" was filmed over summer 2008 in London and the surrounding areas, with scenes at <a href="Hatfield%20House">Hatfield House</a> and in <a href="Chipping%20Barnet">Barnet</a>. Before the completion of the filming, Wilson was quoted as saying she was "thrilled at the prospect of "Dustbin Baby" being brought to life by such a talented cast and production team. I am looking forward to seeing the end result immensely."

The BBC purposefully searched for an actress with Asperger syndrome to play the part of Poppy. <a href="Lizzy%20Clark">Lizzy Clark</a> auditioned for the part after her mother saw an advert on an autism website. Clark was selected to play Poppy, and the role in "Dustbin Baby" was her first experience of professional acting. Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with her mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said "My Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else."

Blakeman said that she read the book in a single sitting, before "crying her eyes out". The film includes the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and <a href="Adolescent%20psychology">teenage angst</a>. For Blakeman, April's "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." <a href="Tom%20Sutcliffe%20%28broadcaster%29">Tom Sutcliffe</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", spoke of the limits of taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer "a unique take" on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself."

On "Behind the Bin", a making-of documentary about "Dustbin Baby", Wilson said that "lots and lots of people will identify with" the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April "went on a journey to try and find herself" as "a lot of people [her age] try and do that because a lot of people get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the <a href="Motif%20%28narrative%29">motif</a> of April's <a href="paper%20doll">paper doll</a>s, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is "still the same person", but that she is "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's "only real friends".

Stevenson described the character of Marion as "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying "it is easier for me than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke of the character of April, saying that "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [April] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is".

Wilson, after seeing an early screening of "Dustbin Baby", said that it was the best film adaptation of any of her works. Haig said that the film was his favourite of his summer projects, saying "it was a terrific story and very touchingly done. I think Juliet Stevenson was very funny and moving in it". During its initial run on BBC One, "Dustbin Baby" was watched by 2.3 million viewers, giving it a 15.4% share of the audience.

Critics responded positively to the film. In an article in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" David Chater awarded the programme the TV choice of the day, describing it as "tremendous", and "the wonderful surprise of Christmas". The film was described in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>" as a "rare treat", as it is "something that teenagers and parents can watch together". This view was shared by producer Anne Brogan, who said that the film was something "that parents and children will enjoy watching while giving them much to talk about". Tom Sutcliffe, writing for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", said Stevenson was "good as a woman who was far more comfortable in the past than the present", and that "her performance was more than matched by that of Dakota Blue Richards as April, mostly banked-down and wary but prone to sudden wild flashes of anger". He criticised some of the "implausibilities", saying that the plot was, at times, "a lot kinder than the world might have been", but said that "it still made you well up with its final reconciliation" with emotion that had been "honestly earned". Euan Ferguson, in an article in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", said that the film "hooked and haunted", and added that Stevenson played Marion like "a kind of updated" <a href="Jean%20Brodie">Jean Brodie</a>.

In 2009, "Dustbin Baby" was one of four works of children's television shortlisted for the <a href="International%20Emmy%20Award">International Emmy Award</a> in the children and young people category at the 37th International Emmy Awards. The other nominations were "<a href="Lharn%20Poo%20Koo%20E-Joo">Lharn Poo Koo E-Joo</a>" (produced by Workpoint Entertainment), "<a href="The%20Little%20Emperor%27s%20Christmas">The Little Emperor's Christmas</a>" (produced by <a href="Rede%20Globo">Rede Globo</a>), and "<a href="Mille%20%28TV%20series%29">Mille</a>" (produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation). The film was one of nine nominations for the UK, which had more than any other nation. The film won the award, making it one of six International Emmys for the UK, and one of three for the BBC, in 2009. "Dustbin Baby" was also shortlisted for the <a href="British%20Academy%20Children%27s%20Awards">British Academy Children's Awards</a> in the drama category, along with "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>" (also by the BBC), <a href="S4C">S4C</a>'s "<a href="Rhestr%20Nadolig%20Wil">Rhestr Nadolig Wil</a>", and the <a href="Internet%20television">online</a> show following boyband <a href="US5">US5</a>. The ceremony was held on 29 November at <a href="The%20London%20Hilton%20on%20Park%20Lane">The London Hilton on Park Lane</a> and hosted by <a href="Dick%20and%20Dom">Dick and Dom</a>. "Dustbin Baby" lost out to "Rhestr Nadolig Wil". Blakeman was shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Award for best writer, thanks to her screenplay for "Dustbin Baby", and won. The film was also entered into the BAFTA Kids' Vote in the television category. Children aged between seven and fourteen were able to vote for their favourite television show from a choice also featuring "<a href="Blue%20Peter">Blue Peter</a>", "<a href="Dani%27s%20House">Dani's House</a>", "<a href="Newsround">Newsround</a>", "<a href="Prank%20Patrol%20%28Britain%29">Prank Patrol</a>", "The Sarah Jane Adventures", "<a href="Hannah%20Montana">Hannah Montana</a>", "<a href="Phineas%20%26amp%3B%20Ferb">Phineas & Ferb</a>", "<a href="iCarly">iCarly</a>", and "<a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>". The Kids' Vote was won by "Hannah Montana".

In February 2010, "Dustbin Baby" was awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for best one-off, special, or TV movie aimed at a family audience. The film also won the Creative Talent award for best acting. These were two of five prizes won by CBBC at the inaugural KidScreen Awards, and Joe Godwin, the BBC Children's director, said "I'm truly delighted that CBBC programmes are being recognised globally for being original and inspiring to children everywhere ... It's especially satisfying to win awards for really distinctive and hard-hitting factual and drama, which has always been, and always will be, a unique and central part of what BBC Children's does."

"Dustbin Baby" was released on DVD in January 2009 by <a href="ITV%20DVD">ITV DVD</a>. It was rated <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification%23Current%20certificates">PG</a> by the <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">British Board of Film Classification</a>, due to "mild threat, violence and one sex reference", and was marketed with the <a href="tagline">tagline</a> "April is about to lift the lid on her past". The DVD included a 24-minute <a href="making-of">making-of</a> feature, "Behind the Bin: The Making of Dustbin Baby", containing interviews with <a href="Jacqueline%20Wilson">Jacqueline Wilson</a> and production staff and cast.

Ron Hamence with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

<a href="Ron%20Hamence">Ron Hamence</a> was a member of <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian cricket team of 1948</a>, which toured England and was undefeated in its 34 matches. As a result of this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England, the team earned the nickname "The Invincibles".

A right-handed <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">middle-order</a> batsman, Hamence was not instrumental in the team's success. Regarded as the last batsman to be chosen for the team, his selection was the subject of controversy because many batsmen who had scored more runs in the preceding Australian season had been overlooked. Hamence and <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a> were the only squad members who did not play a <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> on tour. Hamence was used in non-Test tour matches so that the leading batsmen could conserve energy for the Tests, as play was scheduled for six days a week. Along with <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>, Hamence and McCool called themselves "ground staff" because of their scant playing duties in the major matches, and they often created and sang ironic songs about their lack of opportunities. Bradman was reluctant to risk the team's unbeaten record and as a result, Hamence did not receive many opportunities to bat high in the order, something that was the subject of criticism.

Hamence scored 582 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> at a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 32.33, with a top-score of 99. He was the only frontline Australian batsman not to score a <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>. The remaining eight frontline batsmen each scored at least 973 runs and all averaged no less than 47.30. Hamence also occasionally opened the bowling in the tour matches with his <a href="fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">gentle medium pace</a>, allowing the team's leading bowlers to recuperate between Tests.

During the preceding 1947–48 season in Australia, Hamence was dropped from the national team. He had played sporadically in the Test team, being selected in three of the ten matches in the previous two seasons. In those three Tests he scored a total of 81 runs at an average of 27.00. Returning to domestic cricket following his omission, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a>, a performance which kept him in the running for a place in the national team. His selection for the 1948 tour of England under Bradman was the subject of considerable controversy, as many other batsmen were overlooked despite being more productive during the Australian summer. For his part, Bradman described his middle-order—Hamence among them—as "an array of batsmen who could scarcely fail". From the start, Hamence was on the outer with regards to selection in the Tests. He was not selected for any of the Tests during the English campaign, but in a 2008 interview, emphasised that he felt no resentment over his omission. Hamence was a popular member of the touring party and his cheerful nature and splendid <a href="tenor">tenor</a> voice added to the good spirits of the team. His roommate during the tour was the seamer <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>.

Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. Being a fringe member of the squad and having made only sporadic Test appearances in previous seasons, Hamence was not selected. Australia promptly crushed the hosts <a href="The%20result%20in%20cricket%23Statement%20of%20result">by an innings</a>.

Hamence made his debut on English soil in the second tour match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>. Batting at No. 6, he came in at 4/344 and made only seven. His <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissal</a> triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings. The next match against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">damp pitch</a> that suited slower bowling, was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour. Batting at No. 4, Hamence made 12 in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74. After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was <a href="run%20out">run out</a> after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively had only three wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. However, Australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> and <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a>, aided by a dropped catch and missed <a href="stumping">stumping</a>.

Hamence was rested as the Australians travelled to London to defeat <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> by an innings. He returned for the next match against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>. Elevated to No. 3 by stand-in captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, Hamence came in at 1/64 and put on a <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> of 176 with <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, ending with 92 as Australia piled on 4/414 and won by an innings. Hamence scored mainly from the back foot, and <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> opined "a nice innings it was, too, in its neat strokemaking". Hamence also bowled for the first time on tour, sending down three <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> for seven runs in the second innings without taking a wicket.

In the following match, Australia crushed <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin for the summer. On the first day, Australia set a world record by scoring 721, the most first-class runs added in one day. Halfway through the day, at 2/364, <a href="all%20rounder">all rounder</a> <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> came to the crease. A cavalier and carefree character, Miller resented Bradman's ruthless attitude towards annihilating the opposition and often refused to try when Australia were in an unassailable position. He deliberately let the ball hit the stumps and was out for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">golden duck</a>. Hamence came in and struck 46, adding 146 runs for the fifth wicket with <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a>. The partnership took only an hour, and Australia went on to win by an innings. Miller later said that one of his reasons for gifting his wicket was to protest the lack of opportunities given to Hamence and other fringe batsmen. Batting at No. 5 in the next match against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, Hamence made only three as Australia made 431 and proceeded to another innings victory.

The next match was against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage. Given Hamence's early struggles in the English conditions, which saw him make only 161 runs at 26.83 in his first six innings, while all of Australia's first-choice top six had made centuries, he was not selected; Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.

Recalled for the next match, against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> in Manchester, Hamence scored two while batting at No. 7 in the first innings and an unbeaten 49 at No. 6 in the second, putting on an unbeaten century partnership with Harvey as the match ended in a draw after the entire first day's play was lost to rain. His second innings was praised for the aesthetic quality. It was the first match on tour that Australia had failed to win. Hamence was rested for the following match against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, which was again drawn, before returning against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. He made five as Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195, the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead during the season. He did not get another chance with the bat as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets.

Hamence had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> at <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, the last county fixture before the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>. He came to the crease at 4/453 and made 34 in a stand of 96 with Harvey. His dismissal and Harvey reaching his 100 prompted Australia to <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declare</a> at 5/549. Bradman said that Hamence was "the unlucky player of the match" and that he was standing on the balcony ready to declare when Hamence fell on the last ball of the over. Australia went on to complete an innings victory. In the second innings, Hamence opened the bowling with <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>. He took an early wicket before ending the innings by claiming the last man to fall, a stumping by <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a> standing up to the stumps.

Since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the first five positions in Australia's Test batting order had regularly consisted of <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a>, <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, while the sixth position saw many occupants. All of the first five were selected for the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC, and retained their positions for the First Test.

This left one position for the remaining batsmen in the squad. Up to this point, Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with four centuries, and was on his third tour of England. Brown had played in the first-choice team in the matches against Worcestershire and the MCC. Harvey had accumulated 296 runs at 42.29, all rounder Loxton had 310 runs at 51.66, but was injured, while Hamence had made only 251 runs at 27.88 and was the only one of the four to not have scored a century. Hamence was overlooked while Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">out of position</a> in the middle-order while Barnes and Morris were preferred as the first-choice opening pair, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches where Australia fielded their first-choice team; Brown batted in the middle order. Bradman explained the decision in his memoirs: "Hamence was not in good enough form and Harvey scarcely ready". During the opening stages of the tour, Bradman spent little time talking to Hamence at practice sessions, leading analysts to conclude that the Australian skipper viewed Hamence as being highly unlikely to play in the Tests. Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets, although Brown struggled and made only 17.
Between Tests, Hamence earned selection for the match against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, batting at No. 4 and scoring 34; he partnered acting captain Hassett in a stand of 104 for the third wicket. He took 1/11 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the Second Test, which was against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, Hamence made 48 and six not out, and took a total of 1/17 as the game ended in a draw. He batted slowly and cautiously; Bradman gave him few opportunities, so he had to make the most of them. The first innings 48 was a determined performance on a sticky wicket that helped Australia to 249; Bradman felt that Hamence's grit was a notable factor in Australia managing to pass 200. Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. This was enough for Brown to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's, where Australia fielded an unchanged team. Australia went on to a crushing win by 409 runs but Brown made only 24 and 32.

The next match was against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and started the day after the Second Test. As the Test players were tired, Bradman gave them a lighter workload and assigned Hamence and Loxton to open the bowling. Both took two wickets and Hamence snared opposing captain <a href="Laurie%20Fishlock">Laurie Fishlock</a> and <a href="Eric%20Bedser">Eric Bedser</a> to end with 2/24. Brown injured a finger while fielding, so he was not able to bat in Australia's first innings. Hamence was thus elevated to open the batting. Hamence made a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, but Australia nevertheless took a 168-run lead. Hamence opened the bowling for the second time, although he was unable to take a wicket and ended with 0/30. In the second innings, Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside Loxton and they chased down the 122 runs for victory in less than an hour to complete a 10-wicket win.

For the following match against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> before the Third Test, Brown and Hamence did not play. Harvey made 95 and Loxton ended on 159 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> as Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest of the tour, underpinning an innings victory. As a result of the performance, Loxton seized Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at Old Trafford.

During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Hamence made 30 as Australia defeated <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> by ten wickets in their only county match before the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley</a>. Hamence was overlooked for the vacancy as Harvey was called in. Australia scored 3/404 to set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase; Harvey scored a century.

Immediately after the Test, Hamence made 21 at No. 6 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> by an innings. In the next match against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, Hamence was yet to bat when rain ended the match at 3/215 in Australia's first innings. He was rested as Australia defeated <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> by nine wickets. Hamence was recalled as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He made 14 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 10 in the second when Australia declared, having batted at No. 5 both times. In the last match before the Fifth Test, a non-first-class fixture against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, Hamence scored 24 batting at No. 6 in Australia's 282. The match was a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Hamence was overlooked for the Fifth Test, as Australia won by an innings to seal the series 4–0; the drawn Third Test was Australia's only non-victory.

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> and Hamence made 38. Hamence was the ninth man to fall as partners ran out and Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361. Despite this, they completed an innings victory. In the next match against the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England">Gentlemen of England</a>, Hamence batted at No. 7 and only had a limited opportunity to contribute, coming in at 5/532 and scoring 24 before Bradman declared at 5/610 when Hassett reached 200. Hamence bowled in both innings for a total of 1/41 as Australia won by an innings. In the next match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, Hamence put on 195 for the fifth wicket with <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> to take Australia to 4/501 with his score on 99. The other batsmen had all made centuries, and the Australian players were keen to see Hamence do the same. With his score on 99, the rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone. However, Hamence hit two balls from the middle of the bat, only to see them travel directly to the fielder, yielding no runs. Anxious to reach his century, Hamence then charged down the pitch and was then stumped for 99, his highest score for the season. According to Bradman, Hamence "fell to what everyone said was the best ball all day". Nevertheless, Australia won by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a>, Hamence made seven as Australia declared at 7/522. The match was washed out; Hamence bowled three overs without success in the hosts' only innings.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was the fixture against Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six players currently in England's Test team be allowed to play for the hosts. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, so Hamence was left out. Australia led by 312 on the first innings and were well in control, but the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>. Hamence batted once in each match, scoring six and 15 as Australia ended the tour with two innings victories.

During the tour, Hamence played 19 first-class matches and scored 582 runs at an average of 32.33. An occasional bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of <a href="seam%20bowling">medium pace</a> during the tour, he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches. He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball, occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first-choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests. Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week. In most of the matches, Hamence batted in the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7. Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30. and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, he seldom batted in the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target or time ran out.

Teammate Sid Barnes criticised the omission of Hamence from much meaningful cricket on the tour. Referring to the match against the Gentlemen of England, Barnes criticised the fact that Bradman, Hassett and himself all made centuries, while Hamence was only given a short innings in the lower order and was not out on 24 when Australia declared. As the tourists were already in a strong position, Barnes reasoned that Hamence "could have been sent in [at] <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">first wicket down</a>, where he batted with his <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">interstate team</a> ... Despite this, Hassett still went in before Hamence in the next game, against Somerset ... Hamence batted No. 6... but he should have been sent in No. 3."

Barnes reported that Hamence, along with the other frequent omissions <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a> and <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>, termed themselves the "ground staff". He added: "In the dressing room during <a href="County%20cricket">county games</a> they would break out into ironic song about the few chances they got." Loxton reported that these songs included the "odd risque <a href="limerick">limerick</a>". Bradman did later state that "because of the strong array of batsman ahead of him, [Hamence] seldom had an opportunity to make big scores" but "was an extremely useful reserve who could have been played in the Tests with confidence". Following the 1948 tour, Bradman described Hamence as "a fine batsman of the strictly orthodox type. Very sound and reliable with his game based on <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">driving</a>" and a "very safe fieldsman". Bradman added that Hamence had few opportunities because of Australia's batting strength but "always batted well and often at a critical moment made valuable runs". Bradman said that Hamence "could have been played in the Tests with confidence" and praised his contributions to team morale. Fingleton said "there was criticism of his selection in this side, but had the war not intervened he undoubtedly would have made a[n] [Ashes] trip before".

Typhoon Nabi

Typhoon Nabi (), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Jolina, was a powerful <a href="typhoon">typhoon</a> that struck southwestern <a href="Japan">Japan</a> in September 2005. The 14th <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named storm</a> of the <a href="2005%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season">2005 Pacific typhoon season</a>, Nabi formed on August 29 to the east of the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a>. It moved westward and passed about 55 km (35 mi) north of <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a> on August 31 as an intensifying typhoon. On the next day, the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> upgraded the storm to <a href="typhoon%23Intensity%20classifications">super typhoon</a> status, with winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>. The <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on September 2. Nabi weakened while curving to the north, striking the Japanese island of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a> on September 6. After brushing <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, the storm turned to the northeast, passing over <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> before becoming <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> on September 8.

The typhoon first affected the Northern Mariana Islands, where it left <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>2.5 million in damage, while damaging or destroying 114 homes. The damage was enough to warrant a disaster declaration from the United States government. While passing near <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, Nabi produced gusty winds and caused minor damage. Later, the western fringe of the storm caused several traffic accidents in <a href="Busan">Busan</a>, South Korea, and throughout the country Nabi killed six people and caused US$115.4 million in damage. About 250,000 people evacuated along the Japanese island of Kyushu ahead of the storm, and there were disruptions to train, ferry, and airline services. In Kyushu, the storm left <a href="Japanese%20yen">¥</a>4.08 billion (US$36.9 million) in crop damage after dropping 1,322 mm (52.0 in) of rain over three days. During the storm's passage, there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation. The rains caused flooding and landslides, forcing people to evacuate their homes and for businesses to close. Across Japan, Nabi killed 29 people and caused ¥94.9 billion (US$854 million) in damage. Soldiers, local governments, and insurance companies helped residents recover from the storm damage. After affecting Japan, the typhoon affected the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> of Russia, where it dropped the equivalent of the monthly precipitation, while also causing road damage due to high waves. Overall, Nabi killed 35 people, and its effects were significant enough for the name to be <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Pacific%20typhoon%20names">retired</a>.

On August 28, a large area of <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convection</a> persisted about 1,035 km (645 mi) east of <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. Located within an area of moderate <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a <a href="ridge%20%28meteorology%29">ridge</a> to the north. At 00:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 29, a tropical depression formed from the system, classified by the <a href="Joint%20Typhoon%20Warning%20Center">Joint Typhoon Warning Center</a> (JTWC) as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening, due to warm <a href="sea%20surface%20temperature">sea surface temperature</a>s in the area. At 12:00 UTC on August 29, the <a href="Japan%20Meteorological%20Agency">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm. As such, the JMA <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">named</a> the storm "Nabi". About 12 hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20scales%23Western%20Pacific">severe tropical storm</a>, after the convection organized into spiral <a href="rainband">rainband</a>s. At 18:00 UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> of 120 km/h (75 mph).

On August 31, Nabi passed about 55 km (35 mi) north-northeast of <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a> during its closest approach. The typhoon continued to intensify quickly as it moved to the west-northwest. On September 1, the JTWC upgraded the storm to a <a href="typhoon%23Intensity%20classifications">super typhoon</a> and later estimated peak one-minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph); this is the equivalent of a Category 5 on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson scale</a>. By contrast, the JMA estimated peak ten-minute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on September 2, with a <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of . While at peak intensity, the typhoon developed a large 95 km (60 mi) wide <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a>. For about 36 hours, Nabi maintained its peak winds, during which it crossed into the area of responsibility of <a href="PAGASA">PAGASA</a>; the Philippine-based agency gave it the local name "Jolina", although the storm remained away from the country.
On September 3, Nabi began weakening as it turned more to the north, the result of an approaching <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> weakening the ridge. Later that day, the winds leveled off at 155 km/h (100 mph), according to the JMA. On September 5, Nabi passed near <a href="Kitadait%C5%8Djima">Kitadaitōjima</a> and <a href="Yakushima">Yakushima</a>, part of the <a href="Dait%C5%8D%20Islands">Daitō</a> and <a href="%C5%8Csumi%20Islands">Ōsumi</a> island groups offshore southern Japan. Around that time, the JTWC estimated that the typhoon reintensified slightly to a secondary peak of 215 km/h (130 mph). After turning due north, Nabi made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Isahaya%2C%20Nagasaki">Isahaya, Nagasaki</a> around 05:00 UTC on September 6, after passing through the <a href="Amakusa">Amakusa</a> of Kumamoto. Shortly thereafter, the storm entered the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>. The typhoon turned to the northeast into the <a href="westerlies">mid-latitude flow</a>, influenced by a low over the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a>. At 18:00 UTC on September 6, the JTWC discontinued advisories on Nabi, declaring it <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a>, although the JMA continued tracking the storm. On the next day, Nabi moved across northern <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>. The JMA declared the storm as extratropical on September 8, which continued eastward until dissipating on September 10 south of the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>. The remnants of Nabi weakened and later moved into southwestern <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> on September 12.

After Nabi formed as a tropical depression on August 29, the local <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> office on Guam issued a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches">tropical storm watch</a> for the islands <a href="Tinian">Tinian</a>, <a href="Rota%20%28island%29">Rota</a>, <a href="Sapian">Sapian</a>, and <a href="Agrihan">Agrihan</a>. On August 30, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan, while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan. On all four islands, a <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20warnings%20and%20watches%23Tropical%20Cyclone%20Condition%20of%20Readiness">Condition of Readiness 1</a> was declared. The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate, and several schools operated as shelters. About 700 people evacuated on Saipan, and the airport was closed, stranding about 1,000 travelers. As a precaution, schools were closed on Guam on August 31, after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior. The island's governor, <a href="Felix%20Perez%20Camacho">Felix Perez Camacho</a>, also declared a condition of readiness 2, as well as a state of emergency. Due to the typhoon, several flights were canceled or delayed at <a href="Antonio%20B.%20Won%20Pat%20International%20Airport">Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport</a> on Guam.

Ahead of the storm, <a href="United%20States%20Forces%20Japan">United States Forces Japan</a> evacuated planes from Okinawa to either Guam or mainland Japan to prevent damage. Officials at the military bases on Okinawa advised residents to remain inside during the storm's passage. While Nabi was turning to the north, the island was placed under a Condition of Readiness 2. At the military base in <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Activities%20Sasebo">Sasebo</a>, ships also evacuated, and several buildings were closed after a Condition of Readiness 1 was declared.
In Kyushu, officials evacuated over a quarter of a million people in fear of Typhoon Nabi affecting Japan. These continued after the storm made landfall to protect residents from flood waters and landslides. The first order during the storm took place in the <a href="Arita%2C%20Saga">Arita district</a>. In <a href="Miyazaki%20City">Miyazaki City</a>, 21,483 households were evacuated following reports of significant overflow on the nearby river. Another 10,000 residences were vacated in <a href="Nobeoka">Nobeoka</a> following similar reports. The entirety of the <a href="West%20Japan%20Railway%20Company">West Japan Railway Company</a> was shut down. Canceled train services affected 77,800 people on <a href="Shikoku">Shikoku</a>. Ferry service was also shut down, cutting off transportation for tens of thousands of people. In addition, at least 723 flights were cancelled because of the storm. Japan's second-largest refinery, <a href="Idemitsu%20Kosan">Idemitsu Kosan</a>, stopped shipments to other refineries across the area, and Japan's largest refinery, <a href="Nippon%20Oil">Nippon Oil</a>, stopped all sea shipments. The <a href="Cosmo%20Oil%20Company">Cosmo Oil Company</a>, Japan's fourth largest refinery, stopped all shipments to <a href="Yokkaichi">Yokkaichi</a> and <a href="Sakaide">Sakaide</a> refineries. About 700 schools in the country were closed. Approximately 1,500 soldiers were dispatched to <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> to help coastal areas prepare for Typhoon Nabi's arrival, and to clean up after the storm. Officials in the <a href="Miyazaki%20Prefecture">Miyazaki Prefecture</a> issued a <a href="flood%20warning">flood warning</a> for expected heavy rains in the area.

In South Korea, the government issued a typhoon warning for the southern portion of the country along the coast, prompting the airport at <a href="Pohang">Pohang</a> to close, and forcing 162 flights to be canceled. Ferry service was also disrupted, and thousands of boats returned to port. The storm also prompted 138 schools to close in the region. Earlier, the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon <a href="Typhoon%20Rusa">Rusa</a> in 2002 or <a href="Typhoon%20Maemi">Maemi</a> in 2003, both of which were devastating storms in South Korea. Officials in the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a> issued a storm warning for <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>, advising boats to remain at port.

While passing between Saipan and the volcanic island of <a href="Anatahan">Anatahan</a>, Nabi brought tropical storm force winds to several islands in the Northern Mariana Islands. <a href="Saipan%20International%20Airport">Saipan International Airport</a> reported sustained winds of 95 km/h (59 mph), with gusts to 120 km/h (75 mph). Also on the island, Nabi produced 173 mm (6.82 in) of rainfall. The storm destroyed two houses and left 26 others uninhabitable, while 77 homes sustained minor damage, largely from flooding or roof damage. Nabi damaged 70–80% of the crops on Saipan and also knocked down many trees, leaving behind 544 tonnes (600 tons) of debris. The entire island was left without power, some without water, after the storm. On Tinian to the south, Nabi damaged or destroyed nine homes, with heavy crop damage. On Rota, there was minor flooding and scattered power outages. Farther south, the outer reaches of the storm produced sustained winds of 69 km/h (43 mph) at <a href="Apra%20Harbor">Apra Harbor</a> on Guam, while gusts peaked at 101 km/h (63 mph) at <a href="Mangilao%2C%20Guam">Mangilao</a>. Gusts reached 72 km/h (45 mph) at the international airport on Guam, the highest during 2005. The storm dropped 115 mm (4.53 in) of rainfall in 24 hours on the island. Flooding covered roads for several hours and entered classrooms at <a href="Guam%20Public%20School%20System%23Middle%20schools">Untalan Middle School</a>, forcing hundreds of students to evacuate. Damage in the region was estimated US$2.5 million. After Nabi exited the region, it produced high surf for several days on Guam and Saipan.

Later in its duration, Nabi brushed southeastern South Korea with rainbands. <a href="Ulsan">Ulsan</a> recorded a 24‑hour rainfall total of , while Pohang recorded a record 24‑hour total of . The highest total was 622.5 mm (24.5 in) of rainfall. The periphery of the storm produced gusts of 121 km/h (75 mph) in the port city of <a href="Busan">Busan</a>, strong enough to damage eight billboards and knock trees over. Heavy rains caused several traffic accidents and injuries in Busan, while strong waves washed a cargo ship ashore in Pohang. Throughout South Korea, the storm led to six fatalities and caused US$115.4 million in damages.

In the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a> of Russia, Nabi dropped about 75 mm (3 in) of rain, equivalent to the monthly average. Gusts reached 83 km/h (51 mph), weak enough not to cause major damage. During the storm's passage, high waves washed away unpaved roads in <a href="Severo-Kurilsk">Severo-Kurilsk</a>.

The outer rainbands of Nabi began affecting Okinawa on September 3. The storm's strongest winds ended up bypassing the island, and wind gusts peaked at 85 km/h (53 mph). Two elderly women were injured from the wind gusts. There were minor power outages and some houses were damaged. In the <a href="Amami%20Islands">Amami Islands</a> between Okinawa and mainland Japan, Nabi produced gusts of 122 km/h (76 mph) in <a href="Kikaijima">Kikaijima</a>. Waves of in height affected <a href="Amami%20%C5%8Cshima">Amami Ōshima</a>.
While moving through western Japan, Nabi dropped heavy rainfall that totaled over a three-day period in Miyazaki Prefecture, the equivalent to nearly three times the average annual precipitation. The same station in Miyazaki reported a 24‑hour rainfall total of , as well as an hourly total of . Within the main islands of Japan, Nabi dropped 228.6 mm (9 in) of rainfall per hour in the capital Tokyo.

During the storm's passage, there were 61 daily rainfall records broken by Nabi's precipitation across Japan. The rains from Nabi caused significant <a href="landslide">slope failures</a> and large accumulations of driftwood. The amount of sediment displaced by the rains was estimated at 4,456 m/km, over four times the yearly average. A total of 630 m (22,200 ft) of driftwood was recorded. However, the rainfall also helped to end water restrictions in <a href="Kagawa%20Prefecture">Kagawa</a> and <a href="Tokushima">Tokushima</a> prefectures. In addition to the heavy rainfall, Nabi produced gusty winds on the Japan mainland, peaking at 115 km/h (72 mph) in <a href="Muroto%2C%20K%C5%8Dchi">Muroto</a>. A station on <a href="Tobishima%20%28Yamagata%29">Tobishima</a> in the Sea of Japan recorded a gust of 119 km/h (74 mph). The typhoon spawned a <a href="Fujita%20scale">F1</a> tornado in Miyazaki, which damaged several buildings. In <a href="Wajima%2C%20Ishikawa">Wajima, Ishikawa</a>, Nabi produced a <a href="Foehn%20wind">Foehn wind</a>, causing temperatures to rise quickly.

Throughout Japan, Nabi caused damage in 31 of the 47 <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">prefectures</a>, leaving over 270,000 residences without power. Torrential rains caused flooding and landslides throughout the country. The storm destroyed 7,452 houses and flooded 21,160 others. Several car assembly plants were damaged in southwestern Japan, while others were closed due to power outages, such as Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi. In addition, the storm wrecked about 81 ships along the coast. On the island of Kyushu, damage in <a href="%C5%8Cita%20Prefecture">Ōita Prefecture</a> on Kyushu reached ¥11.7 billion (US$106 million), the fifth highest of any typhoon in the preceding 10 years; about 20% of the total there was related to road damages. In nearby <a href="Saga%20Prefecture">Saga Prefecture</a>, crop damage totaled about ¥1.06 billion (US$9.6 million), mostly to rice but also to soybeans and various other vegetables. Crop damage as a whole on Kyushu totaled ¥4.08 billion (US$36.9 million).

In the capital city of Tokyo, heavy rainfall increased levels along several rivers, which inundated several houses. Strong winds damaged ¥28.8 million (US$259,000) in crop damage in <a href="Gifu%20Prefecture">Gifu Prefecture</a>, and ¥27.1 million (US$244,000) in crop damage in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a>. In <a href="Yamaguchi%20Prefecture">Yamaguchi Prefecture</a> on western <a href="Honshu">Honshu</a>, Nabi damaged a portion of the historical <a href="Kintai%20Bridge">Kintai Bridge</a>, originally built in 1674. In <a href="Yamagata%20Prefecture">Yamagata Prefecture</a>, the winds damaged a window in a school, injuring several boys from the debris. One person was seriously injured in <a href="Kitakata%2C%20Fukushima">Kitakata, Fukushima</a> after strong winds blew a worker from scaffolding of a building under construction. Effects from Nabi spread as far north as Hokkaido, where heavy rainfall damaged roads and caused hundreds of schools to close. In <a href="Ashoro%2C%20Hokkaido">Ashoro</a>, an overflown river flooded a hotel, and a minor power outage occurred in <a href="Teshikaga%2C%20Hokkaido">Teshikaga</a>.

Ahead of the storm, high waves and gusty winds led to one drowning when a woman was knocked off a ferry in <a href="Takamatsu%2C%20Kagawa">Takamatsu, Kagawa</a>. A landslide in <a href="Miyazaki%2C%20Miyazaki">Miyazaki</a> destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing was found dead in a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people. Nabi caused a portion of the <a href="San%27y%C5%8D%20Expressway">San'yō Expressway</a> to collapse in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people. In <a href="Fukui%20Prefecture">Fukui Prefecture</a>, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him. Overall, Nabi killed 29 people in Japan and injured 179 others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at ¥94.9 billion (US$854 million).

After the storm, members of <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Iwakuni">Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni</a> provided $2,500 to the town of <a href="Iwakuni%2C%20Yamaguchi">Iwakuni</a> toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8 billion (US$53 million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6 billion (US$11.4 million). The total was split between ¥49 billion (US$44 million) in housing claims and ¥7.9 billion (US$71 million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas in the days after the storm, along with <a href="Japan%20Post">Japan Post</a>, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.

On November 8, nearly two months after the dissipation of Typhoon Nabi, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> declared a major disaster declaration for the Northern Mariana islands. The declaration allocated aid from the United States to help restore damaged buildings, pay for debris removal, and other emergency services. Federal funding was also made available on a cost-sharing basis for the islands to mitigate against future disasters. The government ultimately provided $1,046,074.03 to the commonwealth.

Due to the damage of the storm in Japan, the Typhoon Committee of the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> agreed to <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Pacific%20typhoon%20names">retire</a> the name "Nabi". The agency replaced it with the name "Doksuri", effective January 1, 2007, and was first used during the <a href="2012%20Pacific%20typhoon%20season">2012 Pacific typhoon season</a>.

Adenanthos obovatus

Adenanthos obovatus, commonly known as basket flower (which usually refers to "<a href="Centaurea">Centaurea</a>", though), or, jugflower, is a shrub of the <a href="plant">plant</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="Southwest%20Australia">Southwest Australia</a>. Described by French naturalist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> in 1805, it had first been collected by <a href="Archibald%20Menzies">Archibald Menzies</a> in 1791. Within the genus "<a href="Adenanthos">Adenanthos</a>", it lies in the <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "<a href="Adenanthos%20sect.%20Eurylaema">Eurylaema</a>" and is most closely related to "<a href="Adenanthos%20barbiger">A. barbiger</a>". "A. obovatus" has hybridized with "<a href="Adenanthos%20detmoldii">A. detmoldii</a>" to produce the hybrid "<a href="Adenanthos%20%C3%97%20pamela">A. × pamela</a>". Several common names allude to the prominent red flowers of the species. It grows as a many-stemmed spreading bush up to high, and about across, with fine bright green foliage. Made up of single red flowers, the <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s appear from April to December, and peak in spring (August to October).

The shrub grows on sandy soils in seasonally wet lowland areas as well as hills and dunes. It regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its underground <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. Pollinators include <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, particularly the <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a>, which can access the nectar with its long curved bill, and the <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a>, which punctures the flower tube. The most commonly cultivated "Adenanthos" species in Australia, it has a long flowering period and attracts honeyeaters to the garden. It is harvested for the <a href="Cut%20flowers">cut flower industry</a>.

The <a href="growth%20habit">growth habit</a> of "Adenanthos obovatus" is that of a <a href="lignotuberous%20shrub">lignotuberous shrub</a>, with many stems arising from a single underground lignotuber. It typically reaches about in height, and about 1.5 m in width, but plants occasionally reach a height of .

The leaves of this species are bright green, oval in shape, up to long and wide, <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a>, and arranged in a spiral pattern on the branches. The flowers appear steadily between April and December, and are most frequent between August and October. They are red or orange, and emerge from the leaf <a href="axil">axil</a>s. They are usually solitary, but occasionally an axil will carry two flowers. As with other <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a> species, each flower consists of a <a href="perianth">perianth</a> of four united <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s, and a single <a href="Gynoecium">style</a>. In "A. obovatus", the perianth is around long, and the style around . Although the flowering period is lengthy (six months), there are generally only a few flowers at any one time, and a seven-year study at Harry Waring Marsupial Reserve south of Perth revealed fairly constant flowering from year to year, even when shrubs were cut back to ground level to simulate a <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>.

The species is very similar to "<a href="Adenanthos%20barbiger">A. barbiger</a>". There are obvious differences in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of "A. barbiger" being very much longer and narrower than those of "A. obovatus". However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of "A. barbiger" have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of "A. obovatus". The most <a href="systematics">systematically</a> important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the perianth limb, which is rounded in "A. obovatus" and pointed in "A. barbiger"; the bracts, <a href="glabrous">glabrous</a> versus <a href="indumentum">hirsute</a>; and the style-ends, which are green and <a href="scarlet%20%28color%29">scarlet</a> respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: "A. barbiger" has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas "A. obovatus" flowers are scarlet to orange.

The first known botanical specimen collection of "A. obovatus" was made by Scottish surgeon and naturalist <a href="Archibald%20Menzies">Archibald Menzies</a> during the visit of the <a href="Vancouver%20Expedition">Vancouver Expedition</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in September and October 1791. However, this collection did not result in publication of the species. Other early collections include a specimen collected by Scottish botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> during the visit of <a href="HMS%20Investigator%20%281798%29">HMS "Investigator"</a> to <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a> in December 1801 and January 1802; and, thirteen months later, King George Sound specimens collected by <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Leschenault%20de%20la%20Tour">Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour</a>, botanist to <a href="Nicolas%20Baudin">Nicolas Baudin</a>'s voyage of exploration, and "gardener's boy" <a href="Antoine%20Guichenot">Antoine Guichenot</a>. In his notes on vegetation published in the official account of the expedition, Leschenault writes:

The species with rounded leaves was "A. obovatus".

A description of the species was published by <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a> in his 1805 "<a href="Novae%20Hollandiae%20Plantarum%20Specimen">Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen</a>", accompanied by a figure drawn by <a href="Pierre%20Antoine%20Poiteau">Pierre Antoine Poiteau</a> and engraved by <a href="Auguste%20Pl%C3%A9e">Auguste Plée</a>. Labillardière chose the specific name "obovata", in reference to the leaves of his specimen, which were <a href="obovate">obovate</a> (egg-shaped, with the narrow end at the base). This leaf shape is often seen in this species. The term "obovata" derives from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "ob-" ("inverse") and "ovum" ("egg"), and has <a href="feminine%20gender">feminine gender</a>, consistent with the gender assigned by Labillardière to the genus.

Labillardière did not acknowledge any collector, and so it was long thought that Labillardière himself had collected the first botanical specimens in 1792 while naturalist to <a href="Bruni%20d%27Entrecasteaux">Bruni d'Entrecasteaux</a>'s expedition in search of the lost ships of <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Galaup%2C%20comte%20de%20La%20P%C3%A9rouse">Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse</a>. However, this and eight other species described by Labillardière do not occur in any locations that he visited, suggesting that he obtained specimens from someone else whom he failed to credit. Though he did not specify a <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> for "A. obovata", a specimen upon which the accompanying figure in "Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen" appears to be based has been located; it is annotated, apparently in Labillardière's hand, as having been collected by Leschenault. <a href="Ernest%20Charles%20Nelson">Ernest Charles Nelson</a> states with certainty that Labillardière based this species on specimens collected by Leschenault, and this view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously.

In 1870, <a href="George%20Bentham">George Bentham</a> published the first infrageneric arrangement of "Adenanthos" in Volume 5 of his landmark "<a href="Flora%20Australiensis">Flora Australiensis</a>". Bentham divided the genus into two <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a>s, placing "A. obovata" in <a href="Adenanthos%20sect.%20Eurylaema">"A." sect. "Eurylaema"</a>, defined as containing those species with one <a href="sterility%20%28physiology%29">sterile</a> <a href="stamen">stamen</a>, and perianth tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle.

A <a href="phenetic">phenetic</a> analysis of the genus undertaken by <a href="Ernest%20Charles%20Nelson">Ernest Charles Nelson</a> in 1975 yielded results in which the members of "A." sect. "Eurylaema" occurred together, with "A. obovata" appearing most closely related to "A. barbigera" (now "A. barbiger"), and then "<a href="Adenanthos%20detmoldii">A. detmoldii</a>". "A. obovata" was therefore retained in "A." sect. "Eurylaema" in <a href="Ernest%20Charles%20Nelson">Ernest Charles Nelson</a>'s 1978 revision of "Adenanthos", and again in his 1995 treatment of the genus for the "<a href="Flora%20of%20Australia%20%28series%29">Flora of Australia</a>" series. By this time, the <a href="ICBN">ICBN</a> had issued a ruling that all genera ending in "-anthos" must be treated as having <a href="masculine%20gender">masculine gender</a>. Hence the species is now known as "Adenanthos obovatus". Its placement in <a href="Nelson%27s%20taxonomic%20arrangement%20of%20Adenanthos">Nelson's arrangement of "Adenanthos"</a> may be summarised as follows:

"Adenanthos obovatus" <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridises</a> with "<a href="Adenanthos%20detmoldii">A. detmoldii</a>" to produce <a href="Adenanthos%20%C3%97%20pamela">"A." × "pamela"</a>. Known only from road verges in the <a href="Scott%20River">Scott River</a> region, it was first discovered in 1979, and it is now known from more than twenty individual plants. The discovery of it in such large numbers, together with its recognised horticultural potential, prompted Nelson to formally describe and name it in 1986. Morphologically it is intermediate between its parents; that is, taller than "A. obovatus", with longer leaves and light red flowers. It is fertile, raising the possibility of the establishment of a <a href="hybrid%20swarm">hybrid swarm</a>.

It is also possible that "A. obovatus" infrequently hybridises with "<a href="Adenanthos%20barbiger">A. barbiger</a>": in 1921, <a href="Carl%20Hansen%20Ostenfeld">Carl Hansen Ostenfeld</a> described "A. intermedia" (now "A. intermedius"), based on specimens found near <a href="Ngilgi%20Cave">Ngilgi Cave</a> at <a href="Yallingup">Yallingup</a> with leaf shape intermediate between these two species. The new species was rejected in 1924 by <a href="Charles%20Gardner">Charles Gardner</a>, and again in the 1970s by Nelson, who argued that leaf shape is inappropriate grounds for erecting a new species in this context, and that, in terms of systematically important characteristics, "A. intermedius" is indistinguishable from "A. barbiger". He therefore synonymized "A. intermedius" with "A. barbiger", but noted the possibility that "A. intermedius" is of hybrid origin. Recently, however, a specimen collected by <a href="Greg%20Keighery">Greg Keighery</a> was held to represent a new species, provisionally named ""A. barbiger" subsp. "intermedius" (Ostenf.) Keighery ms" (later revised to ""Adenanthos" sp. Whicher Range (G.J. Keighery 9736)"), suggesting that Keighery, at least, does not consider "A. intermedius" to be of hybrid origin.

Common names for this species include "basket flower", "glandflower", "jugflower" and "stick-in-the-jug". In the King George Sound vicinity the <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal">Aboriginal</a> name "Cheeuk" is sometimes used.

Abundant and widespread, "A. obovatus" occurs on a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic <a href="pH">pH</a> range 3.9–5.4. Like most "Adenanthos" species it is common on deeply <a href="leaching%20%28pedology%29">leached</a> <a href="siliceous">siliceous</a> <a href="sandplain">sandplain</a> sand. It also occurs on gravelly <a href="quartz">quartz</a> sand derived from rock <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a>. It is rarely found on gravelly <a href="lateritic">lateritic</a> soils. It is also one of the few "Adenanthos" species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by "<a href="Adenanthos%20detmoldii">A. detmoldii</a>"—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.

Consistent with these <a href="edaphic">edaphic</a> preferences, "A. obovatus" is widespread and common in the <a href="scrubland">scrub</a> and <a href="heathland">heath</a> commonly found on the sandplains of <a href="Southwest%20Australia">Southwest Australia</a>, and is also common in the <a href="sedgelands">sedgelands</a> that develop in moister areas of the region. It is uncommon in forest or woodland areas, because these are usually associated with lateritic soils; but it may be found in stands of <a href="jarrah%20forest">jarrah</a> or <a href="marri%20forest">marri</a> forest where these grow in laterite-free sand. The climate in its range is <a href="mediterranean%20climate">mediterranean</a>, with annual rainfall from .

The species occurs in coastal regions of <a href="Southwest%20Australia">Southwest Australia</a>, from <a href="Gingin%2C%20Western%20Australia">Gingin</a> and <a href="Muchea%2C%20Western%20Australia">Muchea</a> north of <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a> south to <a href="Augusta%2C%20Western%20Australia">Augusta</a> and east along the south coast to <a href="Green%20Range">Green Range</a>, east of <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany</a>. It also occurs in the <a href="Stirling%20Range">Stirling Range</a>, a possible <a href="disjunct%20distribution">disjunction</a>; and at <a href="Narrogin">Narrogin</a>, a certain and substantial disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of "A. obovatus" would have been much more extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable <a href="refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugia</a>.

The <a href="western%20spinebill">western spinebill</a> ("Acanthorhynchus superciliosus") is the most frequent visitor to the flowers. A territorial species, the territories are smaller when they contain more "Adenanthos obovatus" bushes. Their long curved bills fit the tube-like flowers exactly, so that the pollen-presenter brushes against the spinebill's head while it is probing for nectar. The birds then carry pollen from plant to plant, fertilising other plants. A field study marking the pollen with fluorescent dye found that pollen could be deposited on flowers of plants up to away from the original flower visited. The <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater</a> ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae") and <a href="brown%20honeyeater">brown honeyeater</a> ("Lichmera indistincta") have also been recorded with pollen from "A. obovatus". The <a href="silvereye">silvereye</a> ("Zosterops lateralis") drinks nectar from the flowers, but punctures the tube with its short bill. Larger honeyeaters in one field study tended to avoid "A. obovatus", possibly seeking sources of more abundant nectar elsewhere. These species are too heavy for the fine branches and their bills are too large for the tubes.

"Adenanthos obovatus" has been recorded as a source of nectar for the <a href="honey%20possum">honey possum</a> ("Tarsipes rostratus") in winter and spring (early June to September), from field studies in the <a href="Scott%20National%20Park">Scott National Park</a>, replaced by "<a href="Adenanthos%20meisneri">A. meisneri</a>" in late spring and summer (late October to February).

"Adenanthos obovatus" is highly susceptible to dieback caused by the water mould "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>". Specimens in coastal dune vegetation were reported killed by the fungus "<a href="Armillaria%20luteobubalina">Armillaria luteobubalina</a>", with mycelial sheaths of the fungus beneath the bark of the root collar.

Described by <a href="Kenneth%20Newbey">Ken Newbey</a> as "an outstanding ornamental species with average foliage and very attractive in flower", "A. obovatus" was first grown in Great Britain in 1824, and is the most commonly cultivated "Adenanthos" species in Australia. It flowers for most of the year, is an excellent attractor of <a href="honeyeater">honeyeater</a>s, and grows in a range of climates. Propagation is by cuttings of the current season's growth, from which it strikes readily, and subsequently makes fairly quick growth. Despite its natural occurrence in damp locations, in cultivation it grows best in a light, well-drained soil. It prefers a sunny aspect. Regular hard pruning is recommended to maintain an attractive form. Wildflowers of this species are harvested by licensed pickers in the <a href="Cut%20flowers">cut flower industry</a>, for sale in both local and export markets. The long, curved stems with flowers in the leaf axils have been described as "excellent for picking".

Carabane

Carabane, also known as Karabane, is an island and a village located in the extreme south-west of <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, in the mouth of the <a href="Casamance%20River">Casamance River</a>. This relatively recent geological formation consists of a <a href="shoal">shoal</a> and <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a> to which soil is added by accumulation in the branches and roots of the <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> trees which cover most of the island. Along with the rest of <a href="Ziguinchor%20Region">Ziguinchor Region</a>, Carabane has a tropical climate, cycling between a <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a> and a <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>. The island was once considered an arid location where no useful plants were likely to grow, but it now supports several types of fruit tree, the most common of which are <a href="mango">mango</a>s and oranges. Although the nearby <a href="Basse%20Casamance%20National%20Park">Basse Casamance National Park</a> and <a href="Kalissaye%20Avifaunal%20Reserve">Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve</a> have been closed for years because of the <a href="Casamance%20Conflict">Casamance Conflict</a>, Carabane has continued to attract ornithologists interested in its wide variety of birds. Various species of fish are plentiful around the island, but there are very few mammals.

The earliest known inhabitants of the island were the <a href="Jola%20people">Jola</a>, the ethnic group which is still the most populous on the island. The <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> were active in the region from the 16th century onwards; however, they did not linger on "Mosquito Island", the mosquitoes and <a href="Simulium">black flies</a> convincing them to establish their trading post in the town of <a href="Ziguinchor">Ziguinchor</a> instead in 1645. On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of <a href="Kagnout">Kagnout</a> in return for an annual payment of 196 francs. A series of treaties between the French and the leaders of the local peoples ensued; however, the inhabitants of Carabane did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them, resulting in lootings and abductions among French rice farmers by the <a href="Karoninka%20people">Karoninka people</a>. In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with <a href="S%C3%A9dhiou">Sédhiou</a> in 1886. Since , the population of the island has gradually declined for a variety of reasons including periods of drought, the Casamance Conflict and, more recently, the sinking of the ferry "<a href="MV%20Le%20Joola">Joola</a>" in 2002. Much of the village's ability to trade and receive tourists was lost until 2014, when <a href="MV%20Aline%20Sitoe%20Diatta">MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta"</a> resumed ferry services to the island.

Although Carabane was once a regional capital, the village has since become so politically isolated from the rest of the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The <a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous</a> population was originally <a href="Animism">animist</a>, but although the sacred groves and <a href="Fetishism">fetishes</a> survive as cultural icons of <a href="Casamance">Casamance</a>, the <a href="Monotheism">monotheistic</a> belief systems of <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Senegal">Catholicism</a> and <a href="Islam%20in%20Senegal">Islam</a> have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as <a href="Elinkine">Elinkine</a> to continue their studies.

The testimonies of explorers and <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20heads%20of%20French%20S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal">colonial administrators</a> demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and <a href="palm%20wine">palm wine</a> production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role in the lives of the population. <a href="Palm%20oil">Palm oil</a> and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by <a href="artisan%20fishing">artisan fishing</a>, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have been reluctant to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.

The <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of Carabane remains unclear. It could be connected to the <a href="Wolof%20language">Wolof</a> word "karabané", which means "who speaks a lot," or possibly the <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> words "casa" and "acaba", which mean "house" and "finish," respectively. According to this hypothesis, the name means the place "where the houses are finished," a possible allusion to the fact that this village was the first French capital in Basse Casamance. According to other sources, the name comes from "karam akam", which means "the other side of the river." These uncertainties are augmented by the instability of the spelling: Karabane with an initial K suggests a <a href="Jola%20languages">Jola</a> or Wolof origin, while Carabane with a C would suggest a Latin derivation, most probably through Portuguese or <a href="French%20language">French</a>.

With a total area of , Carabane is the last major island in the mouth of the <a href="Casamance%20River">Casamance River</a> in south-west Senegal. It is situated 12° 32' N latitude and 16° 43' W longitude and is, by way of Elinkine, nearly away from <a href="Ziguinchor">Ziguinchor</a>, the capital of the <a href="Ziguinchor%20Region">region of the same name</a>, and a little over from Dakar, the country's capital.

""Il faut s'armer de patience pour rejoindre l'île de Carabane"" is a common French phrase which means "One must have patience to reach the island of Carabane". While this adage continues to hold true, it was even more appropriate in the 19th century when, according to one traveller, a 26-hour boat trip from <a href="Rufisque">Rufisque</a> (near <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>) to Carabane was deemed fairly short, and was credited to a favourable wind.

Despite the seemingly close proximity to its neighbouring communities, a motorized <a href="pirogue">pirogue</a> trip to Carabane from Elinkine, the nearest village, takes about thirty minutes; the trip once took an hour and a half by canoe. Carabane may also be accessed by a two- or three-hour boat trip from Ziguinchor. Travelling from <a href="Cap%20Skirring">Cap Skirring</a> via <a href="Cachouane">Cachouane</a> is also possible, but as a detailed map of the region would make clear, the channels of salt water are not easily navigated.

A recent geological formation, Carabane consists of a <a href="shoal">shoal</a> and <a href="alluvium">alluvium</a>. The alluvium has developed because of the saltwater streams that cut across the shoal. As pointed out by early French observers, soils in the region are generally composed of sand and clay, differing in mixture and layer according to natural and human factors. However, Carabane seems to be composed entirely of sand. The lack of clay is the reason that architecture on the island employs straw wrapped around wooden frames more often than banco mud bricks. This type of architecture is also common in the villages of <a href="Mlomp">Mlomp</a> and <a href="Seleki">Seleki</a>.

In this flat and marshy area, the branches and roots of <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> trees form dams where deposits of oyster shells naturally accumulate along with mud and plant detritus. These tangles help retain soil, a process which expands the island where the power of <a href="tidal%20race">tidal race</a> would normally have the opposite effect.

Rising just over , the southern portion of the island is partially flooded during the rainy season and totally submerged every few years. At low tide, mudflats are exposed so that boats with <a href="keel">keel</a>s are forced to dock a considerable distance from the island. When arriving at Carabane, the "Joola" had to stop about north of the village in of water.

The <a href="coastal%20erosion">coastal erosion</a> and salinization affecting the west of Senegal are also a source of concern on the island; signs of erosion have been observed in Carabane since 1849. The house of the government representative on the island has burned down twice; each time it was rebuilt, the site of the building had to be moved further and further inland. The island's erosion is evident when one considers that the original location of the house eventually became flooded, even at low tide. During the dry season the river has a <a href="River%20delta%23Tide-dominated%20deltas">tide-dominated delta</a>, with tidewater reaching 200 km upstream, while it is being concentrated 50% by evaporation.

Using wells, freshwater is available at a reasonable depth for irrigation and domestic purposes. Until the installation of a pump in 2006, however, drinking water had to be sent by boat from Elinkine.

The tropical climate of Basse Casamance cycles between a <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a> and a <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>, which usually starts in June and ends in October. Because of the proximity to the ocean, the humidity of the air remains above 40% and contributes to the abundance of vegetation. With the <a href="trade%20wind">trade wind</a>s from the <a href="Azores%20High">Azores High</a>, the island enjoys a pleasant climate year-round. In the north to north-east, these winds are cool and always wet. Their presence is appreciated by <a href="kitesurfing">kitesurfers</a>. Agricultural activities, including rice cultivation, depend entirely on rainfall. ""Wah uŋejutumu, emit elaatut"" is a <a href="Jola%20people">Jola</a> proverb which means "If a project will not be completed, it will be because the rain did not fall." The invocation of <a href="fetishism">fetishes</a> when there is no rain is part of traditional animist rituals. In recent decades, there has been a general decline in rainfall, which threatens rice production, increases <a href="soil%20salinity">soil salinity</a>, and contributes to the degradation of the mangroves. In May and June, air temperature is around . In January and February, the coldest months, it is around . Temperatures of below are quite rare. In September, the temperature of surface seawater is .

At one time, the island was considered an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce. In what has become a tropical climate, vegetation is more abundant than in the north of the country, especially during the wet season. Anxious to attract the attention of the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator <a href="Emmanuel%20Bertrand-Bocand%C3%A9">Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé</a> submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.

Most of Carabane is covered in mangroves, forming an impassable jungle that can only be crossed in constructed passages. Mangroves are among the few species capable of adapting to the highly saline environment, where the quantity of <a href="soil%20gas">oxygen in the soil</a> is low. In recent decades there has been concern that the mangroves are less prevalent. There are various reasons for the degradation, including <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and the unregulated exploitation of wood. Efforts have been made to safeguard the mangroves and to educate children about their importance.

Tourists are not as attracted to the island for its mangroves as for the coconut trees which line its beaches, as featured on many of Carabane's postcards. These palm trees are a valued resource on the island.

While not as plentiful as in other parts of Basse Casamance such as Mlomp, <a href="kapok%20tree">kapok tree</a>s are nonetheless present. Their grey wood is very light and easy to work, for which reasons it is used to construct many items, ranging from doors to <a href="Dugout%20%28boat%29">dugouts</a>. Jola canoes, which range from in length, are carved by <a href="adze">adze</a>s entirely out of one tree each, unlike the traditional Senegalese pirogue.

As for fruit trees, <a href="mango">mango</a>s and oranges are the most populous. <a href="Opuntia%20ficus-indica">Prickly pears</a>, <a href="Delonix%20regia">flamboyants</a>, and colourful <a href="bougainvillea">bougainvillea</a>s brighten the scenery of hotels and camps on the island. Various organizations have contributed to the <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> of the island.

The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While <a href="Basse%20Casamance%20National%20Park">Basse Casamance National Park</a> and <a href="Kalissaye%20Avifaunal%20Reserve">Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve</a> have not been open for years due to the <a href="Casamance%20Conflict">Casamance Conflict</a>, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: <a href="African%20darter">African darter</a> ("Anhinga rufa"), <a href="Goliath%20heron">Goliath heron</a> ("Ardea goliath"), <a href="palm-nut%20vulture">palm-nut vulture</a> ("Gypohierax angolensis"), <a href="black-tailed%20godwit">black-tailed godwit</a> ("Limosa limosa"), <a href="whimbrel">whimbrel</a> ("Numenius phaeopus"), <a href="Eurasian%20curlew">Eurasian curlew</a> ("Numenius arquata"), <a href="Caspian%20tern">Caspian tern</a> ("Sterna caspia"), <a href="blue-spotted%20wood-dove">blue-spotted wood-dove</a> ("Turtur afer"), <a href="red-eyed%20dove">red-eyed dove</a> ("Streptopelia semitorquata"), <a href="white-rumped%20swift">white-rumped swift</a> ("Apus caffer"), <a href="woodland%20kingfisher">woodland kingfisher</a> ("Halcyon senegalensis"), <a href="grey-backed%20camaroptera">grey-backed camaroptera</a> ("Camaroptera brachyura"), <a href="red-bellied%20paradise-flycatcher">red-bellied paradise-flycatcher</a> ("Terpsiphone rufiventer"), <a href="pied%20crow">pied crow</a> ("Corvus albus"), <a href="black-rumped%20waxbill">black-rumped waxbill</a> ("Estrilda troglodytres") and <a href="yellow-fronted%20canary">yellow-fronted canary</a> ("Serinus mozambicus").

Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter <a href="Carangidae">trevallies</a> ("Carangidae"), <a href="Giant%20African%20threadfin">Giant African threadfin</a>s ("Polydactylus quadrifilis"), <a href="great%20barracuda">great barracuda</a>s ("Sphyraena barracuda"), or <a href="African%20red%20snapper">African red snapper</a>s ("Lutjanus agennes"). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as <a href="southern%20pink%20shrimp">southern pink shrimp</a> ("Farfantepenaeus notialis"), <a href="Uca%20pugilator">sand fiddler crabs</a> ("Uca pugilator"), and <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>. The shellfish population consists mostly of <a href="mangrove%20oyster">mangrove oyster</a>s ("Crassostrea gasar"), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The <a href="Agama%20agama">red-headed agama</a> and <a href="monitor%20lizard">monitor lizard</a> make up the reptilian population of the island.

The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, <a href="bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a>s ("Tursiops truncatus") are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of <a href="Nile%20crocodile">Nile crocodile</a>s ("<a href="Crocodylus%20niloticus">Crocodylus niloticus</a>"), Senegalese manatees ("<a href="Trichechus%20senegalensis">Trichechus senegalensis</a>"), and breeding birds.

On an island called "Ilha dos Mosquitos" (Portuguese for "Mosquito Island"), the natives and their visitors continue to protect themselves with <a href="mosquito%20net">mosquito net</a>s and <a href="Shea%20butter">Shea butter</a>. They must also protect themselves from other, smaller insects which are no less troublesome: <a href="Simulium">black flies</a> ("Simulium").

The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the <a href="Bainuk%20people">Bainuk people</a> and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola. <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century, Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of <a href="wax">wax</a>, <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, and <a href="Slavery%20in%20Africa">slaves</a>. They did not linger on "Mosquito Island", instead founding their first <a href="trading%20post">trading post</a> at Ziguinchor in 1645.

In the late 1820s, a <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> trader from <a href="Gor%C3%A9e">Gorée</a>, Pierre Baudin, moved to <a href="Itou%2C%20Senegal">Itou</a> and began planting rice and producing <a href="Lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a> by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in <a href="lime%20kiln">lime kiln</a>s. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on <a href="weedy%20rice">weedy rice</a>, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the <a href="British%20people">British</a> in <a href="The%20Gambia">The Gambia</a>. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official <a href="Abolitionism">abolition</a> in the <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French colonial empire</a> in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.

The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the <a href="African%20slave%20trade">slave trade</a>, and also because of their competition with <a href="Saint-Louis%2C%20Senegal">Saint-Louis</a>. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of <a href="Diogue">Diogue</a>, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.

On January 22, 1836, the island was ceded to France by the village leader of <a href="Kagnout">Kagnout</a> at an annual cost of 196 francs. Still, another treaty made <a href="S%C3%A9dhiou">Sédhiou</a> the primary trading post of <a href="Casamance">Casamance</a>, and the exploitation of Carabane was left for some time in the hands of the Baudin family, first Pierre then his brother Jean. Each successively took on the title of Resident. With this official but ambiguous title, they were permitted to continue their trading operation so long as they regularly reported to France.

When Jean Baudin fell into disgrace due to a serious incident involving an English ship, he was replaced as Resident in October 1849 by Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé. This multilingual, enterprising businessman and <a href="Entomology">entomologist</a> from <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a> transformed "his" island, sparking a resurgence of commercial and political activity. In 1852, the population surpassed 1,000 inhabitants. A <a href="cadastre">cadastral map</a> assigned tracts of to traders and contractors. Other tracts of were allotted for housing. Provisional concessions were granted to residents of Saint-Louis and Gorée. Other than settlers, the island was mainly inhabited by animist Jola famers, whose practices were disconcerting to the settlers. Coexistence was not always easy. Christianity was practiced by the Europeans and some of the residents of Gorée, although the island did not yet have a church. Missionaries tried but were not permitted to settle on the island.

The construction of a wharf long allowed the berthing of larger vessels coming in from Casamance. A railed pier was built along the river in order to facilitate the transfer of goods. Carabane exported rice, but also <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, considered to be of poor quality, which was <a href="Cotton%20gin">ginned</a> in a factory built by Bertrand-Bocandé in 1840, owned first by <a href="Maurel%20%26amp%3B%20Prom">Maurel & Prom</a> and then by the Casamance Company. The factory also produced <a href="almond">almond</a>s and <a href="Carapa">crabwood</a> ("Carapa procera").

Bertrand-Bocandé became involved in local African politics during his time as Resident. When an intertribal conflict led to an armed raid of Carabane, he mediated the conflict. In 1850, the island's economic growth was disturbed because of an extensive livestock <a href="Raid%20%28military%29">raid</a> which precipitated further incidents the following year. In response to this conflict with the former owners of Carabane, the residents of Kagnout, Bertrand-Bocandé convinced the <a href="List%20of%20colonial%20heads%20of%20French%20S%C3%A9n%C3%A9gal">governor of Senegal</a> to send a warship to Carabane to frighten off the raiders. This single ship failed to faze the island's opponents, therefore Bertrand-Bocandé requested a detachment of soldiers and several other ships from the governor. When these reinforcements arrived from Gorée, the conflict was successfully ended. A treaty was signed on March 25, establishing the sovereignty of France not only in Casamance, but also in Kagnout and <a href="Samatit">Samatit</a>. For his involvement in the conflict, Bertrand-Bocandé was accepted into the "<a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>" and was given a <a href="Concession%20%28territory%29">land concession</a>. Bertrand-Bocandé left the island in 1857 for a leave of absence, but he abandoned his post as Resident in 1860. His tireless activity had a lasting effect on the island.
Meanwhile, the inhabitants of the new French territory did not recognize the authority of the treaties imposed upon them. For this reason, rice farmers in Carabane experienced lootings and abductions by the <a href="Karoninka%20people">Karoninka people</a>. Troops led by <a href="%C3%89mile%20Pinet-Laprade">Émile Pinet-Laprade</a> attacked the Karoninka villages in March 1860, forcing them to submission. A period of calm ensued. While the <a href="Mandinka%20people">Mandinka</a> Muslims continued, illegally, to practice slavery and trade, non-Muslim villages tended to come together, accepting the Resident of Carabane as the arbitrator of their disagreements.

In 1869, Carabane became autonomous, but it merged with Sédhiou in 1886. Its garrison of a dozen men was regularly stricken with tropical diseases such as <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. In 1877, 527 people were counted on the island, mostly Jola, but also some <a href="Wolof%20people">Wolof</a>s, Muslims, and a few <a href="Manjack%20people">Manjacks</a> from <a href="Portuguese%20Guinea">Portuguese Guinea</a>.

The first Catholic mission in Sédhiou was founded in 1875 and the first <a href="baptism">baptism</a>s were celebrated that same year in Carabane. There were 17 people baptised in total, most of whom were residents of the island. The <a href="Holy%20Ghost%20Fathers">Holy Ghost Fathers</a>' mission in Carabane was founded in 1880 by Father Kieffer. On February 22, he settled on the island, but he served for only two years. The staff of the colonial administration was small: the manager of a customs post with four employees, a <a href="Artillery">gunner</a>, a <a href="corporal">corporal</a>, and six European <a href="tirailleur">tirailleur</a>s. There were approximately 250 Christians in Carabane, mostly mulattos. The priest built his house out of <a href="Borassus">Palmyra palm</a> trunks. He visited nearby villages and sometimes went to Sédhiou. The founding of the mission in Carabane was followed by others in Ziguinchor (1888), Elinkine (1891), and several nearby locations in the 20th century. In 1900, a Spiritan missionary, Father Wintz, wrote the first <a href="catechism">catechism</a> in the Jola language.

Temporarily transferred to Ziguinchor, the Carabane mission closed in 1888. Missionaries returned in 1890 and, although they immediately expanded the church building, it was still not large enough to accommodate all those who wished to attend. Thanks to subsidies by the bishop, <a href="Magloire-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Barthet">Magloire-Désiré Barthet</a>, and to donations by the parishioners, a new church was built and inaugurated on the Catholic <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> of <a href="Saint%20Anne">Saint Anne</a> in 1897. The mission also obtained two adjacent properties, lot #73 on the cadastral map. By the following year, the Christian community had performed 1,100 baptisms, as well as many <a href="catechumen">catechumen</a>.

Competition between the French and the Portuguese began to show itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in <a href="Cacheu">Cacheu</a> and <a href="Farim">Farim</a> asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was negotiated in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain <a href="Henri%20Brosselard-Faidherbe">Brosselard-Faidherbe</a>.

In 1901, the administrative capital of Casamance was transferred from Carabane to Ziguinchor, a status which was transferred in turn to <a href="Oussouye%20Department">Oussouye</a> two years later. By 1904, Carabane had lost several of its amenities, including its customs services, which were centralized. The island's trading houses were abandoned and the number of Christians dwindled from 1,000 to 300 by 1907.

Despite the <a href="Anti-clericalism">anti-clerical</a> movement's growth in France at the time, education in Carabane continued to be administered by the Holy Ghost Fathers for the boys and by the <a href="Sisters%20of%20St.%20Joseph%20of%20Cluny">Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny</a> for the girls. A chapel also continued to be run on the island.

In 1913, just before the outbreak of , Carabane suffered a fire which caused its business to decline. People gradually left the island in search of work in Ziguinchor and even <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>. In December 1915, <a href="Marcel%20de%20Coppet">Marcel de Coppet</a>, administrator of Ziguinchor, visited the island in order to recruit <a href="Senegalese%20Tirailleurs">tirailleurs</a>. Six inhabitants of the island accepted the position: a Christian, a pagan, and four Muslims.

In the aftermath of the Great War, the <a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20Senegal">Roman Catholic Church</a> encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, <a href="Thi%C3%A8s">Thiès</a>, <a href="Ngazobil">Ngazobil</a>, <a href="Joal">Joal</a>, <a href="Fadiouth">Fadiouth</a>, <a href="Foundiougne">Foundiougne</a>, <a href="Kaolack">Kaolack</a>, Ziguinchor, <a href="Bignona">Bignona</a> and <a href="Banjul">Banjul</a>. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of <a href="Islam%20in%20Senegal">Islam in the country</a>.

In taking leadership of the <a href="diocese">diocese</a>, Archbishop <a href="Louis%20Le%20Hunsec">Le Hunsec</a> noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, had lost its influence and now had fewer than 500 inhabitants. He considered transferring the mission to Oussouye, which became a reality in 1927. Starting in 1937, the mission in Oussouye also performed baptisms and funerals in Carabane.

In the same year, a <a href="reform%20school">reform school</a> was created on the island, operating until 1953, when it was replaced by another in <a href="Nianing">Nianing</a>. A report submitted in 1938 by an educational advisor to Marcel de Coppet, Governor General of <a href="French%20West%20Africa">French West Africa</a>, detailed the daily life of the prisoners in the school which housed up to 22 boys, mostly convicted for theft but also occasionally for murder.

Carabane's population continued to decline gradually after . In 1950, the construction of a seminary was planned in Carabane, but it was transferred to a new building in <a href="Nyassia">Nyassia</a> in 1959. The Carabane mission closed its doors during the wet season of 1953, 83 years after its inception. The nuns and their interns moved to Ziguinchor.

<a href="History%20of%20Senegal%23Independence">Senegal's independence</a> was declared on August 20, 1960, and after the dissolution of the short-lived <a href="Mali%20Federation">Mali Federation</a>, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of <a href="drought">drought</a> that ravaged the <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a> in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all that grew.

Discontent began to spread among the people, which sometimes escalated to violence. Casamance has since experienced years of conflict which put local initiatives in jeopardy, such as nature reserves and the first network of villages. In 1998, in the middle of the conflict, the French commune of <a href="Bon-Encontre">Bon-Encontre</a> committed to providing Carabane with humanitarian aid, both economically and culturally. Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000. The rebels may have wanted to take advantage of Carabane's reputation to attract media attention.

The <a href="ceasefire">ceasefire</a> of 2004 brought relative peace, but in the meantime, the sinking of the "<a href="MV%20Le%20Joola">Joola</a>" in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years. Considering the problems brought on by the conflict along with the threat of coastal erosion on the island, some fear the worst. Thus, after years of development and community outreach, Carabane is experiencing difficulties in a number of ways.

Formerly an administrative district in its own right, even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23 villages in the rural community of <a href="Diemb%C3%A9ring%20%28rural%20community%29">Diembéring</a>, of which <a href="Kabrousse">Kabrousse</a>, Cap Skirring, and <a href="Boucott-Diemb%C3%A9ring">Boucott-Diembéring</a> are the largest centres. This rural community is located in the <a href="Kabrousse%20Arrondissement">Kabrousse Arrondissement</a>. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the <a href="List%20of%20Ministers%20of%20the%20Interior%20of%20Senegal">Minister of the Interior</a>. Under Senegalese law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including <a href="Law%20enforcement%20in%20Senegal">law enforcement</a>, tax collection, and keeping of <a href="vital%20record">vital record</a>s in the village.

While this administrative structure was decreed by a government anxious to deal with <a href="Interlocutor%20%28politics%29">interlocutors</a>, such a restructuring has not taken place in Casamance. Jola society is devoid of any formal hierarchy. It has no leader with genuine permanent authority. Instead, there are village elders who meet when important decisions need to be made. According to Italian <a href="Anthropology">anthropologist</a> Paolo Palmeri, the leader of the village has very little power in reality, as he is merely responsible for relations with the national administration. He simply allows the village to continue practicing its traditions. In a society where politics are inextricably linked to religion, the real holders of power are the fetish <a href="priest">priest</a>s. The very notion of a village is almost inappropriate in this context: it might be more appropriately considered a <a href="clan">clan</a> or an aggregation of <a href="kinship">kinship</a>. Other specialists, such as Christian Sina Diatta, compare Jola communities to those of <a href="mound-building%20termites">mound-building termites</a>, in which each member performs a specific function and where the queen is easily replaceable.

In 2003, the village of Carabane's official population count stood at 396 people and 55 households, but it fluctuates with the seasons and sometimes reaches some 1,750 people, according to local sources. Most of the population is Jola. The Jola are very distinct from other major <a href="ethnic%20groups%20in%20Senegal">ethnic groups in Senegal</a> by their language, egalitarian society, freedom from political hierarchy, and lack of slavery. Their traditions have persevered because of their independent spirit as well as their geographical isolation. This ethnic group accounts for 80 to 90% of the residents of Basse Casamance, but only 6 to 8% of the total population of Senegal. They are the largest ethnic group in Carabane, followed by Wolofs, <a href="Lebou%20people">Lebous</a>, and <a href="Serer%20people">Serers</a> (including <a href="Niominka%20people">Niominka</a> fishermen). Manjacks also live on the island, some of whom came from Saint-Louis and Gorée at the time of the first colonization. Two communities from neighbouring countries, one from <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a> (the <a href="Susu%20people">Susu people</a>) and the other from <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, have settled on the other side of the island at a distance from the village. There are also seasonal workers who come to fish: <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>ians, Guineans, and Gambians.

The indigenous population was originally <a href="Animism">animist</a>, but while the fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to <a href="Rite%20of%20passage">initiation rites</a> such as <a href="boukout">boukout</a> survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the <a href="Monotheism">monotheistic</a> belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s account for 94% of the population of Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from <a href="Dakar">Dakar</a>, many of whom were Muslim.

Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20Holy%20Heart%20of%20Mary">Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary</a> began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.
Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the <a href="Aline%20Sitoe%20Diatta">Aline Sitoe Diatta</a> High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called "House of Women and Children," founded in 1988 under the auspices of <a href="Caritas%20%28charity%29">Caritas</a> Ziguinchor.

In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.

As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, <a href="family%20planning">family planning</a> consultations, and prenatal information. A maternity hospital was founded in 1991 which is decorated with a fresco by Malang Badji, one of the most famous artists in the region.

The Ph.D. thesis published in 2003, "La part de l'autre: une aventure humaine en terre Diola", meaning "Part of the Other: A Human Adventure in Jola Territory," describes the health challenge present on the island in a more general context.

In particular, the location of the island does not allow easy access to serious or urgent medical assistance. There is a pirogue-ambulance for the transportation of people off the island in the case of medical emergencies.

The testimonies of explorers and colonial administrators demonstrate that Carabane has participated in rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and <a href="palm%20wine">palm wine</a> production for centuries. The island experienced a decline in the 20th century, when Ziguinchor emerged as the regional capital, and more recently because of the negative economic consequences resulting from the Casamance Conflict and the "Joola" tragedy.

From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's position at the mouth of the river was an undeniable asset. In the 20th and 21st centuries, in terms of trade and tourism issues, this location is more of a disadvantage because it effectively separates the island from the rest of the country.
While a direct route by sea has not been available since the sinking of the "Joola", the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some <a href="Roads%20in%20Senegal">national roads</a> connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and <a href="Gambia%20River">the river</a>), the former running through <a href="Nioro%20du%20Rip">Nioro du Rip</a> to <a href="Farafenni">Farafenni</a>, and the latter crossing the river to Banjul. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7 p.m. and 10 a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant <a href="demining">demining</a> operations. Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the <a href="Ziguinchor%20Airport">airport in Ziguinchor</a> or <a href="Cap%20Skirring%20Airport">Cap Skirring</a>, or to travel by boat to one of these locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.

By boat, the distance between Dakar and Carabane is , although Ziguinchor is only away. Before the launch of the "Joola", other boats, mostly well-worn ones, made the connection: first "Cap Skirring", then the "Casamance Express", and then "Island Karabane". In January 1991, a brand new <a href="ferry">ferry</a> went into operation. Like its predecessors, it connected Dakar to Ziguinchor, stopping near Carabane where canoes could reach the island. On September 26, 2002, 180 extra passengers boarded the already overloaded ship at this stop, and a few hours later, the "Joola" sank. For security reasons, the "Joola"'s successor, the "Wilis", stopped calling at Carabane, to the great displeasure of the inhabitants. Tourists became rare after that, and from time to time, inhabitants of the island found it necessary to move to Dakar or Ziguinchor. Significant modifications to the <a href="MV%20Aline%20Sitoe%20Diatta">MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta"</a>, which replaced the "Wilis" in March 2008, were considered to allow it to stop safely at the island, and the construction of a <a href="Berth%20%28moorings%29">berth</a> was announced. <a href="Souleymane%20Nd%C3%A9n%C3%A9%20Ndiaye">Souleymane Ndéné Ndiaye</a>, who later became <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Senegal">Prime Minister of Senegal</a>, laid the first stone of the berth in July 2008, and the entire construction project was financed by the Senegalese government at an estimated cost of 12 billion <a href="West%20African%20CFA%20franc">West African CFA franc</a>s. On April 26, 2014, the MV "Aline Sitoe Diatta" stopped at the Carabane berth for the first time, improving transportation for locals and tourists. , the ferry stops at Carabane four times each week in the middle of its trips between Dakar and Ziguinchor.

In Basse Casamance, the rice cycle structures the lives of the population and plays a central economic and religious role. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese <a href="Exploration">explorers</a>, show them to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, from <a href="African%20rice">African rice</a> to <a href="Asian%20rice">Asian rice</a>, a separate species.

The basic tool used is the "<a href="kayendo">kayendo</a>", a kind of wooden spade or shovel ranging from , surrounded by a sharp wrought iron blade and attached to a very long, straight, cylindrical neck. The two parts are connected by strips of torn Palmyra palm leaves. The main part is manufactured from a very hard wood measuring in length. The "kayendo" is mainly used to plough rice fields, but is also used for other purposes, such as excavation and construction. Men perform the clearing and ploughing while the women take care of the sowing, replanting, and weeding as well as the harvesting between October and January.

An even checkerboard plot model dominates the green landscape during the rainy season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ only in terms of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice <a href="paddy%20field">paddy field</a>s between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build <a href="levee">levee</a>s, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a> which subsequently become trapped are harvested at the end of the rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.

Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice cultivation has been threatened since the late 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though they continue to support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.

Among the agricultural activities practised during the dry season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of <a href="African%20oil%20palm">African oil palm</a> ("Elaeis guineensis"), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: <a href="palm%20oil">palm oil</a> and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.
Palm wine (called "bunuk" or "bounouk" in the Jola language) is an alcoholic drink derived from the natural fermentation of palm sap, so is not strictly a wine, which is produced by the fermentation of <a href="Vitis%20vinifera">grapes</a>. The recent partial <a href="Islamization">Islamization</a> of the region has not challenged its consumption. Fruit clusters are collected exclusively by the men. Supported by a strap, the harvester climbs the tree, cuts the bud, and holds out a funnel which allows the resulting fluid to flow drip by drip into an elongated <a href="calabash">calabash</a> or, more recently, a bottle. The <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a> content of palm wine develops throughout the day. The locals consume large quantities on a daily basis, and even more at banquets and ceremonies dedicated to fetishes. Palm wine is often traded for rice or sold in the city. Many Jola proverbs attest the popularity of the drink, such as "Bunuk abajut birto", which means "With palm wine, one never stands up," or "Ulako, kumusaet jígabulaju", which means "Sit down, don't spill the palm wine."

The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise <a href="artisan%20fishing">artisan fishing</a>, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.

The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with <a href="Petite%20C%C3%B4te">Petite Côte</a> and <a href="Sine-Saloum">Sine-Saloum</a>. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in <a href="dietary%20mineral">dietary mineral</a>s and <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the <a href="staple%20food">staple food</a>, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by <a href="Hawker%20%28trade%29">hawkers</a>.

Crustaceans, such as sand fiddler crabs and shrimp, among the mangroves also occupy a significant place in the local economy. While a large number of shrimp species inhabit the <a href="Senegambian">Senegambian</a> area, a single family exists in Casamance: <a href="Penaeidae">Penaeidae</a>. <a href="Farfantepenaeus%20notialis">Southern pink shrimp</a> ("Farfantepenaeus notialis") are the most commonly collected. They were traditionally caught as part of local artisan fishing by men, women, and children. Shrimp collection in the area experienced significant development in the 1960s, following the establishment of European industrial units. The local fishermen switched to this method, and there was an increased presence of fishermen from other areas. A study in 2005 revealed the extent to which the shrimp population in the region has been depleted, citing multiple causes, including diminishing rainfall, over-salinization of the estuary, and poorly controlled harvesting. Along with the mangrove degradation, the civil unrest, and the inadequate fishery regulation, Casamance has had to deal with the closure in 2003 of a major industrial complex in Ziguinchor which treated and exported shrimp and other crustaceans and employed more than 2,000 people.

Grouped into cooperatives, women play a leading role in the island's economy. Notably through <a href="microcredit">microcredit</a>, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and processing shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island is experiencing a <a href="rural%20exodus">rural exodus</a> of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.

The <a href="Senegal">Republic of Senegal</a> placed an emphasis on <a href="Tourism%20in%20Senegal">tourism</a> early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became a priority in the country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (1973–1977). Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country. Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe as a kind of Brazil in Africa, Carabane seemed well-placed to attract visitors in search of <a href="exoticism">exoticism</a> as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and <a href="kite%20surfing">kite surfing</a>.

At the same time, national and even international controversy threatened the industry from the beginning. Those who opposed tourism in Senegal described it as a <a href="Neocolonialism">new form of colonialism</a> while supporters saw it as a panacea that would cure the country of <a href="underdevelopment">underdevelopment</a>. The idea of alternative tourism was discussed. Several towns in Basse Casamance, including Carabane, were selected to test an integrated <a href="agritourism">agritourism</a> managed by the villagers themselves. In the early 1970s, the agritourism promoter Christian Saglio, a young French sociologist who later became the director of the <a href="Leopold%20Sedar%20Senghor%20French%20Institute">Leopold Sedar Senghor French Institute</a> in Dakar, believed in Carabane's potential. He stated that he wanted to make the island the "Gorée of Casamance", using it as a hub for other camps. Saglio suggested the restoration of old buildings and <a href="canopy%20bed">canopy bed</a>s.

Despite his fervour, Saglio's negotiations with the local people were unsuccessful. <a href="Niomoune">Niomoune</a> and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his <a href="Ethnography">ethnographic</a> theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the <a href="Catholic%20missions">Catholic missions</a> house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.

While Carabane's tourism sector has suffered because it has not taken part in the network of villages, tourists have avoided travelling to Casamance in general because of the civil unrest. The signing of a ceasefire in 2004 allowed tourism to resume, but not to the extent it had reached before the conflict.

Tour operators continue to advertise the island as a lost paradise surrounded by mangroves where travellers' exotic dreams come to life, but this type of discovery tourism is not as popular as traditional beach-related tourism. Thus, visitors from France, Spain, and Italy often combine tours of the "cases á <a href="impluvium">impluvium</a>" in <a href="Enampore">Enampore</a> or Mlomp with a few days of relaxation in Carabane. The area is also very conducive to the interests of fishing enthusiasts. Along the beach, small stalls offer traditional crafts and clothes at prices lower than those in Cap Skirring or <a href="Saly">Saly</a>. Badji Malang, a local painter, potter, sculptor, and poet, has created a camp in the area.

Although remaining separate from the local tourism network, Carabane has demonstrated its support for <a href="social%20solidarity">social solidarity</a> and <a href="holism">holism</a> by joining GENSEN (Global Ecovillage Network Senegal), a network of Senegalese <a href="ecovillage">ecovillage</a>s.

Carabane has many historic sites, such as the Catholic mission house built in 1880 which has since been turned into a hotel, a <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>-style <a href="Church%20%28building%29">church building</a> which is no longer in use, and a former slave-trade building. There is also a French cemetery where a <a href="Troupes%20de%20marine">Troupes de marine</a>-Captain with the name Aristide Protet was shot with a <a href="poisoned%20arrow">poisoned arrow</a> and buried standing up in front of the sea, according to his last wishes. Some tour guides falsely claim that this was <a href="Auguste%20L%C3%A9opold%20Protet">Auguste Léopold Protet</a>, the founder of the city of Dakar, but the name Aristide Protet is clearly shown on the tomb's plaque.

Near the beach are ruins of buildings, <a href="Pontoon%20%28boat%29">pontoons</a>, and wells, with a large tree in the center. A huge piece of metal in its midst bears the inscription "CEO Forrester & Co. Vauxhall Foundry. 18 Liverpool S3".

Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003. An application for Carabane to become a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> was filed with <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> on November 18, 2005.

Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane is attempting to pay homage to victims of <a href="slavery">slavery</a> by starting a small museum like the <a href="The%20Door%20of%20No%20Return">House of Slaves</a>. Like Gorée and Saint-Louis, Carabane places great importance on its <a href="cultural%20heritage">cultural heritage</a>. The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist <a href="Louis-Vincent%20Thomas">Louis-Vincent Thomas</a> posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved, and this question continues to be relevant. The local people suggest that the entire Diogue–<a href="Nikine">Nikine</a>–Carabane area needs saving.

Battle of Sio

The Battle of Sio, fought between December 1943 and March 1944, was the <a href="Breakout%20%28military%29">break-out</a> and <a href="Breakthrough%20%28military%29">pursuit</a> phase of <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s <a href="Huon%20Peninsula%20campaign">Huon Peninsula campaign</a>, part of the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

After the defeat of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Japanese</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sattelberg">Battle of Sattelberg</a>, <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> forces broke through the Japanese positions around <a href="Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>. Constant pressure from <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> <a href="PT%20boats">PT boats</a>, Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse, resulting in disease, malnutrition, and privation for the Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate, particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea.

Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula">Huon Peninsula</a>, using infantry, tanks, and air strikes against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at <a href="Landing%20at%20Saidor">Saidor</a>. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, exhaustion and <a href="suicide">suicide</a>. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces.

During the advance, Australian troops captured Japanese <a href="cryptographic">cryptographic</a> materials. This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific, as it permitted <a href="cryptanalysis">codebreakers</a> in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously.

General Douglas MacArthur's <a href="Operation%20Cartwheel">Operation Cartwheel</a> began with spectacular victories in the <a href="landing%20at%20Lae">landing at Lae</a> and the <a href="landing%20at%20Nadzab">landing at Nadzab</a> but then faltered in the face of inclement weather, unfavourable terrain, and—above all—tenacious and aggressive Japanese opposition on land and in the air. The initiative passed to Major General <a href="Hataz%C5%8D%20Adachi">Hatazō Adachi</a>'s <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Eighteenth Army</a> which launched a series of counter-attacks against <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="George%20Wootten">George Wootten</a>'s <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Finschhafen">Battle of Finschhafen</a>. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sattelberg">Battle of Sattelberg</a>, Wootten finally inflicted a crushing defeat on Adachi.

Although beaten, the Japanese did not leave the area. <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Shigeru%20Katagiri">Shigeru Katagiri</a>, the commander of the <a href="20th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">Japanese 20th Division</a>, ordered the <a href="80th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">80th Infantry Regiment</a> to hold the Wareo area to protect the withdrawal of the <a href="79th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">79th Infantry Regiment</a> and other units. The 2nd Battalion, <a href="238th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">238th Infantry Regiment</a> was to act as a rearguard on the coast. <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a>, the commander of <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Australian II Corps</a>, now urged Wootten to commence a coastal advance to cut the Japanese supply lines and force Adachi to retreat from the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula">Huon Peninsula</a> if he were not already doing so. Wootten took a more cautious approach. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Wareo">Battle of Wareo</a> proved that the Japanese intended to defend the area. After a fierce fight, Wootten managed to drive the Japanese from the high ground around Sattelberg and Gusika. In early December, Adachi ordered all his troops to withdraw to <a href="Sio%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Sio</a>. Wareo was captured by the Australians on 8 December and the last Japanese rearguards left the area on 15 December. Meanwhile, Berryman's coastal advance had commenced on 5 December.

Early in October 1943, a special staff was established at II Corps Headquarters to study the Japanese supply system. It did not include an officer with experience in maintaining a large force over a native <a href="Porter%20%28carrier%29">carrier</a> line, and therefore took time to realise that the Japanese force could not be maintained over an inland track, as was first assumed. Operations soon confirmed that the Japanese were dependent on a coastal supply line. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sattelberg">Battle of Sattelberg</a>, the Allies set out to cut this supply line. A three-pronged approach was taken:

By December, the pitiful condition of Japanese prisoners confirmed for the Australians that "the Japanese logistic system was in the final stages of breakdown". Between 9 and 13 December, PT boats sank 23 barges, most of them south of Sio. On 7 January, the PT boats also attacked a submarine. No less than twelve barges were destroyed on the night of 8 January, one of which was loaded with ammunition and another with around 70 troops. On 9 January, PT boats attacked a group of six barges, which attempted to fight back. One barge was seen to sink. Another patrol engaged eight barges and destroyed two. A third patrol found six barges on a beach and destroyed them. Then on 10 January, three PT boats sank three troop-carrying barges, taking one Japanese prisoner. The same night, two barges were also sunk north of Sio Island. When General Berryman saw <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Thomas%20C.%20Kinkaid">Thomas C. Kinkaid</a>, the commander of the Allied Naval Forces, on 14 December, he made a point of congratulating him on the work his PT boats were doing.

Lieutenant General Tsutomu Yoshihara, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Eighteenth Army recalled:

The main Australian advance was by <a href="infantry">infantry</a>-<a href="tank">tank</a>-<a href="Military%20engineer">engineer</a> teams moving along the coastal tracks. Japanese positions were generally sited at creek crossings in the <a href="jungle">jungle</a>. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, except for short periods during the latter stages of the operation when Japanese opposition was negligible and the difficulty of moving the artillery forward quickly was too great. A secondary outflanking movement was made inland, over the higher ground, which was usually <a href="coral">coral</a> cliffs covered by <a href="Imperata%20cylindrica">kunai grass</a> and rising as high as . Since the Japanese intent was to delay rather than fight to the death, a threat to their escape route usually prompted a withdrawal. When this did not occur, the position was reduced by a combination of manoeuvre and tank, mortar, and artillery fire. During the early part of the advance, 4,700 rounds were fired in one day; but during the entire 5th Division advance from Sio to Saidor, only 30 rounds were fired. The advance was made in a series of bounds, the objective of which was usually to secure sheltered beachheads.
Allied supply was entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the <a href="Engineer%20Special%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade</a>, wearing Australian uniforms, advanced with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side as they were secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was brought in by landing craft to set up an administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be brought up by <a href="jeep">jeep</a>s but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers. Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks or else were moved by <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Mechanised">Landing Craft Mechanised</a> (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.

The major problem was the weather. The <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> caused rough seas that precluded the use of the small <a href="Landing%20Craft%2C%20Vehicle%2C%20Personnel">Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel</a> (LCVPs) and restricted the operations of the larger LCMs. Because of the extremely rough seas—the most difficult that the 532nd EBSR had ever encountered—most supply missions were by night when tidal conditions were most favourable. Wootten insisted that at least seven days' supplies be available in forward areas in case the weather prevented the LCMs from running. II Corps made available two trawlers, manned by the 1st Water Transport Group, to deliver rations. The Australian Army also moved supplies by <a href="DUKW">DUKW</a>s.

Wootten designated <a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> C. R. V. Edgar's <a href="4th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">4th Infantry Brigade</a>, a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> formation, for the initial phase of the coastal advance, reserving his veteran <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> brigades for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wareo">Battle of Wareo</a>. The brigade consisted of the <a href="22nd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">22nd</a> and <a href="29th/46th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">29th/46th</a> Infantry Battalions from <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and the <a href="37th/52nd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">37th/52nd Infantry Battalion</a> from <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Each battalion was allotted a team of advisors from the 9th Division. Under Edgar's command was C Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion, with seven <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda tank</a>s, 9th Platoon, C Company, <a href="Papuan%20Infantry%20Battalion">Papuan Infantry Battalion</a>, and detachments from the 532nd EBSR, <a href="Australian%20New%20Guinea%20Administrative%20Unit">Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit</a> (ANGAU), <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Service%20Corps">Australian Army Service Corps</a> (AASC) and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Australian Army Medical Corps</a> (AAMC). In support were the <a href="sappers">sappers</a> of the 2/7th Field Company and the 24 <a href="25-pounder">25-pounder</a>s of the 2/6th Field Regiment. In case Edgar got into trouble, the <a href="20th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">20th Infantry Brigade</a> was in reserve, on six hours notice.

To support the advance, a beach maintenance area was prepared at a beach at the mouth of the Kalueng River, which involved removing underwater and landward obstacles. So that the tanks and jeeps could immediately support the advance, a bridge was required over the Kalueng River. A preliminary operation by the 22nd Infantry Battalion on 3 December 1943 secured a crossing area and a log bridge was constructed. The operation jumped off on 5 December, with the 29th/46th Infantry Battalion passing through the bridgehead established by the 22nd. It soon came under sporadic enemy fire, and a tank was disabled by a land mine. In the face of mounting opposition, the advance was halted near the lagoon. It resumed the next day, and the Japanese withdrew after an artillery bombardment, their orders being "while avoiding any decisive engagement" to "carry out successful resistance to try to delay the enemy advance". This became the pattern, with the Japanese preferring to withdraw rather than suffer heavy casualties. On 10 December, Edgar brought all three of his battalions into the line and by 14 December they were closing in on Lakona, a key position on the 20th Division's retreat route.

The tanks had difficulty keeping up with the advance. One obstacle was mines. On the first day, the 2/7th Field Company lifted fourteen mines but a tractor broke a track running over a mine. On 7 December, two more tanks were damaged by mines, one beyond repair. The sappers then cut a new track which they <a href="Corduroy%20road">corduroyed</a>. To support the attack on Lakona, the tanks had to cross a creek with steep coral banks, swollen by a torrential downpour. While efforts were made to bring up a compressor, tanks fired into banks and holes were packed with explosives and detonated. On the evening of 16 December, the infantry were joined by five Matilda tanks and overran the Japanese positions. They counted 47 Japanese dead; and killed another 17 in mopping-up operations the next day. On 20 December, aided by four Matilda tanks and 750 rounds from the 25-pounders, the 4th Infantry Brigade occupied the Fortification Point area. Between 5 and 20 December, the 4th Infantry Brigade reported 65 killed and 136 wounded. Japanese casualties were 420 killed and 136 found dead, victims of disease, malnutrition, and suicide. Only six Japanese prisoners were taken.

On 21 December 1943, the 20th Infantry Brigade passed through the 4th Infantry Brigade and initiated the second stage of the pursuit. Generals <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Blamey</a>, Berryman and Wootten visited the acting brigade commander, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> N. W. Simpson, and emphasised that the brigade was to minimise casualties where possible by employing artillery and tanks. That afternoon, the lead company of the 2/13th Infantry Battalion reached Hubika. The battalion diarist recorded: 
A halt was called for Christmas while supplies were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and <a href="Christmas%20pudding">Christmas pudding</a>, and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare be available to all units, and extraordinary efforts were made to carry out his directive. In one instance, a <a href="Piper%20J-3">Piper Cub</a> of <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron RAAF</a> dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company on a long-range patrol. The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 <a href="B-25%20Mitchell">B-25 Mitchell</a> and 12 <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Boston</a> bombers. The <a href="2/15th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/15th Infantry Battalion</a> and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had a sheltered beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American <a href="landing%20at%20Saidor">landing at Saidor</a> placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.

Before moving over the mountains, the 20th Division headquarters elected to destroy its cryptographic materials rather than carry them. As the wet weather made burning them page by page a slow and difficult process, and a fire might attract the attention of the Allied Air Forces, someone decided to simply bury them in a steel trunk in a stream bed. An Australian <a href="sapper">sapper</a> checking the stream bed for booby traps with a <a href="metal%20detector">metal detector</a> discovered it, and it was dug up in the belief that it was a mine. An intelligence officer recognised the contents as code books and soon it was on its way to the <a href="Central%20Bureau">Central Bureau</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>. There, the pages were carefully dried out and photographed. On 4 February 1944, Central Bureau codebreakers decrypted a thirteen-part message that laid out the decisions reached at a conference of high-ranking Japanese officers. Copies of the material were quickly sent to <a href="Arlington%20Hall">Arlington Hall</a>. In January 1944, Arlington Hall had decrypted 1,846 Japanese army messages. In March 1944, with the Sio codebooks in hand, it decrypted 36,000 messages.

On 11 January a platoon of the <a href="2/17th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/17th Infantry Battalion</a> replaced a rope ladder, and after climbing it and two wooden ladders reached an area atop a cliff which had once been a Japanese headquarters. It would have been a formidable position if defended, but it was not. The main body of the battalion followed the next day. The Goaling River was crossed in small boats left behind by the Japanese on 13 January and it entered Nambariwa, where one prisoner was taken, six Japanese were shot, and nine found dead. On 15 January, Sio was taken. The Sio-Nambariwa area was found to have been the principal Japanese supply area, and a large number of fuel, supply, and stores dumps were found. During the advance from Fortification Point to Sio, 303 Japanese had been killed or found dead, and 22 captured. The 20th Infantry Brigade had lost 3 killed and 13 wounded, but 958 had been evacuated sick, mostly with <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and an epidemic of <a href="dengue">dengue</a> had also taken its toll. Large quantities of Japanese equipment had been captured, including six <a href="Type%2041%2075%20mm%20Mountain%20Gun">75 mm guns</a>, three <a href="Type%2011%2037%20mm%20Infantry%20Gun">37 mm guns</a> and three <a href="Type%202%2020%20mm%20AA%20Machine%20Cannon">20 mm guns</a>.

At 1800 on 20 January 1944, the headquarters of Major General A. H. Ramsay's <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th Division</a>, which had come up from <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, replaced that of the 9th Division. At the same time the <a href="8th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">8th Infantry Brigade</a> replaced the 20th. The 8th Infantry Brigade, which had spent much of the war on garrison duty in Western Australia, began departing <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> on 10 January. The original intention had been for it to go to Lae to relieve the 29th Infantry Brigade, which had fought in the <a href="Salamaua-Lae%20campaign">Salamaua-Lae campaign</a>, but in December it was decided to ship it directly to Finschhafen. The brigade contained three infantry battalions, the <a href="4th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">4th</a>, <a href="30th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">30th</a> and <a href="35th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">35th</a>, all from <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. It also still had the support of the 2/12th Field Regiment, 532nd EBSR, and A Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. The brigade suffered its first casualties on the night of 21/22 January in a <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> incident, which was a common occurrence with units inexperienced in <a href="jungle%20warfare">jungle warfare</a>. Two Australians were killed and two wounded by their own comrades.

On 22 January a native reported seeing seven Japanese in the hills south-west of Sio and a patrol was sent out under <a href="Corporal">Corporal</a> Bengari to investigate. On arriving in the vicinity on 24 January, a local reported that another 22 Japanese had arrived. The next morning, Bengari and his five companions ambushed the Japanese and killed them all before they could fire a shot. <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">Wirraway</a> and <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">Boomerang</a> aircraft of No. 4 Squadron RAAF scouted ahead of the advance. Its aerial reconnaissance work let the Australians and Papuans know where opposition could be expected, thereby speeding up the advance. The pilots noted Japanese parachutes, signs that the Japanese were receiving supplies by air. On 4 February, the Australians were also forced onto air supply, as swollen rivers washed out a number of bridges.

Each day the Papuans killed 12 to 15 Japanese, but not until 8 February was the Japanese rearguard encountered at Weber Point and a formal attack made. Five Japanese were killed. In all, 53 Japanese were killed and four captured that day. Two Australians were wounded. The next day another 61 Japanese were killed and 9 captured, this time without any Australian casualties. On 10 February, the 30th Infantry Battalion encountered two American soldiers at Yagomai, thereby linking up with the American force at Saidor.

The 8th Infantry Brigade now began to mop up the area. On 18 February, the 35th Infantry Battalion attacked a Japanese force near Gabutamon, killing 40. Finding a force of about 100 Japanese at nearby Tapen, they attacked, killing another 52 Japanese for the loss of one man wounded, while the Papuans on their flanks killed another 51, of whom 43 were accounted for by Corporal Bengari and two other Papuans. The next day, the Papuans found and killed another 39 Japanese in the vicinity. At Tapen, the Australians and Papuans also found evidence that the Japanese had resorted to <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a>. In the period of 20 January – 1 March 1944, 734 Japanese were killed, 1,775 found dead and 48 were captured. Australian casualties came to four killed and six wounded.

Both sides managed to accomplish their objectives; the Japanese withdrew, while the Australians exacted a terrible toll. The balance of losses was overwhelmingly against the Japanese, both in terms of men and equipment. It seems that only about 4,300 of the 7,000 troops under the command of the <a href="20th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">Japanese 20th Division</a> who had originally been forward of Sio survived the withdrawal, and many of them were rendered ineffective through wounds, sickness, malnutrition and exhaustion. The opportunity to destroy the <a href="51st%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">Japanese 51st Division</a> was not seized. These troops lived to fight the Americans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Driniumor%20River">Battle of Driniumor River</a> later in the year, and the Australians in the <a href="Aitape%E2%80%93Wewak%20campaign">Aitape–Wewak campaign</a> in 1945. On the other hand, the new base at Finschhafen was no longer threatened by the Japanese and became an important staging point for the <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea%20campaign">Western New Guinea campaign</a>. The capture of the Japanese ciphers at Sio allowed General MacArthur to carry out <a href="Operations%20Reckless%20and%20Persecution">Operations Reckless and Persecution</a> with a plan based upon sound intelligence rather than just his own intuition.

Juan Davis Bradburn

Juan Davis Bradburn (1787 – April 20, 1842), born John Davis Bradburn, was a <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> in the Mexican Army. His actions as commandant of the garrison at <a href="Anahuac%2C%20TX">Anahuac</a> in <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a> in 1831 and 1832 led to the events known as the <a href="Anahuac%20Disturbances">Anahuac Disturbances</a>.

Born and raised in the United States, Bradburn's first career was as a merchant and slave trader. He likely first entered Mexico in 1812 as part of the <a href="Guti%C3%A9rrez-Magee%20Expedition">Gutiérrez-Magee Expedition</a> fighting Spanish control of Texas. When the expedition was quashed, Bradburn moved to Louisiana, where he served in the Louisiana militia during the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a>. After his discharge, Bradburn spent several years fighting for Mexican independence. Spain relinquished its hold on Mexico in 1821, and Bradburn became an officer in the new Mexican Army. He served as a courier for Mexican emperor <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20de%20Iturbide">Agustín de Iturbide</a>.

In 1830, Bradburn established a new military and customs post, Anahuac, in Texas. The local settlers resented Bradburn's efforts to withhold land titles from those who had squatted in unauthorized areas. They were further angered by his attempts to enforce customs laws which had been largely ignored. The hard feelings escalated when Bradburn, following Mexican law, refused to return runaway slaves to their owners in the United States. After receiving a hoax letter claiming that armed men were marching on Anahuac to retrieve runaway slaves, Bradburn arrested local lawyers <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a> and <a href="Patrick%20Churchill%20Jack">Patrick Churchill Jack</a>. Settlers were outraged that Travis did not receive some of the protections offered by the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">United States Bill of Rights</a>, even though these rights were not guaranteed in Mexico. A large force of <a href="Texian">Texian</a>s marched on Anahuac to secure Travis's release. The resulting confrontation forced Bradburn's expulsion from Texas and encouraged other immigrants to take armed action against Mexican soldiers. As a result of his actions, Bradburn was "one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of" Texas in the 19th century.

John Davis Bradburn was born in 1787 in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. His father was probably William C. Bradburn, and John likely had an elder brother, also named William. At some point after 1800, the family moved to <a href="Christian%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Christian County, Kentucky</a>. As a young adult, Bradburn became a merchant in nearby <a href="Springfield%2C%20Tennessee">Springfield, Tennessee</a>. He trafficked in slaves and was once jailed in <a href="Natchez%2C%20MS">Natchez, Mississippi</a> over a disputed slave sale.

It is likely that Bradburn participated in the 1812 <a href="Guti%C3%A9rrez-Magee%20Expedition">Gutiérrez-Magee Expedition</a>, which intended to establish independent Mexican control of <a href="Spanish%20Texas">Spanish Texas</a>. The rebels were initially successful, taking <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a>, <a href="Goliad%2C%20Texas">Goliad</a>, and provincial capital <a href="San%20Antonio%20de%20B%C3%A9xar">San Antonio de Béxar</a>. After the execution of Governor <a href="Manuel%20Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Salcedo">Manuel María de Salcedo</a>, many Americans left the movement in disgust. The remaining members of the expedition were decisively defeated by royalist forces at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Medina">Battle of Medina</a> in August 1813; a small number of Americans escaped to Louisiana.

By 1814, Bradburn resided in Louisiana. Rumors abounded that British troops were preparing to invade New Orleans. After the December call for volunteers to help defend the state, Bradburn enrolled in the Eighteenth Louisiana Regiment and was elected third lieutenant. His unit arrived in New Orleans on January 24, just after the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a>, and remained until <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> ended March 11.

Following his discharge from the militia, Bradburn remained in New Orleans. The <a href="Mexican%20War%20of%20Independence">Mexican War of Independence</a> was raging, and many <a href="filibuster%20%28military%29">filibusters</a>—men planning unauthorized military expeditions—gathered in the city to plan the liberation of Texas from Spanish control. Bradburn became a sergeant major in the movement led by Juan Pablo Anaya and Henry Perry. When Perry's forces entered Texas in early 1816, Bradburn was initially stationed in <a href="Nacogdoches">Nacogdoches</a> to direct recruits and supplies to the main body of the expedition. In June, Bradburn joined Perry at his headquarters, a bluff along the <a href="Trinity%20River%20%28Texas%29">Trinity River</a> which became known as Perry's Point. Little activity occurred over the next few months.

In November 1816, another filibuster, <a href="Mart%C3%ADn%20Javier%20Mina%20y%20Larrea">Martín Javier Mina y Larrea</a>, arrived with additional men and supplies. Mina planned to invade <a href="Tampico">Tampico</a> and assist the revolutionary army in the Mexican interior. Bradburn allied himself with Mina, whose plan was better-developed than Perry's, and was soon appointed second-in-command of the American troops, under Colonel Gilford Young. The filibusters traveled to Fort Sombrero, an insurgent stronghold in <a href="Guanajuato">Guanajuato</a> province. Rebel supplies dwindled when the fort was besieged by Spanish royalist troops. Mina attempted to negotiate a surrender, but the Spanish offered safe passage only to native Mexicans; Americans and other foreigners were required to <a href="surrender%20at%20discretion">surrender at discretion</a>. As the filibusters pondered this development, Young was killed, leaving Bradburn in sole command of the American troops. On August 19, he ordered a retreat. Spanish cavalrymen attacked, and less than one-quarter of the Americans escaped.

Bradburn remained in Mexico and soon joined the forces led by <a href="Vicente%20Guerrero">Vicente Guerrero</a>. Despite Guerrero's reputation for cruelty, the two men developed a close relationship. At least once, Bradburn countermanded Guerrero's orders, refusing to allow the execution of captured Spanish officers. His action impressed <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20de%20Iturbide">Agustín de Iturbide</a>, the commander of the Spanish forces fighting Guerrero. In December 1820, Bradburn left the insurgent army to join Iturbide. Most Mexican historians believe his defection was due to a weariness with the conflict; at least one historian speculates that Bradburn joined the Spanish Army as Guerrero's spy. Within a month, Bradburn had been appointed intermediary between Iturbide and Guerrero.

Iturbide defected from the Spanish Army, intending to place himself at the head of a new independent Mexico. He recruited his forces from both the Spanish and rebel armies, offering all who joined him an equal or higher rank in his new organization. Bradburn was appointed a colonel.

In August 1821, Mexico officially received its independence from Spain. The following year Iturbide became emperor of Mexico and sent Bradburn as an envoy to the United States. Bradburn returned with news that the United States was prepared to recognize the Mexican republic as an independent country. Later that year, Iturbide arranged Bradburn's marriage to a well-connected Mexican woman, Maria Josefa Hurtado de Mendoza y Caballero de los Olivos. Her brother, Agustin Hurtado, was the 9th Count of the Valley of Orizaba. Bradburn and his wife had one son, who entered the priesthood as a young man.

Iturbide was overthrown in 1823. The new government was based on <a href="federalism">federalist</a> principles, and Bradburn, a staunch <a href="centralized%20government">centralist</a>, kept a discreet distance from politics over the next few years. He reappears in Mexican records in 1828, when he was granted a monopoly on steamboat traffic on the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> through <a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a>. His charter was revoked in 1830 when he was unable to meet its terms.

The new federalist government officially authorized immigration from the United States to <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a> in 1824. The resulting mass influx of settlers, combined with failed attempts by the United States government to purchase the territory, concerned Mexican authorities, who feared that the United States wished to forcibly take Texas. In response, on April 6, 1830 the Mexican government enacted a series of laws restricting immigration from the United States. The laws also called for the establishment of customs houses within Texas to begin enforcing customs duties. On October 4, 1830, Bradburn was ordered to create the first customs post, to be located at <a href="Galveston%20Bay">Galveston Bay</a>. He was chosen for the assignment partly because he was bilingual and would be able to communicate with both the immigrants from the United States and the native Mexicans and partly due to his knowledge of the area and its terrain.

Bradburn and his men arrived at Galveston Bay on October 26 and established a post atop the same bluff where Bradburn had camped with Perry. As ordered, Bradburn named the fort <a href="Anahuac%2C%20Texas">Anahuac</a> after the <a href="Anahuac%20Valley">Anahuac Valley</a>, the ancient capital of the <a href="Aztec">Aztec</a>s. The soldiers erected two large kilns to produce bricks to build a more permanent fort. When the kilns were operational, however, Bradburn sold the bricks to settlers who wished to live near the fort. The town grew quickly and by June 1 the population had reached 300 civilians and 170 military personnel. At this point, Bradburn redirected his attention to building a permanent fort. The soldiers, who had been largely idle while the kilns produced bricks for settlers, were angry that they were now expected to do significant physical labor. Their displeasure was augmented by Bradburn's high standards; he often forced the men to tear down and rebuild sections that did not meet his benchmark for quality. Many soldiers deserted.

Bradburn also angered the colonists. The Mexican <a href="Constitution%20of%201824">Constitution of 1824</a> prohibited immigrants from settling with of the coast, and many foreigners had established homes close to the coast. In January 1831, a new state land commissioner, Jose Francisco Madero, arrived to grant land titles to people who had settled in the area before 1830. Bradburn believed that only the federal government had the authority to grant titles in the area near the coast, and that as the representative of the federal government he was the only individual who could authorize surveys of the land.

Bradburn arrested Madero and his assistant, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mar%C3%ADa%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Carbajal">José María Jesús Carbajal</a>. Within 10 days, Bradburn received orders from his superiors to release the men. Madero issued deeds as quickly as he could. Madero then established an official council, an "<a href="ayuntamiento">ayuntamiento</a>", for the residents in the disputed area. The new community, "Villa de la Santissima Trinidad de la Libertad", is now known as <a href="Liberty%2C%20Texas">Liberty, Texas</a>. Although Bradburn believed that Liberty was created illegally, as the town was too close to the coast, he made no attempt to interfere with its establishment. On December 9, however, Bradburn's superior, Commandant General <a href="Manuel%20Mier%20y%20Teran">Manuel Mier y Teran</a>, ordered Bradburn to dismantle the town and establish the "ayuntamiento" at Anahuac.

The Mexican government had granted specific tariff exemptions to the first group of immigrants to Texas. Known as the <a href="Old%20Three%20Hundred">Old Three Hundred</a>, this initial colony had been established by "<a href="empresario">empresario</a>" <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>. Most Texas colonists, including those who settled in Austin's other land grants, erroneously assumed the exemption applied to all settlers. With Bradburn's arrival, tariff collections began. After hearing complaints from ship captains, Bradburn's influence helped the law be amended to curtail some excessive charges. Nevertheless, colonists were angry that their goods were more expensive. Many of the settlers in Austin's colony also refused to accept that their exemption had expired and were vocal in their dislike of the tariffs and Bradburn. To keep the peace, Bradburn appointed local men to collect fees near Austin's colony; these men did not try to enforce the law rigidly, and tensions cooled.

In an effort to resolve the issues, Stephen F. Austin wrote Bradburn seeking help in getting the tariffs repealed throughout Texas. Bradburn promptly forwarded the letter up the chain of command. Bradburn's commander sent Austin a sharply-worded letter which, according to Bradburn's biographer Margaret Swett Henson, "remind[ed] the empresario that tariff was collected by every nation in the world but that only in Brazoria did it cause rioting". Austin blamed Bradburn for the reprimand.

In January 1832, Bradburn received a letter listing 10 men in his jurisdiction who favored separating Texas from Mexico. From that point on, according to Henson, "Bradburn became increasingly obsessed about the Anglo-Americans and their intentions, believing that every event was part of a conspiracy to detach Texas". Several months later, local men organized a militia, supposedly to protect the settlement from Indian attacks. Mexican law forbade residents from creating militias, so Bradburn arrested the ringleader, <a href="Patrick%20Jack">Patrick Jack</a>. Although citizens were outraged, few were willing to intervene. An exception was <a href="Robert%20McAlpin%20Williamson">Robert "Three-Legged Willie" Williamson</a>—his threat to kill Bradburn resulted in Jack's release.
Bradburn was also worried about the intentions of Jack's law partner, <a href="William%20Barret%20Travis">William Barret Travis</a>. The previous year, Bradburn had granted asylum to two men who had escaped slavery in Louisiana. Travis represented the men's owner in a series of failed attempts to return the former slaves to the United States. In May 1832, Bradburn received a letter warning that 100 armed men were stationed away, intent on reclaiming the slaves. After realizing the letter was a hoax, Bradburn arrested Travis for questioning. He intended to send Travis to Matamoros for a military trial on charges of attempted insurrection. Conviction on this charge would have led to Travis's execution. The settlers were outraged that the arrest did not require a warrant, a statement of charges, or trial by jury. Most were unfamiliar with Mexican law and assumed that the United States <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a> still applied to them.

Jack threatened Bradburn, who angrily rearrested him. Colonists had reached their limit, and men began marching towards Anahuac from various Texas settlements. By early June, over 150 <a href="Texian">Texian</a>s had gathered. They elected <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a> as commander. Without firing a shot, Johnson's group soon captured Bradburn's 19 cavalry officers, who had been trying to reconnoiter the Texian position. This left Bradburn with only 80 soldiers; the rest had deserted.

On June 10, the insurgents occupied buildings in northern Anahuac and began negotiations to peacefully end the dispute. Mexican officers agreed to release their prisoners into civilian custody if the Texians would release the captured cavalry officers and then withdraw from the town to <a href="Turtle%20Bayou">Turtle Bayou</a>. Although most of the rebels left Anahuac, 15 to 30 men remained scattered through the town. Bradburn believed this violated their agreement and in retaliation threatened to fire on the village within 2 hours. Most of the Texians believed that Bradburn had never intended to follow the agreement.

Fearing imminent cannon fire, the women and children of Anahuac fled. Mexican soldiers briefly engaged the men who remained, leading to the deaths of 5 Mexican soldiers and 1 Texan. After the skirmish, the remaining Texians gathered at Turtle Bayou to await the arrival of cannons that were stored at Brazoria. Taking advantage of the civil war currently engulfing the Mexican interior, the Texians drafted the <a href="Turtle%20Bayou%20Resolutions">Turtle Bayou Resolutions</a>. In this document, they declared themselves federalists who supported rebellious Mexican general <a href="Antonio%20Lopez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna</a> and decried "the present dynasty" which gave them military order instead of civil authority.

While the Texians waited for their artillery, Bradburn sent messages to Colonel Piedras, stationed at <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20TX">Nacogdoches</a> ( north), and Colonel Elosúa at San Antonio ( to the west). On June 19, Piedras and about 100 of his men set out to reinforce Bradburn. Unsure how many Texians he actually faced, Piedras was eager to defuse the conflict without violence. At his urging, Bradburn agreed to relinquish his authority, but his chosen successor, Lieutenant Colonel Felix Maria Subarán, refused to take his place. Piedras agreed to take temporary command of the garrison. On July 2, he transferred the prisoners to civilian authorities; within a week they were all released with no charges filed. Piedras left for Nacogdoches on July 8; three days later, the bulk of the Anahuac troops declared themselves federalists. Only Bradburn and a few others remained committed to the centralist cause.

After an aborted assassination attempt—widely attributed to Travis—Bradburn resolved to leave Texas. None of the local ship captains would allow him passage. On July 13, Subarán announced that he would not guarantee the safety of any officers who still supported the centralist government. That night, Bradburn left Anahuac on foot. Years later, Anahuac carpenter William B. Scates related that after Bradburn's departure, locals gathered up the other centralist officers and <a href="Tarring%20and%20feathering">tarred and feathered</a> them before taking them into the water and "scour[ing] them with corn cobs to scrub their Bradburn sins off".

On August 6, Bradburn arrived in New Orleans and sought refuge with the Mexican consul. Many New Orleans residents had a highly unfavorable view of Bradburn; ten days earlier the local paper had published a letter from Travis describing Bradburn as a "tyrant" and claiming that Travis had been jailed solely for his political opinions. Bradburn quickly booked passage to Matamoros. On arriving in Mexico, he learned that he had been officially relieved of his duties in Anahuac on June 29, before his superiors had learned of the armed conflict.

Bradburn remained in the army, fighting for the centralist government. Acting president <a href="Anastasio%20Bustamante">Anastasio Bustamante</a> promoted Bradburn to <a href="brigadier%20general">brigadier general</a> after his bravery in a large battle on September 18. For the next few months, Bradburn commanded a regiment near <a href="Reynosa">Reynosa</a>. In December, Bustamante and Santa Anna negotiated an end to the war. Bradburn's forces were merged with that of the federalist general operating in the same area, Lorenzo Cortina. Cortina commanded the joint regiment, and Bradburn retired from military service. For several years, Bradburn raised vegetables near Matamoros. Henson related that "a Texas visitor noted that [Bradburn] had the respect of the foreign community in the city, even the Anglo merchants".

When the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> erupted in 1835, Bradburn rejoined the military under General <a href="Jose%20de%20Urrea">Jose de Urrea</a> on the condition that he was not required to fight in eastern Texas. Urrea's forces eradicated opposition along the Texas <a href="Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a>, and Bradburn was left to command the small port at <a href="Copano%2C%20Texas">Copano</a>, just north of the <a href="Nueces%20River">Nueces River</a>. In April 1836, Santa Anna (now president of Mexico) was captured at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a> and all Mexican troops were ordered to retreat beyond the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>. Bradburn remained at Copano to intercept Mexican supply vessels before they could fall into the hands of the Texians. In mid-May, he was ordered to retreat south to <a href="Refugio%2C%20TX">Refugio</a> and wait for the arrival of a specific supply ship. His force was reduced to five men. After two deserted and the remainder fell ill, Bradburn set out alone and on foot for Mexico. He reached Matamoros in ill health on June 13.

Bradburn again served in the army during the federalist war in 1838, but by the end of 1840 he had retired to Matamoros. He died on April 20 and was buried on his ranch, likely east of present-day <a href="Mission%2C%20Texas">Mission</a>. The property is now the home of the La Lomita Seminary, but there is no record of the location of Bradburn's grave.

Bradburn's death was announced in Texas newspapers in a very neutral manner. The "<a href="Telegraph%20and%20Texas%20Register">Telegraph and Texas Register</a>" said simply that "Gen. Bradburn, who had long been in the Mexican service, and formerly commanded the garrison of Anahuac, lately died at Matamoros". However, the history books of the time did not speak kindly of his actions. In his 1841 book "Texas and the Texans; or, Advance of the Anglo-Americans to the South-West" <a href="Henry%20Stuart%20Foote">Henry Stuart Foote</a> described Bradburn as an "evil spirit, hovering, with gloomy and malignant aspect, in the rear of Santa Anna's army". Henson posits that Bradburn was "one of the most maligned men in historical accounts of that period", partially because he had no descendants to try to "preserv[e] his name and reputation in Texas".

Many of Bradburn's contemporaries appeared to share Stephen F. Austin's belief that: "The fact is [Bradburn] is incompetent to such a command and is half crazy part of his time." His actions "appeared arbitrary and authoritarian to the colonists, who were ignorant about the power traditionally exercised by the Mexican military". Texians were further disgusted that Bradburn, who shared their American roots, often sided against American immigrants. However, according to historian J. R. Edmondson, colonists "would probably have resented any officer—Anglo or not—sent among them to initiate the collection of customs". Few Texans in the 19th century understood that Bradburn was following orders and attempting to enforce the national laws of Mexico, and that he was no longer bound by the laws of the United States. Even as late as the 20th century, historians often described Bradburn as a "petty tyrant".

Historian <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a> believes that Bradburn "overreacted and made heroes of two local malcontents whose actions their own people otherwise had not been much inclined to sanction". The resulting Turtle Bayou Resolutions empowered other Texians to follow a similar course of action. Many communities began declaring in favor of Santa Anna, and in August Piedras and his troops were driven from Nacogdoches. Their retreat into the Mexican interior temporarily left eastern Texas free of Mexican military control, encouraging the colonists to increase their political activity. Shortly thereafter, colonists organized the <a href="Convention%20of%201832">Convention of 1832</a>, which marked the first attempt to gather Texians from each of the colonies to discuss their common goals.

Shortly after Bradburn left Texas, the garrison at Anahuac was dismantled. With no troops to purchase supplies, the civilians in the area soon dispersed. The fort was not regarrisoned until January 1835, when Captain Antonio Tenorio arrived with 40 men. His command was no more successful than Bradburn's; within months Travis led a group of insurgents to overthrow Tenorio in the second of the Anahuac Disturbances.

Boydell Shakespeare Gallery

The Boydell Shakespeare Gallery in London, England, was the first stage of a three-part project initiated in November 1786 by <a href="engraver">engraver</a> and publisher <a href="John%20Boydell">John Boydell</a> in an effort to foster a <a href="School%20%28discipline%29">school</a> of British <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>. In addition to the establishment of the gallery, Boydell planned to produce an illustrated edition of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare's</a> plays and a folio of prints based upon a series of paintings by different contemporary painters. During the 1790s the London gallery that showed the original paintings emerged as the project's most popular element.

The works of William Shakespeare enjoyed a renewed popularity in 18th-century Britain. Several new editions of his works were published, his plays were revived in the theatre and numerous works of art were created illustrating the plays and specific productions of them. Capitalising on this interest, Boydell decided to publish a grand illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays that would showcase the talents of British painters and engravers. He chose the noted scholar and Shakespeare editor <a href="George%20Steevens">George Steevens</a> to oversee the edition, which was released between 1791 and 1803.

The press reported weekly on the building of Boydell's gallery, designed by <a href="George%20Dance%20the%20Younger">George Dance the Younger</a>, on a site in <a href="Pall%20Mall%2C%20London">Pall Mall</a>. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a>, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations had to be done by lesser artists, the final products of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become insolvent, and they were forced to sell the gallery at a lottery.

In the 18th century, Shakespeare became associated with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped into the same mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, but also to the emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.

The actor, director, and producer <a href="David%20Garrick">David Garrick</a> was a key figure in Shakespeare's theatrical renaissance. His reportedly superb acting, unrivalled productions, numerous and important Shakespearean portraits, and his spectacular 1769 <a href="Shakespeare%20Jubilee">Shakespeare Jubilee</a> helped promote Shakespeare as a marketable product and the national playwright. Garrick's <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane theatre</a> was the centre of the Shakespeare mania which swept the nation.

The visual arts also played a significant role in expanding Shakespeare's popular appeal. In particular, the <a href="Conversation%20piece%20%28paintings%29">conversation piece</a>s designed chiefly for homes generated a wide audience for literary art, especially Shakespearean art. This tradition began with <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> (whose prints reached all levels of society) and attained its peak in the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> exhibitions, which displayed paintings, drawings, and sculptures. The exhibitions became important public events: thousands flocked to see them, and newspapers reported in detail on the works displayed. They became a fashionable place to be seen (as did Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery, later in the century). In the process, the public was refamiliarized with Shakespeare's works.

The rise in Shakespeare's popularity coincided with Britain's accelerating change from an <a href="oral%20tradition">oral</a> to a <a href="print%20culture">print culture</a>. Towards the end of the century, the basis of Shakespeare's high reputation changed. He had originally been respected as a playwright, but once the theatre became associated with the masses, Shakespeare's status as a "great writer" shifted. Two strands of Shakespearean print culture emerged: <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> popular editions and scholarly critical editions.

In order to turn a profit, booksellers chose well-known authors, such as <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>, to edit Shakespeare editions. According to Shakespeare scholar <a href="Gary%20Taylor%20%28English%20literature%20scholar%29">Gary Taylor</a>, Shakespearean criticism became so "associated with the dramatis personae of 18th-century English literature ... [that] he could not be extracted without uprooting a century and a half of the national canon". The 18th century's first Shakespeare edition, which was also the first illustrated edition of the plays, was published in 1709 by <a href="Jacob%20Tonson">Jacob Tonson</a> and edited by <a href="Nicholas%20Rowe%20%28dramatist%29">Nicholas Rowe</a>. The plays appeared in "pleasant and readable books in small format" which "were supposed ... to have been taken for common or garden use, domestic rather than library sets". Shakespeare became "domesticated" in the 18th century, particularly with the publication of family editions such as Bell's in 1773 and 1785–86, which advertised themselves as "more instructive and intelligible; especially to the young ladies and to youth; glaring indecencies being removed".

Scholarly editions also proliferated. At first, these were edited by author-scholars such as Pope (1725) and Johnson (1765), but later in the century this changed. Editors such as <a href="George%20Steevens">George Steevens</a> (1773, 1785) and <a href="Edmund%20Malone">Edmund Malone</a> (1790) produced meticulous editions with extensive footnotes. The early editions appealed to both the middle class and to those interested in Shakespeare scholarship, but the later editions appealed almost exclusively to the latter. Boydell's edition, at the end of the century, tried to reunite these two strands. It included illustrations but was edited by George Steevens, one of the foremost Shakespeare scholars of the day.

Boydell's Shakespeare project contained three parts: an illustrated edition of Shakespeare's plays; a folio of prints from the gallery (originally intended to be a folio of prints from the edition of Shakespeare's plays); and a public gallery where the original paintings for the prints would hang.

The idea of a grand Shakespeare edition was conceived during a dinner at the home of <a href="Josiah%20Boydell">Josiah Boydell</a> (John's nephew) in late 1786. Five important accounts of the occasion survive. From these, a guest list and a reconstruction of the conversation have been assembled. The guest list reflects the range of Boydell's contacts in the artistic world: it included <a href="Benjamin%20West">Benjamin West</a>, painter to <a href="George%20III">King George III</a>; <a href="George%20Romney%20%28painter%29">George Romney</a>, a renowned portrait painter; <a href="George%20Nicol%20%28bookseller%29">George Nicol</a>, bookseller to the king; <a href="William%20Hayley">William Hayley</a>, a poet; <a href="John%20Hoole">John Hoole</a>, a scholar and translator of <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Tasso</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>; and Daniel Braithwaite, secretary to the postmaster general and a patron of artists such as Romney and <a href="Angelica%20Kauffman">Angelica Kauffman</a>. Most accounts also place the painter <a href="Paul%20Sandby">Paul Sandby</a> at the gathering.

Boydell wanted to use the edition to help stimulate a British <a href="School%20%28discipline%29">school</a> of <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>. He wrote in the "Preface" to the folio that he wanted "to advance that art towards maturity, and establish an English School of Historical Painting". A court document used by Josiah to collect debts from customers after Boydell's death relates the story of the dinner and Boydell's motivations:

[Boydell said] he should like to wipe away the stigma that all foreign critics threw on this nation—that they had no genius for historical painting. He said he was certain from his success in encouraging engraving that Englishmen wanted nothing but proper encouragement and a proper subject to excel in historical painting. The encouragement he would endeavor to find if a proper subject were pointed out. Mr. Nicol replied that there was one great National subject concerning which there could be no second opinion, and mentioned Shakespeare. The proposition was received with acclaim by the <a href="Alderman">Alderman</a> [John Boydell] and the whole company.

However, as Frederick Burwick argues in his introduction to a collection of essays on the Boydell Gallery, "[w]hatever claims Boydell might make about furthering the cause of history painting in England, the actual rallying force that brought the artists together to create the Shakespeare Gallery was the promise of engraved publication and distribution of their works."

After the initial success of the Shakespeare Gallery, many wanted to take credit. <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a> long claimed that his planned Shakespeare ceiling (in imitation of the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel%20ceiling">Sistine Chapel ceiling</a>) had given Boydell the idea for the gallery. <a href="James%20Northcote%20%28painter%29">James Northcote</a> claimed that his "Death of Wat Tyler" and "Murder of the Princes in the Tower" had motivated Boydell to start the project. However, according to Winifred Friedman, who has researched the Boydell Gallery, it was probably <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds's</a> <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> lectures on the superiority of history painting that influenced Boydell the most.

The logistics of the enterprise were difficult to organise. Boydell and Nicol wanted to produce an illustrated edition of a multi-volume work and intended to bind and sell the 72 large prints separately in a folio. A gallery was required to exhibit the paintings from which the prints were drawn. The edition was to be financed through a subscription campaign, during which the buyers would pay part of the price up front and the remainder on delivery. This unusual practice was necessitated by the fact that over <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>350,000—an enormous sum at the time, worth about £ today—was eventually spent. The gallery opened in 1789 with 34 paintings and added 33 more in 1790 when the first engravings were published. The last volume of the edition and the "Collection of Prints" were published in 1803. In the middle of the project, Boydell decided that he could make more money if he published different prints in the folio than in the illustrated edition; as a result, the two sets of images are not identical.

Advertisements were issued and placed in newspapers. When a subscription was circulated for a medal to be struck, the copy read: "The encouragers of this great national undertaking will also have the satisfaction to know, that their names will be handed down to Posterity, as the Patrons of Native Genius, enrolled with their own hands, in the same book, with the best of Sovereigns." The language of both the advertisement and the medal emphasised the role each subscriber played in the patronage of the arts. The subscribers were primarily middle-class Londoners, not aristocrats. <a href="Edmund%20Malone">Edmund Malone</a>, himself an editor of a rival Shakespeare edition, wrote that "before the scheme was well-formed, or the proposals entirely printed off, near six hundred persons eagerly set down their names, and paid their subscriptions to a set of books and prints that will cost each person, I think, about ninety guineas; and on looking over the list, there were not above twenty names among them that anybody knew".

The "magnificent and accurate" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise—he viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that "splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition". The volumes themselves were handsome, with <a href="gilding">gild</a>ed pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of "Persons in the Drama". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the <a href="typography">typography</a> experts <a href="William%20Bulmer%20%28printer%29">William Bulmer</a> and William Martin to develop and cut a <a href="Bulmer%20%28typeface%29">new typeface</a> specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they "established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove <a href="James%20Whatman%20%28papermaker%29">Whatman</a> paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the "Dramatic Works" were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.

Boydell was responsible for the "splendor", and <a href="George%20Steevens">George Steevens</a>, the general editor, was responsible for the "correctness of text". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was "at first an ardent advocate of the plan" but "soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint. Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition:

Throughout the edition, modern (i.e. 18th-century) spelling was preferred as were <a href="First%20Folio">First Folio</a> readings.

Boydell sought out the most eminent painters and engravers of the day to contribute paintings for the gallery, engravings for the folio, and illustrations for the edition. Artists included <a href="Richard%20Westall">Richard Westall</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Stothard">Thomas Stothard</a>, <a href="George%20Romney%20%28painter%29">George Romney</a>, <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20West">Benjamin West</a>, <a href="Angelica%20Kauffman">Angelica Kauffman</a>, <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28painter%29">Robert Smirke</a>, <a href="James%20Durno">James Durno</a>, <a href="John%20Opie">John Opie</a>, <a href="Francesco%20Bartolozzi">Francesco Bartolozzi</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Kirk%20%28artist%29">Thomas Kirk</a>, <a href="Henry%20Thomson%20%28painter%29">Henry Thomson</a>, and Boydell's nephew and business partner, <a href="Josiah%20Boydell">Josiah Boydell</a>.

The folio and the illustrated Shakespeare edition were "by far the largest single engraving enterprise ever undertaken in England". As print collector and dealer Christopher Lennox-Boyd explains, "had there not been a market for such engravings, not one of the paintings would have been commissioned, and few, if any, of the artists would have risked painting such elaborate compositions". Scholars believe that a variety of engraving methods were employed and that <a href="line%20engraving">line engraving</a> was the "preferred medium" because it was "clear and hardwearing" and because it had a high reputation. <a href="Stipple%20engraving">Stipple engraving</a>, which was quicker and often used to produce shading effects, wore out quicker and was valued less. Many plates were a mixture of both. Several scholars have suggested that <a href="mezzotint">mezzotint</a> and <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a> were also used. Lennox-Boyd, however, claims that "close examination of the plates confirms" that these two methods were not used and argues that they were "totally unsuitable": mezzotint wore quickly and aquatint was too new (there would not have been enough artists capable of executing it). Most of Boydell's engravers were also trained artists; for example, Bartolozzi was renowned for his stippling technique.
Boydell's relationships with his illustrators were generally congenial. One of them, <a href="James%20Northcote%20%28painter%29">James Northcote</a>, praised Boydell's liberal payments. He wrote in an 1821 letter that Boydell "did more for the advancement of the arts in England than the whole mass of the nobility put together! He paid me more nobly than any other person has done; and his memory I shall ever hold in reverence". Boydell typically paid the painters between £105 to £210, and the engravers between £262 and £315. <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a> at first declined Boydell's offer to work on the project, but he agreed when pressed. Boydell offered Reynolds "carte blanche" for his paintings, giving him a down payment of £500, an extraordinary amount for an artist who had not even agreed to do a specific work. Boydell eventually paid him a total of £1,500.

There are 96 illustrations in the nine volumes of the illustrated edition and each play has at least one. Approximately two-thirds of the plays, 23 out of 36, are each illustrated by a single artist. Approximately two-thirds of the total number of illustrations, or 65, were completed by three artists: <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28painter%29">William Hamilton</a>, <a href="Richard%20Westall">Richard Westall</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Smirke%20%28painter%29">Robert Smirke</a>. The primary illustrators of the edition were known as book illustrators, whereas a majority of the artists included in the folio were known for their paintings. Lennox-Boyd argues that the illustrations in the edition have a "uniformity and cohesiveness" that the folio lacks because the artists and engravers working on them understood book illustration while those working on the folio were working in an unfamiliar medium.

The print folio, "A Collection of Prints, From Pictures Painted for the Purpose of Illustrating the Dramatic Works of Shakspeare, by the Artists of Great-Britain" (1805), was originally intended to be a collection of the illustrations from the edition, but a few years into the project, Boydell altered his plan. He guessed that he could sell more folios and editions if the pictures were different. Of the 97 prints made from paintings, two-thirds of them were made by ten of the artists. Three artists account for one-third of the paintings. In all, 31 artists contributed works.

In June 1788, Boydell and his nephew secured the lease on a site at 52 <a href="Pall%20Mall%2C%20London">Pall Mall</a> () to build the gallery and engaged <a href="George%20Dance%20the%20Younger">George Dance</a>, then the Clerk of the City Works, as the architect for the project. Pall Mall at that time had a mix of expensive residences and commercial operations, such as bookshops and gentleman's clubs, popular with fashionable London society. The area also contained some less genteel establishments: King's Place (now Pall Mall Place), an alley running to the east and behind Boydell's gallery, was the site of Charlotte Hayes's high-class <a href="brothel">brothel</a>. Across King's Place, immediately to the east of Boydell's building, 51 Pall Mall had been purchased on 26 February 1787 by <a href="George%20Nicol%20%28bookseller%29">George Nicol</a>, bookseller and future husband of Josiah's elder sister, Mary Boydell. As an indication of the changing character of the area, this property had been the home of Goostree's gentleman's club from 1773 to 1787. Begun as a gambling establishment for wealthy young men, it had later become a reformist political club that counted <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt</a> and <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a> as members.
Dance's Shakespeare Gallery building had a monumental, <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> stone front, and a full-length exhibition hall on the ground floor. Three interconnecting exhibition rooms occupied the upper floor, with a total of more than of wall space for displaying pictures. The two-storey façade was not especially large for the street, but its solid classicism had an imposing effect. Some reports describe the exterior as "sheathed in copper".

The lower storey of the façade was dominated by a large, rounded-arched doorway in the centre. The <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">unmoulded</a> arch rested on wide piers, each broken by a narrow window, above which ran a simple <a href="cornice">cornice</a>. Dance placed a <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transom</a> across the doorway at the level of the cornice bearing the inscription "Shakespeare Gallery". Below the transom were the main entry doors, with glazed panels and side lights matching the flanking windows. A radial <a href="fanlight">fanlight</a> filled the <a href="lunette">lunette</a> above the transom. In each of the <a href="spandrels">spandrels</a> to the left and right of the arch, Dance set a carving of a lyre inside a ribboned wreath. Above all this ran a panelled <a href="band%20course">band course</a> dividing the lower storey from the upper.

The upper façade contained paired <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s on either side, and a thick <a href="entablature">entablature</a> and triangular <a href="pediment">pediment</a>. The architect <a href="Sir%20John%20Soane">Sir John Soane</a> criticised Dance's combination of slender pilasters and a heavy entablature as a "strange and extravagant absurdity". The capitals topping the pilasters sported <a href="volute">volute</a>s in the shape of <a href="ammonite">ammonite</a> fossils. Dance invented this neo-classical feature, which became known as the <a href="Ammonite%20Order">Ammonite Order</a>, specifically for the gallery. In a recess between the pilasters, Dance placed <a href="Thomas%20Banks">Thomas Banks's</a> sculpture "Shakespeare attended by Painting and Poetry", for which the artist was paid 500 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a>. The sculpture depicted Shakespeare, reclining against a rock, between the Dramatic Muse and the Genius of Painting. Beneath it was a panelled pedestal inscribed with a quotation from "Hamlet": "He was a Man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again".

The Shakespeare Gallery, when it opened on 4 May 1789, contained 34 paintings, and by the end of its run it had between 167 and 170. (The exact inventory is uncertain and most of the paintings have disappeared; only around 40 paintings can be identified with any certainty.) According to Frederick Burwick, during its sixteen-year operation, the Gallery reflected the transition from <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a> to <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. Works by artists such as <a href="James%20Northcote%20%28painter%29">James Northcote</a> represent the conservative, neoclassical elements of the gallery, while those of <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a> represent the newly emerging Romantic movement. <a href="William%20Hazlitt">William Hazlitt</a> praised Northcote in an essay entitled "On the Old Age of Artists", writing "I conceive any person would be more struck with Mr. Fuseli at first sight, but would wish to visit Mr. Northcote oftener."

The gallery itself was a fashionable hit with the public. Newspapers carried updates of the construction of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed façade. The "Daily Advertiser" featured a weekly column on the gallery from May through August (exhibition season). Artists who had influence with the press, and Boydell himself, published anonymous articles to heighten interest in the gallery, which they hoped would increase sales of the edition.

At the beginning of the enterprise, reactions were generally positive. The "<a href="Public%20Advertiser">Public Advertiser</a>" wrote on 6 May 1789: "the pictures in general give a mirror of the poet ... [The Shakespeare Gallery] bids fair to form such an epoch in the History of the Fine Arts, as will establish and confirm the superiority of the English School". "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" wrote a day later:
Fuseli himself may have written the review in the "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>", which praised the general plan of the gallery while at the same time hesitating: "such a variety of subjects, it may be supposed, must exhibit a variety of powers; all cannot be the first; while some must soar, others must skim the meadow, and others content themselves to walk with dignity". However, according to Frederick Burwick, critics in Germany "responded to the Shakespeare Gallery with far more thorough and meticulous attention than did the critics in England".

Criticism increased as the project dragged on: the first volume did not appear until 1791. <a href="James%20Gillray">James Gillray</a> published a cartoon labelled "Boydell sacrificing the Works of Shakespeare to the Devil of Money-Bags". The essayist and soon-to-be co-author of the children's book "<a href="Tales%20from%20Shakespeare">Tales from Shakespeare</a>" (1807) <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28writer%29">Charles Lamb</a> criticised the venture from the outset:

Northcote, while appreciating Boydell's largesse, also criticised the results of the project: "With the exception of a few pictures by Joshua [Reynolds] and [John] Opie, and—I hope I may add—myself, it was such a collection of slip-slop imbecility as was dreadful to look at, and turned out, as I had expected it would, in the ruin of poor Boydell's affairs".

By 1796, subscriptions to the edition had dropped by two-thirds. The painter and diarist <a href="Joseph%20Farington">Joseph Farington</a> recorded that this was a result of the poor engravings:

West said He looked over the Shakespeare prints and was sorry to see them of such inferior quality. He said that excepting that from His Lear by Sharpe, that from Northcote's children in the Tower, and some small ones, there were few that could be approved. Such a mixture of dotting and engraving, and such a general deficiency in respect of drawing which He observed the Engravers seemed to know little of, that the volumes presented a mass of works which He did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscription.

The mix of engraving styles was criticised; line engraving was considered the superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, at a lower price to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.

Although the Boydells ended with 1,384 subscriptions, the rate of subscriptions dropped, and remaining subscriptions were also increasingly in doubt. Like many businesses at the time, the Boydell firm kept few records. Only the customers knew what they had purchased. This caused numerous difficulties with debtors who claimed they had never subscribed or had subscribed for less. Many subscribers also defaulted, and Josiah Boydell spent years after John's death attempting to force them to pay.

The Boydells focused all their attention on the Shakespeare edition and other large projects, such as "The History of the River Thames" and "The Complete Works of John Milton", rather than on lesser, more profitable ventures. When both the Shakespeare enterprise and the Thames book failed, the firm had no capital to fall back upon. Beginning in 1789, with the onset of the <a href="French%20revolution">French revolution</a>, John Boydell's export business to Europe was cut off. By the late 1790s and early 19th century, the two-thirds of his business that depended upon the export trade was in serious financial difficulty.

In 1804, John Boydell decided to appeal to Parliament for a <a href="private%20bill">private bill</a> to authorise a lottery to dispose of everything in his business. The bill received <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> on 23 March, and by November the Boydells were ready to sell tickets. John Boydell died before the lottery was drawn on 28 January 1805, but lived long enough to see each of the 22,000 tickets purchased at three <a href="guinea%20%28coin%29">guinea</a>s apiece (£ each in modern terms). To encourage ticket sales and reduce unsold inventory, every purchaser was guaranteed to receive a print worth one guinea from the Boydell company's stock. There were 64 winning tickets for major prizes, the highest being the Gallery itself and its collection of paintings. This went to <a href="William%20Tassie">William Tassie</a>, a <a href="engraved%20gem">gem engraver</a> and <a href="cameo%20%28carving%29">cameo modeller</a>, of Leicester Fields (now <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>). Josiah offered to buy the gallery and its paintings back from Tassie for £10,000 (worth about £ now), but Tassie refused and auctioned the paintings at <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a>. The painting collection and two reliefs by <a href="Anne%20Seymour%20Damer">Anne Damer</a> fetched a total of £6,181 18s. 6d. The Banks sculpture group from the façade was initially intended to be kept as a monument for Boydell's tomb. Instead, it remained part of the façade of the building in its new guise as the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a> until the building was torn down in 1868–69. The Banks sculpture was then moved to <a href="Stratford-upon-Avon">Stratford-upon-Avon</a> and re-erected in <a href="New%20Place">New Place</a> Garden between June and November 1870. The lottery saved Josiah from bankruptcy and earned him £45,000, enabling him to begin business again as a printer.

From the outset, Boydell's project inspired imitators. In April 1788, after the announcement of the Shakespeare Gallery, but a year before its opening, <a href="Thomas%20Macklin">Thomas Macklin</a> opened a Gallery of the Poets in the former <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> building on the south side of Pall Mall. The first exhibition featured one work from each of 19 artists, including Fuseli, Reynolds, and <a href="Thomas%20Gainsborough">Thomas Gainsborough</a>. The gallery added new paintings of subjects from poetry each year, and from 1790 supplemented these with scenes from the Bible. The Gallery of the Poets closed in 1797, and its contents were offered by lottery. This did not deter <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a> from opening a <a href="John%20Milton">Milton</a> Gallery in the same building in 1799. Another such venture was the Historic Gallery opened by <a href="Robert%20Bowyer">Robert Bowyer</a> in <a href="Schomberg%20House">Schomberg House</a> at 87 Pall Mall in about 1793. The gallery accumulated 60 paintings (many by the same artists who worked for Boydell) commissioned to illustrate a new edition of <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume's</a> "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Great%20Britain%20%28Hume%29">The History of Great Britain</a>". Ultimately, Bowyer had to seek parliamentary approval for a sale by lottery in 1805, and the other ventures, like Boydell's, also ended in financial failure. 
The building in Pall Mall was purchased in 1805 by the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>, a private club of connoisseurs founded that year to hold exhibitions. It remained an important part of the London art scene until disbanded in 1867, typically holding a Spring exhibition of new works for sale from the start of February to the first week of May, and a loan exhibition of <a href="old%20master">old master</a>s, generally not for sale, from the first week of June to the end of August.

The paintings and engravings that were part of the Boydell Gallery affected the way Shakespeare's plays were staged, acted, and illustrated in the 19th century. They also became the subject of criticism in important works such as <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poet</a> and essayist <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge's</a> "Lectures on Shakespeare" and <a href="William%20Hazlitt">William Hazlitt's</a> dramatic criticism. Despite Charles Lamb's criticism of the Gallery's productions, Charles and <a href="Mary%20Lamb">Mary Lamb's</a> children's book, "<a href="Tales%20from%20Shakespeare">Tales from Shakespeare</a>" (1807), was illustrated using plates from the project.

The Boydell enterprise's most enduring legacy was the folio. It was reissued throughout the 19th century, and in 1867, "by the aid of photography the whole series, excepting the portraits of their Majesties George III. and Queen Charlotte, is now presented in a handy form, suitable for ordinary libraries or the drawing-room table, and offered as an appropriate memorial of the tercentenary celebration of the poet's birth". Scholars have described Boydell's folio as a precursor to the modern <a href="coffee%20table%20book">coffee table book</a>.

The "Folio" and "Illustrated Edition" lists were taken from Friedman's "Boydell's Shakespeare Gallery". 


The "Paintings" list is derived from the numbered catalogue "The exhibition of the Shakspeare gallery, Pall-Mall: being the last time the pictures can ever be seen as an entire collection" (London: W. Bulmer & Co., 1805), "The Boydell Shakespeare Gallery" edited by Walter Pape and Frederick Burwick (Bottrop: Peter Pomp, 1996), and <a href="http%3A//www.whatjanesaw.org/1796/rooms.php%3Flocation%3DNRNE">"What Jane Saw"</a>.

Scarlett Johansson

Scarlett Ingrid Johansson (; born November 22, 1984) is an American actress and singer. Johansson is the world's highest-paid actress, has made multiple appearances in the <a href="Forbes%20Celebrity%20100">"Forbes" Celebrity 100</a>, and has a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>. She aspired to be an actress from a young age, and first appeared on stage in an <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> play as a child. Johansson made her film debut in the fantasy comedy "<a href="North%20%281994%20film%29">North</a>" (1994), and was nominated for an <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award">Independent Spirit Award</a> for "<a href="Manny%20%26amp%3B%20Lo">Manny & Lo</a>" (1996).

Johansson shifted to adult roles in 2003 with her performances in "<a href="Lost%20in%20Translation%20%28film%29">Lost in Translation</a>," which won her a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA Award for Best Actress</a>, and "<a href="Girl%20with%20a%20Pearl%20Earring%20%28film%29">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>". She was nominated for four <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globe Awards</a> for these films, and for playing an estranged teenager in the drama "<a href="A%20Love%20Song%20for%20Bobby%20Long">A Love Song for Bobby Long</a>" (2004), and a seductress in the psychological thriller "<a href="Match%20Point">Match Point</a>" (2005). Other films during this period, include the mystery thriller "<a href="The%20Prestige%20%28film%29">The Prestige</a>" (2006) and the comedy-drama "<a href="Vicky%20Cristina%20Barcelona">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>" (2008). She also released two albums: "<a href="Anywhere%20I%20Lay%20My%20Head">Anywhere I Lay My Head</a>" (2008) and "<a href="Break%20Up%20%28album%29">Break Up</a>" (2009), both of which charted on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>.

In 2010, Johansson debuted on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in a revival of "<a href="A%20View%20from%20the%20Bridge">A View from the Bridge</a>", which won her a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20by%20a%20Featured%20Actress%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award for Best Featured Actress</a>. Later that year, she began portraying <a href="Black%20Widow%20%28Natasha%20Romanova%29">Black Widow</a> in the <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. She voiced an intelligent computer operating system in the 2013 comedy-drama "<a href="Her%20%28film%29">Her</a>", played an alien in the 2013 science fiction film "<a href="Under%20the%20Skin%20%282013%20film%29">Under the Skin</a>" and a woman with <a href="psychokinetic">psychokinetic</a> abilities in the 2014 science fiction action "<a href="Lucy%20%282014%20film%29">Lucy</a>". She was the highest-grossing actress of 2016, and is also the highest-grossing actress of all time in North America in nominal dollar terms.

As a public figure, Johansson is a Hollywood <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>. She is a prominent celebrity brand endorser, and also supports various charities and causes. She has been married twice, to the Canadian actor <a href="Ryan%20Reynolds">Ryan Reynolds</a> from 2008 to 2011 and the French businessman Romain Dauriac, with whom she has a daughter, from 2014 to 2017.

Scarlett Ingrid Johansson was born in the <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan borough</a> of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. on November 22, 1984. Her father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark, and her paternal grandfather, <a href="Ejner%20Johansson">Ejner Johansson</a>, was an art historian, screenwriter and film director, whose own father was Swedish. Scarlett's mother, Melanie Sloan, a producer, comes from an <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jewish</a> family, from Poland and Russia. She has an older sister, Vanessa, also an actress; an older brother, Adrian; and a twin brother, Hunter. Johansson also has an older half-brother, Christian, from her father's first marriage. She holds both American and Danish citizenship.

Johansson attended <a href="PS%2041">PS 41</a>, an elementary school in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, Manhattan. Her parents divorced when she was 13. Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, she often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and <a href="jazz%20hands">jazz hands</a>. She took lessons in <a href="tap%20dance">tap dance</a>, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. She describes her childhood as very ordinary.

As a child, Johansson practiced acting by staring in the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a> in "<a href="Meet%20Me%20in%20St.%20Louis">Meet Me in St. Louis</a>". At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her brothers instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the <a href="Lee%20Strasberg%20Theatre%20Institute">Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute</a>, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: "I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> play "Sophistry" with <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>, in which she had two lines. Around this time, she began studying at <a href="Professional%20Children%27s%20School">Professional Children's School</a> (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as <a href="John%20Ritter">John Ritter</a>'s daughter in the fantasy comedy "<a href="North%20%281994%20film%29">North</a>" (1994). She says that when she was on the film set, she knew intuitively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> and <a href="Kate%20Capshaw">Kate Capshaw</a>'s characters in the mystery thriller "<a href="Just%20Cause%20%28film%29">Just Cause</a>" (1995), and an art student in "<a href="If%20Lucy%20Fell">If Lucy Fell</a>" (1996).

Johansson's first leading role was as Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her <a href="Foster%20care">foster home</a> in "<a href="Manny%20%26amp%3B%20Lo">Manny & Lo</a>" (1996) alongside <a href="Aleksa%20Palladino">Aleksa Palladino</a> and her brother, Hunter. Her performance received positive reviews: one written for the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" noted, "[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson," while critic <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a>, writing for the same paper, commented on her "peaceful aura", and believed, "If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress." Johansson earned a nomination for the <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award%20for%20Best%20Lead%20Female">Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female</a> for the role.

After appearing in minor roles in "<a href="Fall%20%281997%20film%29">Fall</a>" and "<a href="Home%20Alone%203">Home Alone 3</a>" (both 1997), Johansson attracted wider attention for her performance in the film "<a href="The%20Horse%20Whisperer%20%28film%29">The Horse Whisperer</a>" (1998), directed by <a href="Robert%20Redford">Robert Redford</a>. The drama film, based on the 1995 <a href="The%20Horse%20Whisperer%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="Nicholas%20Evans">Nicholas Evans</a>, tells the story of a talented trainer with a gift for understanding horses, who is hired to help an injured teenager played by Johansson. The actress received an "introducing" credit on this film, although it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as "13 going on 30". Todd McCarthy of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" commented that Johansson "convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance". For the film, she was nominated for the <a href="Chicago%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress</a>. She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions. On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they "portray kids like mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth".

Johansson later appeared in "<a href="My%20Brother%20the%20Pig">My Brother the Pig</a>" (1999) and in the <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a>, <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a> film "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Wasn%27t%20There%20%282001%20film%29">The Man Who Wasn't There</a>" (2001). Her breakthrough came playing a cynical <a href="outcast%20%28person%29">outcast</a> in <a href="Terry%20Zwigoff">Terry Zwigoff</a>'s black comedy "<a href="Ghost%20World%20%28film%29">Ghost World</a>" (2001), an adaptation of <a href="Daniel%20Clowes">Daniel Clowes</a>' <a href="Ghost%20World%20%28comics%29">graphic novel of same name</a>. Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be "a unique, eccentric person, and right for that part". The film premiered at the 2001 <a href="Seattle%20International%20Film%20Festival">Seattle International Film Festival</a>; it was a box office failure, but has since developed a <a href="cult%20film">cult status</a>. Johansson was credited with "sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age" by an "<a href="Austin%20Chronicle">Austin Chronicle</a>" critic, and won a <a href="Toronto%20Film%20Critics%20Association%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress</a> for her performance.

With <a href="David%20Arquette">David Arquette</a>, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy "<a href="Eight%20Legged%20Freaks">Eight Legged Freaks</a>" (2002), about a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. After graduating from <a href="Professional%20Children%27s%20School">Professional Children's School</a> that year, she applied to New York University's <a href="Tisch%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">Tisch School of the Arts</a>; she decided to focus on her film career when she was rejected.

Johansson transitioned from teen to adult roles with two films in 2003: the romantic comedy-drama "<a href="Lost%20in%20Translation%20%28film%29">Lost in Translation</a>" and the drama "<a href="Girl%20with%20a%20Pearl%20Earring%20%28film%29">Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>". In the former, directed by <a href="Sofia%20Coppola">Sofia Coppola</a>, she plays Charlotte, a listless and lonely young wife, opposite <a href="Bill%20Murray">Bill Murray</a>. Coppola had first noticed Johansson in "Manny & Lo", and compared her to a young <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>; Coppola based the film's story on the relationship between <a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> and Bacall in "<a href="The%20Big%20Sleep%20%281946%20film%29">The Big Sleep</a>" (1946). Johansson found the experience of working with a female director different because of Coppola's ability to empathize with her. Made on a budget of $4million, the film earned $119million at the box office and received positive reviews. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> was pleased with the film and described the lead performances as "wonderful", and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" wrote of Johansson's "embracing, restful serenity". "The New York Times" praised Johansson, then 18, for playing an older character.
In <a href="Peter%20Webber">Peter Webber</a>'s "Girl with a Pearl Earring", which is based on <a href="Girl%20with%20a%20Pearl%20Earring%20%28novel%29">the novel of same name</a> by <a href="Tracy%20Chevalier">Tracy Chevalier</a>, Johansson played Griet, a young 17th-century servant in the household of the Dutch painter <a href="Johannes%20Vermeer">Johannes Vermeer</a> (played by English actor <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>). Webber interviewed 150 actors before casting Johansson. Johansson found the character moving, but did not read the novel, as she thought it was better to approach the story with a fresh start. "Girl with a Pearl Earring" received positive reviews and was profitable. In his review for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", <a href="Anthony%20Lane">Anthony Lane</a> thought that her presence kept the film "alive", writing, "She is often wordless and close to plain onscreen, but wait for the ardor with which she can summon a closeup and bloom under its gaze; this is her film, not Vermeer's, all the way." <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a>, of "Entertainment Weekly" noted her "nearly silent performance", observing, "The interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." She was nominated for the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role</a> and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress for both films in 2003, winning the former for "Lost in Translation".

In "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" opinion, Johansson's roles in "Lost in Translation" and "Girl with a Pearl Earring" established her as among the most versatile actresses of her generation. Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Score">The Perfect Score</a>", the drama "<a href="A%20Love%20Song%20for%20Bobby%20Long">A Love Song for Bobby Long</a>", and the drama "<a href="A%20Good%20Woman%20%28film%29">A Good Woman</a>"—were critical and commercial failures. Co-starring with <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a>, Johansson played a discontented and suspicious teenager in "A Love Song for Bobby Long", which is based on the novel "Off Magazine Street" by Ronald Everett Capps. "Variety" David Rooney wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's portrayals rescued the film. Johansson earned a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama</a> nomination for the film.

In her fourth release in 2004, the <a href="live-action%20animated%20film">live-action animated</a> comedy "<a href="The%20SpongeBob%20SquarePants%20Movie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a>", Johansson voiced Princess Mindy, the daughter of <a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">King Neptune</a>. She took the part because of her love for cartoons and "<a href="The%20Ren%20%26amp%3B%20Stimpy%20Show">The Ren & Stimpy Show</a>". The film was her most commercially successful work that year. She followed it with "<a href="In%20Good%20Company%20%282004%20film%29">In Good Company</a>", a comedy-drama in which she complicates the life of her father when she dates his much younger boss. Reviews of the film were generally positive, describing it as "witty and charming". Roger Ebert was impressed with Johansson's portrayal, writing that she "continues to employ the gravitational pull of quiet fascination".

Johansson played Nola, an aspiring actress who begins an affair with a married man (<a href="Jonathan%20Rhys%20Meyers">Jonathan Rhys Meyers</a>) in <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a>'s drama "<a href="Match%20Point">Match Point</a>" in 2005. After replacing <a href="Kate%20Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> with Johansson for the role, Allen changed the character's nationality from British to American. As an admirer of Allen's films, Johansson liked the idea of working with him, but felt nervous her first day on the set. "The New York Times" was impressed with Johansson and Rhys Meyers' performances, and Mick LaSalle, writing in the "San Francisco Chronicle", said that Johansson "is a powerhouse from the word go", with a performance that "borders on astonishing". The film, a box office success, earned Johansson nominations for the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe</a> and the <a href="Chicago%20Film%20Critics%20Association%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>. Also that year, Johansson underwent a <a href="tonsillectomy">tonsillectomy</a>, after which she starred with <a href="Ewan%20McGregor">Ewan McGregor</a> in <a href="Michael%20Bay">Michael Bay</a>'s science fiction film "<a href="The%20Island%20%282005%20film%29">The Island</a>", in dual roles as Sarah Jordan and her clone, Jordan Two Delta. Johansson found her filming schedule exhausting: she had to shoot for 14 hours a day, and she hit her head and injured herself. The film received mixed reviews and grossed $163million against a $126million budget.
Two of Johansson's films in 2006 explored the world of stage magicians, both opposite <a href="Hugh%20Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a>. Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film "<a href="Scoop%20%282006%20film%29">Scoop</a>" (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics. Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson "lovely as always", and Mick LaSalle noted the freshness she brought to her part. She also appeared in <a href="Brian%20De%20Palma">Brian De Palma</a>'s "<a href="The%20Black%20Dahlia%20%28film%29">The Black Dahlia</a>", a <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later said she was a fan of DePalma and had wanted to work with him on the film, but thought that she was unsuitable for the part. Anne Billson of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" likewise found her miscast. However, <a href="CNN">CNN</a> said that she "takes to the pulpy period atmosphere as if it were oxygen".

As of May 2017, Johansson is the highest-grossing actress of all time in North America, with her films making over $4.3billion.

Johansson has appeared in advertising campaigns for <a href="Calvin%20Klein">Calvin Klein</a>, <a href="Dolce%20%26amp%3B%20Gabbana">Dolce & Gabbana</a>, <a href="L%27Or%C3%A9al">L'Oréal</a>, and <a href="Louis%20Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>, and has represented the Spanish brand <a href="Mango%20%28clothing%29">Mango</a> since 2009. Johansson was the first Hollywood celebrity to represent a champagne producer, appearing in advertisements for <a href="Mo%C3%ABt%20%26amp%3B%20Chandon">Moët & Chandon</a>. In January 2014, the Israeli company <a href="SodaStream">SodaStream</a>, which makes home-carbonation products, hired Johansson as its first global brand ambassador, a relationship that commenced with a television commercial during <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII">Super Bowl XLVIII</a> on February 2, 2014. This proved controversial, as SodaStream is based in Israeli-occupied territory in the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a>.

Johansson has supported various charitable organizations, including "<a href="Aid%20Still%20Required">Aid Still Required</a>, <a href="Cancer%20Research%20UK">Cancer Research UK</a>, <a href="Stand%20Up%20To%20Cancer">Stand Up To Cancer</a>, Too Many Women" (which works against breast cancer), and "<a href="USA%20Harvest">USA Harvest</a>", which provides food for people in need. In 2005, Johansson became a global ambassador for the aid and development agency <a href="Oxfam">Oxfam</a>. In 2007, she took part in the anti-<a href="poverty">poverty</a> campaign <a href="ONE%20Campaign">ONE</a>, which was organized by <a href="U2">U2</a>'s lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a>. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid <a href="%C2%A3">£</a>20,000 on an <a href="eBay">eBay</a> auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets, and a chauffeured trip to accompany her on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of "<a href="He%27s%20Just%20Not%20That%20Into%20You%20%28film%29">He's Just Not That Into You</a>".

In January 2014, Johansson resigned from her Oxfam position after criticism of her promotion of SodaStream, whose main factory was based in <a href="Mishor%20Adumim">Mishor Adumim</a>, an <a href="Israeli%20settlement">Israeli settlement</a> in the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a>; Oxfam opposes all trade with such Israeli settlements. Oxfam stated that it was thankful for her contributions in raising funds to fight poverty. Together with her "Avengers" costars, Johansson raised $500,000 for the victims of <a href="Hurricane%20Maria">Hurricane Maria</a>.

In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the <a href="Time%27s%20Up%20%28movement%29">Time's Up</a> initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination. She took part in <a href="2018%20Women%27s%20March">Women's March</a> in Los Angeles in January 2018 and spoke on topics such as abuses of power and shared her own experience. Johansson was criticised for calling out <a href="James%20Franco">James Franco</a> on allegations of <a href="James%20Franco%23Misconduct%20accusations">sexual misconduct</a> as in the past she had been silent on working with <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a> amid accusation by his daughter <a href="Dylan%20Farrow">Dylan Farrow</a>.

Johansson was registered as an <a href="Independent%20%28voter%29">independent</a>, at least through 2008, and campaigned for <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic candidate</a> <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 United States presidential election</a>. When <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> was reelected in 2004, she said she was disappointed.

In January 2008, her campaign for Democratic candidate <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> included appearances in <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> targeted at younger voters, an appearance at <a href="Cornell%20College">Cornell College</a>, and a speaking engagement at <a href="Carleton%20College">Carleton College</a> in <a href="Northfield%2C%20Minnesota">Northfield, Minnesota</a>, on <a href="Super%20Tuesday%2C%202008">Super Tuesday, 2008</a>. Johansson appeared in the music video for rapper <a href="will.i.am">will.i.am</a>'s song, "<a href="Yes%20We%20Can%20%28will.i.am%20song%29">Yes We Can</a>" (2008), directed by <a href="Jesse%20Dylan">Jesse Dylan</a>; the song was inspired by Obama's speech after the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20primary%2C%202008">2008 New Hampshire primary</a>. In February 2012, Johansson and <a href="Anna%20Wintour">Anna Wintour</a> hosted a fashion launch of pro-Obama clothing, bags, and accessories, whose proceeds went to the President's re-election campaign. She addressed voters at the <a href="2012%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> in September 2012, calling for Obama's reelection and for more engagement from young voters. She encouraged women to vote for Obama and condemned <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> for his opposition to <a href="Planned%20Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a>.

Johansson publicly endorsed and supported <a href="Manhattan%20Borough%20President">Manhattan Borough President</a> <a href="Scott%20Stringer">Scott Stringer</a>'s 2013 run for New York City Comptroller by hosting a series of fundraisers.

Political history of Mysore and Coorg (1565–1760)

The political history of Mysore and Coorg (1565–1760) is the <a href="political%20history">political history</a> of the contiguous historical regions of <a href="Princely%20State%20of%20Mysore">Mysore state</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Kodagu%23British%20rule">Coorg province</a> located on the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a> in west-central <a href="peninsular%20India">peninsular India</a> (Map 1). It begins with the fall of the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a> in 1565 and ends just before the rise of <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> <a href="Haidar%20Ali">Haidar Ali</a> in 1761.

At the height of the Vijayanagara Empire (1350–1565), the Mysore and Coorg region was ruled by motley <a href="chiefdom">chieftains</a>, or <a href="raja">raja</a>s ("little kings"). Each raja had dominion over a small area, and each supplied soldiers and annual <a href="tribute">tribute</a> for the empire's needs. Soon after the empire's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family, many chieftains, especially in the west, tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms. Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty, various powers from the north invaded the region intermittently. Among these were the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Bijapur">Sultanate of Bijapur</a> to the northwest, the <a href="Sultanate">Sultanate</a> of <a href="Qutb%20Shahi%20dynasty">Golconda</a> to the northeast, the fledgling <a href="Maratha%20empire">Maratha empire</a>, farther northwest, and the <a href="Mughul%20Empire">Mughal empire</a>, farther north still. For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers, and amongst the little kings, resulted in shifting sovereignties, loyalties, and borders. By the turn of the 18th century, the political landscape had become better defined. The northwestern hills were being ruled by the <a href="Nayak%20%28title%29%23Nayankara%20System%20%28in%20South%20India%29">Nayaka</a> rulers of <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Ikkeri</a>, the southwestern, in the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a>, by the <a href="Raja">Raja</a>s of <a href="Coorg">Coorg</a>, the southern plains by the <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyar</a> rulers of <a href="Mysore%20state">Mysore</a>, all of which were <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> dynasties; whereas the eastern and northeastern regions were being ruled by the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="Nawab">Nawab</a>s of <a href="Nawab%20of%20the%20Carnatic">Arcot</a> and <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a>. Of these, Ikkeri and Coorg were independent, Mysore, although much expanded, was formally a Mughal dependency, and Arcot and Sira, Mughal "<a href="Subah%20%28province%29">subahs</a>" (or provinces).

The stability, however, was not to last. Mysore's expansions had been based on unstable alliances. When the alliances began to unravel, as they did during the next half century, political decay set in, presided over inevitably by pageant kings. The Mughal governor, Nawab of Arcot, in a display of the still far-flung reach of a <a href="Mughal%20Empire%23Decline">declining Mughal empire</a>, raided the Mysore capital, <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>, to collect unpaid taxes. The neighbouring Raja of Coorg began a war of attrition with Mysore over western territory. Soon, the <a href="Maratha%20empire">Maratha empire</a> invaded again and exacted more concessions of territory. In the chaotic last decade of this period, a little-known <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> cavalryman, <a href="Haidar%20Ali">Haidar Ali</a>, seized power in Mysore. Under him, in the decades following, Mysore was to expand again. It was to do so prodigiously to match in size southern India itself. It was also to pose the last serious threat to the new rising power on the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">subcontinent</a>, the <a href="East%20India%20Company">English East India Company</a>.

A common feature of all large regimes in the region during the period 1565–1760 is increased <a href="Fiscal-military%20state">military fiscalism</a>. This mode of creating income for the state consisted of extraction of <a href="tribute">tribute</a> payments from local chiefs under threat of military action. It differed both from the more <a href="Segmentary%20lineage">segmentary</a> modes of preceding regimes and the more absolutist modes of succeeding ones—the latter achieved through direct tax collection from citizens. Another common feature of these regimes is the fragmentary <a href="historiography">historiography</a> devoted to them, making broad generalizations difficult.

The last <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> empire in South India, the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>, was defeated on 23 January 1565, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talikota">Battle of Talikota</a> by the combined forces of the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> states of <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Bijapur">Bijapur</a>, <a href="Golconda">Golconda</a>, and <a href="Ahmadnagar%20Sultanate">Ahmadnagar</a> to its north. The battle was fought in <a href="Talikota">Talikota</a> on the "<a href="doab">doab</a>" (or "tongue" of land) between the <a href="Kistna%20River">Kistna river</a> and its major left bank tributary, the <a href="Bhima%20river">Bhima</a>, north of the imperial capital of <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> (see ). The invaders later destroyed the capital, and the ruler's family escaped to <a href="Penukonda">Penukonda</a>, southeast, where they established their new capital. Soon they moved their capital another east-southeast to <a href="Chandragiri">Chandragiri</a>, not far from the southeastern coast, and survived there until 1635, their dwindling empire concentrating its resources on its eastern <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> and <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> speaking realms. According to historian <a href="Sanjay%20Subrahmanyam">Sanjay Subrahmanyam</a>: " ... in the ten years following 1565, the imperial centre of Vijayanagara effectively ceased to be a power as far as the western reaches of the peninsula were concerned, leaving a vacuum that was eventually filled by Ikkeri and Mysore."
Earlier, in the heyday of their rule, the kings of Vijayanagara had granted tracts of lands throughout their realm to various <a href="vassal">vassal</a> <a href="chiefdom">chiefs</a> on the stipulation that they pay tribute and render military service. The chiefs in the northern regions were supervised directly from the capital. Those in the richer, more distant southern provinces, however, could not be controlled easily and the Vijayanagara emperors were able to collect only part of the annual revenue from them. Overseen by a <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>—titled "Sri Ranga Raya" and based in the island town of <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a> on the river <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri</a> (also <a href="Cauvery">Cauvery</a>), some south of the capital—the southern chiefs bore various formal titles. These included the title "<a href="Nayak%20dynasty">Nayaka</a>", assumed by the chiefs of <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi</a> in the northwestern hills, of Basavapatna, and <a href="Nayakas%20of%20Chitradurga">Chitaldroog</a> in the north, of <a href="Belur%2C%20Karnataka">Belur</a> in the west, and of Hegalvadi in the centre; the title "<a href="Gowda%20%28caste%29">Gowda</a>", assumed by the chiefs of <a href="Chickballapur">Ballapur</a> and of <a href="Yelahanka">Yelahanka</a> in the centre, and of <a href="Kolar%20district">Sugatur</a> in the east; and "<a href="Odeyar">Wodeyar</a>", assumed by the rulers of <a href="Wodeyar">Mysore</a>, of <a href="Nanjangud">Kalale</a> and of <a href="Chamrajnagar">Ummatur</a> in the south. (See .)

The somewhat tenuous hold the Vijayanagara centre had on its southern periphery resulted only partly from the latter's remoteness. The centralisation imposed by the empire was resisted by the southern chiefs (sometimes called "rajas", or "little kings") for moral and political reasons as well; according to historian <a href="Burton%20Stein">Burton Stein</a>: 'Little kings', or "<a href="raja">raja</a>s", never attained the legal independence of an aristocracy from both monarchs and the local people whom they ruled. The sovereign claims of would-be centralizing, South Indian rulers and the resources demanded in the name of that sovereignty diminished the resources which local chieftains used as a kind of royal largess; thus centralizing demands were opposed on moral as well as on political grounds by even quite modest chiefs.

These chiefs came to be called "<a href="poligars">poligars</a>", a British corruption of "Palaiyakkarar" (<a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>: holder of "palaiya" or "baronial estate"). (<a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>: "pale" + "gara" = palegara).
Meanwhile, almost a decade after their victories at <a href="Talikota">Talikota</a>, the <a href="Deccan%20sultanates">Deccan sultanates</a> of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar agreed in 1573 not to interfere in each other's future conquests by reserving regions to the south for <a href="Adil%20Shahi">Bijapur</a>. In 1577, Bijapur forces attacked again and overwhelmed all opposition along the western coast. Easily taking <a href="Adoni">Adoni</a>, a former Vijayanagara stronghold, they attempted next to take <a href="Penukonda">Penukonda</a>, the new Vijayanagara capital. (See ).) There, however, they were repulsed by an army led by the Vijayanagara ruler's father-in-law, Jagadeva Raya, who had traveled north for the engagement from his base in <a href="Dharmapuri%20district">Baramahal</a>. For his services, Jagadeva Raya's territories within the crumbling empire were vastly expanded, extending westward now up to the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a>, the mountain range running along the southwestern coast of India, and with a new capital in <a href="Channapatna">Channapatna</a> (See .)

The territories controlled by the other poligars were also changing fast. Some, such as Tamme Gowda of Sigatur, expanded theirs by performing services for the Vijayanagara monarch and receiving territorial rewards. In Tamme Gowda's case, the rewards consisted of a tract of land which, from his base in Sigatur, extended west to <a href="Hoskote">Hoskote</a> and east to <a href="Punganur">Punganur</a>. Others, such as the Wodeyars of <a href="Chamrajnagar">Ummattur</a> and of Mysore (now <a href="Mysore%20district">Mysore district</a>), achieved the same end by ignoring the monarch altogether, and annexing small states in their vicinity. (See .)
Through much of the 16th century, the chiefs of Ummattur in particular had carried on "unceasing aggression" against their neighbors, even in the face of punitive raids by the Vijayanagara armies. In the end, as a compromise, the son of a defeated Ummattur chief was appointed the viceroy at <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>. The Wodeyars of Mysore too were eying surrounding land; by 1644, when the Wodeyars unseated the powerful Changalvas of <a href="Piriyapatna">Piriyapatna</a>, not only had they become the dominant presence in the southern regions of what later became Mysore state, but the Vijayanagara empire was also on its last legs, having only a year's life left. (See .)

The <a href="Adil%20Shahi%20dynasty">Sultans of Bijapur</a>, for their part—some sixty years after their defeat at Penukonda—regrouped and struck again in 1636. They did so now with the blessing of the <a href="Mughal%20empire">Mughal empire</a> of <a href="Northern%20India">Northern India</a>, whose <a href="tributary%20state">tributary state</a>s they had recently become. They had also the help of a <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> chieftain of western India, <a href="Shahaji%20Bhonsle">Shahaji Bhonsle</a>, who was on the lookout for rewards of "<a href="jagir">jagir</a>" land in the conquered territories, and whose son, <a href="Shivaji%20Bhonsle">Shivaji Bhonsle</a> was to found the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha Empire</a> some 30 years later. In the western-central poligar regions, the Bijapur-Shahji forces achieved only mixed results: The <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Nayakas of Keladi</a> were decisively defeated, but were able to buy back their lands from their Bijapur invaders. The Bijapur attack on <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a> was repulsed in its entirety by the reigning Wodeyar of Mysore, with great losses to the invaders. (See .)

In the east, the Bijapur-Shahji forces had better success; in 1639, they took possession of gold-rich <a href="Kolar%20district">Kolar district</a> and soon of <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>, a city founded a century earlier by <a href="Kempe%20Gowda%20I">Kempe Gowda I</a>, and to become, two centuries later, a hub of British presence. Next, moving down the <a href="Eastern%20Ghats">Eastern Ghats</a>, the range of mountains rising behind the coastal plains of southeastern India, they captured the historic towns of <a href="Vellore">Vellore</a> and <a href="Gingee">Gingee</a>. Returning north through the east-central "<a href="maidan%20%28Karnataka%29">maidan</a>" plain (average elevation ), they gained possession of the towns of <a href="Chickballapur">Ballapur</a>, <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a>, and the hill fortress of <a href="Chitradurga">Chitaldroog</a>. (See .)
A new province named "Caranatic-Bijapur-Balaghat", consisting of possessions such as Kolar, Hoskote, Bangalore, and Sira, and situated above (or westwards of) the <a href="Eastern%20Ghats">Eastern Ghats</a> range, was soon incorporated into the <a href="Adil%20Shahi%20dynasty">Sultanate of Bijapur</a> and granted to Shahji as a <a href="jagir">jagir</a>, or temporary gift. The possessions "below" the Ghats, such as <a href="Gingee">Gingee</a> and <a href="Vellore">Vellore</a> became part of another province, named "Carnatic-Bijapur-Payanghat", whose first governor was none other than Shahji again. When Shahji died in 1664, his son, <a href="Venkoji">Venkoji</a>, from his second wife, who meanwhile had become the ruler of <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a> farther south, inherited these territories. This twist of fate, however, did not sit well with <a href="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>—Shahji's oldest son, from his first wife—who now led an expedition southwards to claim his fair share. Shivaji's quick victories resulted in a partition, whereby both the "Carnatic-Bijapur" provinces became his dominions, and whereas <a href="Tanjore">Tanjore</a> was retained by Venkoji. (See .)

The successes of Bijapur and Shivaji were being watched warily by the major imperial presence on the subcontinent, the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal Empire</a> in <a href="North%20India">North India</a>. Having become the Mughal emperor in 1659, <a href="Aurengzeb">Aurengzeb</a>, soon set himself upon destroying the Sultanates of Bijapur and <a href="Qutb%20Shahi%20dynasty">Golconda</a>, the latter famous for its <a href="Golconda%23Diamonds">diamond mines</a>, as well as the burgeoning Maratha power of Shivaji. In 1686, the Mughals took Bijapur and, the following year, Golconda. Before long, fast moving Mughal armies were bearing down on the former Vijayanagara dominions. In 1687, a new Mughal province (or "suba") was created with capital at <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a>. Bangalore, quickly taken by the Mughals from the Marathas, was sold to the Wodeyar of Mysore for 300,000 <a href="rupees">rupees</a>. Qasim Khan was appointed the first Mughal "Faujdar Diwan" (literally, "military governor") of the "<a href="Province%20of%20Sira">Province of Sira</a>".

Although their own histories date the origins of the <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyars of Mysore</a> (also "Odeyar", "Udaiyar", "Wodiyar", "Wadiyar", or "Wadiar", and, literally, "chief") to 1399, records of them go back no earlier than the early 16th century. These "<a href="poligar">poligar</a>s" are first mentioned in a <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> literary work from the early 16th century. A petty <a href="chiefdom">chieftain</a>, Chamaraja (now Chamaraja III), who ruled from 1513 to 1553 over a few villages not far from the <a href="Kaveri%20river">Kaveri river</a>, is said to have constructed a small fort and named it, "Mahisuranagara" "<a href="Water%20buffalo">Buffalo Town</a>"), from which <a href="Mysore%20State">Mysore</a> gets its name. (See .) Th <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyar</a> clan issued its first inscription during the chieftaincy of Timmaraja (now Timmaraja II) who ruled from 1553 to 1572. Towards the end of his rule, he is recorded to have owned 33 villages and fielded an army of 300 men.

By the time of the short-lived incumbency of Timmaraja II's son, Chama Raja IV—who, already well into his 60s, ruled from 1572 to 1576—the Vijayanagara Empire had been dealt its fatal blow. Before long, Chama Raja IV withheld payment of the annual tribute to the now weakened empire's viceroy at <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>. The viceroy responded by attempting to arrest Chamaraja IV; in this, however, he failed, and the taxes remained unpaid. An outright military challenge to the empire would have to await the incumbency of Raja I, Chama Raja IV's eldest son, who became the "Wodeyar" in 1574. Early in 1610, Raja I captured Seringapatam and, in a matter of days, on 8 February 1610, moved his capital there. (See .) During his rule, according to , his "chiefdom expanded into a major principality".

In 1638, the reins of power fell into the hands of the 23-year-old <a href="Kanthirava%20Narasaraja%20I">Kanthirava Narasaraja I</a>, who, a few months earlier, had been adopted by the widow of Raja I. Kanthirava was the first "wodeyar" of Mysore to create the symbols of royalty, such as a royal mint, and went on to issue coins named "Kanthiraya" (corrupted to "Canteroy") after himself. These remained a part of Mysore's "current national money" well into the 18th century.

<a href="Roman%20Catholicism%20in%20India">Catholic missionaries</a>, who had arrived in the coastal areas of <a href="southern%20India">southern India</a>—the southwestern <a href="Malabar%20coast">Malabar coast</a>, the western <a href="Kanara">Kanara coast</a>, and the southeastern <a href="Coromandel%20coast">Coromandel coast</a> (also "Carnatic")—beginning early in the 16th century, did not start work in land-locked Mysore until half way through the seventeenth. (See ). The Mysore mission was established in <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a> in 1649 by Leonardo Cinnami, an Italian <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> from <a href="Goa">Goa</a>. Expelled a few years later from Mysore on account of opposition in Kanthirava's court, Cinnami returned, toward the end of Kanthirava's rule, to establish missions in half a dozen locations. During his second stay Cinnami obtained permission to convert Kanthirava's subjects to Christianity. He was successful mostly in the eastern regions, later part of the <a href="Madras%20Presidency">Madras Presidency</a> of <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. According to , "Of a reported 1700 converts in the Mysore mission in the mid-1660s, a mere quarter were "Kannadigas" (<a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> speakers), the rest being <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> speakers from the western districts of modern-day <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, ..." Married ten times, the ruler died on 31 July 1659, at the age of 44. At his funeral, all his surviving wives killed themselves by committing <a href="sati%20%28practice%29">sati</a> on his funeral pyre.

After an unremarkable period of rule by short-lived incumbents, in 1672, Kanthirava's 27-year-old grand nephew, <a href="Chikka%20Devaraja">Chikka Devaraja</a>, became the new "wodeyar". During his rule, centralized military power increased to an unprecedented degree for the region. (See and .) Introducing various mandatory taxes on peasant-owned land, Chikka Devaraja, however, exempted his soldiers' land from these payments. The perceived inequity of this action, the unusually high taxes, and the intrusive nature of his regime, created wide protests which had the support of the wandering <a href="Jangama">Jangama</a> ascetics in the monasteries of the <a href="Lingayatism">Lingayat</a>s, a monotheistic religious order that emphasizes a personal relationship with the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> god <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>. According to , a slogan of the protests was: Basavanna the Bull tills the forest land; <a href="Indra">Devendra</a> gives the rains;<br>
Why should we, the ones who grow crops through hard labor, pay taxes to the king?

The king, resolving upon a "treacherous massacre", used the stratagem of inviting over 400 monks to a grand feast at the famous <a href="Shaivism">Shaiva</a> center of "Nanjanagudu" and, upon its conclusion, presenting them with gifts and directing them to exit one at a time through a narrow lane where they were each strangled and beheaded by waiting royal wrestlers. According to <a href="Mark%20Wilks">Mark Wilks</a>, quoted in , "Circular orders had been sent for the destruction, on the same day, of all the Jangam "<a href="matha">matha</a>" (places of residence and worship) in his dominions; and the number reported to have been in consequence destroyed was upwards of seven hundred." This "sanguinary measure" had the effect of stopping cold all protests to the new taxes.

Around this time, 1687, Chikka Devaraja purchased the city of <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> for <a href="Rs.">Rs.</a> 300,000 from Qasim Khan, the new <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> governor of the <a href="Province%20of%20Sira">Province of Sira</a>. Through the latter, Chikka Devaraja "assiduously cultivated an alliance" with Mughal emperor <a href="Aurangzeb">Aurangzeb</a>. He also turned his attention to the regions that were less the objects of Moghul interest. The regions to the southeast below the <a href="Eastern%20Ghats">Eastern Ghats</a> mountains around <a href="Dharmapuri%20district">Baramahal</a> and <a href="Salem%20district">Salem</a> were annexed to Mysore, and, in 1694, regions in the southwest up to the <a href="Baba%20Budangiri">Baba Budan mountains</a> on the western edge of the <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan Plateau</a>, were added. Two years later Chikka Devaraja attacked lands farther south belonging to the <a href="Madurai%20Nayak">Madurai Nayak</a> (also "Madura") and laid a siege of <a href="Tiruchirapalli">Trichinopoly</a>. (See .)

After the death of Qasim Khan, his Mughal liaison, Chikka Devaraja sent a diplomatic mission to Emperor Aurangzeb at Ahmadnagar with the intention of either renewing his Mughal connections, or seeking Mughal recognition of his southern conquests. In response, in 1700, it was said, the Mughal emperor sent the Mysore Raja a <a href="Seal%20%28device%29%23Signet%20rings">signet ring</a> "bearing the title "Jug Deo Raj" (literally, "lord and king of the world") and permission to sit on an ivory throne" and a " Firangi " Sword from his Palace <a href="Regalia">Regalia</a>, with Gold Etching on the <a href="Hilt">Hilt</a>, to be used as a <a href="Sword%20of%20State">Sword of State</a> by the Mysore Raja, while sitting on the throne. After the return of the mission, Chikka Devaraja reorganized his administration into eighteen departments, in "imitation of what the envoys had seen at the Mughal court". When the Raja died on 16 November 1704, his dominions extended from <a href="Tumkur%20district">Midagesi</a> in the north to <a href="Palni%20Hills">Palni Hills</a> and <a href="Anaimalai">Anaimalai</a> in the south, and from <a href="Coorg">Coorg</a> in the west to <a href="Dharmapuri%20district">Dharmapuri district</a> in the east. (See and .) During his long reign of 31 years, he had made Mysore a "secure and prosperous state."

However, according to , the <a href="polity">polity</a> that Chikka Devaraja left for his son was "at one and the same time a
strong and a weak" one. Although it had uniformly expanded in size from the mid-17th century to the early 18th century, it had done so as a result of alliances that tended to hinder the very stability of the expansions. Some of the southeastern conquests (such as that of <a href="Salem%20district">Salem</a>), although involving regions that were not of direct interest to the Mughals, were nonetheless the result of alliances with the Mughal governor of Sira and with <a href="Venkoji">Venkoji</a>, the <a href="Tanjore%20Nayak">Maratha ruler of Tanjore</a>; the siege of <a href="Tiruchirapalli">Tiruchirapalli</a> had to be abandoned because the alliance had begun to rupture. (See .) Similarly, in addition to allegedly receiving a signet ring and a <a href="Monarchy">Royal</a> State <a href="Sword">Sword</a> or <a href="Sword%20of%20State">Sword of State</a>, a consequence of the diplomatic mission sent to Aurangzeb in 1700 was formal subordination to Mughal authority and a requirement to pay annual taxes; there is evidence too that the administrative reforms Chikka Devaraja has instituted might have been a direct result of Mughal influence.

The early 18th century ushered in the rule of <a href="Kanthirava%20Narasaraja%20II">Kanthirava Narasaraja II</a>, who, being both deaf and <a href="muteness">mute</a>, ruled under the <a href="regent">regency</a> of a series of army chiefs ("Delavoys") all of whom hailed from a single family from the village of <a href="Kalale">Kalale</a> in the <a href="Nanjangud">Nanjangud</a> <a href="taluk">taluk</a> (or sub-district) of Mysore. Upon the ruler's death in 1714 at the age of 41, his son, <a href="Dodda%20Krishnaraja%20I">Dodda Krishnaraja I</a>, still two weeks shy of his 12th birthday, succeeded him.

Around this time a change had come in the governance of the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> <a href="Province%20of%20Sira">Province of Sira</a> to the north and northeast of Mysore. (See .) In 1713, the province was split into a "payanghat" jurisdiction with capital at <a href="Arcot">Arcot</a> and governed by a newly styled <a href="Nawab%20of%20Arcot">Nawab of Arcot</a>, and a "balaghat" jurisdiction with capital at <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a>, and governed by an also newly styled <a href="Nawab">Nawab</a> of <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a>. That same year, the military governor of the old province, Sadat-ulla Khan, was made the new Nawab of Arcot, and another official, Amin Khan, was appointed Nawab of Sira; Since Mysore remained a formal <a href="tributary%20state">tributary state</a> of Sira, this division, and the resulting loss of revenue from the rich "<a href="Maidan%20%28Karnataka%29">Maidān</a>" plain of Mysore, provoked Sadat-ulla Khan's displeasure. In collusion with the rulers of <a href="Kadapa">Kadapa</a>, <a href="Kurnool">Kurnool</a>, and <a href="Savanur">Savanur</a> and the <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> Raja of <a href="Anantapur%2C%20Andhra%20Pradesh">Gutti</a>, he decided to march against Dodda Krishnaraja I. The Nawab of Sira, anxious to preempt the coalition's action, hit upon a similar plan for reaching the Mysore capital, <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>. In the end, both Nawabs—of Arcot and Sira—settled upon a joint invasion led by the former. Dodda Krishnaraja, for his part, was able to "buy off this formidable confederacy" by offering a tribute of <a href="Rs.">Rs.</a> 10 million (10 million). Although avoiding bloodshed, the outcome made Mysore vulnerable to similar future claims, which were made successfully two years later by <a href="Maratha%20empire">Maratha</a> raiders who appeared in the Mysore capital. The resulting depletion of the Mysore treasury led Mysore to attack and absorb the <a href="poligar">poligar</a> <a href="chiefdom">chiefdom</a> of <a href="Magadi">Magadi</a> to its north. (See .)

According to , the ruler's lack of interest in the affairs of state, led two ministers, Devaraja, the army chief (or "delavayi"), and his cousin, Nanjaraja, who was both the revenue minister (the "sarvadhikari") and the privy councilor ("pradhana"), to wield all authority in the kingdom. After Dodda Krishnaraja's death in 1736, the ministers appointed "pageant rajas", and effectively ruled Mysore until the rise of <a href="Haidar%20Ali">Haidar Ali</a> in 1760.

In the northwestern regions, according to , an even more impressive chiefly house arose in Vijayanagara times and came to enjoy an extensive sovereignty. These were the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi chiefs</a> who later founded the "Nayaka" kingdom of <a href="Ikkeri">Ikkeri</a>. At its greatest, the Ikkeri "<a href="raja">raja</a>s" controlled a territory nearly as large as the Vijayanagara heartland, some 20,000 square miles, extending about 180 miles south from <a href="Goa">Goa</a> along the trade-rich <a href="Kanara">Kanara coast</a>. 
When <a href="Vasco%20da%20Gama">Vasco da Gama</a> landed in <a href="History%20of%20Kozhikode">Calicut</a>, on the southwestern <a href="Malabar%20coast">Malabar coast</a> of India, in 1498, the Vijayanagara empire was about to reach its apex. During the 16th century the chieftaincies, or "Nayaka" principalities, of Keladi (and later of Ikkeri and Bednur) were established in the western part of what later became <a href="Shivamogga%20district">Shimoga district</a>. (See and .) Sadasiva Raya Naik, the first of the Keladi chiefs, was granted permission by the Vijayanagara emperor to administer some towns on the western <a href="Kanara">Kanara coast</a>. In the decade after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire, the <a href="Portuguese%20India">Portuguese</a>, who until then had pursued their <a href="Spice%20trade%23Trade%20under%20colonialism">pepper trade</a> entirely on the <a href="Malabar%20coast">Malabar coast</a> farther south, decided as a commercial strategy, to hedge their bets, and commenced purchasing some pepper from the Kanara region. During 1568–1569, they took possession of the coastal towns of <a href="Honavar">Onor</a> (now Honavar), <a href="Basrur">Barcelor</a> (now Basrur), and <a href="Mangalore">Mangalore</a> and constructed fortresses and factories at each location. (See and .)

Onor (Modern <a href="Honnavar">Honnavar</a>) was located on the banks of the <a href="Sharavathi%20River">Sharavathi River</a>, two miles (3 km) upstream from the mouth, where the river widened into a lake. Built strategically on a cliff overlooking the river, the Portuguese fort contained homes for thirty "casados" (married settlers). A natural <a href="sandbank">sandbank</a> kept out the large ocean-going ships, and left the harbour accessible only to small craft. Approximately, farther upstream, the Portuguese maintained a weighing station at <a href="Gersoppa%20Falls">Gersoppa</a>, where they purchased the pepper. During the latter part of the 16th century and the first half of the 17th, Onor became not only the principal port for the export of Kanara pepper, but also the most important Portuguese supply point for pepper in all of Asia.

Located some south of Onor, and a few miles up the <a href="Varahi%20River">Coondapoor estuary</a> (now Varahi) was the town of <a href="Basrur">Barcelore</a> (now Basrur). Building their fortress downstream of the existing Hindu town in order to control any approaches from the sea, the Portuguese provided accommodation for some 30 "casados" within its walls; another 35 casados and their families lived in a walled area at a stone's throw. Barcelore became a busy trading centre which exported rice, local textiles, <a href="Potassium%20nitrate">saltpetre</a>, and iron from the interior regions and imported <a href="coral">coral</a>s, exotic <a href="yard%20goods">yard goods</a> and horses. (See and .)

Fifty miles south of Barcelore was Mangalore, the last of the Portuguese strongholds in Kanara, situated on the mouth of the <a href="Netravati%20River">Netravati River</a>. There too the Portuguese built a fortress and alongside it a walled town with accommodation for 35 "casados" families. Both Barcelore and Mangalore became principal ports for the export of rice and during the first half of the 17th century and supplied the many strategic "fortalezas" that were of significance to the "<a href="Estado%20da%20India">Estado da India</a>", the Portuguese Asian empire. These included, <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a>, <a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman">Muscat</a>, Mozambique and <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a>. (See .)

As a ready source of rice, <a href="black%20pepper">pepper</a> and <a href="teak">teak</a>, the <a href="Kanara">Kanara</a> coast was important to the "Estado da India". For much of the 16th century, Portuguese had been able to negotiate favorable terms of trade with the weak principalities that constituted the Kanara coast. Towards the end of the century, the "Nayaka" ruler of Keladi (and Ikkeri), Venkatappa Nayaka (<a href="Reign">r.</a> 1592–1629), "assumed independence" from the residual Vijayanagara empire. Asserting power, he and his successors, Virabhadra Nayaka (<a href="Reign">r.</a> 1629–1645) and Shivappa Nayaka (r. 1645–1660) forced a revision of the previous trade treaties. By the 1630s, the Portuguese had agreed to buy pepper at market rates and the rulers of Ikkeri had been permitted two voyages per year without the purchase of a "<a href="cartaz">cartaz</a>" (a pass for Portuguese protection) as well as annual importation of twelve duty-free horses.

With the Bijapur raids threatening the region, Shivappa Nayaka moved the capital once again, this time to Bednur (later Nagar), which was deemed safer. (See .) Shivappa Nayaka rapidly took possession of a region that extended east to Shimoga, south to Manjarabad, and west through most of the Kanara coast. When the last king of Vijayanagara sought refuge in his realms, Shivappa Nayaka set him up at Belur and Sakkarepatna, and later mounted an unsuccessful siege of <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a> on the latter's behalf. By the 1650s, he had driven the Portuguese out of the three "fortalezas" at Onor, Barcelore, and Mangalore. After his death in 1660, his successor Somashker Nayaka, however, sent an embassy to Goa for reestablishing the Portuguese trading posts in Kanara. By 1671 a treaty, which was very favorable once again to the Portuguese, had been agreed to. (See and .)

Before the treaty could be implemented, Somashkar Nayaka died and was succeeded by an infant grandson Basava Nayaka, his succession disputed by the Queen Mother, who favored another claimant, Timmaya Nayaka. The 1671 treaty languished amidst the succession struggle until 1678, when yet another treaty was negotiated with Basava Nayaka who emerged as the victor. Since both parties in the succession struggle had been interested in purchasing European artillery from the Portuguese, the eventual treaty of 1678 was even more favorable to the latter. Under it, Basava agreed to pay 30,000 <a href="xerafin">xerafin</a>s in Portuguese war-charges for the decade-long conflict with the <a href="Dutch%20India">Dutch</a> (whom the Nayakas of Ikkeri had supported), to provide construction material for the factory at Mangalore, to provide 1,500 sacks of clean rice annually, to pay a yearly <a href="tribute">tribute</a> for Mangalore and Barcelore, to destroy the factories of the Omani Arabs on the Kanara coast, and to allow Catholic churches to be built at a number of locations in Kanara. With the treaty in place, Portuguese power returned to Kanara after an interregnum of almost half a century. The Nayakas of Ikkeri, in their turn, managed to control the region until 1763, at which time Haidar Ali took possession of it and declared the intention of making a new capital, later called Nagar. (See .)

A <a href="Mughal%20empire">Mughal</a> province, which comprised the <a href="Carnatic%20region">Carnatic region</a> south of the <a href="Tungabhadra%20river">Tungabhadra river</a>, and which was to exist for seventy years, was established in 1687 with its capital at <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a> (in <a href="Tumkur%20District">Tumkur District</a>). (See .) Known as the "<a href="Province%20of%20Sira">Province of Sira</a>" (also "Carnatic-Balaghat"), it was composed of seven <a href="pargana">pargana</a>s (districts): <a href="Davanagere%20district">Basavapatna</a>, Budihal, <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a>, <a href="Penukonda">Penukonda</a>, <a href="Doddaballapura">Dod-Ballapur</a>, <a href="Hoskote">Hoskote</a>, and <a href="Kolar">Kolar</a>; in addition, <a href="Harpanahalli">Harpanahalli</a>, Kondarpi, <a href="Anegundi">Anegundi</a>, <a href="Shimoga">Bednur</a>, <a href="Chitradurga">Chitaldroog</a>, and Mysore were considered by the Mughals to be <a href="tributary%20state">tributary state</a>s of the province. Qasim Khan (also, Khasim Khan or Kasim Khan) was appointed the first "Subahdar" (governor) and "Faujdar" (military governor) of the province in 1689. Having displayed "energy and success" both in controlling and in developing the province, he died in 1694, either killed by <a href="Maratha%20empire">Maratha</a> raiders from the northwest, or killing himself in disgrace after these raiders seized a treasure under his care. Most "Subhahdars" who governed after him were to be replaced in a year or two by a successor. The instability would continue until Dilavar Khan was appointed governor in 1726, his term lasting until 1756. In 1757, Sira was overrun by the Marathas, only to be restored to the Mughals in 1759. In 1761 future ruler <a href="Haidar%20Ali">Haidar Ali</a>, whose own father had been the Mughal military governor (or "Faujdar") of <a href="Kolar%20district">Kolar district</a> in the province, captured Sira, and soon conferred on himself the title of "Nawab of Sira". However, the defection of his brother five years later caused the province to be lost again to the Marathas, who retained it until Haidar's son, <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, recaptured it for his father in 1774.

The capital of the province, Sira town, prospered most under Dilavar Khan and expanded in size to accommodate 50,000 homes. (See .) Palaces and public monuments of Sira became models for other future constructions; both Haidar Ali's palace in <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> and Tipu Sultan's in <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>, built during the period 1761–1799 of their rule, were modeled after Dilavar Khan's palace in Sira. Likewise, according , Bangalore's <a href="Lal%20Bagh">Lal Bagh</a> as well as <a href="Bangalore%20Fort">Bangalore fort</a> may have been designed after Sira's Khan Bagh gardens and Sira fort respectively. Sira's civil servants, however, could not be as readily reproduced; after Tipu Sultan had succeeded his father as Sultan of Mysore in 1782, he deported 12,000 families, mainly of city officials, from Sira to Shahr Ganjam, a new capital he founded on Seringapatam island.

Earlier, in 1689, after the <a href="Moghul%20Empire">Moghul</a> armies had overrun the region of the Mysore table-land, twelve <a href="pargana">pargana</a>s (or sub-districts) were annexed to the newly formed province ("subah") of Sira. The remaining region was allowed to remain under the rule of the "<a href="poligar">poligar</a>s", who continued to collect taxes from the cultivators, but were now required to pay annual tribute to the provincial government in Sira. In the annexed regions, in which tax assessment on cultivation was under "amāni" or "Sarkār" (provincial government) management, an elaborate system of officials collected and managed revenue. Most offices had existed in the region under the previous <a href="Adil%20Shahi">Bijapur Sultanate</a> administration, and consisted, among others, of "Deshmūks", "Deshpāndes", "Majmūndārs", and "Kānungoyas". The "Deshmūks" "settled accounts" with the village headmen (or "patels"); the "Deshpāndes" verified the account-books of the village registrars (or "kārnāms"); the "Kānungoyas" entered the official regulations in the village record-books and also explained decrees and regulations to the village governing officers and residents.
Lastly, the "Majmūndārs" prepared the final documents of the "settlement" ("i.e." the assessment and payment of tax) and promulgated it.

Until the mid-17th century, both village- and district ("<a href="taluq">taluq</a>") accounts had been prepared in the language and script of <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>, the region's traditional language.
However, after the Bijapur invasions, <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha</a> <a href="chiefdom">chieftains</a> came to wield authority in the region and brought in with them various officials who introduced the <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi language</a> and script into the "public accounts". The new language even found its way into lands ruled by some <a href="poligar">poligar</a> chiefs. These chieftains had brought in <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a>-speaking horsemen from the northern Bijapur realms for their newly formed cavalry units and resorted to hiring Maratha accountants for the benefit of these cavalrymen. After the province of Sira was created, the official language of the <a href="Moghul%20empire">Moghul empire</a>, <a href="Farsi%20language">Persian</a>, came to be used.

Although, "Rājendranāme", a "royal" genealogy of the rulers of <a href="Coorg">Coorg</a>, written in 1808, makes no mention of the origin of the lineage, its reading by historian <a href="Lewis%20Rice">Lewis Rice</a> led him to conclude that the princely line was established by a member of the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Ikkeri Nayaka</a> family. Having moved south to the town of Haleri in northern Coorg in the disguise of a wandering <a href="Jangama">Jangama</a> monk, he soon began to attract followers; then, with their help, or their acquiescence, he took possession of the town, and in such manner came to rule the entire country. (See .) According to the genealogy, the Coorg "<a href="raja">raja</a>s" who ruled from the mid-16th century to the mid-18th century were:

By the late 17th-century, the "raja"s of Coorg had created an "aggressive and independent" state, which became known for its acts of "wanton cruelty" against enemies, and for its "system of terror" directed at its citizens. Muddu Raja, the Coorg ruler from 1633 to 1687, initially ruled from the town of Haleri, but later moved his capital to <a href="Mercara">Mercara</a>, which he fortified and where he built a palace in 1681. Early during the rule of his successor, Dodda Virappa (1687–1736), the army of the neighboring kingdom of Mysore, under the orders of "Wodeyar" <a href="Chikka%20Devaraja">Chikka Devaraja</a>, attacked and seized <a href="Piriyapatna">Piriyapatna</a>, a territory which abutted Coorg (see ), and which was then being ruled by a kinsman of Dodda Virappa. Buoyed by the victory, the Mysore army soon attacked Coorg itself; however, it had advanced only a short distance, when, while camping overnight on the plain of Palupare, it was surprised by a Coorg ambush. In the ensuing massacre, the Mysore army lost 15,000 men, and the survivors had to beat a hasty retreat.
For most of the next two decades, the western reaches of Mysore remained vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army. In the border district of Yelusavira, the Coorg and Mysore forces fought to a stalemate and, in the end, had to work out a tax sharing arrangement.

In 1724, major hostilities resumed between Coorg and Mysore. Changing his <a href="modus%20operandi">modus operandi</a> from <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla skirmishes</a> in the hilly Coorg jungle to open field warfare, Dodda Virappa, attacked the Mysore army in the plains. Catching it off guard, he took in rapid succession six fortresses from <a href="Piriyapatna">Piriyapatna</a> to <a href="Arkalgud">Arkalgud</a>. The resulting loss of revenue, some 600,000 gold <a href="Pagoda%20%28coin%29">pagodas</a>, was felt in Mysore, and several months later, in August or September 1724, a large army was sent from <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>, the Mysore capital, to Coorg. Upon the Mysore army's arrival in the western region, however, the Coorg forces, returning to guerrilla warfare, retreated into the woods. Emboldened by the lack of resistance, the Mysore forces next mounted an attack on the Coorg hills. There too, they met no resistance. However, a few days into this invasion, the Mysore forces, recalling their ignominious ambush in the 1690s, panicked and retreated during the night. Soon, the Coorg army was attacking the Mysore outposts again. This pattern of back and forth was to continue until the Mysore army was recalled, a few months later, to Seringapatam, leaving the region again vulnerable to the periodic raids of the Coorg army. According to historian <a href="Sanjay%20Subrahmanyam">Sanjay Subrahmanyam</a>, The entire episode yields a rare insight into one aspect of war in the 18th century: the (<a href="Coorg">Coorg</a>) forces, lacking cavalry, with a minimum of
firearms, lost every major battle, but won the war by dint of two factors. First, the terrain, and the possibility of retreating periodically into the wooded hillside, favoured them, in contrast to their relatively clumsy opponents. Second, the Mysore army could never maintain a permanent presence in the region, given the fact that the Wodeyar kingdom had several open frontiers.

More than a century earlier, <a href="Lewis%20Rice">Lewis Rice</a>, had written: Dodda Virappa evinced throughout his long and vigorous reign an unconquerable spirit, and though surrounded by powerful neighbours, neither the number nor the strength of this enemies seems to have relaxed his courage or damped his enterprise. He died in 1736, 78 years old. Two of his wives <a href="sati%20%28practice%29">ascended the funeral pile</a> with the dead body of the Raja.

The ruler was succeeded by his grandson, Chikka Virappa, whose unremarkable rule lasted until 1768, when Coorg was conquered by <a href="Haidar%20Ali">Haidar Ali</a>, the new <a href="sultan">sultan</a> of Mysore.

From the mid-15th century to the mid-18th century, according to historian <a href="Burton%20Stein">Burton Stein</a>, rulers of states in southern India commenced financing wars on a different footing than had their predecessors. To varying degrees, all the rulers of the Mysore and Coorg region—the Vijayanagara emperors, the "Wodeyars" of Mysore, the "Nayakas" of Ikkeri, the "Subahdars" of Sira, and the "Rajas" of Coorg—fall under this category. A similar political system, referred to as "military fiscalism" by French historian Martin Wolfe, took hold in Europe between the 15th and 17th centuries. During this time, according to Wolfe, most regimes in Western Europe emerged from the aristocracy to become absolute monarchies; they simultaneously reduced their dependence on the aristocracy by expanding the tax base and developing an extensive tax collection structure. In Stein's words, Previously resistant aristocracies were eventually won over in early modern Europe by being offered state offices and honors and by being protected in their patrimonial wealth, but this was only after monarchies had proven their ability to defeat antiquated feudal forces and had found alternative resources in cities and from trade.

In southern India, none of the pre-1760 regimes were able to achieve the "fiscal absolutism" of their European contemporaries. Local chieftains, who had close ties with their social groups, and who had only recently risen from them, opposed the excessive monetary demands of a more powerful regional ruler. Consequently, the larger states of this period in southern India, were not able to entirely change their mode of creating wealth from one of extracting <a href="tribute">tribute</a> payments, which were seldom regular, to that of direct collection of taxes by government officials. Extorting tribute under threat of military action, according to Stein, is not true "military fiscalism," although it is a means of approaching it. This partial or limited military fiscalism began during the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>, setting the latter apart from the more "segmentary" regimes that had preceded it, and was a prominent feature of all regimes during the period 1565–1760; true military fiscalism was not achieved in the region until the rule of <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> in the 1780s.

Stein's formulation has been criticized by historian <a href="Sanjay%20Subrahmanyam">Sanjay Subrahmanyam</a>, in part, on account of the lack of extensive <a href="historiography">historiography</a> for the period. The 18th-century <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyar</a> rulers of Mysore—in contrast to their contemporaries in <a href="Rajputana">Rajputana</a>, <a href="Central%20India">Central India</a>, <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>, and <a href="Tanjavur">Tanjavur</a>—left little or no record of their administrations. Surveying the historiography, Subrahmanyam, says:A major problem attendant on such generalisations by modern historians concerning pre-1760 Mysore is, however, the paucity of documentation on this older 'Old Regime'.

The first explicit "History" of Mysore in English is "Historical Sketches of the South of India, in an attempt to trace the History of Mysoor" (), by <a href="Mark%20Wilks">Mark Wilks</a>. Wilks claimed to have based his history on various <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> documents, many of which have not survived. According to , all subsequent histories of Mysore have borrowed heavily from Wilks's book for their pre-1760 content. These include, <a href="Lewis%20Rice">Lewis Rice</a>'s well-known "<a href="Gazetteer">Gazetteer</a>" of 1897 and C. Hayavadana Rao's major revision of the "Gazetteer" half a century later, and many modern spin-offs of these two works. In Subrahmanyam's words, "Wilks's work is an important one therefore, not only for its own sake, but for its having been regurgitated and reproduced time and again with minor variations."

A <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyar</a> dynasty genealogy, the "Chikkadevaräya Vamśävali" of Tirumalarya, was composed in <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a> during the period 1710–1715, and was claimed to be based on all the then-extant inscriptions in the region. Another genealogy, "Kalale Doregala Vamśävali", of the "Delvoys", the near-hereditary chief ministers of Mysore, was composed around the turn of the "19th" century. However, neither manuscript provides information about administration, economy or military capability. The ruling dynasty's origins, especially as expounded in later palace genealogies, are also of doubtful accuracy; this is, in part, because the Wodeyars, who were reinstated by the British on the Mysore "<a href="Throne%23Thrones%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">gaddi</a>" in 1799, to preside over a fragile sovereignty, "obsessively" attempted to demonstrate their "unbroken" royal lineage, to bolster their then uncertain status.

The earliest manuscript offering clues to governance and military conflict in the pre-1760 Mysore, seems to be Dias , an annual letter written in <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> by a Mysore-based <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Jesuit missionary</a>, Joachim Dias, and addressed to his <a href="Provincial%20superior">Provincial superior</a>. After the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>'s final 1799 victory over <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, official Company records began to be published as well; these include , a collection of <a href="Anglo-Mysore%20Wars">Anglo-Mysore Wars</a>-related correspondence between the Company's officials in India and <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company%20directors">Court of Directors</a> in London, and , the first report on the new <a href="Princely%20State%20of%20Mysore">Princely State of Mysore</a> by its resident, Mark Wilks. Around this time, French accounts of the Anglo-Mysore wars appeared as well, and included , a history of the wars by Joseph-François Michaud, another Jesuit priest. The first attempt at including a comprehensive history of Mysore in an English language work is , an account of a survey of <a href="South%20India">South India</a> conducted at Lord <a href="Richard%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Wellesley">Richard Wellesley</a>'s request, by <a href="Francis%20Buchanan">Francis Buchanan</a>, a Scottish physician and geographer. By the end of the period of British Commissionership of Mysore (1831–1881), many English language works had begun to appear on a variety of Mysore-related subjects. These included , a book of English translations of <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a> inscriptions, and , <a href="William%20Digby%20%28writer%29">William Digby</a>'s two volume critique of British famine policy during the <a href="Great%20Famine%20of%201876%E2%80%9378">Great Famine of 1876–78</a>, which devastated Mysore for years to come.

Liber Eliensis

The Liber Eliensis is a 12th-century English chronicle and history, written in <a href="medieval%20Latin">Latin</a>. Composed in three books, it was written at <a href="Ely%20Abbey">Ely Abbey</a> on the island of <a href="Ely%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Ely</a> in the <a href="The%20Fens">fenland</a>s of eastern <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a>. Ely Abbey became the <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">cathedral</a> of a newly formed <a href="Diocese%20of%20Ely">bishopric</a> in 1109. Traditionally the author of the anonymous work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author.

The "Liber" covers the period from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of <a href="hagiography">saints' lives</a>. The work typifies a type of local history produced during the latter part of the 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the "Liber" chronicles the devastation that <a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a> caused during the reign of King <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen</a>. It also documents the career of <a href="Nigel%20of%20Ely">Nigel</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a> from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, <a href="%C3%86thelthryth">Æthelthryth</a>, and gifts of land to Ely.

Two complete manuscripts survive, complemented by partial manuscripts. The Latin text was published in 1962, and an English translation followed in 2005. Extracts had appeared in print earlier.

The "Liber Eliensis" provides an important history of the region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely.

The "Liber Eliensis" was written at Ely Abbey, which became <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">Ely Cathedral</a> upon conversion into a bishopric in 1109. The historian Elisabeth van Houts believes that it was written in two stages: first under Bishop <a href="Hervey%20le%20Breton">Hervey le Breton</a>, in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop <a href="Geoffrey%20Ridel%20%28bishop%20of%20Ely%29">Geoffrey Ridel</a>, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s. However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the "Liber" was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the "Liber" was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the "Liber" was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As there is no mention of Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.

Traditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian <a href="Antonia%20Gransden">Antonia Gransden</a> is inclined to believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and <a href="prior">prior</a> of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a <a href="classicist">classicist</a> and a recent translator of the "Liber", suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the "Liber" specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.

The "Liber" is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the "<a href="Historia%20Ecclesie%20Abbendonensis">Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis</a>" of <a href="Abingdon%20Abbey">Abingdon Abbey</a>, the "<a href="Chronicon%20Abbatiae%20Rameseiensis">Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis</a>" of <a href="Ramsey%20Abbey">Ramsey Abbey</a>, the "<a href="Chronicon%20Angliae%20Petriburgense">Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense</a>" of <a href="Peterborough%20Abbey">Peterborough Abbey</a>, a history of the <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a> of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Bath%20and%20Wells">Bath and Wells</a>, and the "<a href="Chronicon%20Monasterii%20de%20Bello">Chronicon Monasterii de Bello</a>" of <a href="Battle%20Abbey">Battle Abbey</a>. The northern histories record the <a href="foundation%20stories">foundation stories</a> of the various <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the "Liber Eliensis", mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a>.

To a large extent the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing from or at least using earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", a chronicle that was associated with Bede's "<a href="De%20temporum%20ratione">De temporum ratione</a>", the "<a href="Chronicon%20ex%20chronicis">Chronicon ex chronicis</a>", and <a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a>' "Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum". Lesser-used sources include the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a>' "Historia Ecclesiastica", Stephen of Ripon's "<a href="Vita%20Sancti%20Wilfrithi">Vita Sancti Wilfrithi</a>", <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>'s "<a href="Gesta%20pontificum%20Anglorum">Gesta pontificum Anglorum</a>", a list of the <a href="King%20of%20Wessex">kings of Wessex</a>, the Old English poem "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Maldon">The Battle of Maldon</a>", and a number of saints' lives, including some written by <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a>, Felix, <a href="Abbo%20of%20Fleury">Abbo of Fleury</a>, <a href="Goscelin">Goscelin</a>, and <a href="Osbern%20of%20Canterbury">Osbern of Canterbury</a>. The work on Maldon was included because the hero of the work was <a href="Byrhtnoth">Byrhtnoth</a>, a patron of the monastery.

Works more directly related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Winchester">Æthelwold of Winchester</a>'s "Libellus", large parts of which were copied into the "Liber Eliensis". Also incorporated into the "Liber" was an earlier "Vita", or saints' life, on Æthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely. A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used, and the material from three surviving <a href="cartulary">cartularies</a>. These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler. Another source, as related in the "Liber" itself, was a work about <a href="Hereward%20the%20Wake">Hereward the Wake</a> written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the "<a href="Gesta%20Herwardi">Gesta Herwardi</a>" known from a 13th-century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the "Liber" used the exact text of the "Gesta" as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.

Some of these sources may originally have been oral works. A number of the stories in the narrative parts of the "Liber" resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It is possible that the information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.

The work is traditionally divided into three books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, Æthelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King <a href="Edgar%20the%20Peaceable">Edgar's</a> (reigned 959–975) rule concludes the book. The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop Æthelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents. The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>. Interspersed with the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.

The work also depicts the devastation that <a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a> caused during King <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen's</a> reign. The chronicler states that failure of the harvest and pillaging caused a <a href="famine">famine</a>. The work describes the area around the abbey for as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200 <a href="penny%20%28English%20coin%29">pence</a>. The long descriptions of Nigel of Ely's disputes with King Stephen lead to a discussion of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lincoln%20%281141%29">Battle of Lincoln</a> and other matters not directly related to Ely. The "Liber" gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a> to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the "Liber" praises the new king.

An important part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint Æthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier "Vita", or "Life", of Æthelthryth, which resembles the "Vitae" of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely. The work may have helped to increase the number of pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred II</a> (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift. The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the "Liber" would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation. The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the "Liber".

Another concern of the chronicle was the acquisition of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre-existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The "Liber" was used by the monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate. The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishops of Lincoln</a>, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.

A third theme of the work is the stress on the importance and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The "Liber" stresses the burials of <a href="Athelstan%20%28bishop%29">Æthelstan</a>, a <a href="Bishop%20of%20Elmham">Bishop of Elmham</a>, that of <a href="%C3%86lfwine%20of%20Elmham">Ælfwine</a>, another Bishop of Elmham, and <a href="Wulfstan%20II">Wulfstan II</a>, an <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>.

The "Liber" was familiar to the 13th-century chronicler <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a>, who used it along with the "Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis" of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, <a href="Roger%20of%20Wendover">Roger of Wendover</a>, was also aware of the "Liber".

Some of the information contained in the "Liber" is important to historians. It is in the "Liber" that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the "<a href="Benedictine%20Rule">Benedictine Rule</a>" into Old English is made. The "Liber" is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal <a href="Chancery%20%28medieval%20office%29">chancery</a>, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The "Liber" describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of <a href="chancellor">chancellor</a> (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> is a matter of some debate amongst historians.

The historian <a href="Dorothy%20Whitelock">Dorothy Whitelock</a> says of the work that it is "unique among post-Conquest monastic histories". It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a <a href="Liberty%20%28division%29">judicial liberty</a>, or the exercise of all the royal rights within a <a href="Hundred%20%28county%20subdivision%29">hundred</a>. To do this, the "Liber" collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution. Despite the untrustworthy nature of the "Liber" and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period it covers, as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric. The historian Antonia Gransden characterises the "Liber" as "valuable for general history", but qualifies by saying that "the whole lacks unity and has errors and confusing repetitions".

The work survives in two complete manuscripts (MS), that of <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a> MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of Ely Cathedral Chapter, usually known as the F manuscript. The E manuscript dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different <a href="Hand%20%28handwriting%29">scribal hands</a>. The F manuscript dates to the early 13th century, with four scribal hands. The E manuscript was given to Trinity College as part of the Gale Collection by <a href="Roger%20Gale%20%28antiquary%29">Roger Gale</a> in 1738. The F manuscript has remained at Ely since its creation, and is the only manuscript at Ely still remaining from the medieval monastic library.

As well as the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> MS <a href="Cotton%20library">Cotton</a> Titus A.i, usually known as the G manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottonian manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286. This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.

The relationship between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts relate to each other cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the "Liber", suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.

Related manuscripts include <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> Oxford MS Laud 647, known as the O manuscript. This is based on the "Liber", but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the "Liber", calls that and related works the "Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium". Another related work is contained in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the "Libellus" of Æthelwold and an Ely cartulary. Two other related works containing just cartularies are British Library <a href="Cotton%20MS%20Tiberius">Cotton MS Tiberius</a> A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register Liber M.

"Liber Eliensis" has been published by the <a href="Royal%20Historical%20Society">Royal Historical Society</a> in its Camden Third Series, edited by E. O. Blake. The edition contains the Latin text along with some Old English texts, but no translation. Janet Fairweather has produced a recent English translation of the Latin, published in 2005 by the <a href="Boydell%20Press">Boydell Press</a>.

Formerly, only sections of the "Liber" had appeared in print, without translations. Parts of the "Liber" were edited by D. J. Stewart and published by the <a href="Anglia%20Christiana%20Society">Anglia Christiana Society</a> in 1848. Other extracts were published in various works, including parts of Book I that were included in Volume 2 of <a href="Jean%20Mabillon">Jean Mabillon</a>'s nine-volume "<a href="Acta%20Sanctorum">Acta Sanctorum</a>", printed between 1688 and 1701. Another set of extracts, mainly consisting of parts of Book II, was compiled by Roger Gale's father <a href="Thomas%20Gale">Thomas Gale</a>, as part of his "<a href="Historicae%20Britannicae%20Scriptores%20XV">Historicae Britannicae Scriptores XV</a>", published at Oxford in 1691.

Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series

The Fourth Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five <a href="Test%20cricket">Tests</a> in a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> <a href="1948%20Ashes%20series">series</a> between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>. The match was played at <a href="Headingley%20Stadium">Headingley Stadium</a> at <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> from 22 to 27 July with a rest day on 25 July. Australia won the match by <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29">seven wickets</a> to take an unassailable 3–0 series lead. In successfully chasing a <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">target</a> of 404, they set a new world record for the highest victorious <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">runchase</a> in Test history.

Needing to win the match to prevent an Australian series victory, England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> won the <a href="Toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat. England continued to rearrange their team, making three changes in an attempt to find a combination that could challenge Australia, which made two changes forced by injury. Unlike the preceding Tests, England's <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">openers</a> were able to withstand the Australian new ball attack, and the <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> of <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> put on 168 for the opening stand. Washbrook fell for 143 in the last <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> of the day, but England clearly had the better of the play, ending at 268/2 by <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">stumps</a>. Australia's bowlers were heavily criticised for their performance, which was seen as lethargic. The next day, England continued to amass runs, with Australia appearing unthreatening and unable to dislodge <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a> and <a href="Nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a> <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>, who batted until mid-afternoon. Bedser and Edrich then fell in quick succession for 79 and 111 respectively as England then collapsed and lost 8/73 to be all out for 496 late in the day. The hosts were heavily criticised for the collapse, which was largely due to unforced errors. Among the Australian bowlers, the wickets were shared. Australia then reached 63/1 in reply at stumps on day two.

Australia were in early trouble on the third morning when English <a href="Bowler%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a> <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> removed <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> and captain <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> in the same over to leave the score at 68/3. However, <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> (58) and <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> (112) launched a rapid counter-attack, adding 121 runs in 90 minutes in a display praised for its aesthetic beauty. They were later supported by <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> (93)—who hit five <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a><nowiki>—</nowiki>and <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> (77), who both struck the ball powerfully. Australia ended the day at 457/9, having added 394 runs in one day, and 102 runs for the last two wickets to that point.

Australia were bowled out for 458 early on the fourth morning after the rest day, and England set about extending their lead, adding 129 for the first wicket, until both openers fell without further addition. In the meantime the workload on the Australian bowlers was heavy as <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> had broken down in the first innings and unable to participate further. Edrich and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> took the score to 232/2 until a late collapse saw England reach stumps at 362/8. England batted on for two overs on the final day, <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declaring</a> at 365/8. <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> was the most successful bowler with 4/95. This left Australia a target of 404 in less than a day, which would require a world record runchase, and allowed Yardley to use the <a href="road%20roller">heavy roller</a> to break up the <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitch</a>, making batting even harder for the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">tourist</a>s. Most observers predicted an easy England win on a deteriorating surface. Australia started slowly, and Bradman joined Morris at 57/1 with 347 runs still needed in 257 minutes. They put together a <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">stand</a> of 301 in only 217 minutes, aided by erratic bowling, several missed catches and <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">stumpings</a> to help Australia to a win by seven wickets with 15 minutes remaining. Morris made 182 while Bradman was unbeaten on 173. The England selectors were heavily criticised after the match for failing to include a <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner in the team to exploit the favourable conditions. For the third time in a row, the match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.

Australia had proceeded through the first two months of their tour of England undefeated. After winning 10 of the first 12 games—the other two being drawn—eight of these by an innings, they won the <a href="first%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">First Test</a> by eight wickets. Between the Tests, they defeated <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> by an innings before drawing against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>. They crushed England by 409 runs in the <a href="Second%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Second Test</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, Abefore defeating <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> by ten wickets and crushing <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> by an innings and 363 runs, after amassing 774/7 <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a>, their highest score of the season. The <a href="Third%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">Third Test</a> was drawn amid rain interruptions that cost a day and a half of play; England had been in a strong position, having been 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand in their second innings when rain came at the end of the third day. Australia proceeded to claim a ten-wicket triumph over <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> in their only county game before the Fourth Test.

Australia made two changes for the Test at Headingley. Middle-order batsman <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> replaced the injured opener <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>, who had collapsed while fielding during the Third Test after being hit in the ribs by a <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">pull shot</a>. Australia declined to replace Barnes with the reserve opener <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, instead opting to use vice-captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> as a makeshift opener rather than in his customary position in the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">middle-order</a>. Harvey had scored an <a href="not%20out">unbeaten</a> 73 and a 95 in the recent tour matches against Surrey and Gloucestershire respectively. <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a> replaced first-choice wicket-keeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test, and he exacerbated the injury during the match against Middlesex. Former Australian Test <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> criticised the Australians for opting to use only one spinner, pointing out that he and <a href="Chuck%20Fleetwood-Smith">Chuck Fleetwood-Smith</a>, a left-arm <a href="wrist%20spin">wrist spin</a>ner, had taken 17 wickets between them during the last Anglo-Australian Test at Headingley in 1938. O'Reilly cited a further instance of an Ashes Test at the same venue in 1934 in which he and <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a> had significant success for Australia. He wanted at least one of the two leg spinners, <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a> or <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>, to have played alongside <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a>, the only specialist spinner to have played in the three preceding Tests.

England made three changes. <a href="George%20Emmett">George Emmett</a> was dropped after making 10 and a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> on his debut, and <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> was recalled to take his opening position after being controversially omitted after the Second Test. England's leading batsman, Hutton had scored 74 in the First Test and made 52 and 64 for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> against Australia in the lead-up matches, when none of his teammates passed 26. O'Reilly praised the decision and the England selectors for stopping "all nonsense and phoney tactics". He further speculated that they would have done so irrespective of Hutton's form to avoid the wrath of the parochial <a href="Yorkshire%20CCC">Yorkshire</a> spectators at Headingley, but in any case he regarded the original axing as scapegoating for England's two losses. O'Reilly believed the English administrators were penalising Hutton for angering them rather than poor performance. The decision to recall Hutton was met with wide approval from the cricketing public.

<a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>, the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner, replaced his left arm finger-spinning colleague <a href="Jack%20Young%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Young</a>, who had taken 1/78 in the previous match against Australia for Middlesex, and totalled 3/174 in his two Tests in the series. Since his omission after the Second Test, Laker had taken 15 wickets in four matches for Surrey.

Middle-order batsman <a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a>, who had made only 38 in three innings in the Second and Third Tests, was replaced by all-rounder <a href="Ken%20Cranston">Ken Cranston</a>. Playing mainly for <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, Cranston had scored a century and four fifties, and taken 37 wickets in his last ten matches, but his previous outings against the tourists had not been successful. In two matches for the MCC and Lancashire against Australia, he had managed only 47 runs in three innings and a total of 2/109. English commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> said Cranston's selection was an "indication that the selectors were again hankering after the non-existent Test all-rounder". O'Reilly regarded it as "the best team that the English selectors chose during the season" but felt they would be largely incapable of stopping an Australian series victory.

As Australia were leading 2–0 after three Tests, England needed to win the last two matches to square the series. The hosts won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch, which was seen as being unhelpful to <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a>. Despite saying the pitch would be more conducive to spinners, O'Reilly described the playing strip as being "so green that it was difficult to decide where the out-field ended and the pitch began". Although fast, the outfield was bumpy in some parts. On some sections of the ground, there was a downward slope towards the edge of the playing arena, meaning the ball would accelerate downhill after being hit. At times the crowd spilled over the unfenced boundary, making the ground smaller than intended. All these factors meant <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29">scoring a boundary</a> would be an easier task for the batsmen.

The England openers <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> and <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> were given a loud reception as they walked out to bat, particularly the <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> local Hutton. They had to face the Australian opening pair of <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> without the aid of <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">sightscreen</a>. It was the first time some of the Australians had played in a first-class match without a sightscreen, and those cricketers would later have to bat without its assistance. It was believed the Yorkshire administrators were reluctant to install a sightscreen as it would have taken up space and lowered the capacity of the ground, and thus the gate takings.

The large crowd roared boisterously as Hutton got off the mark with a single in the first <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> from Lindwall. At the other end, Miller bowled with less pace than normal and his opening over saw three <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a>es. In Miller's first over, Hutton scored the first boundary of the day, driving past mid-off. Both Australian pacemen felt their legs for strained muscles, and after two overs O'Reilly described as "very innocuous", Miller was taken off. He was replaced by the left-arm pace of <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a>, who appeared to be having back problems. Johnston had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues. Johnston's apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine that he should have been given more rest in the county matches. The Australian bowlers appeared to be unsettled and Bradman made four bowling changes in the first 50 minutes of play.

Bradman thought his faster bowlers could not extract much bounce from the surface and soon removed the short leg fielder, and pursued a 6–3 off-side field with three slips and a deep point, trying to encourage the English openers to cut through the vacant area between the slips and extra cover. However, they declined Bradman's incentive and decided to bat in a low-risk manner, favouring straight-batted shots. After 80 minutes of batting, England's openers reached 50, the first time they had put on a half-century in the series. Hutton and Washbrook appeared set for the long haul, and did not react to the applause. They continued on cautiously, and persisted in eschewing the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">cross-batted cut and pull shots</a> and relying on the safe accumulation of singles.

Hutton then edged a ball from left-arm <a href="Medium%20pace%20bowling">medium pace</a>r <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> through <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">the slips</a>, and was dropped by <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> on 25 after flicking the ball behind <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">square leg</a> from the medium pace of <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a>. Hutton then hit a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">square drive</a> past <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">point</a> and Washbrook pulled a ball along the ground past Harvey, who was patrolling the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">midwicket boundary</a>. England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively. After a slow start, they had scored at almost a run a minute after passing 50, and five boundaries were hit from a spell of six overs by Lindwall.

Immediately after lunch, Lindwall made a confident <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a> for <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) against Washbrook, but was not supported behind the stumps by a silent Saggers, and the umpire ruled against the tourists. At the other end, Hutton square drove Toshack for four, bringing up his fifty in 125 minutes. He followed this with another boundary in the same direction, and Washbrook back cut Lindwall for four more at the other end. This brought up England's 100, its first without loss for the series. Washbrook then <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">on-drove</a> a ball to the boundary and brought up his half-century, as Bradman pondered how to capture Australia's first wicket. England brought up 150 without loss 30 minutes before tea, and continued unhindered by two brief rain interruptions. Up to this point, the Australian bowling had been loose and inaccurate.

In bright sunshine, Bradman called on the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> of <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a>, who had delivered only three overs to this point, the rest of the proceedings having been through fast bowlers. Seeking to stem the flow of runs, Bradman set a defensive ring field, with no slip in place. While Johnson bowled two consecutive <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">maiden</a>s, Washbrook took 24 at the other end to reach 85. O'Reilly said Bradman's defensive field settings "made the sorry admission of impotency". Bradman then called for the new ball with the score on 164, which Hutton on-drove for four from Lindwall. This took the opening partnership to 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook shot</a>, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership ended on the very next ball when Hutton went onto the front foot and was clean bowled by Lindwall, much to the dismay of the home crowd. Nevertheless, England had made a strong start, continuing their spirited showing in the previous Test. Washbrook was joined by Edrich, who had scored two 50s in the Third Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> after a lean start to the series. O'Reilly said the hosts' incoming batsmen had an ideal opportunity to amass a large score as "the Australian attack was completely at the mercy of the two Englishmen. It had lost all its sting and looked quite innocuous."

Washbrook reached his century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures half an hour after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and profited from many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It was a welcome return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five innings of the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second innings of the Third Test before proceeding to an unbeaten 85. After reaching his century, Washbrook began to play more expansively, driving in a manner that prompted Arlott to compare him to <a href="Frank%20Woolley">Frank Woolley</a>.

Washbrook and Edrich batted until late in the first day, when the former was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over before stumps, hitting a catch to Lindwall in the slips. His innings included 22 <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">fours</a> and the dismissal ended a second wicket <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> worth exactly 100 runs. Washbrook had been solid in his back foot defence and scored many runs from overpitched deliveries. Bedser was sent in as the <a href="nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a>, and he survived the last four balls from Johnston as England closed at 268/2 without further addition to the score, with Edrich, who played fluently as he had done in the previous Test, on 41. England's supporters were much buoyed with the situation at the end of the first day.

Former Test batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, who covered the tour as a journalist, said Australia's day went "progressively downhill" and described the efforts as the country's worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses. England had batted conservatively, steadily accumulating runs on a pitch unfavourable for fast bowlers, and Miller bowled placidly. Fingleton's fellow journalist and former playing colleague O'Reilly criticised the bowling display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said none of the bowlers could be excused. He lambasted the attack for operating "without object—hopelessly and meaninglessly" throughout the day. He decried the "so-called attack" for being "so blatantly inaccurate both in direction in length" and likened it to what was on offer in "another monotonously uninteresting county match". O'Reilly criticised Bradman's players for what he regarded as an overly casual and relaxed disposition in the morning, which gradually became more lethargic throughout the day as the home team strengthened their position. O'Reilly speculated that the tourists had become complacent because of their comfortable 2–0 series lead.

The next day, England resumed hoping for more of what happened on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a <a href="swing%20bowling">swinging</a> ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, it was not until the 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">glanced</a> a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.

After the new ball bowlers had finished their new ball spells, Bradman reverted to the slower bowlers, using run-saving, defensive field settings. Immediately thereafter, Bedser targeted Toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over. Bradman immediately removed the left-armer and replaced him with Johnson. The Australian captain set his infield rather deep, effectively allowing the batsmen to take easy singles. Bedser responded cautiously, surveying Johnson's <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> for one over, before going on the attack in the next. He lofted Johnson into the leg side three times, yielding a <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> over long on and two fours, taking his score to 47. Bedser then hit a ball back to the bowler Loxton, which was almost caught, before reaching 50. Bradman also brought back a tired Miller to bowl medium pace <a href="off%20break">off break</a>s, to no avail. England went to the lunch adjournment at 360/2, with Edrich on 76 and Bedser on 52. They had added 92 for the session, including 70 in the second hour. Lindwall had been the only bowler who caused much difficulty to the batsmen, particularly concerning Edrich, but the Englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and Miller, nursing fitness concerns, was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks.

Edrich and Bedser continued to amass runs after the break, and Lindwall appealed for <a href="Leg%20before%20wicket">lbw</a> for the fourth time while Saggers remained silent. The pair brought up their century partnership as England scored 22 runs in the 30 minutes after lunch. Johnson came on, and Edrich lofted him for six to reach 96. Edrich then hit a <a href="long%20hop">long hop</a> from the part-time <a href="wrist%20spin">wrist spin</a> of <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> for four to reach his <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>. Bedser joined the attack and lifted Morris high over <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">square leg</a> for six, and Bradman replaced him with Toshack, who bowled a <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">maiden</a>. O'Reilly said that during the partnership, only Lindwall appeared capable of threatening the batsmen. He said Lindwall "kept slogging away, tirelessly retaining his pace and enthusiasm long after the other members of the attack had lost all signs of hostility…Bradman could not afford to spare him from doing much more than his share of the galley-slave work." O'Reilly decried Lindwall's workload as excessive and potentially harmful to his longevity. However, against the run of play, Bedser was out <a href="caught%20and%20bowled">caught and bowled</a> by Johnson after almost three hours of batting, ending a 155-run stand for the third wicket. His on-drive was intercepted by the bowler, who dived across the pitch to his right-hand side to complete the catch. Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes in a Test best of 79. He appeared upset by his dismissal, patting the ball back to the bowler when he could have hit it decisively. Edrich attempted to pull a Johnson long hop to the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>, targeting the large gap between square leg and mid-on, but only ballooned the ball to Morris, who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on. This came after only three runs after Bedser's dismissal and left the score at 426/4. Edrich had batted for 314 minutes in compiling 111, with 13 fours and a six.

With two new batsmen—Compton and <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a>—at the crease, Australia quickly made further inroads. Toshack bowled Crapp for five with an inside-edged half volley to leave England at 447/5. With this, Bradman took the new ball, and Compton exploited its hardness to score quickly. However, after the shine wore off and the ball went soft, Compton could not score for 25 minutes. O'Reilly decried Compton's "helpless" effort in failing to dispatch the tired Australian bowling as "the worst Test innings I have seen him play".

After Compton and captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> had added 26 for the sixth wicket, the former edged Lindwall down the leg side, and Saggers completed his first Test catch to leave England at 473/6. O'Reilly speculated that Compton's inability to make progress against the bowling deflated his colleagues. Playing in his second Test of the summer, Loxton bowled <a href="Ken%20Cranston">Ken Cranston</a> for 10 to claim his first Ashes wicket, leaving England at 486/7. Cranston opted to not play at a ball that went straight into his leg stump. Loxton then removed <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> and <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> in quick succession as England fell to 496/9. Evans fell meekly, prodding a ball straight to Hassett at silly mid-on, prompting O'Reilly to deem Loxton "lucky to be on deck when the English tail were falling over themselves in their nervous speed to commit <a href="hara-kiri">hara-kiri</a>". In contrast, Laker edged Loxton down the leg side and it took a diving, low catch from Saggers to complete the dismissal. Umpire Baldwin asked his colleague Chester at square leg to confirm the ball had carried on the full before sending Laker back to the pavilion. Miller then bowled Yardley to end England's innings at 496. The home side had batted for 192.1 overs and lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs. Loxton took 3/55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two apiece. However, the late wickets came at a cost for Australia, who lost the services of Toshack to a knee injury.

The collapse was heavily condemned. Fingleton said England "encountered something [ascendancy over Australia] which they had not known in post-war cricket with Australia and did not know how to handle it". O'Reilly called the capitulation a "disgustingly bad show". He asked what "was there to make bowlers...pulverize the carefully chosen cream of English batting on a perfect wicket?" before concluding that the collapse was caused by "an unfortunate absence of concentration" rather than the opposition bowling. Both thought England had wasted an opportunity to put themselves in an unassailable position.

With Barnes injured, Hassett moved up from the middle order to open the innings with Morris. Using the new ball, Bedser removed Morris, who chipped the ball in the air to Cranston at mid-wicket and fell for six to leave Australia at 13/1. This brought Bradman to the crease and he was mobbed by the spectators on a ground where he had scored two triple centuries in Tests in 1930 and 1934. Many spectators surged onto the playing arena to greet Bradman, and he doffed his <a href="baggy%20green">baggy green</a> and raised his bat to acknowledge them. Fingleton wrote "on this field he [Bradman] has won his greatest honours; nowhere else has he been so idolatrously acclaimed".

Bradman got off the mark from his first ball, which Compton prevented from going for four with a diving stop near the boundary. Hassett was restrained while Bradman attacked, taking three fours from one Edrich over. Bradman was 31 and Hassett 13 as the tourists reached stumps at 63/1. The Australian captain did the majority of the scoring in the late afternoon, adding 31 in a partnership of 50. The tourists batted with little discomfort on a pitch that was still offering even bounce at a gentle pace.

On the third morning, play resumed under hot and humid conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed proceedings by taking a single from a Bedser <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable to get out of the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.

Sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, the crowd erupted. Australia were struggling at 68/3 as Harvey, playing his first Ashes Test and the youngest member of the squad at the age of 19, walked out bareheaded to join Miller at the crease. The tourists were more than 400 behind, and another wicket would expose the lower order and give England the opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Harvey told his senior partner "What's going on out here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em". He got off the mark by forcing the ball <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">behind point</a>.

The pair launched a counterattack, Miller taking the lead. He hoisted <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner Laker's first ball over the square leg fence for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as his younger partner was struggling against the <a href="off%20break">off break</a>s that were turning away from him, including one that spun and bounced sharply to beating the outside edge. Miller drilled one off-drive off Laker for four, and after mis-hitting the next, much to the amusement of the crowd, hit the off spinner flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback in the next over, hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He struck another boundary to reach 44, while Miller's score stayed on 42. After half an hour of play, the early morning life in the pitch appeared to have died out.

Miller then lifted Laker for another six over long off, hitting a spectator in the head. The English captain, noted for his ability to break partnerships with his occasional bowling, brought himself on. Miller responded by striking a four over long on from Yardley's bowling to reach 54. He drove the next ball <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">through cover</a> for four. The English skipper responded by stacking the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> with outfielders and <a href="leg%20theory">bowled outside leg stump</a>, challenging Miller to attempt another hit for six. Yardley bowled a half-volley outside leg stump and the batsman obliged, but edged the ball off the back of his bat onto wicket-keeper Evans' head and was caught by a forward-diving Edrich at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short fine leg</a>.

The partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, and was likened by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" to a "hurricane". Fingleton said he had never "known a more enjoyable hour" of "delectable cricket". He acclaimed Miller's innings as "one of the rarest gems in the Test collection of all time" and "a moment to live in the cricket memory". O'Reilly said Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with "such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation". The crowd was in raptures at both the batting and Edrich's catch. Arlott said "two of the greatest innings of all Test cricket were being played", and praised Miller for elevating "cricket to a point of aesthetic beauty".

Loxton came in to join Harvey at 189/4, who continued attacking, unperturbed by Miller's departure. Cranston came on and Harvey square drove and then hooked to deep square leg for two consecutive boundaries. Yardley moved a man from fine leg to the location where the previous hook had gone; Harvey responded by glancing a ball to where the fine leg fielder had been, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 204/4, with Harvey on 70.

After lunch, Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled to find his fluency against the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen with extra pace, but instead, Loxton began to settle in. The Australian lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and hit three fours off a subsequent Pollard over. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. He had taken 177 minutes and hit 14 fours. Loxton then dominated the scoring in a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. The century stand yielded 105 runs in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Reverse%20sweep">cross-batted sweep</a>. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Nevertheless, it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket, and Harvey's fast scoring helped to wrest the match back from England's firm control. O'Reilly said the innings was one of "no inhibitions ... completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot". He added that it was "the very mirror of truth in the batting art", "delightfully untrammeled by the scourage of good advice or any other handicapping influence", and deemed Harvey's innings to be most pleasing he had seen since <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>'s 232 at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> in 1938.

Harvey's departure at 294/5 brought the first of the bowlers, Johnson, to the crease. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting the off spinner for four more sixes, two over the leg side followed by consecutive off drives into the gallery. On each occasion, umpire Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester's actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Laker refused to be deterred by the aggressive batting and continued to bowl normally by pursuing defensive <a href="off%20theory">off</a> or <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>. Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 329/6, hitting Laker to Cranston.

Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers came in and only managed five in his first Test innings before being <a href="stumped">stumped</a> after being lured out of his <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a> by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.

Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling, dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively. He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half-volley so he could hit lofted drives. Of the 103 added for the last two wickets, Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before Toshack lasted the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston as his <a href="runner%20%28cricket%29">runner</a>. Australia were 457/9 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12. During Lindwall's partnership with Johnston, Yardley bowled himself for over an hour, failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls. Lindwall's partners were able to survive against the English pacemen, leading O'Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner <a href="Doug%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">Doug Wright</a>, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians. O'Reilly thought Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play, so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors' attack could have made inroads. However, Yardley was neither able to contain nor dismiss the Australian tail.

Sunday was a rest day, and the match resumed on Monday morning. In the third over of the day, Lindwall was the last man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its overnight score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.

For the remainder of the fourth day, England set about extending their lead. Early in the innings, the capacity crowd encroached substantially onto the ground and the umpires spent eight minutes trying to force them back to the edge of the official playing area, but they again spilled over. Initially, Hutton and Washbrook played cautiously to see off the new ball before trying to lift the run rate. Lindwall's first two overs were maidens, but Hutton and Washbrook scored 21 runs from his next five overs, while taking only five from Miller's six overs. The English batsmen attacked the bowling and reinforced their aggressive strokeplay with quick running. England reached lunch at 72/0 with Hutton on 40 and Washbrook on 28. Washbrook was particularly confident and Bradman decided to not risk Johnson in the morning session.

The afternoon session continued with further spectator encroachments. After lunch, Bradman set defensive fields with the intent of restricting the scoring, and used his remaining bowlers in short spells to conserve their energy, expecting a long day in the field. The absence of Toshack also meant Loxton had a substantial workload with the ball. The English batsmen continued to accelerate, and when Bradman finally brought Johnson into the attack, they targeted him. Washbrook hit a straight six from Johnson, and Hutton followed suit to take England from 98 to 104. For the second time in the match, the English openers had put on a century stand, and the shot also brought up Hutton's 50 in 125 minutes. This feat made Hutton and Washbrook the first pair to make century opening partnerships in both innings of a Test on two occasions; they had done this for the first time against Australia in the Fourth Test at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> in 1946–47. Bradman replaced Johnson with Lindwall immediately, and Washbrook responded by cutting the paceman for four to reach his half-century. Lindwall responded with two <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a>. Washbrook then hooked one a short ball from Johnston and got a top edge, but Bradman failed to take the catch.

Washbrook then attempted another hook from Johnston towards deep square leg. Connecting with the middle of the bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground. Harvey quickly moved in across the outfield from the square leg fence and bent over to catch the ball at his ankles while still on the run. Fingleton called it "the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> [in an earlier match against Surrey]". O'Reilly doubted "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He further said the "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic".

Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 without further addition to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 129/2. The Yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it high in the air after being beaten in flight, and the Australian captain ran backwards from mid-on to complete the catch. This meant the two new batsmen at the crease, Edrich and Compton, were still yet to score, and the second new ball was only six overs away, so they had to preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for Australia's fast bowlers. During a slow period in which only 15 runs came in half an hour, Edrich and Compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place. After 45 minutes, Compton premeditated a charge down the pitch and hit Johnson to the leg side for a boundary. The pair accelerated, Compton taking risks in cutting Johnson against the spin. Australia took the new ball and each batsman hit a boundary to bring up the fifty partnership, which took an hour. Worried by the substantial and hazardous craters he and the other bowlers had created in the pitch while following through on the left-hand side of the crease, Lindwall changed to bowling from <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">around the wicket</a> and was warned by umpire Baldwin for running on the pitch, before reverting to over the wicket, although he delivered from the edge of the crease to avoid the holes. O'Reilly said Baldwin's warning to Lindwall had played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump, which the English bowlers could target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. Compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from Lindwall and Johnston and England went to tea at 209/2. Compton was on 42 and Edrich 33.

After the interval, Bradman continued with his strategy of rotating his bowlers in short spells, and set a defensive, well-spread field for Johnson's bowling. Edrich hit three consecutive boundaries from Johnson before lofting a fourth ball into the crowd for six. He then passed his half-century—his fourth consecutive Test score in excess of 50—before Lindwall trapped him lbw for 51 to leave England at 232/3, ending a third-wicket partnership of 103. Crapp came in and added 18 before he was bowled by Lindwall, inside edging an attempted forcing stroke through the off side from the back foot. This left England at 260/4, and precipitated a mini-collapse. Yardley deliberately lifted Lindwall over the vacant <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slips region</a> and reached seven before he fell to Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot. Johnston then had Cranston caught behind for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> with only a further run added to leave England at 278/6, a lead of 316. Evans came in and edged his first ball through the slips at a catchable height for four. Compton drove Lindwall for a boundary but then fell to Johnston for 66, caught by Miller at cover. England were 293/7 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. Wicket-keeper Evans was joined by Bedser, and the pair added 37 before Miller removed the latter. Laker came in and helped Evans to add a further 32 as England reached 362/8 at the close of the fourth day. Evans—mainly through boundaries—had helped England to add 69 runs in the last 45 minutes of play.

England batted on for five minutes during the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> at 365/8, with Evans unbeaten on 47. Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures, with 4/95. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a <a href="road%20roller">heavy roller</a> at the start of the morning, which would help break up the wicket and make it more likely to spin. Bradman had done a similar thing during the previous Ashes series in Australia before setting England a target. The hosts needed to beat Australia to avoid a series defeat. Bradman elected to not have the pitch rolled at all, demonstrating his opinion that such a device would make the surface less favourable for batting.

The declaration left Australia with a victory target of 404 runs. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting their dismissal by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spinners. In addition, most of the Australian onlookers present at the ground thought their team had no chance of victory. Morris and Hassett started slowly, making only six runs in the first six <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes Australia had only scored 10 runs.

After Bedser had bowled three overs, Yardley introduced Laker in his place in the seventh over to exploit the spin. An attacking field, with two slips and a gully, was put in a place, but Laker bowled inaccurately and the Australian openers took 13 runs from his first over. Hassett hit a four and took a single to give Morris the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">strike</a>. Morris hit a four, was beaten by a <a href="bouncing%20ball">bouncing ball</a> that hurried off the pitch and then hit another boundary. Despite this over, only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that 360 runs were needed in 285 minutes. After his poor first over, Laker had settled down and conceded only two runs from his next six overs. The frustrated crowd heckled the Australian openers for their slow scoring and Morris was ironically applauded after taking a single. Evans then missed a leg-side stumping opportunity against Hassett, and Bedser beat each of the Australians with extra bounce. During his early spell, Laker "was getting at least one ball every over to turn considerably".

Noting Laker's ability to extract substantial turn from the pitch, Yardley brought on the part-time <a href="left-arm%20unorthodox%20spin">left-arm unorthodox spin</a> of Compton, who bowled inaccurately although with some turn. Morris struck two fours in Compton's first over to register Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. Compton's next over was more potent; he deceived Morris, who danced down the pitch and missed the ball, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. At the time, Morris was on 32 and Australia at 55/0. Laker beat Morris in the next over with an <a href="off%20break">off break</a> that spun a foot, and in the succeeding over, Hassett was dismissed by Compton with the score at 57. Compton had caught Hassett's leading edge and dived forward in his follow through to catch the ball one-handed just above the ground.

Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. After receiving another rapturous welcome from the Headingley spectators in his last innings at the ground, the Australian captain signalled his intentions by hitting a boundary from Compton and another off the first ball he faced from Laker, <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">cover driving</a> against the spin. Bradman reached 12 in six minutes.

Yardley then called upon the occasional <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> of Hutton in an attempt to exploit the turning wicket. The latter had taken only four wickets in the 1947 English season and had never dismissed an Australian batsman in ten Tests against such opponents. As Australia were still behind the required run rate, Yardley could afford to take risks and sacrifice some runs if he got wickets in return. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours from Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as "rather terrible" due to the <a href="line%20and%20length">errant length</a>. This over took Morris to 51. After an economical over from Compton, Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23H">holing out</a> to Yardley. Despite the near miss, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 96/1 from 90 minutes.

In the next over, Compton bowled a <a href="googly">googly</a> to deceive Bradman, who expected the ball to turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">leg glanced</a> the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball of the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on to the catch. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.

Upon resumption, Compton continued as Yardley attempted to exploit the turning wicket. However, Compton was not a regular bowler and he sent down a series of ill-directed <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a>es and <a href="long%20hop">long hop</a>s that were easily dispatched for runs. Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called "indescribably bad bowling". This included six fours in eight balls. As Morris continued to attack, Compton began to crack under the pressure and his inaccuracy increased. The part-time bowler had generated trouble for the batsmen by tossing the ball up and beating the bat or inducing edges, but Morris counterattacked with drives. Compton tried to hold back his length to avoid being driven but the Australian opener pounced on the shorter balls. Morris reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in a little over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs since lunch, mainly from Compton's wayward offerings, while Bradman had only added three.

The onslaught prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced it in the air to <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">point</a>. Yardley dived forward and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a <a href="fibrositis">fibrositis</a> attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">strike</a> until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.

Morris was given another life on 136 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg from Compton's bowling. Bradman was given another life at 108 when he advanced two metres down the pitch to Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman far out of his ground. Australia reached tea at 292/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in a 290-minute innings. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. Miller struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling lbw to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes of batting with 29 fours.

The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds. The crowd remains a record for a Test in England.

After the Fourth Test, the Australians had five tour matches before the final Test. They defeated <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> by an innings, before having a <a href="Rainout%20%28sports%29">washout</a> against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>. The Australians then defeated <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> by nine wickets, before drawing with <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, who hung on with three wickets in hand on the final day. This was followed by a two-day non-first-class match against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, which was drawn after rain washed out the second day. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Toshack also recovered to play against Lancashire, but injured himself again and was ruled out of the remainder of the tour.

Following Australia's unlikely win at Headingley, the England selectors were widely condemned for their failure to choose a specialist <a href="wrist%20spin">wrist spin</a>ner to exploit the turning pitch. This was cited as a reason for the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a>. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.

Despite Hollies being able to trouble most of their batsmen, Australia completed the Test series with a convincing innings victory in the Fifth Test to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and Australia only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. They secured three consecutive innings victories against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>, the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England">Gentlemen of England</a> and <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>. They proceeded to take first innings leads of more than 200 against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a> and <a href="HDG%20Leveson-Gower">Leveson-Gower's XI</a>, but both matches were washed out. The last two matches were two-day non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>, both won by an innings. Bradman's men thus completed the tour undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

Third Test, 1948 Ashes series

The Third Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five <a href="test%20cricket">Tests</a> in a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> <a href="1948%20Ashes%20series">series</a> between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">teams representing Australia</a> and <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>. The match was played at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> from 8–13 July, with a rest day on 11 July. The match was drawn after the whole of the fourth day and the first half of the fifth day was washed out due to rain; England had the upper hand before the weather intervened. The draw maintained Australia's 2–0 lead in the series, which was established through victories in the first two Tests. As Australia were the holders of <a href="The%20Ashes">The Ashes</a>, the draw meant that England could do no better than level the series 2–2 by winning the last two Tests, and thus Australia retained The Ashes.

The Test started amid controversy following the omission of leading England batsman <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> for performing poorly in the <a href="Second%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">previous match</a>. Having largely failed—apart from brief periods—to challenge Australia in the first two Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> after two poor matches. England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a>. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to recover to 363 all out on the second afternoon. England could have been in an even stronger position, but Compton and <a href="fast%20bowling">seamer</a> <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being <a href="run%20out">run out</a> and ending a 121-run <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a>. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">on strike</a>, was hit in the ribs by a <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">pull shot</a> and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 by the end of the second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a> by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.

England began their second innings and were strongly placed on 174/3 at the end of the third day, an overall lead of 316 with seven wickets in hand. They had been aided by several dropped chances against <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a>, who reached 85 by the close of play. However, rain meant that no play was possible on the fourth day and England did not have the opportunity to capitalise on their favourable position and set Australia a high runchase. Yardley declared on the final morning, but play did not start until mid-afternoon due to continuing inclement weather. The Australian batsman thereafter played for a draw; they batted slowly and reached 92/1 when stumps were drawn, not making an attempt to chase the 317 for victory. <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> made 54 not out, his second <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">half-century</a> of the match to go with his 51 in the first innings, registering Australia's top-score on both occasions. Despite the fact that 30% of the playing time was lost to rain, the match still managed to set a record for the highest attendance at a Test match in England, surpassing the mark set in the previous Test.

Led by <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, Australia had proceeded through the first two months of <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">their 1948 England tour</a> undefeated. After winning 10 of the 12 games before the Tests, eight of these by an innings, they won the <a href="First%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">First Test</a> by eight wickets. Before the Second Test, they defeated <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> by an innings before drawing with <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>. Bradman's men then crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. Between Tests, they defeated <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> by ten wickets and crushed <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> by an innings and 363 runs, having amassed 774/7 <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a>, their highest score of the season, and the second highest ever by an Australian team in England.

When the teams reconvened at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> for the Third Test, leading English batsman <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> had been dropped. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the previous Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side—which was not in good batting form—as it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave the impression he had been scared of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">retired ill</a> in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.

Hutton's opening position was taken by debutant <a href="George%20Emmett">George Emmett</a>, who made 43 and nine for Gloucestershire in Australia's preceding tour match. In that match, two of Australia's leading pacemen, <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> and <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a>, did not bowl. Despite scoring 76 and 92 in the preceding match against <a href="Warwickshire%20CCC">Warwickshire</a>, Emmett was not having a prolific season; he ended the summer with an average of 36.11.

England made three further changes. Spinner <a href="Jack%20Young%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Young</a> and paceman <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> replaced the spin pair of <a href="Doug%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">Doug Wright</a> and <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> in the bowling department, meaning England would only play one slow bowler. Wright and Laker had struggled to penetrate the Australian batting lineup in the Second Test, taking match figures of 2/123 and 2/128 respectively. In contrast, Pollard had taken match figures of 4/85 for <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> in a match against Australia earlier in the season, and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in the past fortnight. The selection was seen as being influenced by the fact the Test was being staged at Lancashire's home ground, where Pollard was familiar with the conditions, and the Australians had a high regard for him. In the month since being dropped for the Second Test in favour of Wright, after taking 1/107 in the First Test, Young had returned to play for <a href="Middlesex%20CCC">Middlesex</a>, taking 27 wickets in five matches. <a href="Alec%20Coxon">Alec Coxon</a>, the Yorkshire allrounder who made his Test debut in the previous match at Lord's and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a>, a debutant batsman. Crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for Gloucestershire in the preceding match against the tourists. It was only the third <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> scored against Australia during the tour, and was part of a season in which Crapp had made four centuries and six half-centuries in 16 matches thus far. Coxon's omission was believed to have been caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>—whom he disliked and considered self-important—in the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. O'Reilly interpreted the omission of the Yorkshiremen Hutton and Coxon at the expense of the Gloucestershire pair of Crapp and Emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in the English selection panel. He pointed out that only one of the four selectors—England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a>, who was also from Yorkshire—was from the north of the country.

Australia dropped <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, who had scored 73 runs at a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to play him out of position in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against <a href="Worcestershire%20CCC">Worcestershire</a> and the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had appeared out of place in the middle-order because he was used to the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a>, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a>—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick footwork, which he used to charge and attack the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> of <a href="Tom%20Goddard">Tom Goddard</a>.

The match started amid clear weather, a far cry from the previous Ashes Test at the ground in 1938, which was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to continuous rain for several days. The outfield was also smooth and green, a contrast to its state during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when it was left cratered by <a href="Nazi%20German">German</a> bombing raids. Yardley won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat.

The change in England's opening pair did not result in an improvement on the scoreboard. A <a href="run%20out">run out</a> was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three <a href="long%20hop">long hop</a>s outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let the balls pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first half hour of play.

With 22 runs on the board after half an hour of play, Washbrook played around a <a href="yorker">yorker</a> from Johnston and was bowled, much to the disappointment of his Lancashire home crowd. Johnston had been bowling from over the wicket, and his left-arm deliveries had generally been swinging back into the right-handed Washbrook. However, the opening batsman did not detect Johnston's variation ball, which was released from wide of the crease and angled across more sharply without curling back in. Washbrook played inside the line of the ball, which hit his stumps. Australia nearly had two wickets in the same over as the new batsman <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a> struggled. He played loosely outside the off stump to the first ball but did not get an edge, and on the third delivery he faced from Johnston, Edrich survived again. Receiving a ball on middle and leg stump, he tried to defend it straight back down the pitch, rather than the conventional stroke to the leg side, and managed to edge the ball past the slips for four.

Six runs after the fall of Washbrook, the diminutive Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short leg</a>, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a>, Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".
Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a> attempted to establish themselves. He was hurried by the pace of Lindwall and Johnston, making many last-moment movements to either hit the ball or withdraw from a shot.

Lindwall bowled a series of <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short balls</a>. One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer, but edged it into his face. Upon hearing the umpire's call of no-ball while the ball was travelling towards him, and knowing he was immune from dismissal, Compton decided to change his stroke. Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side, he then attempted to hook the ball, but could not readjust quickly enough. The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing. This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33/2. After a ten-minute delay, Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings, and he got off the mark from his first ball, gliding Lindwall past gully for a single. Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball, provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a>, a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>, a strategy of intimidatory bowling. Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play, resulting in one 25-minute period during which only one run was added, as England reached lunch with their total on 57/2. Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting, while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes. One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion, so he could resume batting. Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores, and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent, whereas Crapp was usually circumspect. For a series of accurate overs from <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>, Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> at silly point. Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.

Upon the resumption, Crapp began to accelerate, hitting a six—which flew directly back over the bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">driven boundaries</a> from the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> of <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a>. This was a stark contrast to Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—<a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. <a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a> came in and took a single to get off the mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> came in and played the <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a> of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow himself more time to play his shots. Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> in the slips cordon on the half-volley.

After 170 minutes of slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught behind by wicket-keeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a>. At 119/5, Compton returned to the field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">on-drove</a> Lindwall for a four, but lofted <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>, who had been bowling <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.

This brought wicket-keeper <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> to the crease and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The last of the specialist batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, the benefit of the doubt was given to the batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a>, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.

England resumed on the second day at 231/7 amid dark skies and the threat of rain; Australia was unable to break through despite taking the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians, playing with a straight bat and stretching forward onto the front foot to block the ball. Tallon dropped Compton for the third time, off the bowling of Johnston when the batsman was on 73. Lindwall bowled well below his top pace in the morning session and the batsmen slowly accumulated their runs. Bedser was the more defensive of the two Englishmen, and Compton drove Toshack past <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">mid on</a> for a four to register his second century of the series, after 235 minutes of batting. Lindwall then beat Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch, but the Englishman survived. England reached lunch at 323/7 having added 92 runs without losing a wicket. Compton was on 123 and Bedser on 37, having brought up their century partnership. Five minutes were lost in the morning session when a stray dog invaded the playing arena and evaded policemen and a number of Australian fielders who attempted to catch it.

Immediately subsequent to the resumption, Compton took two boundaries from Lindwall's first over and another from Johnston's subsequent over. He then hit a ball into the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">covers</a> and Bradman and Loxton collided in an attempt to prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end with Bedser a long way short of the <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>. It ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 and featured in a 121-run partnership with Compton. According to O'Reilly, it was the only mistake Compton made in his innings. The stand fell five runs short of England's highest Test partnership for the eighth wicket against Australia, a mark set by <a href="Patsy%20Hendren">Patsy Hendren</a> and <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a>.

Pollard came to the crease and soon pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes stood closer than virtually all in that position, with one foot on the edge of the <a href="cricket%20pitch">cut strip</a> and he was unable to evade the ball. Barnes "dropped like a fallen tree", and had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Throughout the season, Barnes had received a mixed reception for his tactics; it was agreed they had a negative effect on the batsman, and there was a debate as to whether it was in the spirit of the rules. Compton hit two <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">fours</a> and Bradman responded by putting all of his men on the boundary to offer Compton a single so Pollard would be on <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">strike</a> and could be attacked. The Australia skipper then brought his men in close during the latter part of the over to prevent Compton from taking a single and regaining the strike for the following over. Compton was unable to farm the strike as he desired.

Toshack then bowled Pollard and Bradman caught Young from Johnston's bowling as England were dismissed for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 after 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl, so the four remaining frontline bowlers sent down no less than 38 overs each.

Australia came out to bat halfway through the middle session. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> as a specialist opener. Johnson was thus deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He had never opened at Test level, but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman after the fall of the first wicket late on a day's play. He was unable to make an impact—Bedser removed him for one, caught by Evans at chest height off the inside edge from a ball that reared from the pitch. It was a difficult catch as Evans was standing up to the stumps and he had little time to react to the ball's change of direction. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach. Johnson's dismissal brought Bradman in to face the new ball. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman lbw with an <a href="off%20cutter">off cutter</a> that struck the Australian captain on the back foot for seven to leave Australia in trouble at 13/2. This provoked a strong cheer from the crowd in support of Pollard, the Lancashire local. Australia were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming for leg stump to stifle the scoring. He was partnered by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes.

Morris and vice-captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes. They played sedately without trying to take risks. Hassett fell after being <a href="loop%20%28cricket%29">beaten in flight</a> by Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive <a href="leg%20theory">leg side bowling</a>, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted drive over cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Washbrook at wide mid-off. Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126/3 <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">at stumps</a>, with their personal tallies on 23 and 48 respectively. The run rate picked up in the last 50 minutes of the day as the pair added 44 runs; Miller was the more attacking of the Australian duo during this time.

On the third morning, the players were greeted by sunshine, and a large Saturday crowd had arrived from afar to watch proceedings; as a result, the gates were closed by 9:00 in the morning with the ground already filled. The large gallery again encroached on the playing arena, which was not fenced. In the first hour, Australia struggled against the new ball. Miller was beaten three times in one over by Bedser before Pollard trapped him for 31, after Australia had added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Bedser removed Morris for 51, leaving Australia 139/5. It had been a slow morning for Morris, who took 21 minutes to add to his overnight total and reached his half-century 45 minutes into the day's play, having added only four runs to his overnight score. At the same time, Barnes had come out to bat upon Miller's dismissal, despite having collapsed while practising in the nets due to the aftereffects of his rib injury. He batted after refusing to stay in hospital and returning to the ground in spite of his bruised and discoloured ribs. He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before the injury became too much and he had to be taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, before being sent to hospital to be put under observation. Barnes would eventually miss two and a half weeks of cricket. Tallon and Loxton added a further 33 before the former was caught behind from Edrich with the score at 172/6. Lindwall came into bat with Australia facing the prospect of the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>. He received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand and caused visible pain, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled by Pollard, leaving Australia 208/7, still five runs behind the follow-on mark. Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow-on before Bedser removed both. Johnston was reprieved in his brief innings when he edged a delivery from Pollard in the direction of Edrich at first slip, but Evans dived across, trying to catch the ball in his right hand. The wicket-keeper could not hold on to the ball at full stretch, and the resulting deflection further to the right wrong-footed Edrich, who was moving the other way, and it went past him. From second slip, Crapp dived left behind Edrich but the ball landed a few centimetres beyond his fingers. However, in the next over Bedser, Johnston edged the ball in the same manner and Crapp caught the ball easily. Lindwall was the last man out for 23, while Toshack was unbeaten without scoring. Australia were thus bowled out for 221, giving England a lead of 142 runs. Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers, taking 4/81 and 3/53 respectively.

At the start of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who then removed Emmett for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>. The paceman pitched an <a href="outswinger">outswinger</a> on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who took it in his right hand while taking a dive.

Emmett's departure brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing such actions would be interpreted as retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction. After not bowling in the first innings, Miller came on and immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a>. Washbrook then drove Lindwall for four before Miller bounced him in the next over. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. Lindwall followed Miller's lead towards Washbrook and was <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed by umpire Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. Following a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the matter faded away and the bowler was not no-balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.

Lindwall then bounced Washbrook again and this time the England opener went for the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook shot</a>. The ball flew high in the air straight towards Hassett at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">fine leg</a>, who dropped the catch on his third juggled attempt. Having received a life on 21, Washbrook settled down as Loxton replaced Lindwall, while Johnson replaced Miller. Washbrook scored on both sides of the wicket and reached 50 in only 70 minutes as England proceeded to 80/1. 

Lindwall returned for a new spell and almost hit Washbrook in the head. After tea, Edrich hit Miller for four. Although Lindwall did not retaliate for the bouncers he received in the first innings, Miller did so with four consecutive short balls, earning the ire of the crowd. Miller struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened, ordered him to stop, and apologised to Edrich. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes, England's largest of the series to that point. Edrich hit a four to <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">long on</a>, followed by a lofted <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">off drive</a> for <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> from the bowling of Toshack, generating momentum in their favour. However, Washbrook called Edrich through for a quick single soon after. The batsmen hesitated and after both Englishmen had paused in the middle of their run, Morris <a href="run%20out">threw down Edrich's stumps</a> from <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">cover</a>, ending the partnership at 125/2. Edrich had struck eight boundaries and a six in his 53. 

Toshack then removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, leaving England three wickets down with the score still on 125. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, stopping Australia's fightback as England reached 174 by the close without further loss. Washbrook was unbeaten on 85 and Crapp 19. England were 316 runs in front with two days of play remaining and seven wickets in hand. Their position was aided by the Australian fielders, who dropped Washbrook twice more. The Lancastrian was on 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman to signify his need for protection from the ball, much to the amusement of the crowd. After adding two more runs, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. At the end of the day's play, Washbrook purchased a drink for Hassett in gratitude for the dropped catches.

The rest day was followed by the fourth day, which was abandoned due to persistent rain. Despite this, 21,000 spectators came in anticipation of the weather clearing so that some play would be possible. However, a northeasterly depression from the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> brought ongoing precipitation and prevented any play.

Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day after a pitch inspection, leaving Australia a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire first session was abandoned. The umpires had decided to start play half an hour later than normal, but this was not possible and they helped the ground staff to clean up the wet surface. Bradman chose to use the <a href="road%20roller">light roller</a> and play was supposed to begin as soon as the lunch break ended.
Further delay meant play began after the tea break, and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture, which also caused there to be little bounce in the surface. With Australia not looking to chase the runs because the time available was not reasonable, Yardley often had seven men in close catching positions. In the first half hour, Australia showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Young replaced Pollard and Johnson immediately <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">swept him</a> for four, before edging the next ball to Crapp, who completed the catch. Johnson fell for six to leave Australia at 10/1.

Bradman came in and played his first 11 balls from Young without scoring, while Morris hit two streaky shots for four from Bedser. Yardley used the spin of Young and Compton for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to rotate the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">strike</a> with singles. Bradman only played eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled by his partner's desire for a single that he sent him back. The tourists thereafter batted in an unhurried and defensive manner to ensure a draw, which was sealed by a series of periodic rain interruptions. They ended on 92/1 from 61 overs, a <a href="run%20rate">run rate</a> of 1.50, with 35 <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">maidens</a>. It was the slowest innings run rate to date in the series. Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century of the series. O'Reilly criticised the approach taken by the Australians in the closing stages of the match, attributing it to Bradman's orders. He said the pitch was made so tame by the heavy rain that they could have played in a natural and attractive manner to entertain the spectators, rather than defending carefully. He said Bradman's "unwillingness to take a risk or to accept the challenging call of some particular phase of the game is one of the greatest flaws" in his leadership.

The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous record for a Test in England, which was set in the preceding match at Lord's even though more than 30% of the playing time had been lost.

After being aided by rain while in a disadvantageous position during the Third Test, the Australians had only one tour match—a victory over <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>—to prepare for the next Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a>. Barnes was unable to recover from his injury in this short space of time, and was replaced by <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a>. Instead of opting to use reserve opener Brown to replace Barnes, Australia played Hassett out of position to partner Morris, while Harvey took a middle-order slot.

For England's part, Washbrook's second innings half-century at Old Trafford, aided by multiple dropped catches, was regarded as a major factor in his retention for the Headingley match, having scored only 63 runs in the first five innings of the series. He was reunited with Hutton, whose controversial exile lasted only one Test before Emmett was dropped. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings in the Second and Third Tests, was replaced by all-rounder <a href="Ken%20Cranston">Ken Cranston</a>. Despite being productive in domestic matches during the season, Cranston had struggled in his previous outings against the tourists. In two matches against Australia, he had managed only 47 runs in three innings and a total of 2/109.

Washbrook and Hutton put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for opening stand, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.

Following the historic win at Headingley, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in <a href="Rainout%20%28sports%29">rain-curtailed draws</a>. During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Australia then completed the series in style with a convincing innings victory in the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and the tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. Apart from two matches against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a> and <a href="HDG%20Leveson-Gower">Leveson-Gower's XI</a>, which were washed out after Australia had secured first innings leads of more than 200, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

Second Test, 1948 Ashes series

The Second Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five <a href="test%20cricket">Tests</a> in a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> <a href="1948%20Ashes%20series">series</a> between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>. The match was played at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> in <a href="London">London</a> from 24 to 29 June, with a rest day on 27 June. Australia won the match by 409 runs to take a 2–0 lead, meaning that England would need to win the remaining three matches to regain <a href="The%20Ashes">The Ashes</a>.

Australian captain <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> won the toss and elected to bat. The tourists had won the First Test convincingly, and decided to field the same team, while England made three changes, mainly to adopt a more attacking bowling strategy. Australia started strongly, led by <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">opener</a> <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a>, who scored 105 and took the score to 166/2 mid-way through the first day. However, the later batsmen struggled after his departure and fell to 258/7 by the end of the first day, handing the home team the advantage. However, a <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower-order</a> counterattack on the second morning saw Australia reach 350, <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> scoring 53. For England, the <a href="fast%20bowling">seamer</a> <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> was the most successful bowler, taking 4/100. Australian paceman <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> then cut through the English top-order, reducing them to 46/4. After a recovery an 87-run partnership between <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>—who top-scored with 53—and captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a>, both fell within one run of each other and England looked set to be dismissed short of the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a> mark when they were at 145/7. However, the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower order</a> resisted stoutly and they ended at 215 early on the third morning; Lindwall took 5/70. Australia then set about extending their first innings lead, and opener <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> led the way, scoring 141. He put on an <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">opening partnership</a> of 122 with Morris (62), and added 174 with Bradman (89). Australia closed the third day at 343/4 after a productive day of batting, giving them a lead of 478 despite losing three quick wickets late in the afternoon.

After the rest day, Australia proceeded to reach 460/7—<a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> making 74—before Bradman <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a>, setting England a target of 596 midway through the afternoon. The hosts reached 106/3 at stumps on the fourth day, but then collapsed on the final morning to be all out for 186, handing Australia a 409-run victory. <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> and <a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a> top-scored for England with 37 apiece. <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> had the pick of the figures with 5/40 while Lindwall took 3/61. Although Toshack had the better figures, commentators credited Lindwall with orchestrating the England collapse; at the start of the innings he bowled at leading English batsmen <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> at great pace before dismissing him. Hutton had appeared very unsettled by Lindwall and played meekly. He was severely criticised for his timid manner and was controversially dropped for the following match as the selectors thought he was providing a poor example to the junior members of the team. The Australians were very pleased with this decision, which they believed to be wrong, as they regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent. The match set a new record for the highest attendance at a Test in England.

Australia had proceeded through the first two months of the tour of England without defeat. After winning 10 of the first twelve matches before the Tests started, eight of these by an innings—the other two were drawn—they won the <a href="First%20Test%2C%201948%20Ashes%20series">First Test</a> by eight wickets. Between the Tests, they defeated <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> by an innings before drawing against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>.

According to former English paceman <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a>, England had approached the First Test with the intention of achieving a draw against a team they regarded as their superior, reflected in their selections and use of defensive tactics. Bowes himself believed the tactics to be correct and almost successful. However, he suspected that <a href="Walter%20Robins">Walter Robins</a>, one of the selectors, considered the English strategy to be misguided and that they should attack the Australians. This was reflected in the English selections. The home team made three changes; the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Doug%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">Doug Wright</a>, who was forced to withdraw from the First Test at late notice due to <a href="lumbago">lumbago</a>, had regained his fitness and replaced the <a href="left%20arm%20orthodox%20spin">left arm orthodox spin</a> of Young, who had taken match figures of 1/107 in the First Test—Australian wicket-keeper <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> was his only wicket. However, he had managed to keep the batsmen quiet with his defensive <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, bowling 60 overs for 79 runs; Wright was a much more attacking and therefore expensive bowler. <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>, who had been called into the First Test team due to Wright's lumbago, was initially the third spinner in the pecking order, but he took 4/138, including three specialist batsmen, and was retained.

<a href="Alec%20Coxon">Alec Coxon</a> took match figures of 4/113 for Yorkshire against Australia, taking four middle-order wickets, and scored 21 and 16 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> in the middle-order. He came into the team as an <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>, even though his performances during the rest of the English season had been mediocre; he had a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 20.25 for the summer and took only ten wickets in seven matches prior to the county fixture against Australia. Bowes saw him as an attacking bowler compatible with Robins's strategic thinking.

<a href="Tom%20Dollery">Tom Dollery</a> was called into the team after a run of heavy scoring for <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> on difficult pitches at <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a>. He had made two centuries and seven fifties in 12 first-class matches for the season. Batsman <a href="Charlie%20Barnett%20%28cricketer%29">Charlie Barnett</a> was dropped after scoring only eight and six in the First Test. <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a> was also left out; he had scored a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> and 43 in the First Test, and had a toe infection, so the selectors were spared the predicament of deciding whether to drop him on performance grounds. With Wright in for Young, and Coxon selected in place of a specialist batsman, England had a more attacking bowling line-up, something the retired Australian Test leg spinner <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> praised. He also thought the selection of Coxon was beneficial, as his swing bowling would ease the workload of batsman <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>, who had opened the bowling in the previous Test. O'Reilly regarded Edrich as a mediocre bowler and thought the extra burden with the ball was detracting from his main duty, batting.

Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> was retained despite taking match figures of 1/85, as was <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, the opener who was <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">batting out of position</a> in the middle-order. Brown had scored 25, 26 and 17 in his three innings in the middle-order during the tour. O'Reilly criticised the selection of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite Brown's unbeaten double century in his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> and <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> had better claims to selection. Following his groin injury at Trent Bridge, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Before the toss, Bradman had spent an unusually long time inspecting the wicket, and after correctly predicting the side of the coin, he looked at the surface for another period before announcing Australia's decision to bat. The all-rounder <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> played, but was unfit to bowl.

At 8:00 on the morning of the Test, there was a storm to the south of London but the rain did not reach Lord's, which was located in the north of the English capital. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and he removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short fine leg</a> from a short delivery to leave Australia 3/1. Barnes tried to knock the ball through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton. Coxon bowled from very close to the wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside the right-hander's leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner. Although he was not of particularly fast pace, Coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride, making a significant impact on the surface. Bradman received a loud, positive reception from the crowd as he came out to bat in his final Test at Lord's.

Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving a loud appeal for <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with <a href="seam%20bowling">seam movement</a> off the pitch and one ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a> removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first 20 minutes and Australia had scored only 14 after the first 30 minutes. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.

Edrich then relieved Coxon, who had bowled his first seven overs in Test cricket for the loss of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a>, which Bradman tried to swing to the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>, but the leading edge instead went in the air and landed <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">behind point</a>. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the leg trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted leg glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.

Bedser was relieved after 70 minutes of bowling. The <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a> that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a>, before hitting another ball for <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">four</a>. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, and from the other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than take risks, and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.

In the third over after the lunch break, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time in the series by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when he was on 13. Including a county match against Yorkshire, it was the fourth time Hutton had caught Bradman in the leg trap from a glance. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said this was the first time Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession.

Hassett came to the crease to join Morris, with the new ball already due. Still using the old ball, Bedser beat Hassett second ball with a delivery that moved back in, but the appeal for lbw was turned down. However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called for a replacement ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.

After a slow start, Morris had begun to take control. He <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">drove the ball through the covers and clipped it through the leg side</a>, and reached his <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> with consecutive boundaries from Coxon soon after the new ball was taken. Former Australian Test opener <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, covering the tour as a newspaper journalist, called it "a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings". The century ended a poor run of form for Morris earlier in the tour, when he had been shuffling uncertainly on the crease without decisively moving forward or back. O'Reilly called it Morris's best Test century to date, as this was the strongest English attack he had faced during his career, and because of the loss of wickets at the other end. O'Reilly said Morris had been disciplined in not playing loose shots outside off stump and missing or edging them, yet still being able to score quickly at every opportunity.

Morris was out soon after for 105 runs with the score at 166/3, having struck 14 fours and one six. His innings, which was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives, ended when he hit Coxon to Hutton in the <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">gully</a>. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three consecutive <a href="outswinger">outswinger</a>s to him. A fourth ball swung <a href="inswinger">the other way</a>, and Miller did not offer a shot, expecting the ball to curve away and miss the stumps. Instead, he was hit in front of the wickets and given out lbw for four. O'Reilly said Miller's display was more akin to that of a tail-end batsman with minimal skill, and blamed his poor form with the bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by Bradman. With two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle-order, Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run. They realised Australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with extreme caution, reluctant even to attack <a href="long%20hop">long hop</a>s. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a <a href="yorker">yorker</a>. The English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia at 225/6. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.

This left Johnson and Tallon as the new men at the <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>. Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely in the last hour. Edrich had Johnson caught behind for four to leave Australia at 246/7. Johnson had contributed only four of the 30 runs scored while he was at the crease. Lindwall joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 258/7 with Tallon on 25 and Lindwall on 3. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in the day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. Bowes believed that Yardley attacked very well, keeping the pressure on Australia by rotating his bowlers effectively so his three main bowlers were always at the crease. O'Reilly praised Evans's agile display in his stumping attempts as the fastest and best he had seen. The English crowd were optimistic about England's position and some of them immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground. Arlott said England's "bowlers had done nobly".

The next day, the English crowd filled the ground early, anticipating a strong showing from the home team after their promising start on the first day, but Australia's lower order batted their team into control on the second morning. Tallon and Lindwall batted confidently from the start of the play, and the latter hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball was taken. O'Reilly said Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series, but he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8. Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, while Johnston and Toshack played adventurously, registering the highest Test scores of their careers. Both Johnston and Toshack swung hard at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29—before becoming Bedser's second victim of the morning, holing out to Yardley for 53. Toshack came out to join Johnston with the score at 320/9 and the last pair put on 30 more runs before the latter was <a href="stumped">stumped</a> from Wright's leg spin, having overbalanced while leaning onto the front foot and trying to hit a ball for six. The Australians had regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers from mishits. Both Johnston and Toshack—not known for their batting ability—played without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail was dealing efficiently with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs. The <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> of Laker was used sparingly, accounting for only seven overs, whereas the part-time medium pace of Edrich and Yardley had combined for 23 overs.

Washbrook and Hutton then strode to the crease as England faced a short burst of Australian pace before the lunch break. Lindwall took the <a href="cricket%20ball">new ball</a> and felt pain in his groin after delivering the first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered, and his first over was a maiden. Seeing Lindwall struggle through the pain barrier, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller at the start off the second over to see if he could lift and bowl as well. However, Miller threw the ball back to his captain, indicating that his body would not be able to withstand the strain. This resulted in media speculation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.

Although Bradman claimed the exchange had been amicable, others disputed this. Teammate Barnes later asserted that Miller had retorted by suggesting Bradman—a very occasional slower bowler—bowl himself. Barnes said the captain "was as wild as a battery-stung brumby" and warned his unwilling bowler that there would be consequences for his defiance. According to unpublished writings in Fingleton's personal collection, Bradman chastised his players in the dressing room at the end of the play, saying "I'm 40 and I can do my full day's work in the field." Miller reportedly snapped "So would I—if I had <a href="fibrositis">fibrositis</a>"; Bradman had been discharged from the armed services during World War II on health grounds, whereas most of the team had been sent into battle. Miller had crash-landed while serving as a fighter pilot in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> in England and had suffered chronic back trouble ever since.

Washbrook had been criticised after the First Test for playing aggressively and taking too many risks early in his innings, having fallen twice to attacking shots. He continued to play in a similar way, rather than adopting the traditional opener's strategy of not playing at any ball unless it was going to hit the stumps and waiting for the bowlers to tire. Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over, playing at a ball outside off stump, and ended his pre-lunch spell with 1/7 from six overs, while Johnston accompanied him from the other end. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After lunch, Hutton did the majority of the scoring, before playing outside a Johnson <a href="off%20break">off break</a> on the front foot and being bowled for 20 to leave England at 32/2. The English opener had been uncertain against Johnson's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball, which went between a gap between his bat and pad. Compton came in, having been dismissed <a href="hit%20wicket">hit wicket</a> after falling over in the last Test while trying to avoid a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a>, and Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich—who was <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">playing across the line</a>—with an <a href="outswinger">outswinger</a> for five. Edrich had toiled for 70 minutes in scoring those runs. Dollery came out and played the first ball with his <a href="pads">pads</a> before being bowled for a duck from the next delivery. Dollery's bat was still about to start its downward swing towards by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell by Lindwall that yielded 2/11 as the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his extreme pace. England were 46/4 and Australia firmly in control.

Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and after playing defensively for a period, the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs in 100 minutes. After the loss of four quick wickets, the Compton and Yardley elected to not play at any balls that were not on the line of the stumps, and Lindwall and Johnston were taken off to recuperate ahead of the second new ball. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels. Meanwhile, Johnson and Toshack operated, and the English duo played them cautiously and comfortably. At tea, England had recovered to be 129/4, with Compton on 51 and Yardley 42. The English captain had been particularly successful against Johnson, capitalising on a series of overpitched balls and driving them away for runs. After tea, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball, but the former appeared to be tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Compton edged Johnston into the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slips</a>, where Miller took a low catch, ending his innings for 53. One run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. Evans came to the crease and tried to counter-attack, hitting Lindwall for a boundary past square leg. Johnston then removed Evans for nine, caught by a diving Miller from a swing of the bat wide outside off stump, leaving the hosts at 145/7.

Coxon and Laker came to the crease and put on a 41-run stand for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson, ending his first Test innings for 19, and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice in the slips. England's last pair added ten runs to close <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">at stumps</a> on 207/9 with Bedser on six and Wright eight, having just avoided the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>.

On the third morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall tried to break their resistance by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs for the loss of 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he knew just when to put his all into the task ... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.
The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. From the second ball of the innings, bowled by Bedser, Barnes got off the mark to avoid his <a href="pair%20%28cricket%29">pair</a>. Coxon took the new ball at the other end and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In contrast to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps and established a solid start for themselves. Yardley then introduced Laker, who induced Morris to hit a ball back down the pitch in the air, but the bowler was slow to react to the possibility of a <a href="caught%20and%20bowled">caught and bowled</a>. According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers would have been able to reach the ball and attempt a catch. Barnes survived a missed stumping opportunity from Laker in the same over when he was on 18; he came down the pitch and the ball bounced out of the footmarks and narrowly missed leg stump, but Evans fumbled it, and it went away for four byes.

Barnes took advantage of his reprieve to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes in an attempt to disrupt their progress. Wright came on and bowled a <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes decided to adopt a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been bowled or trapped lbw trying to force off breaks into the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>. He <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">drove</a> Laker into the pavilion and Australia were 73/0 at lunch with Morris on 40 and Barnes 25, an overall lead of 208.

After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">sweep</a> from a long hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat three times in a row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the new ball.

Barnes was also quiet after lunch, and after one long period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing his hand on his chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he accelerated after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.

Barnes lingered for a further ten minutes on 96 before reaching his century with a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">straight drive</a> from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours. After registering his century, Barnes became particularly aggressive. Barnes stepped out to attack Laker but missed; luckily for him, Evans failed to collect the ball as it turned down the leg side.

Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two successive blows over the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">long on boundary</a> for six, and two fours, and Australia's lead went past the 400 mark with nine wickets still in hand. Yardley then brought on the part-time <a href="left-arm%20unorthodox%20spin">left-arm unorthodox spin</a> of Compton, and himself, in an attempt to stem Barnes' hitting. The Australian finally fell for 141, caught by Washbrook on the boundary from Yardley. The ball would have gone for another six had it not been intercepted by Washbrook. Barnes had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings. The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 296/2 in minutes, after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Yardley bowled Hassett for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">golden duck</a> off the inside edge, so Miller came to the crease at 296/3 to face Yardley's <a href="Hat-trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a> ball. The Australian all-rounder survived a loud lbw appeal on his first ball, denying the English captain his hat-trick. Despite Yardley's failure to complete the hat-trick, he had taken four wickets in the match, and was going through an unusually productive period with his semi-regular bowling. While England's front-line bowlers struggled, Yardley managed 9 wickets at a <a href="bowling%20average">bowling average</a> of 22.66 for the series. His average was second only to Lindwall among all bowlers, and only Bedser (18) among his players dismissed more batsmen. In contrast, Yardley averaged less than two wickets every three matches throughout his first-class career, at an average above 30. 
Bradman was on 89 and heading towards a century in his last Test innings at Lord's when he fell to Bedser again, this time courtesy of a one-handed diving effort from Edrich. Bradman had been worried by Bedser's angle into his pads and the leg trap, but the seamer's <a href="leg%20cutter">leg cutter</a> moved the ball the other way towards the slips and caught Bradman's outside edge. Bedser had dismissed Bradman all four times so far in the Test series. Brown joined Miller at 329/4 after Australia had lost 3/33. The tourists reached stumps at 343 without further loss, Miller striking one six over <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">square leg</a> into the grandstand. He had also offered two chances, but none of the catches were completed. This gave Australia a lead of 478 at the end of the third day, with Miller on 22 and Brown on 7. In all, England had missed seven catches or stumpings. O'Reilly said the loss of three quick wickets in the afternoon was not so much a sign of an English revival but Australian complacency due to the large size of the lead.

After the Sunday rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages, which increased England's chances of saving the game. Just ten minutes after the start of the day's play, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, having advanced Australia to 409/4. Miller was given a life before lunch when he hit a ball high into the air; Dollery stood right under it and had ample time to prepare, but dropped the catch. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 66 runs. During this time, the third new ball became available, but England opted not to use it immediately, as the wet and slippery ground had made it hard for the bowlers to grip the ball or run up to the crease with confidence; the hosts instead waited for drier conditions so they could exercise more control over the ball. However, after a period of using his slower bowlers, Yardley opted to take the new ball, and Miller hit three boundaries to pass 50, and both batsmen lifted their rate of scoring. It appeared that aside from the need to score quickly in preparation for the declaration, both players found the new ball easier to see than its muddied predecessor. Miller hooked Coxon repeatedly, and drove Bedser for many runs. Bradman was expected to declare just before lunch so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower at this time deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball; Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times.

After the resumption of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker across the line to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs for the loss of three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.

Yardley decided to use the <a href="road%20roller">medium roller</a> to flatten out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break immediately after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain started again. The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">unsuccessfully appealed against the light</a>. Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled adjournment.

When the players returned, Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball, troubling the English batsmen. However, Washbrook changed his tactics and decided to eschew the hook shot, even allowing some short balls to hit him on the body. Washbrook drove Johnston for three runs and then <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">pulled</a> Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes—who was standing close in at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short leg</a>—in the nose. He proceeded to score England's first 16 runs. Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved the ball into the right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took the outside of the edge of the bat. Hutton had trouble dealing with Lindwall, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light, hampered by the lack of a sightscreen. Fingleton described it as "probably Hutton's worst effort in a Test". In a fidgety display, Hutton played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over. O'Reilly said Hutton "seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows", and that he "was little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]". Hutton took 32 minutes of batting to score his first run of the innings.

Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42, England's highest opening partnership of the series thus far, before the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips and was out for 13. Edrich and Washbrook were then subjected to repeated <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">short balls</a>, and the latter was hit several times on the fingers while fending down Lindwall's bouncers, having decided to avoid the hook shot. Edrich ducked so low and so quickly that the top of the stumps could often be seen behind his back. Soon after, Toshack removed both Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65/3. Edrich, having played only one scoring shot in the preceding 20 minutes, edged an overpitched delivery to Johnson low down in the slips, and decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken. The batsman thought he may have hit a <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23B">bump ball</a> into the ground before it flew to Johnson, but the umpire ruled otherwise and gave him out. Tallon then took a difficult catch to remove Washbrook. Washbrook <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">inside edged</a> a Toshack <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a> directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as "miraculous" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Up until this point, Washbrook had been beginning to find some fluency and was striking the ball confidently. Arlott speculated that Edrich and Washbrook may have lost concentration after Lindwall was replaced by Toshack, lulled into a false sense of security once Australia's leading bowler was no longer operating. However, Compton and Dollery added 41 in the last 30 minutes to take England to 106/3 at the close of play. Compton was on 29 and Dollery 21. The latter was particularly fluent in scoring on the leg side and he defied the Australian bowlers resolutely. Lindwall was brought back to put pressure on Dollery, having bowled him for a duck in the first innings, but the batsman had already been in the middle for a short period, and played the pace bowling with more assurance in the second innings.

The final day started poorly for England; after failing to hit a leg stump <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a> for a boundary from the first ball of the day, Compton edged Johnston to a diving Miller at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">second slip</a> from the second ball of the morning. Compton had aimed a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">square drive</a>, but the delivery was Johnston's variation ball, which went away instead of into the batsman. It took the outside edge and flew to a diving Miller, who knocked the ball upwards before falling on his back and completing the catch as the ball went down. Compton stood his ground and waited for the umpire to confirm whether Miller had caught the ball cleanly, and was duly given out by the unhesitating official. O'Reilly described Miller's effort as "perhaps the very best slips catch of the whole series and ... a real match-winner." England had lost a wicket without adding to their overnight total.

Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack bowled the former for 11. He trapped the new man Coxon two balls later in the same over for a duck, leaving England at 133/6. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit him in front of the stumps and prompted a loud lbw appeal, and did the same thing to the next ball. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston. In the meantime, Dollery had continued to bat effectively, watching the ball closely onto his bat, and scoring three leg side boundaries from Johnston's bowling. Eight runs after Coxon's dismissal, Dollery shaped to duck a Lindwall bouncer, but it skidded through low and bowled him. Lindwall bowled Laker without scoring later in the same over to leave England at 141/8. Evans continued to resist stubbornly, remaining 24 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> as England were bowled out for 186 to cede a 409-run victory. Johnston had Bedser caught by Hassett for nine before Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall for four.

Toshack ended the innings with 5/40, while Lindwall and Johnston took 3/61 and 2/62 respectively. The dominance of Australia's three-man seam attack was such that the off spinner Johnson bowled only two of the 78.1 overs. Arlott said that while Toshack had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure. He said that when Lindwall "so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome." O'Reilly said England's second innings "had developed into an undignified scramble" and had allowed the Australian bowlers to pick up wickets as though they were playing against a weak county team. He blamed the low standards of <a href="county%20cricket">county cricket</a> for allowing English batsmen to accumulate large tallies of runs easily while not testing them against formidable bowling. O'Reilly said they had become soft after many matches against weak opposition, which had not forced them to concentrate as intensely as they would have had to in Test cricket. The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were £43,000—a record for a Test in England.<ref name="Allen p136/37">Allen, pp. 106–107. A report by R. J. Hayter.</ref>

"Wisden's" verdict was that "this convincing victory confirmed the First Test realisations of Australia's clear superiority at all points. Only on the first day did England provide comparable opposition, and their Selectors must have been very disappointed at the lack of determination by some of the batsmen against an attack again below full strength ... Australia were the better team in batting, bowling, fielding and tactics, but England could not complain of lack of opportunities to wrest the initiative." Bowes considered England's attacking policy to be a failure and that, unlike the First Test, "there were no saving graces."

The main talking point after the Test was the controversial omission of England's leading batsman Hutton for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the Second Test. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would have a negative effect on the rest of the side—which was not in good batting form—as it was a poor example from a leading batsman. The omission generated considerable acrimony, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was their most formidable opponent with the bat. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> against Australia in the lead-up matches, a game in which no other Englishman passed 35, and made 94, 76 and 122 <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">retired ill</a> in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. Hutton's position was taken by debutant <a href="George%20Emmett">George Emmett</a>, who made only 10 and a duck in a rain-shortened draw, and was subsequently dropped for the Fourth Test.

Hutton's controversial exile thus ended after just one Test. However, both <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a> and Bill Bowes believed Hutton to be a better batsman once he returned to the side. He and Washbrook put on 168 for the first wicket, the first time England had put on more than 42 for the opening stand during the series, as the hosts went on to make 496, their highest score for the series. The pair added another triple-figure partnership in the second innings. Despite this, Australia's batsmen set a world record by chasing down 404 on the final day to win by seven wickets and take a series-winning 3–0 lead.

The events of the Second Test also affected the career paths of other players. England's inability to cut down the Australians resulted in the dropping of three of their bowlers—Wright, Laker and Coxon—after the Lord's Test. Coxon's debut was his only Test match, something believed to be caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Compton—whom he disliked and considered self-important—in the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. The match was the last ever Test for Brown, who had struggled out of position in the middle-order, scoring 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. He had scored centuries on his previous Test outings at Lord's in 1934 and 1938, but the third visit proved to be the end of his international career.

After the historic win in the Fourth Test, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in <a href="Rainout%20%28sports%29">rain-curtailed draws</a>. Australia completed the series in style with an innings victory in the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and the tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. Apart from two matches that were washed out after Australia had secured first innings leads of more than 200, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

First Test, 1948 Ashes series

The First Test of the 1948 Ashes series was one of five <a href="test%20cricket">Tests</a> in a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> <a href="1948%20Ashes%20series">series</a> between <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a> and <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a>. The match was played at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> from 10 to 15 June with a rest day on 13 June. Australia won the match by eight wickets to take a 1–0 series lead.

The Australians started the match as firm favourites, having won the previous series against England 3–0; in the lead-up to the 1948 series, they had won 10 of their 12 tour matches in England, mostly by large margins. This included a crushing innings defeat in a match over the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a>—a team consisting almost entirely of Test-capped and current England players. England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat on a cloudy day. After the first morning was interrupted by inclement weather, the Australian <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowlers</a> quickly made inroads into the English batting. Despite the loss of leading Australian paceman <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> with a groin injury, the hosts had difficulty against his colleagues and fell to be 74 runs for the loss of eight wickets (74/8). However, a rearguard action by <a href="tail-ender">tail-ender</a>s <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> and <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> saw England reach 165, <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> taking five wickets for 36 runs (5/36) for Australia, while compatriot <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> took 3/38. Laker top-scored for the hosts with 63. The tourists then reached 17 without loss <a href="Stumps%23End%20of%20the%20day%27s%20play">by stumps</a>.

On the second day, Yardley attempted to slow the Australian batsmen by employing <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a>, a defensive strategy that sought more to contain the opposition than to attack. As England had batted poorly in the first innings, allowing Australia to take the lead quickly, the home team sought to slow the tourists' momentum and force a drawn match. Despite the tactics, Australia reached 293/4 at the end of the day's play, captain <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> having registered his 28th Test <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>. Although Bradman and his batsmen made gestures indicating frustration at England's stifling tactics, they remained patient as there was still much time left in the match for them to convert their dominance into a victory. The next morning, Bradman departed for 138, the first in a series of dismissals in the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">leg trap</a>, but his vice-captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> continued, making 137 and putting on a century partnership with Lindwall as Australia were eventually out for 509, giving them a 344-run first innings lead. Laker was the leading bowler, taking 4/138. England reached 121/2 by stumps on the third day, which ended with a hostile crowd reaction to Miller, who bowled a large amount of <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a> at <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> and <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>.

After the rest day, play resumed in poor visibility, with frequent interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers to bear a greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the entire day to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead at the close of play, on 345/6. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower order</a> could bat for a large part of the final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after <a href="hit%20wicket">falling on his stumps</a>. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.

Prior to the First Test, Australia had played 12 first-class matches since arriving in England and starting their campaign in late-April, winning ten and drawing two. Eight of the victories were by an innings, and another was by eight wickets. One of the drawn matches, against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>, was rain-affected, with the first day washed out entirely.

One of the tour matches was against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC), which fielded a team composed almost entirely of Test players. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Australia fielded their full-strength team and won by an innings. The difference in Australia's team for the First Test was the omission of <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a>, who had been struggling from a torn <a href="callus">callus</a> on his spinning finger, which prevented him from bowling long spells. It was thought that Bradman would play another leg spinner—<a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>—in McCool's place, but the Australian captain changed his mind on the first morning when rain was forecast. <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> was played in the hope of exploiting a <a href="sticky%20wicket">wet wicket</a>. In previous rain-affected matches on the tour, Johnston had been highly effective, taking match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> and <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> respectively. <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, the reserve opener, played out of position in the middle-order, as he had against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a> and the MCC. Aside from Brown and Johnston's inclusion, Australia's team was the same as that which started the previous Ashes series in 1946–47, which they won 3–0.

England lost their leg spinner <a href="Doug%20Wright%20%28cricketer%29">Doug Wright</a> before the match to <a href="lumbago">lumbago</a>, so the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> of <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> was brought in at late notice. Laker had struggled when he had played for <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and the MCC against Australia in the lead-up matches, taking 1/137 and 3/127 respectively. In the MCC match, the Australians had attacked him, taking nine <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">sixes</a> from his bowling in one 82-minute passage of play. Of the team that took to the field for the MCC, <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>, <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>, <a href="Denis%20Compton">Denis Compton</a>, captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a>, Laker and <a href="Jack%20Young%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Young</a> were also selected for the First Test. Hutton scored 52 and 64 in the MCC match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings. Young had bowled 55.2 overs in Australia's only innings, taking 4/155. Opener <a href="Jack%20Robertson%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Jack Robertson</a> was left out after scoring six and a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, and <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a>, who had played against Australia in the 1946–47 series, partnered Hutton. <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a> had scored 107 for <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, the only <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> made against Australia in the lead-up matches, earning himself Test selection. Paceman <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> did not play in the MCC match, but had been a regular during England's last series against Australia in 1946–47, and had taken 4/104 for Surrey in their match against the tourists. <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>, who <a href="wicket-keeper">kept wickets</a> in the previous Ashes series, also gained Test selection. According to former England bowler <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a>, England went into the match with the intention of securing a draw through the selection of defensive bowlers. The home team's bowlers would tie down the Australians, forcing the batsmen to take risks to score runs and thereby increasing the chances of dismissal; however, if rain produced a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>, the England attack might be able to dismiss Australia relatively easily. As such, England filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers, Laker, Bedser and Young, and relied on Yardley, Edrich and <a href="Charlie%20Barnett%20%28cricketer%29">Charlie Barnett</a> to support them with their occasion <a href="seam%20bowling">seam bowling</a>. It was speculated that England would use only two specialist bowlers; the all-rounder <a href="George%20Pope%20%28cricketer%29">George Pope</a> was in the squad and it was thought he would be used in place of one of the bowlers, but in the end, he was omitted, as was <a href="Reg%20Simpson">Reg Simpson</a>. The latter had made 74 and 70 for <a href="Nottinghamshire%20CCC">Nottinghamshire</a> against Australia and had impressed observers with his display, and was made twelfth man.
Before the start of the match, much of the attention was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.

England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and elected to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had reputation for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a> of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set the pattern of the series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton had to deal with the contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat <a href="Roundarm%20bowling">round-arm</a> action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the point of delivery. In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start. Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">edge</a> from Washbrook in his first <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller <a href="bowled">bowled</a> Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and <a href="pads">pads</a> as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.

During the lunch interval, heavy rain fell, before the sun began to dry the pitch, making the ball skid through upon England's resumption at 13/1. Miller beat Washbrook's bat twice in one over soon after the resumption, but was unable to extract an edge. Lindwall reached his peak speed and Edrich edged to <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">first slip</a>, where <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> got both hands to the ball above his head, but failed to hold on. Edrich was on four at the time and this was part of a 20-minute passage of play during which England was unable to score. The next ball from Lindwall, Washbrook was caught on the run by Brown on the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">fine leg boundary</a> after attempting to <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">hook</a> a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> pitched on the line of leg stump. It was to be the first of several times that Washbrook was dismissed while hooking, attracting substantial criticism. Washbrook's fall left England at 15/2 after 41 minutes of batting and brought Compton to the crease to join Edrich. Compton <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">square drove</a> Miller to the boundary for <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">four</a>, which prompted a retaliatory <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> and a negative crowd reaction. Edrich was not scoring quickly but he defied the bowling of Miller and Lindwall as the English pair took the score to 46. Likewise, Compton was restraining his natural inclination to attack in an attempt to rebuild the innings after the two early wickets. During this period Brown made a series of one-handed run-saving stops in the field. The rain had also softened up the pitch and as a result, the playing surface did not offer much bounce.

Bradman then made a double change and brought on the two left-arm pacemen, <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a> and <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>. In his first over, Johnston bowled Edrich with a delivery that knocked the off stump out of the ground as the batsman leaned forward on the front foot. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, caught by Miller in <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slips</a> after attempting a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut</a>. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" described the catch as "dazzling". Miller dived and balanced himself on his spine as he caught the ball heels over head. O'Reilly said: "Johnston had trimmed and embroidered the efforts of his opening bowlers and had swung the fortunes of the game completely in Australia's favour".

Bradman then decided to bring Miller back in place of Toshack. Two runs later, Compton was bowled attempting a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">leg sweep</a> against Miller, his leg stump knocked out of the ground as he moved across his wickets. Five English wickets had fallen with only 48 runs on the board after 100 minutes of play; three batsmen had been dismissed in just ten minutes. O'Reilly said "There was nothing whatsoever to suggest that the pitch had been instrumental in the English debacle. It was purely and simply an exhilarating display of splendid bowling fit to be classed with any match-winning bowling performance in the story of Test cricket."

The collapse left Barnett and captain Yardley as the new men at the crease. Both players attacked the bowling but could not get their shots through the field for runs. Soon after, Lindwall was forced to leave the field due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Barnett hit one four before Johnston bowled him for eight off the inside edge as he leaned onto the front foot. This brought Evans to the crease with the score at 60/6, and he attempted to disrupt the Australians' line and length by counter-attacking with a series of shots in front of the wicket. He drove the ball <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">forward of point</a> to the boundary for four, and was then given two <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">lives</a>. He hit Johnston hard to <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">cover</a>, but the catch went through Bradman for another boundary. The second chance of a catch went through Bradman's hand and struck the Australian captain in the abdomen. However, the missed opportunities cost the tourists little; Evans hit a ball strongly but it was caught at close range at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short leg</a> by Morris. Without further addition to the score, Toshack trapped Yardley, who had lingered at the crease for 26 minutes in accumulating three runs, <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) with a ball that straightened after pitching, leaving the score at 74/8.

England was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, worse than the 112 made by England against <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a>'s Australians in 1921. However, a late fightback averted the unwanted record. Laker and Bedser, both from <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>, joined forces and scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">hooking and driving</a>, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket, much to the delight of the Nottingham crowd, who had appeared to have become depressed by the collapse of England's batsmen. At first, Bradman did not appear concerned by the partnership between the two bowlers from Surrey—it was thought the Australian captain may have been happy for England to continue batting so his top order would not have to bat in fading light towards the end of the afternoon, but he became anxious as the total continued to mount and both Bedser and Laker appeared comfortable. O'Reilly speculated that both players had batted confidently as their home ground in Surrey—<a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>—had a reputation for being batsman-friendly, and that as they would have had to contend with opposition batsmen who had the benefit of consistently favourable conditions, then they should also prepare so they too could capitalise on their opportunities with the willow. According to English commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a>, the playing surface was easier for batting than it had been at the start of the day, "but the difference was not such as to cause hesitation in the best batsmen in England".

Eventually, Australia was forced to take the second new ball, and Bedser was finally removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six <a href="boundary%20%28cricket%29">boundaries</a>, having reached his first 50 in only 60 minutes. O'Reilly said "There was nothing about his batting to suggest that luck was going his way or that he was short of batting experience." Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with his accuracy and variations in pace and <a href="swing%20bowling">swing</a>. Miller took 3/38 and a catch, while Lindwall and Toshack took one wicket each. Spin was not used in abundance, as Johnson bowled five overs and Morris three. Following England's struggles in the first innings, many pundits criticised Yardley's decision to bat first.

Australia had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an <a href="list%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">appeal against the light</a> after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Barnes walked down the pitch and reportedly muttered to umpire <a href="Frank%20Chester%20%28umpire%29">Frank Chester</a> in a casual tone "Eh, the light!", which allegedly shocked the arbiter. During the previous Ashes series in Australia, Barnes had continuously made time-wasting appeals against the light, which forced cricket administrators to limit the batting team to one appeal; if this was declined it would be up to the umpires to offer an adjournment. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the <a href="cricket%20ball">new ball</a> bowling of Edrich and Bedser. They <a href="Stumps%23End%20of%20the%20day%27s%20play">reached stumps</a> at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on six. Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon, and Yardley's decision to place his bowlers Young and Bedser in that region raised surprise; bowlers tend to lack the agility and reflexes needed for such positions. At this stage, following their tail-end resistance, England were in a good position with runs on the board if rain struck overnight and caused a sticky wicket, forcing the Australians to bat in hostile conditions the following day.

Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted the players on the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung the ball into the right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.

Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the umpire failed to evade a drive from Morris and stopped it with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the ground and <a href="handled%20the%20ball">handed it</a> to the bowler, prompting a finger-wagging from Chester, to which Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball. Morris unnecessarily played at a ball outside off stump from Bedser and edged it to wicket-keeper Evans, who dropped the catch. The batsman recomposed himself and hit Young's first ball—a <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a>—for runs as Australia passed 50 without loss. After the wayward start, Young began to bowl with consistent accuracy.

Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was bowled for 31 by Laker after two hours of batting. Morris tried to force a ball from Laker away, but hit it from the middle of his bat into his back pad, and the ball rebounded onto the stumps. Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field, employing <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a> to slow the scoring. The English leader packed the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> with fielders, including two short legs, and ordered Bedser to bowl at leg stump. Bradman almost inside-edged the second ball onto his stumps, before defending uneasily for a period. With Laker stopping the scoring at the other end, Bradman managed only four runs in his first 20 minutes of batting. The Australian captain regarded Bedser as the finest seam bowler he faced in his career, and he batted in a circumspect manner as he sought to establish himself. At the other end, Bradman misjudged a ball from Laker and an incorrectly executed cut shot narrowly went wide of the slip fielder. Now aged 40, Bradman's reflexes had slowed and he no longer started his innings as confidently as he had done in the past. Barnes then reached his half-century after 135 minutes, <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Pull%20and%20hook">pulling</a> Barnett for four, and the Australians passed 100 before lunch after 125 minutes of batting. At the adjournment, the tourists were 104/1.

The score had progressed to 121 when Barnes <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">tried to cut</a> Laker, but only edged it onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire Cooke was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point on the other side of the field, before ruling the batsman out. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck in Laker's next over without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's <a href="arm%20ball">arm ball</a>, which drifted away and went straight on instead of turning inwards, thereby clipping the outside edge of his bat. The ball flew to <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">slip</a> where Edrich completed the catch. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, a position usually occupied by vice-captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>, a more sedate batsman, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed.

Laker to this point had taken 3/22 from 12.4 overs, having also top-scored in the first innings. All the while, Australia had been scoring slowly, as they would for most of the day. Brown came in at No. 5, but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and looked unaccustomed to playing in the middle order, but Bradman brought him in ahead of Hassett as the new ball was due and Brown was used to starting his innings against pace bowlers and a new ball. The Australian captain decided to hasten the new ball by using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball to attack the spinners, hitting them through the off side. Yardley removed Laker—who was bowling effectively—from the attack and took the second new ball, bringing back Bedser and Edrich. However, this move backfired as Bradman struck his first boundary in over 80 minutes, and in the first 40 minutes after lunch, 43 runs were added. Yardley brought back his two spinners, and Australia passed England's total before the English captain brought himself on to bowl, trapping Brown—who was attempting to push the ball to mid-on—lbw with an <a href="off%20cutter">off cutter</a> in his first over. This ended a 64-run stand in 58 minutes and Hassett came in at 185/4. The Australian vice-captain came close to being caught when he knocked a ball from Bedser into the air, narrowly evading the grasp of Evans. Following the departure of Brown, the Australian scoring slowed as Bradman changed the team strategy to one of attempting to bat only once.

Yardley continued to employ a leg side field as he and Barnett bowled outside leg stump. During one over, Bradman did not attempt a single shot and then put his hands on his hips to express his displeasure at England's tactics. During the 15 minutes before tea, the Australian captain did not add a single run and was heckled by the crowd. Bradman reached tea on 78, and 55 minutes after the resumption of play, he <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">cover drove</a> Bedser to reach his <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> in 218 minutes. It was his 28th <a href="List%20of%20international%20cricket%20centuries%20by%20Donald%20Bradman">Test century</a>, and his 18th in Ashes Tests. The last 29 runs took 70 minutes to accumulate, and it was one of Bradman's slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs rather than taking wickets. Nevertheless, Bradman had appeared comfortable after the early stages of his innings, and patiently scored most of his runs between mid-off and mid-on, often from the back foot. After Bradman had reached his milestone, many of the spectators began to leave the ground, content with what they had seen.

Bradman added a further 30 in the last hour to end with 130. Hassett also batted patiently, with one period of 20 minutes during which his score remained on 30. Australia batted <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">to stumps</a> on the second day without further loss, ending at 293/4, a lead of 128, with Hassett on 41. Young had bowled 32 overs to a leg side field, conceding only 53 runs. Fingleton described the afternoon day's play as a "very shrewd display of tactics" and said that although the proceedings and the progress of the Australian batsmen had been slow, they were "never ... dull". He added: "Bradman was on top by virtue of the facts that his side was well ahead of England, his own score was 130 and he was also unconquered." However, O'Reilly disagreed and said the Australians had not made enough progress as they should or could have. He said the batsmen failed to capitalise on the fatigue of the bowlers late in the day by not going on the attack in search of quick runs, instead of their "monotonously dull" strategy of patient attrition. O'Reilly claimed that in containing the opposition batsmen, the English attack had "shared the honours of the day with—if they did not actually steal them from—Bradman." Bradman and Hassett had made physical gestures indicating their displeasure at England's tactics, but O'Reilly felt Yardley had no choice after his team had squandered the initiative with their poor batting, and claimed it was up to the Australians to turn their advantage into a decisive, match-winning position. Arlott disagreed with O'Reilly, and said Australia "had time to build ... without risk or hurry on a gentle and accommodating ... wicket. Given a winning opportunity, it is characteristic of the Australians that they will never dissipate it by over-anxiety or by carelessness."

After the day's play, O'Reilly—a former teammate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist—consulted Bedser on his use of leg theory. During his career O'Reilly had often attacked leg stump, and had devised a plan to ensnare Bradman.

On the third morning, amid sunshine, Bradman resumed on 130, before progressing to 132 and becoming the first player to pass 1,000 runs for the English season. The Australian captain was not aware of the reason for the spontaneous crowd applause until being notified by wicket-keeper Evans.

Bedser was bowling and he soon implemented O'Reilly's plans. Hutton was moved from <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">leg slip</a> to a squarer position at short fine leg, around 11 metres from the bat. Two <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">short legs and a mid-on</a> were put in place. Bradman drove Bedser through cover for a boundary, but on the next ball, his innings terminated at 138 when he glanced an <a href="inswinger">inswinger</a> from Bedser straight to Hutton at short fine leg, who caught the ball without having to move. Bradman had batted for 290 minutes and faced 321 balls and as Johnson walked in to replace him with Australia at 305/5, Bedser waved to O'Reilly in the press box. When former Australian Test opener <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>—a teammate of both Bradman and O'Reilly who was also working as a journalist—reported what his colleague had done, there was some debate as to whether O'Reilly's actions were treacherous.

Johnson made 21, including an edge over the slips cordon, before being bowled by Laker. He inside edged the ball onto his foot and it rolled back into his stumps. At the same time, Yardley pinned Hassett down with more leg theory. Laker bowled with one slip, while Young had none and had all of his fielders evenly spread in a circular formation. Tallon came in and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the <a href="left-arm%20orthodox%20spin">left-arm orthodox spin</a> of Young. The scoring was very slow during this passage of play—Young delivered 11 consecutive <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">maiden overs</a> and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs. Hassett conducted himself in a humorous way, and Arlott said: "only his grace and concealed humour made his innings tolerable". He mainly scored from deflections and was for the most part prepared to take his time.

The injured Lindwall came out to bat at 365/7 without a <a href="runner%20%28cricket%29">runner</a> to join Hassett, and appeared to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time elapsed.

After the break, Hassett reached his century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The dismissal ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who was caught by Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23W">wagged</a> a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his <a href="spin%20bowling">spinners</a>; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113. The part-time <a href="seam%20bowling">seam bowlers</a>, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs respectively. Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.

England thus started their second innings still 344 runs in arrears. Although Lindwall was able to run between the wickets, he did not take to the field in the second innings and the 12th man <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> took his place. Fingleton called Harvey "by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides". Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but did not formally object to Harvey's presence on the field. O'Reilly said Lindwall had demonstrated his mobility during his innings, was in no way "incapacitated" and that the English captain "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far" when no substitute was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton's judgement of Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far. Arlott went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world.

Four of the first five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up his end of the pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the <a href="arm%20ball">arm ball</a>, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.

This brought together England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon the fall of Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a> from Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect the gaps between the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.

Hutton then <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">leg glanced</a> Miller, before <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">cover driving and square cutting</a> him in another over. All three shots went for four and he reached his fifty in 110 minutes. Miller responded to the spate of boundaries with a series of <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncers</a>, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short-pitched barrage, including shouts of ""<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>"". The original practitioners of Bodyline, <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> and <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a>, were both from Nottinghamshire and played at Trent Bridge, and were later excluded from selection for England after being blamed for the ill-feeling caused by Bodyline. The Nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that Miller was able to do something they saw to be equivalent. For his part, Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. However, Hutton had the last word, glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 121/2, with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively. Miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off the field, and the crowded surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room. O'Reilly defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed the batsman the opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try; in contrast the packed Bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal.

The third day was followed by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, a Monday, with England still 223 runs in arrears. Before the start of play, the <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club</a> (NCCC) secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery over the public address system to refrain from their heckling of Miller.
The crowd responded by clapping as the Australians took to the field. The chairman of the NCCC reportedly apologised to Bradman in private for the crowd reaction to Miller.
As the new ball was due soon after the start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson extracted sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day as soon as it was available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an <a href="off%20cutter">off cutter</a> in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">second slip</a> as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.

At 12:35, bad light stopped proceedings, and after two inspections the umpires resumed play, although Arlott claimed that visibility was "barely more than a half candle-power better". Hardstaff then batted aggressively, walking towards the bowling and hitting three cover drives for four from Miller and Johnston, in one period in which he outscored Compton 23 to four. He then edged through slips for another boundary before Compton swept Toshack to the fence. In the final over before the lunch break, Hardstaff <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">square drove</a> Johnston for four off the back foot and England adjourned at 191/3 with Compton on 63 and Hardstaff 31, still 153 in arrears. During the session, Bradman used Miller for 11 overs in a row in an attempt to pressure the Englishmen, while Toshack bowled defensively from the other end.

After lunch, the light was again poor, but England did not appeal to the umpires for an adjournment. Yardley wanted to bat now in poor visibility in order to eradicate the deficit and build a lead, so that if a shower came later and turned the pitch into a <a href="sticky%20wicket">sticky wicket</a>, Australia would have to chase a target on an erratic surface. Bradman anticipated rain, so he utilised Toshack and Johnson to bowl defensively to slow England's progress in the hope that the hosts would not have a lead by the time a sticky wicket materialised. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as to endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced play to continue as they posed no physical threat to the batsmen. In foggy and misty conditions, Hardstaff brought up England's 200 with a strongly-hit hook that almost hit Barnes. Compton then hit a boundary from Toshack, prompting Bradman to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions. Scoring was slow as Toshack pinned down the batsmen with an effective leg stump line.

The innings was interrupted by bad light and upon the resumption of proceedings, poor visibility intervened for a second time with Compton on 97. After 55 minutes of delay, the umpires called the players back onto the field. "Wisden" said: "rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day." Fingleton said the conditions were "pitiable" and lamented the "utmost gloom in which batsmen and fieldsmen had intense difficulty in sighting the ball". O'Reilly said it was "without doubt the worst light" under which he had seen a first-class match proceed. Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge by hitting a single to square leg, a "lovely century of stroke-play and patience" according to Fingleton. The innings had taken 227 minutes and included 12 fours, and Compton had regularly hit the ball in the middle of his bat despite the poor visibility, which meant the batsmen could not see the ball once it was close to the boundary. O'Reilly described the innings as "one of the greatest batting efforts in the story of Anglo-Australian Tests", adding that "his hundred runs was but a poor measure by which to estimate the value of his magnificent innings", deeming Compton's innings equivalent to a double century under normal conditions. Arlott said "In its manner, its style and its context it must rank with any innings he has ever played ... his innings will remain a Test classic."

Soon after, Compton edged to the slips from the bowling of Miller, but Johnson spilled the catch. Hardstaff fell for 43, lofting Toshack to Hassett on the leg side, having put on 93 with Compton. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Barnett came in and together with Compton added 21 runs in 33 minutes before edging Johnston to Miller, who completed a difficult catch in slips. Yardley came out to bat at 264/5 and Compton drove Miller square for four, provoking the bowler's first bouncer of the day. Compton hooked it away for two and Miller's next delivery slipped out of his hand and cleared Compton's head on the full to some jeering in the crowd. Such a ball is known as a <a href="beamer%20%28cricket%29">beamer</a> and is illegal because of the physical danger it poses to the batsman. Compton and Yardley put on a 57-run partnership in 66 minutes before Johnston held a return catch to dismiss Yardley for 22. England <a href="Stumps%23End%20of%20the%20day%27s%20play">reached stumps</a> at 345/6, just one run ahead of Australia, with Compton on 154 and Evans on 10. During the day, Johnston bowled the most overs, 30.

Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes after the start of play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans continued to attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.

Miller bowled a fast and very short bouncer at Compton, who moved into position to hook before changing his mind and attempting to evade the ball. He lost balance and threw his legs apart, trying to avoid stepping onto his stumps. However, he was unsuccessful and was out <a href="hit%20wicket">hit wicket</a> for 184, having batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours. "Wisden" said: "No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances." Fingleton said it was "a most depressing end to an innings that will live always". O'Reilly described it as "an unsavoury ending to one of the greatest fighting knocks in Test history". Compton's fall at 405/7 exposed the English <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">tail</a> and Australia quickly finished off the rest of the batsmen in 36 minutes. Miller bowled Laker—who played outside the line of the ball—for four, Evans reached 50 and was caught behind from Johnston, who then <a href="bowled">castled</a> Young for nine. England were all out for 441 after 183 overs, leaving Australia a target of 98 in three hours. Lindwall's absence throughout the England innings meant the remaining four Australian frontline bowlers had bowled more than 32 overs each—Johnston delivered 59 and ended with 4/147 while Miller took 4/125 from 44 overs. Toshack and Johnson took a wicket each from 33 and 42 overs respectively.

Australia progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs, including three boundaries, from the opening over, bowled by Bedser, while Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. Yardley tried to stop the run-scoring by bringing on Young, but Morris hit him for four and the bowler was promptly taken off. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Bedser bowled Morris for nine; after bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger. Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch. Bradman came to the crease and batted for 12 minutes without getting off the mark. From the 10th ball he faced, the Australian skipper was out for a duck, again caught by Hutton at short fine leg in Bedser's leg trap. Bradman showed obvious displeasure at allowing himself to be dismissed by the same trap in consecutive innings, and his departure left Australia at 48/2. It was the first time in four tours to England that Bradman had made a duck in a Test.

Upon Bradman's dismissal, dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">square cut</a>. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit the winning run.

The First Test was a continuation of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. "Wisden's" verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevent defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified and should have been continued.

Australia's success came at a cost, with Lindwall injured and unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the intervening matches against <a href="Northamptonshire%20CCC">Northamptonshire</a> and <a href="Yorkshire%20CCC">Yorkshire</a>. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, and he was still not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was unfit to bowl.

Content with their convincing win at Trent Bridge, Australia made no changes to their team, while England made three, omitting Barnett, Hardstaff and Young due to a combination of injury and poor form. Barnett and Hardstaff never played another Test. Despite his injury, Lindwall played a key role in a heavy 409-run Australian victory, taking eight wickets. His bowling also led to the controversial omission of Hutton, who performed poorly at Lord's, for the Third Test. The reason was said to be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. This decision pleased the Australians, who regarded Hutton as their most formidable opponent with the bat.

On the field, the Australians continued to flourish. The Third Test was a rain-affected draw, and between the First and Fourth Tests, they won four of their five county matches, drawing the other. On the final day of the Fourth Test, Australia's batsmen set a world Test cricket record by scoring 404 to win the match, thereby taking a series-winning 3–0 lead.

After the historic win in the Fourth Test, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in <a href="Rainout%20%28sports%29">rain-curtailed draws</a>. Australia then completed the series with an innings victory in the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match of the tour, and the tourists had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the English season undefeated. Apart from two washed-out matches, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team to complete an English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

Meningitis

Meningitis is an <a href="Acute%20%28medical%29">acute</a> <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of the protective membranes covering the <a href="brain">brain</a> and <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a>, known collectively as the <a href="meninges">meninges</a>. The most common symptoms are <a href="fever">fever</a>, <a href="headache">headache</a>, and <a href="neck%20stiffness">neck stiffness</a>. Other symptoms include <a href="mental%20confusion">confusion</a> or altered <a href="consciousness">consciousness</a>, vomiting, and an <a href="photophobia">inability to tolerate light</a> or <a href="phonophobia">loud noises</a>. Young children often exhibit only <a href="nonspecific%20symptoms">nonspecific symptoms</a>, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a <a href="rash">rash</a> is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by <a href="meningococcal%20disease">meningococcal bacteria</a> may be accompanied by a characteristic rash.
The inflammation may be caused by infection with <a href="virus">virus</a>es, <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, or other <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s, and less commonly by certain <a href="medication">drugs</a>. Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a <a href="medical%20emergency">medical emergency</a>. A <a href="lumbar%20puncture">lumbar puncture</a>, in which a needle is inserted into the <a href="spinal%20canal">spinal canal</a> to collect a sample of <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF), can diagnose or exclude meningitis.
Some forms of meningitis are preventable by <a href="immunization">immunization</a> with the <a href="meningococcal%20vaccine">meningococcal</a>, <a href="mumps%20vaccine">mumps</a>, <a href="pneumococcal%20vaccine">pneumococcal</a>, and <a href="Hib%20vaccine">Hib vaccine</a>s. Giving <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s to people with significant exposure to certain types of meningitis may also be useful. The first treatment in acute meningitis consists of promptly giving antibiotics and sometimes <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s. <a href="Corticosteroid">Corticosteroid</a>s can also be used to prevent complications from excessive inflammation. Meningitis can lead to serious long-term consequences such as <a href="deafness">deafness</a>, <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, <a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a>, or <a href="cognitive%20deficit">cognitive deficit</a>s, especially if not treated quickly.
In 2015, meningitis occurred in about 8.7 million people worldwide. This resulted in 379,000 deaths – down from 464,000 deaths in 1990. With appropriate treatment the risk of death in bacterial meningitis is less than 15%. Outbreaks of bacterial meningitis occur between December and June each year in an area of <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a> known as the <a href="meningitis%20belt">meningitis belt</a>. Smaller outbreaks may also occur in other areas of the world. The word meningitis comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> μῆνιγξ "meninx", "membrane", and the medical suffix "-itis", "inflammation".

In adults, the most common symptom of meningitis is a severe <a href="headache">headache</a>, occurring in almost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by <a href="neck%20stiffness">neck stiffness</a> (the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck <a href="muscle%20tone">muscle tone</a> and stiffness). The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal rigidity, sudden <a href="Fever%23Types">high fever</a>, and <a href="altered%20level%20of%20consciousness">altered mental status</a>; however, all three features are present in only 44–46% of bacterial meningitis cases. If none of the three signs are present, acute meningitis is extremely unlikely. Other signs commonly associated with meningitis include <a href="photophobia">photophobia</a> (intolerance to bright light) and <a href="phonophobia">phonophobia</a> (intolerance to loud noises). Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms, and may only be <a href="irritability">irritable</a> and look unwell. The <a href="fontanelle">fontanelle</a> (the soft spot on the top of a baby's head) can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months. Other features that distinguish meningitis from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain, cold extremities, and an abnormal <a href="Human%20skin%20color">skin color</a>.

Nuchal rigidity occurs in 70% of bacterial meningitis in adults. Other signs include the presence of positive <a href="Kernig%27s%20sign">Kernig's sign</a> or <a href="Brudzi%C5%84ski%20sign">Brudziński sign</a>. Kernig's sign is assessed with the person lying <a href="Supine%20position">supine</a>, with the hip and knee flexed to 90 degrees. In a person with a positive Kernig's sign, pain limits passive extension of the knee. A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip. Although Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the <a href="Sensitivity%20and%20specificity">sensitivity</a> of these tests is limited. They do, however, have very good <a href="Sensitivity%20and%20specificity">specificity</a> for meningitis: the signs rarely occur in other diseases. Another test, known as the "jolt accentuation maneuver" helps determine whether meningitis is present in those reporting fever and headache. A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally; if this does not make the headache worse, meningitis is unlikely.

Other problems can produce symptoms similar to those above, but from non-meningitic causes. This is called <a href="meningism">meningism</a> or pseudomeningitis.

Meningitis caused by the bacterium "<a href="Neisseria%20meningitidis">Neisseria meningitidis</a>" (known as "meningococcal meningitis") can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a rapidly spreading <a href="petechial%20rash">petechial rash</a>, which may precede other symptoms. The rash consists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots ("petechiae") on the trunk, <a href="Human%20leg">lower extremities</a>, mucous membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet. The rash is typically <a href="non-blanching%20rash">non-blanching</a>; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler. Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it is relatively specific for the disease; it does, however, occasionally occur in meningitis due to other bacteria. Other clues on the cause of meningitis may be the skin signs of <a href="hand%2C%20foot%20and%20mouth%20disease">hand, foot and mouth disease</a> and <a href="genital%20herpes">genital herpes</a>, both of which are associated with various forms of viral meningitis.

Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness. These may require specific treatment, and sometimes indicate severe illness or worse prognosis. The infection may trigger <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>, a <a href="systemic%20inflammatory%20response%20syndrome">systemic inflammatory response syndrome</a> of falling <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a>, <a href="tachycardia">fast heart rate</a>, high or abnormally low temperature, and <a href="tachypnea">rapid breathing</a>. Very low blood pressure may occur at an early stage, especially but not exclusively in meningococcal meningitis; this may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs. <a href="Disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>, the excessive activation of <a href="coagulation">blood clotting</a>, may obstruct <a href="blood%20flow">blood flow</a> to organs and paradoxically increase the bleeding risk. <a href="Gangrene">Gangrene</a> of limbs can occur in meningococcal disease. Severe meningococcal and pneumococcal infections may result in hemorrhaging of the <a href="adrenal%20gland">adrenal gland</a>s, leading to <a href="Waterhouse-Friderichsen%20syndrome">Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome</a>, which is often fatal.

The <a href="cerebral%20edema">brain tissue may swell</a>, <a href="intracranial%20pressure">pressure inside the skull</a> may increase and the swollen brain may <a href="Brain%20herniation">herniate</a> through the skull base. This may be noticed by a decreasing <a href="level%20of%20consciousness">level of consciousness</a>, loss of the <a href="pupillary%20light%20reflex">pupillary light reflex</a>, and <a href="abnormal%20posturing">abnormal posturing</a>. The inflammation of the brain tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain (<a href="hydrocephalus">hydrocephalus</a>). <a href="Seizure">Seizure</a>s may occur for various reasons; in children, seizures are common in the early stages of meningitis (in 30% of cases) and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause. Seizures may result from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue. <a href="Focal%20seizures">Focal seizures</a> (seizures that involve one limb or part of the body), persistent seizures, late-onset seizures and those that are difficult to control with medication indicate a poorer long-term outcome.

Inflammation of the meninges may lead to abnormalities of the <a href="cranial%20nerves">cranial nerves</a>, a group of nerves arising from the <a href="brain%20stem">brain stem</a> that supply the head and neck area and which control, among other functions, eye movement, facial muscles, and hearing. Visual symptoms and <a href="hearing%20loss">hearing loss</a> may persist after an episode of meningitis. Inflammation of the brain (<a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a>) or its <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s (<a href="cerebral%20vasculitis">cerebral vasculitis</a>), as well as the formation of <a href="thrombosis">blood clots</a> in the veins (<a href="cerebral%20venous%20sinus%20thrombosis">cerebral venous thrombosis</a>), may all lead to weakness, loss of sensation, or abnormal movement or function of the part of the body supplied by the affected area of the brain.

Meningitis is typically caused by an <a href="infection">infection</a> with <a href="microorganisms">microorganisms</a>. Most infections are due to viruses, with <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, and <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> being the next most common causes. It may also result from various non-infectious causes. The term "<a href="aseptic%20meningitis">aseptic meningitis</a>" refers to cases of meningitis in which no bacterial infection can be demonstrated. This type of meningitis is usually caused by viruses but it may be due to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, when bacteria disappear from the meninges, or pathogens infect a space adjacent to the meninges (e.g. <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a>). <a href="Endocarditis">Endocarditis</a> (an infection of the <a href="heart%20valve">heart valve</a>s which spreads small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may cause aseptic meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection with <a href="spirochete">spirochete</a>s, a group of bacteria that includes "<a href="Treponema%20pallidum">Treponema pallidum</a>" (the cause of <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>) and "<a href="Borrelia%20burgdorferi">Borrelia burgdorferi</a>" (known for causing <a href="Lyme%20disease">Lyme disease</a>). Meningitis may be encountered in <a href="cerebral%20malaria">cerebral malaria</a> (malaria infecting the brain) or <a href="amoebic%20meningitis">amoebic meningitis</a>, meningitis due to infection with <a href="amoebae">amoebae</a> such as "<a href="Naegleria%20fowleri">Naegleria fowleri</a>", contracted from freshwater sources.

The types of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> that cause bacterial meningitis vary according to the infected individual's age group.

Recent skull <a href="physical%20trauma">trauma</a> potentially allows nasal cavity bacteria to enter the meningeal space. Similarly, devices in the brain and meninges, such as <a href="cerebral%20shunt">cerebral shunt</a>s, <a href="extraventricular%20drain">extraventricular drain</a>s or <a href="Ommaya%20reservoir">Ommaya reservoir</a>s, carry an increased risk of meningitis. In these cases, the persons are more likely to be infected with <a href="Staphylococci">Staphylococci</a>, <a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>, and other <a href="Gram-negative">Gram-negative</a> bacteria. These pathogens are also associated with meningitis in people with <a href="Immunodeficiency">an impaired immune system</a>. An infection in the head and neck area, such as <a href="otitis%20media">otitis media</a> or <a href="mastoiditis">mastoiditis</a>, can lead to meningitis in a small proportion of people. Recipients of <a href="cochlear%20implant">cochlear implant</a>s for hearing loss are more at risk for pneumococcal meningitis.

<a href="Tuberculous%20meningitis">Tuberculous meningitis</a>, which is meningitis caused by "<a href="Mycobacterium%20tuberculosis">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</a>", is more common in people from countries in which <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> is endemic, but is also encountered in persons with immune problems, such as <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>.

Recurrent bacterial meningitis may be caused by persisting anatomical defects, either <a href="congenital">congenital</a> or acquired, or by disorders of the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>. Anatomical defects allow continuity between the external environment and the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>. The most common cause of recurrent meningitis is a <a href="skull%20fracture">skull fracture</a>, particularly fractures that affect the base of the skull or extend towards the <a href="paranasal%20sinuses">sinuses</a> and <a href="petrous%20pyramids">petrous pyramids</a>. Approximately 59% of recurrent meningitis cases are due to such anatomical abnormalities, 36% are due to immune deficiencies (such as <a href="complement%20deficiency">complement deficiency</a>, which predisposes especially to recurrent meningococcal meningitis), and 5% are due to ongoing infections in areas adjacent to the meninges.

Viruses that cause meningitis include <a href="enterovirus">enterovirus</a>es, <a href="herpes%20simplex%20virus">herpes simplex virus</a> (generally type 2, which produces most genital sores; less commonly type 1), <a href="varicella%20zoster%20virus">varicella zoster virus</a> (known for causing <a href="chickenpox">chickenpox</a> and <a href="Herpes%20zoster">shingles</a>), <a href="mumps">mumps virus</a>, <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, and <a href="lymphocytic%20choriomeningitis">LCMV</a>. <a href="Mollaret%27s%20meningitis">Mollaret's meningitis</a> is a chronic recurrent form of herpes meningitis; it is thought to be caused by <a href="herpes%20simplex%20virus">herpes simplex virus type 2</a>.

There are a number of risk factors for <a href="fungal%20meningitis">fungal meningitis</a>, including the use of <a href="immunosuppressant">immunosuppressant</a>s (such as after <a href="organ%20transplantation">organ transplantation</a>), <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, and the loss of immunity associated with aging. It is uncommon in those with a normal immune system but has occurred with <a href="New%20England%20Compounding%20Center%20meningitis%20outbreak">medication contamination</a>. Symptom onset is typically more gradual, with headaches and fever being present for at least a couple of weeks before diagnosis. The most common fungal meningitis is <a href="cryptococcal%20meningitis">cryptococcal meningitis</a> due to "<a href="Cryptococcus%20neoformans">Cryptococcus neoformans</a>". In Africa, cryptococcal meningitis is now the most common cause of meningitis in multiple studies, and it accounts for 20–25% of AIDS-related deaths in Africa. Other less common fungal pathogens which can cause meningitis include: "<a href="Coccidioides%20immitis">Coccidioides immitis</a>", "<a href="Histoplasma%20capsulatum">Histoplasma capsulatum</a>", "<a href="Blastomyces%20dermatitidis">Blastomyces dermatitidis</a>", and "<a href="Candida%20%28fungus%29">Candida</a>" species.

A parasitic cause is often assumed when there is a predominance of <a href="eosinophil%20granulocyte">eosinophils</a> (a type of white blood cell) in the CSF. The most common parasites implicated are "<a href="Angiostrongylus%20cantonensis">Angiostrongylus cantonensis</a>", "<a href="Gnathostoma%20spinigerum">Gnathostoma spinigerum</a>", "<a href="Schistosoma">Schistosoma</a>", as well as the conditions <a href="cysticercosis">cysticercosis</a>, <a href="toxocariasis">toxocariasis</a>, <a href="Baylisascaris%20procyonis">baylisascariasis</a>, <a href="paragonimiasis">paragonimiasis</a>, and a number of rarer infections and noninfective conditions.

Meningitis may occur as the result of several non-infectious causes: spread of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> to the meninges ("<a href="neoplastic%20meningitis">malignant or neoplastic meningitis</a>") and certain <a href="drugs">drugs</a> (mainly <a href="non-steroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug</a>s, <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s and <a href="intravenous%20immunoglobulin">intravenous immunoglobulin</a>s). It may also be caused by several inflammatory conditions, such as <a href="sarcoidosis">sarcoidosis</a> (which is then called <a href="neurosarcoidosis">neurosarcoidosis</a>), connective tissue disorders such as <a href="systemic%20lupus%20erythematosus">systemic lupus erythematosus</a>, and certain forms of <a href="vasculitis">vasculitis</a> (inflammatory conditions of the blood vessel wall), such as <a href="Beh%C3%A7et%27s%20disease">Behçet's disease</a>. <a href="Epidermoid%20cyst">Epidermoid cyst</a>s and <a href="dermoid%20cyst">dermoid cyst</a>s may cause meningitis by releasing irritant matter into the subarachnoid space. Rarely, <a href="migraine">migraine</a> may cause meningitis, but this diagnosis is usually only made when other causes have been eliminated.

The meninges comprise three membranes that, together with the <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, enclose and protect the <a href="brain">brain</a> and <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a> (the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>). The <a href="pia%20mater">pia mater</a> is a very delicate impermeable membrane that firmly adheres to the surface of the brain, following all the minor contours. The <a href="arachnoid%20mater">arachnoid mater</a> (so named because of its spider-web-like appearance) is a loosely fitting sac on top of the pia mater. The <a href="subarachnoid%20space">subarachnoid space</a> separates the arachnoid and pia mater membranes and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid. The outermost membrane, the <a href="dura%20mater">dura mater</a>, is a thick durable membrane, which is attached to both the arachnoid membrane and the skull.

In bacterial meningitis, bacteria reach the meninges by one of two main routes: through the bloodstream or through direct contact between the meninges and either the nasal cavity or the skin. In most cases, meningitis follows invasion of the bloodstream by organisms that live upon <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous surfaces</a> such as the <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavity</a>. This is often in turn preceded by viral infections, which break down the normal barrier provided by the mucous surfaces. Once bacteria have entered the bloodstream, they enter the <a href="subarachnoid%20space">subarachnoid space</a> in places where the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a> is vulnerable – such as the <a href="choroid%20plexus">choroid plexus</a>. Meningitis occurs in 25% of newborns with bloodstream infections due to <a href="group%20B%20streptococci">group B streptococci</a>; this phenomenon is less common in adults. Direct contamination of the cerebrospinal fluid may arise from indwelling devices, skull fractures, or infections of the nasopharynx or the nasal sinuses that have formed a tract with the subarachnoid space (see above); occasionally, <a href="Congenital%20disorder">congenital defects</a> of the <a href="dura%20mater">dura mater</a> can be identified.

The large-scale <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> that occurs in the subarachnoid space during meningitis is not a direct result of bacterial infection but can rather largely be attributed to the response of the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> to the entry of bacteria into the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>. When components of the bacterial <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a> are identified by the immune cells of the brain (<a href="astrocyte">astrocyte</a>s and <a href="microglia">microglia</a>), they respond by releasing large amounts of <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s, hormone-like mediators that recruit other immune cells and stimulate other tissues to participate in an immune response. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable, leading to <a href="Cerebral%20edema%23Vasogenic%20Cerebral%20Edema">"vasogenic" cerebral edema</a> (swelling of the brain due to fluid leakage from blood vessels). Large numbers of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s enter the CSF, causing inflammation of the meninges and leading to <a href="Cerebral%20edema%23Interstitial%20Cerebral%20Edema">"interstitial" edema</a> (swelling due to fluid between the cells). In addition, the walls of the blood vessels themselves become inflamed (cerebral vasculitis), which leads to decreased blood flow and a third type of edema, <a href="Cerebral%20edema%23Cytotoxic%20Cerebral%20Edema">"cytotoxic" edema</a>. The three forms of cerebral edema all lead to increased <a href="intracranial%20pressure">intracranial pressure</a>; together with the lowered blood pressure often encountered in <a href="Acute%20%28medical%29">acute infection</a>, this means that it is harder for blood to enter the brain, consequently <a href="brain%20cell">brain cell</a>s are deprived of oxygen and undergo <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> (<a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a>).

It is recognized that administration of antibiotics may initially worsen the process outlined above, by increasing the amount of bacterial cell membrane products released through the destruction of bacteria. Particular treatments, such as the use of <a href="glucocorticoid">corticosteroids</a>, are aimed at dampening the immune system's response to this phenomenon.

If someone is suspected of having meningitis, <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>s are performed for markers of inflammation (e.g. <a href="C-reactive%20protein">C-reactive protein</a>, <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a>), as well as <a href="blood%20culture">blood culture</a>s.

The most important test in identifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid through <a href="lumbar%20puncture">lumbar puncture</a> (LP, spinal tap). However, lumbar puncture is contraindicated if there is a mass in the brain (tumor or abscess) or the <a href="intracranial%20pressure">intracranial pressure</a> (ICP) is elevated, as it may lead to <a href="brain%20herniation">brain herniation</a>. If someone is at risk for either a mass or raised ICP (recent head injury, a known immune system problem, localizing neurological signs, or evidence on examination of a raised ICP), a <a href="Computed%20tomography">CT</a> or <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> scan is recommended prior to the lumbar puncture. This applies in 45% of all adult cases. If a CT or MRI is required before LP, or if LP proves difficult, professional guidelines suggest that antibiotics should be administered first to prevent delay in treatment, especially if this may be longer than 30 minutes. Often, CT or MRI scans are performed at a later stage to assess for complications of meningitis.

In severe forms of meningitis, monitoring of blood electrolytes may be important; for example, <a href="hyponatremia">hyponatremia</a> is common in bacterial meningitis. The cause of hyponatremia, however, is controversial and may include dehydration, the <a href="Syndrome%20of%20inappropriate%20antidiuretic%20hormone%20hypersecretion">inappropriate secretion</a> of the <a href="antidiuretic%20hormone">antidiuretic hormone</a> (SIADH), or overly aggressive <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">intravenous fluid administration</a>.

A lumbar puncture is done by positioning the person, usually lying on the side, applying <a href="local%20anesthetic">local anesthetic</a>, and inserting a needle into the <a href="dural%20sac">dural sac</a> (a sac around the spinal cord) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). When this has been achieved, the "opening pressure" of the CSF is measured using a <a href="manometer">manometer</a>. The pressure is normally between 6 and 18 cm water (cmHO); in bacterial meningitis the pressure is usually elevated. In <a href="cryptococcal%20meningitis">cryptococcal meningitis</a>, intracranial pressure is markedly elevated. The initial appearance of the fluid may prove an indication of the nature of the infection: cloudy CSF indicates higher levels of protein, white and red blood cells and/or bacteria, and therefore may suggest bacterial meningitis.

The CSF sample is examined for presence and types of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s, <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, <a href="protein">protein</a> content and <a href="glucose">glucose</a> level. <a href="Gram%20staining">Gram staining</a> of the sample may demonstrate bacteria in bacterial meningitis, but absence of bacteria does not exclude bacterial meningitis as they are only seen in 60% of cases; this figure is reduced by a further 20% if antibiotics were administered before the sample was taken. Gram staining is also less reliable in particular infections such as <a href="listeriosis">listeriosis</a>. <a href="Microbiological%20culture">Microbiological culture</a> of the sample is more sensitive (it identifies the organism in 70–85% of cases) but results can take up to 48 hours to become available. The type of white blood cell predominantly present (see table) indicates whether meningitis is bacterial (usually neutrophil-predominant) or viral (usually lymphocyte-predominant), although at the beginning of the disease this is not always a reliable indicator. Less commonly, <a href="eosinophil">eosinophil</a>s predominate, suggesting parasitic or fungal etiology, among others.

The concentration of glucose in CSF is normally above 40% of that in blood. In bacterial meningitis it is typically lower; the CSF glucose level is therefore divided by the <a href="Blood%20sugar">blood glucose</a> (CSF glucose to serum glucose ratio). A ratio ≤0.4 is indicative of bacterial meningitis; in the newborn, glucose levels in CSF are normally higher, and a ratio below 0.6 (60%) is therefore considered abnormal. High levels of <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate</a> in CSF indicate a higher likelihood of bacterial meningitis, as does a higher white blood cell count. If lactate levels are less than 35 mg/dl and the person has not previously received antibiotics then this may rule out bacterial meningitis.

A diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty is "partially treated meningitis", where there are meningitis symptoms after receiving antibiotics (such as for presumptive <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a>). When this happens, CSF findings may resemble those of viral meningitis, but antibiotic treatment may need to be continued until there is definitive positive evidence of a viral cause (e.g. a positive enterovirus PCR).

Meningitis can be diagnosed after death has occurred. The findings from a <a href="post%20mortem">post mortem</a> are usually a widespread inflammation of the <a href="pia%20mater">pia mater</a> and <a href="arachnoid%20mater">arachnoid</a> layers of the meninges. <a href="Neutrophil%20granulocyte">Neutrophil granulocyte</a>s tend to have migrated to the cerebrospinal fluid and the base of the brain, along with <a href="cranial%20nerve">cranial nerve</a>s and the <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a>, may be surrounded with <a href="pus">pus</a> – as may the meningeal vessels.

For some causes of meningitis, protection can be provided in the long term through <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a>, or in the short term with <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s. Some behavioral measures may also be effective.

Bacterial and viral meningitis are contagious, but neither is as contagious as the <a href="common%20cold">common cold</a> or <a href="flu">flu</a>. Both can be transmitted through droplets of respiratory secretions during close contact such as kissing, sneezing or coughing on someone, but cannot be spread by only breathing the air where a person with meningitis has been. Viral meningitis is typically caused by <a href="enteroviruses">enteroviruses</a>, and is most commonly spread through fecal contamination. The risk of infection can be decreased by changing the behavior that led to transmission.

Since the 1980s, many countries have included <a href="Hib%20vaccine">immunization against "Haemophilus influenzae" type B</a> in their routine childhood vaccination schemes. This has practically <a href="Eradication%20of%20infectious%20diseases">eliminated</a> this pathogen as a cause of meningitis in young children in those countries. In the countries in which the disease burden is highest, however, the vaccine is still too expensive. Similarly, immunization against mumps has led to a sharp fall in the number of cases of mumps meningitis, which prior to vaccination occurred in 15% of all cases of mumps.

<a href="Meningococcal%20vaccine">Meningococcus vaccines</a> exist against groups A, B, C, W135 and Y. In countries where the vaccine for meningococcus group C was introduced, cases caused by this pathogen have decreased substantially. A quadrivalent vaccine now exists, which combines four vaccines with the exception of B; immunization with this ACW135Y vaccine is now a visa requirement for taking part in <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a>. Development of a vaccine against group B meningococci has proved much more difficult, as its surface proteins (which would normally be used to make a vaccine) only elicit a weak <a href="Immunogenicity">response from the immune system</a>, or cross-react with normal human proteins. Still, some countries (<a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>) have developed vaccines against local strains of group B meningococci; some have shown good results and are used in local immunization schedules. Two new vaccines, both approved in 2014, are effective against a wider range of group B meningococci strains. In Africa, until recently, the approach for prevention and control of meningococcal epidemics was based on early detection of the disease and emergency reactive mass vaccination of the at-risk population with bivalent A/C or trivalent A/C/W135 polysaccharide vaccines, though the introduction of <a href="MenAfriVac">MenAfriVac</a> (meningococcus group A vaccine) has demonstrated effectiveness in young people and has been described as a model for product development partnerships in resource-limited settings.

Routine vaccination against "Streptococcus pneumoniae" with the <a href="pneumococcal%20conjugate%20vaccine">pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</a> (PCV), which is active against seven common serotypes of this pathogen, significantly reduces the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis. The <a href="pneumococcal%20polysaccharide%20vaccine">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a>, which covers 23 strains, is only administered to certain groups (e.g. those who have had a <a href="splenectomy">splenectomy</a>, the surgical removal of the spleen); it does not elicit a significant immune response in all recipients, e.g. small children. Childhood vaccination with <a href="Bacillus%20Calmette-Gu%C3%A9rin">Bacillus Calmette-Guérin</a> has been reported to significantly reduce the rate of tuberculous meningitis, but its waning effectiveness in adulthood has prompted a search for a better vaccine.

Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis is another method of prevention, particularly of meningococcal meningitis. In cases of meningococcal meningitis, preventative treatment in close contacts with antibiotics (e.g. <a href="rifampicin">rifampicin</a>, <a href="ciprofloxacin">ciprofloxacin</a> or <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a>) can reduce their risk of contracting the condition, but does not protect against future infections. Resistance to rifampicin has been noted to increase after use, which has caused some to recommend considering other agents. While antibiotics are frequently used in an attempt to prevent meningitis in those with a <a href="basilar%20skull%20fracture">basilar skull fracture</a> there is not enough evidence to determine whether this is beneficial or harmful. This applies to those with or without a CSF leak.

Meningitis is potentially life-threatening and has a high mortality rate if untreated; delay in treatment has been associated with a poorer outcome. Thus, treatment with wide-spectrum antibiotics should not be delayed while confirmatory tests are being conducted. If meningococcal disease is suspected in primary care, guidelines recommend that <a href="benzylpenicillin">benzylpenicillin</a> be administered before transfer to hospital. <a href="Intravenous%20fluid">Intravenous</a> fluids should be administered if <a href="hypotension">hypotension</a> (low blood pressure) or <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a> are present. It is not clear whether intravenous fluid should be given routinely or whether this should be restricted. Given that meningitis can cause a number of early severe complications, regular medical review is recommended to identify these complications early and to admit the person to an <a href="intensive%20care%20unit">intensive care unit</a> if deemed necessary.

<a href="Mechanical%20ventilation">Mechanical ventilation</a> may be needed if the level of consciousness is very low, or if there is evidence of <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>. If there are signs of raised intracranial pressure, measures to monitor the pressure may be taken; this would allow the optimization of the <a href="cerebral%20perfusion%20pressure">cerebral perfusion pressure</a> and various treatments to decrease the intracranial pressure with medication (e.g. <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a>). Seizures are treated with <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s. Hydrocephalus (obstructed flow of CSF) may require insertion of a temporary or long-term drainage device, such as a <a href="cerebral%20shunt">cerebral shunt</a>. The osmotic therapy, <a href="glycerol">glycerol</a>, has an unclear effect on mortality but may decrease hearing problems.

<a href="Empiric%20antibiotics">Empiric antibiotics</a> (treatment without exact diagnosis) should be started immediately, even before the results of the lumbar puncture and CSF analysis are known. The choice of initial treatment depends largely on the kind of bacteria that cause meningitis in a particular place and population. For instance, in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> <a href="empirical%20treatment">empirical treatment</a> consists of a third-generation <a href="cefalosporin">cefalosporin</a> such as <a href="cefotaxime">cefotaxime</a> or <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a>. In the US, where resistance to cefalosporins is increasingly found in streptococci, addition of <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a> to the initial treatment is recommended. <a href="Chloramphenicol">Chloramphenicol</a>, either alone or in combination with <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a>, however, appears to work equally well.

Empirical therapy may be chosen on the basis of the person's age, whether the infection was preceded by a <a href="head%20injury">head injury</a>, whether the person has undergone recent <a href="neurosurgery">neurosurgery</a> and whether or not a cerebral shunt is present. In young children and those over 50 years of age, as well as those who are immunocompromised, the addition of <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a> is recommended to cover "<a href="Listeria%20monocytogenes">Listeria monocytogenes</a>". Once the Gram stain results become available, and the broad type of bacterial cause is known, it may be possible to change the antibiotics to those likely to deal with the presumed group of pathogens. The results of the CSF <a href="microbiological%20culture">culture</a> generally take longer to become available (24–48 hours). Once they do, empiric therapy may be switched to specific antibiotic therapy targeted to the specific causative organism and its sensitivities to antibiotics. For an antibiotic to be effective in meningitis it must not only be active against the pathogenic bacterium but also reach the meninges in adequate quantities; some antibiotics have inadequate penetrance and therefore have little use in meningitis. Most of the antibiotics used in meningitis have not been tested directly on people with meningitis in <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s. Rather, the relevant knowledge has mostly derived from laboratory studies in <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s. Tuberculous meningitis requires prolonged treatment with antibiotics. While tuberculosis of the lungs is typically treated for six months, those with tuberculous meningitis are typically treated for a year or longer.

Additional treatment with <a href="corticosteroids">corticosteroids</a> (usually <a href="dexamethasone">dexamethasone</a>) has shown some benefits, such as a reduction of <a href="hearing%20loss">hearing loss</a>, and better short term neurological outcomes in adolescents and adults from <a href="World%20Bank%20high-income%20economy">high-income countries</a> with low rates of HIV. Some research has found reduced rates of death while other research has not. They also appear to be beneficial in those with tuberculosis meningitis, at least in those who are HIV negative.

Professional guidelines therefore recommend the commencement of dexamethasone or a similar corticosteroid just before the first dose of antibiotics is given, and continued for four days. Given that most of the benefit of the treatment is confined to those with pneumococcal meningitis, some guidelines suggest that dexamethasone be discontinued if another cause for meningitis is identified. The likely mechanism is suppression of overactive inflammation.

Additional treatment with corticosteroids have a different role in children than in adults. Though the benefit of corticosteroids has been demonstrated in adults as well as in children from high-income countries, their use in children from <a href="Poverty">low-income</a> countries is not supported by the evidence; the reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Even in high-income countries, the benefit of corticosteroids is only seen when they are given prior to the first dose of antibiotics, and is greatest in cases of "H. influenzae" meningitis, the incidence of which has decreased dramatically since the introduction of the <a href="Hib%20vaccine">Hib vaccine</a>. Thus, corticosteroids are recommended in the treatment of pediatric meningitis if the cause is "H. influenzae", and only if given prior to the first dose of antibiotics; other uses are controversial.

<a href="Viral%20meningitis">Viral meningitis</a> typically only requires supportive therapy; most viruses responsible for causing meningitis are not amenable to specific treatment. Viral meningitis tends to run a more benign course than bacterial meningitis. <a href="Herpes%20simplex%20virus">Herpes simplex virus</a> and <a href="varicella%20zoster%20virus">varicella zoster virus</a> may respond to treatment with antiviral drugs such as <a href="aciclovir">aciclovir</a>, but there are no clinical trials that have specifically addressed whether this treatment is effective. Mild cases of viral meningitis can be treated at home with conservative measures such as fluid, bedrest, and analgesics.

Fungal meningitis, such as <a href="cryptococcal%20meningitis">cryptococcal meningitis</a>, is treated with long courses of high dose <a href="Antifungal%20drug">antifungals</a>, such as <a href="amphotericin%20B">amphotericin B</a> and <a href="flucytosine">flucytosine</a>. Raised intracranial pressure is common in fungal meningitis, and frequent (ideally daily) lumbar punctures to relieve the pressure are recommended, or alternatively a lumbar drain.

Untreated, bacterial meningitis is almost always fatal. Viral meningitis, in contrast, tends to resolve spontaneously and is rarely fatal. With treatment, <a href="Mortality%20rate">mortality</a> (risk of death) from bacterial meningitis depends on the age of the person and the underlying cause. Of newborns, 20–30% may die from an episode of bacterial meningitis. This risk is much lower in older children, whose mortality is about 2%, but rises again to about 19–37% in adults. 

Risk of death is predicted by various factors apart from age, such as the pathogen and the time it takes for the pathogen to be cleared from the cerebrospinal fluid, the severity of the generalized illness, a decreased level of consciousness or an abnormally low count of white blood cells in the CSF. Meningitis caused by "H. influenzae" and meningococci has a better prognosis than cases caused by group B streptococci, coliforms and "S. pneumonia". In adults, too, meningococcal meningitis has a lower mortality (3–7%) than pneumococcal disease.

In children there are several potential disabilities which may result from damage to the nervous system, including <a href="sensorineural%20hearing%20loss">sensorineural hearing loss</a>, <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, <a href="Learning%20disability">learning</a> and behavioral difficulties, as well as decreased intelligence. These occur in about 15% of survivors. Some of the hearing loss may be reversible. In adults, 66% of all cases emerge without disability. The main problems are <a href="deafness">deafness</a> (in 14%) and <a href="Developmental%20disability">cognitive impairment</a> (in 10%).

Tuberculous meningitis in children continues to be associated with a significant risk of death even with treatment (19%), and a significant proportion of the surviving children have ongoing neurological problems. Just over a third of all cases survives with no problems.

Although meningitis is a <a href="notifiable%20disease">notifiable disease</a> in many countries, the exact <a href="incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> rate is unknown. In 2013 meningitis resulted in 303,000 deaths – down from 464,000 deaths in 1990. In 2010 it was estimated that meningitis resulted in 420,000 deaths, excluding <a href="cryptococcal%20meningitis">cryptococcal meningitis</a>.

Bacterial meningitis occurs in about 3 people per 100,000 annually in <a href="Western%20world">Western countries</a>. Population-wide studies have shown that viral meningitis is more common, at 10.9 per 100,000, and occurs more often in the summer. In Brazil, the rate of bacterial meningitis is higher, at 45.8 per 100,000 annually. <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a> has been plagued by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis for over a century, leading to it being labeled the "meningitis belt". Epidemics typically occur in the dry season (December to June), and an epidemic wave can last two to three years, dying out during the intervening rainy seasons. Attack rates of 100–800 cases per 100,000 are encountered in this area, which is poorly served by <a href="Health%20care">medical care</a>. These cases are predominantly caused by meningococci. The largest epidemic ever recorded in history swept across the entire region in 1996–1997, causing over 250,000 cases and 25,000 deaths.

Meningococcal disease occurs in epidemics in areas where many people live together for the first time, such as army barracks during mobilization, college campuses and the annual <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a> pilgrimage. Although the pattern of epidemic cycles in Africa is not well understood, several factors have been associated with the development of epidemics in the meningitis belt. They include: medical conditions (immunological susceptibility of the population), demographic conditions (travel and large population displacements), socioeconomic conditions (overcrowding and poor living conditions), climatic conditions (drought and dust storms), and concurrent infections (acute respiratory infections).

There are significant differences in the local distribution of causes for bacterial meningitis. For instance, while "N. meningitides" groups B and C cause most disease episodes in Europe, group A is found in Asia and continues to predominate in Africa, where it causes most of the major epidemics in the meningitis belt, accounting for about 80% to 85% of documented meningococcal meningitis cases.

Some suggest that <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> may have realized the existence of meningitis, and it seems that <a href="meningism">meningism</a> was known to pre-Renaissance physicians such as <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>. The description of tuberculous meningitis, then called "<a href="dropsy">dropsy</a> in the brain", is often attributed to Edinburgh physician <a href="Robert%20Whytt">Sir Robert Whytt</a> in a posthumous report that appeared in 1768, although the link with tuberculosis and its pathogen was not made until the next century.

It appears that epidemic meningitis is a relatively recent phenomenon. The first recorded major outbreak occurred in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a> in 1805. Several other epidemics in Europe and the United States were described shortly afterward, and the first report of an epidemic in Africa appeared in 1840. African epidemics became much more common in the 20th century, starting with a major epidemic sweeping <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a> in 1905–1908.

The first report of bacterial infection underlying meningitis was by the Austrian bacteriologist <a href="Anton%20Weichselbaum">Anton Weichselbaum</a>, who in 1887 described the "meningococcus". Mortality from meningitis was very high (over 90%) in early reports. In 1906, <a href="antiserum">antiserum</a> was produced in horses; this was developed further by the American scientist <a href="Simon%20Flexner">Simon Flexner</a> and markedly decreased mortality from meningococcal disease. In 1944, <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> was first reported to be effective in meningitis. The introduction in the late 20th century of "<a href="Haemophilus">Haemophilus</a>" vaccines led to a marked fall in cases of meningitis associated with this pathogen, and in 2002, evidence emerged that treatment with steroids could improve the prognosis of bacterial meningitis. World Meningitis Day is celebrated on 24 April each year.

Landing at Nadzab

The Landing at Nadzab was an <a href="airborne%20forces">airborne landing</a> on 5 September 1943 during the <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in conjunction with the <a href="landing%20at%20Lae">landing at Lae</a>. The Nadzab action began with a parachute drop at <a href="Lae%20Nadzab%20Airport">Lae Nadzab Airport</a>, combined with an overland force.

The parachute drop was carried out by the US Army's <a href="503rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment</a> and elements of the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>'s <a href="2/4th%20Field%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2/4th Field Regiment</a> into <a href="Nadzab">Nadzab</a>, <a href="Territory%20of%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> in the <a href="Markham%20Valley">Markham Valley</a>, observed by <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, circling overhead in a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17</a>. The Australian <a href="2/2nd%20Pioneer%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Pioneer Battalion</a>, 2/6th Field Company, and B Company, <a href="Papuan%20Infantry%20Battalion">Papuan Infantry Battalion</a> reached Nadzab after an overland and river trek that same day and began preparing the airfield. The first transport aircraft landed the next morning, but bad weather delayed the Allied build up. Over the next days, the <a href="25th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">25th Infantry Brigade</a> of the Australian <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> gradually arrived. An air crash at <a href="Port%20Moresby%20Airfield%20Complex%23Jackson%20Airfield%20%287%20Mile%20Drome%29">Jackson's Field</a> ultimately caused half the Allied casualties of the battle.

Once assembled at Nadzab, the 25th Infantry Brigade commenced its advance on Lae. On 11 September, it engaged the Japanese soldiers at Jensen's Plantation. After defeating them, it engaged and defeated a larger Japanese force at Heath's Plantation. During this skirmish, Private <a href="Richard%20Kelliher">Richard Kelliher</a> won the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, Australia's highest award for <a href="courage">gallantry</a>. The Japanese Army elected not to fight for Lae, preferring instead to withdraw over the <a href="Saruwaged%20Range">Saruwaged Range</a>. This proved to be a gruelling test of endurance for the Japanese soldiers who had to struggle over the rugged mountains; in the end, the Japanese Army managed to withdraw its forces from <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a> and <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, though with extensive losses from exposure and starvation during the retreat. Troops of the 25th Infantry Brigade reached Lae shortly before those of the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a> that had been advancing on Lae from the opposite direction.

The development of Nadzab was delayed by the need to upgrade the Markham Valley Road. After strenuous efforts in the face of wet weather, the road was opened on 15 December. Nadzab then became the major Allied air base in New Guinea.

In July 1942, the United States <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> approved a series of operations against the Japanese bastion at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a>, which blocked any Allied advance along the northern coast of <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> toward the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> or north toward the main Japanese naval base at <a href="Chuuk%20Lagoon">Truk</a>. In keeping with the overall Allied <a href="grand%20strategy">grand strategy</a> of defeating <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> first, the immediate aim of these operations was not the defeat of Japan but merely the reduction of the threat posed by Japanese aircraft and warships based at Rabaul to air and sea communications between the United States and Australia.

By agreement among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific theatre</a> was divided into two separate commands, each with its own <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a>. The <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a>, which included Australia, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> came under <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> as <a href="Commander-in-chief">supreme commander</a>. Most of the remainder, known as the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Areas%20%28command%29">Pacific Ocean Areas</a>, came under <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Admiral</a> <a href="Chester%20W.%20Nimitz">Chester W. Nimitz</a>. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to be made on the basis of compromise, cooperation and consensus.

Rabaul fell within MacArthur's area, but the initial operations in the southern <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> came under Nimitz. The Japanese reaction to Task One, the seizure of the southern part of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, was more violent than anticipated and some months passed before the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> was brought to a successful conclusion. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's forces fought off a series of Japanese offensives in <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papua</a> in the <a href="Kokoda%20Track%20campaign">Kokoda Track campaign</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Milne%20Bay">Battle of Milne Bay</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wau">Battle of Wau</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>.

Following these victories, the initiative in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a> passed to the Allies and General Douglas MacArthur pressed ahead with his plans for Task Two. At the Pacific Military Conference in Washington, D.C. in March 1943, the plans were reviewed by the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. The chiefs were unable to supply all the requested resources, so the plans had to be scaled back, with the capture of Rabaul postponed to 1944. On 6 May 1943, MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> issued "Warning Instruction No. 2", officially informing subordinate commands of the plan, which divided the Task Two operations on the <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> axis into three parts:
The second part was assigned to <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>'s <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a>. As a result, "It became obvious that any military offensive in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>, just as during the bitter campaigns of 1942."

The Japanese maintained separate army and navy headquarters at Rabaul which cooperated with each other but were responsible to different higher authorities. Naval forces came under the <a href="Southeast%20Area%20Fleet">Southeast Area Fleet</a>, commanded by <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Jinichi%20Kusaka">Jinichi Kusaka</a>. Army forces came under <a href="General%20officer">General</a> <a href="Hitoshi%20Imamura">Hitoshi Imamura</a>'s <a href="Japanese%20Eighth%20Area%20Army">Eighth Area Army</a>, consisting of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Seventeenth Army</a> in the Solomon Islands, <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="Hataz%C5%8D%20Adachi">Hatazō Adachi</a>'s <a href="Eighteenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">Eighteenth Army</a> in New Guinea, and the <a href="6th%20Air%20Division%20%28Japan%29">6th Air Division</a>, based at Rabaul. As a result of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bismarck%20Sea">Battle of the Bismarck Sea</a>, the Japanese decided not send any more convoys to Lae, but to land troops at <a href="Hansa%20Bay">Hansa Bay</a> and <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a> and move them forward to Lae by <a href="barge">barge</a> or <a href="submarine">submarine</a>. In the long run they hoped to complete a road over the <a href="Finisterre%20Range">Finisterre Range</a> and thence to Lae through the <a href="Ramu">Ramu</a> and <a href="Markham%20Valley">Markham Valley</a>s.

Imamura ordered Adachi to capture the Allied bases at <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a>, <a href="Bena%20Bena">Bena Bena</a> and <a href="Mount%20Hagen">Mount Hagen</a>. To support these operations, <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> transferred the <a href="7th%20Air%20Division%20%28Japan%29">7th Air Division</a> to New Guinea. On 27 July 1943, Lieutenant General <a href="Kumaichi%20Teramoto">Kumaichi Teramoto</a>'s Fourth Air Army was assigned to Imamura's command to control the 6th and 7th Air Divisions, the 14th Air Brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons. By June, Adachi had three divisions in New Guinea; the <a href="41st%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">41st Division</a> at <a href="Wewak">Wewak</a> and the <a href="20th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">20th Division</a> around <a href="Madang">Madang</a>, both recently arrived from <a href="Palau">Palau</a>, and the <a href="51st%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">51st Division</a> in the Salamaua area, a total of about 80,000 men. Of these only the 51st Division was in contact with the enemy. Like Blamey, Adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to bring his troops into battle.

The <a href="Markham%20River">Markham River</a> originates in the <a href="Finisterre%20Range">Finisterre Range</a> and flows for , emptying into the <a href="Huon%20Gulf">Huon Gulf</a> near <a href="Lae">Lae</a>. The <a href="Markham%20Valley">Markham Valley</a>, which rises to an elevation of , runs between the Finisterre Range to the north and the <a href="Bismarck%20Range">Bismarck Range</a> to the south and varies from wide. The valley floor is largely composed of gravel and is generally infertile. Half of its area was covered by dense <a href="Themeda%20triandra">kangaroo grass</a> high, but in parts where there had been a build-up of <a href="silt">silt</a>, <a href="Imperata%20cylindrica">Kunai grass</a> grew from high. Rainfall is around per annum. The Markham Valley was traversable by motor vehicles in the dry season, which ran from December to April, and therefore formed part of a natural highway between the Japanese bases at Lae and <a href="Madang">Madang</a>.

At Blamey's Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (Adv LHQ) in <a href="St%20Lucia%2C%20Queensland">St Lucia, Queensland</a>, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a>, headed the planning process. A model of the Lae-Salamaua area was constructed in a secure room at St Lucia, the windows were boarded up and two guards were posted on the door round the clock. On 16 May, Blamey held a conference with Berryman and <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a>, the commander of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>, around the model at which the details of the operation were discussed. Blamey's operational concept was for a <a href="double%20envelopment">double envelopment</a> of Lae, using "two of the finest divisions on the Allied side". Major General <a href="George%20Wootten">George Wootten</a>'s <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a> would land east of Lae in a shore-to-shore operation and advance on Lae. Meanwhile, Major General <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">George Alan Vasey</a>'s <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a>, in a reprise of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a> in 1942, would advance on Lae from the west by an overland route. Its primary role was to prevent reinforcement of the Japanese garrison at Lae by establishing itself in a blocking position across the Markham Valley. Its secondary task was to assist the 9th Division in the capture of Lae. The plan was generally known as Operation , although this was actually the GHQ code name for Lae itself.
Meanwhile, Major General <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>'s <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> in the <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a> area and <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Horace%20Fuller">Horace Fuller</a>'s <a href="41st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 41st Infantry Division</a> around <a href="Morobe%20Province">Morobe</a> were ordered to advance on <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a> so as to threaten it and draw Japanese forces away from Lae. The result was the arduous <a href="Salamaua-Lae%20campaign">Salamaua Campaign</a>, which was fought between June and September, and which at times looked like succeeding all too well, capturing Salamaua and forcing the Japanese back to Lae, thereby throwing Blamey's whole strategy into disarray.

The plan called for the 7th Division to move in transports to Port Moresby and in coastal shipping to the mouth of the Lakekamu River. It would travel up the river in barges to Bulldog, and in trucks over the Bulldog Road to Wau and Bulolo. From there it would march overland via the Watut and Wampit Valleys to the Markham River, cross the Markham River with the aid of <a href="paratroops">paratroops</a>, and secure an airfield site. There were a number of suitable airfield sites in the Markham Valley; Blamey selected <a href="Nadzab">Nadzab</a> as the most promising.

Vasey pronounced the plan "a dog's breakfast". There were a number of serious problems. It relied on the Bulldog Road being completed, which it was not, due to the rugged nature of the country to be traversed and shortages of equipment. Even if it was, the 7th Division would have been unlikely to make the operation target date. It had taken heavy casualties in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a> and was seriously under-strength, with many men on leave or suffering from <a href="malaria">malaria</a>. It would take time to concentrate it at its camp at <a href="Ravenshoe%2C%20Queensland">Ravenshoe, Queensland</a> on the <a href="Atherton%20Tableland">Atherton Tableland</a>. To bring it up to strength, the 1st Motor Brigade was disbanded in July to provide reinforcements. Reinforcements passed through the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at <a href="Canungra%2C%20Queensland">Canungra, Queensland</a>, where they spent a month training under conditions closely resembling those in New Guinea.

The delays in getting the overland supply route organised and the 7th Division itself ready meant that, in the initial stages of the operation at least, the 7th Division would have to be maintained by air. Vasey further proposed that the bulk of his forces avoid a tiring overland march by moving directly to Nadzab by air, which increased the importance of capturing Nadzab early. MacArthur agreed to make the 2nd Battalion, <a href="503rd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment</a> based at nearby <a href="Gordonvale%2C%20Queensland">Gordonvale, Queensland</a>, available to New Guinea Force to capture Nadzab. He further authorised the regiment to conduct training with the 7th Division and a number of exercises were conducted. Colonel Kenneth H. Kinsler, the commander of the 503rd, eager to discuss the <a href="Battle%20of%20Crete">Battle of Crete</a> with the 21st Infantry Brigade's <a href="Brigadier">Brigadier</a> <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a>, took the unusual step of parachuting into Ravenshoe. On 31 July, Vasey raised the prospect of utilising the entire regiment with Kinsler. Blamey took up the matter with MacArthur, who authorised it on 8 August. Blamey made the Australian Army transport available to ship the regiment from <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> to Port Moresby, except for the 2nd Battalion and advance party, which moved by air as originally planned.

The 7th Division was treated to a training film, "Loading the Douglas C-47", and the commander of the Advanced Echelon of Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>'s <a href="Fifth%20Air%20Force">Fifth Air Force</a>, Major General <a href="Ennis%20Whitehead">Ennis Whitehead</a>, made five <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">C-47 Dakota</a> transports available to the 7th Division each day so they could practise loading and unloading. Whitehead also made a <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a> available so Vasey could fly low over the target area on 7 August. Meanwhile, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and 2/6th Field Company practiced crossing the Laloki River with <a href="folding%20boat">folding boat</a>s. They flew to <a href="Tsili%20Tsili%20Airfield">Tsili Tsili Airfield</a> on 23 and 24 August.
To give the paratroops some artillery support, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2/4th Field Regiment proposed dropping some of its eight <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025-pounder%20Short">short 25-pounders</a> by parachute. A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected. On 30 August, Vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at <a href="Rogers%20Airfield">Rogers Airfield</a>. This turned out to be the easy part. Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August. Two were handed over for training while, as a precaution, the remaining six were sent the 2/117th Field Workshops for inspection and checking. All six were condemned, owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture. On 30 August, the gunners received orders to move out the next day, so the 2/51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns, which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun. Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight. Eight of the 2/4th Field Regiment’s Mark II 25-pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of filings in the buffer system. Vasey was less than impressed.

Vasey was concerned about the Japanese strength in the Lae area, which his staff estimated at 6,400, in addition to the 7,000 that Herring's I Corps staff estimated were in the Salamaua area. However, a more immediate danger was posed by the Japanese <a href="Fourth%20Air%20Army">Fourth Air Army</a> at Wewak. Photographs taken by Allied reconnaissance planes showed 199 Japanese aircraft on the four fields there on 13 August. On 17 August, Whitehead's heavy and medium bombers and fighters, escorted by fighters, <a href="Bombing%20of%20Wewak">bombed Wewak</a>. Taking the Japanese by surprise, they destroyed around 100 Japanese aircraft on the ground. In September, the Japanese Army air forces had at their disposal only 60 or 70 operational aircraft to oppose the Allied air forces in New Guinea, although both the 6th and 7th Air Divisions were in the area.

On the south bank of the Markham River lay Markham Point, where the Japanese maintained a force of about 200 men on commanding ground. Part of the 24th Infantry Battalion was ordered to capture the position. The attack on the morning of 4 September went wrong from the start, with two scouts being wounded by a <a href="land%20mine">land mine</a>. The force fought its way into the Japanese position but took heavy casualties and was forced to withdraw. Twelve Australians were killed and six were wounded in the attack. It was then decided to merely contain the Japanese force at Markham Point, which was subjected to <a href="Mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortar</a> fire and an <a href="airstrike">airstrike</a>.

Transport aircraft were controlled by the 54th Troop Carrier Wing, which was commanded by <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Paul H. Prentiss, with his headquarters at Port Moresby. He had two groups under his command: the <a href="374th%20Airlift%20Wing">374th Troop Carrier Group</a> at <a href="Wards%20Airfield">Ward's Field</a> and the <a href="375th%20Airlift%20Wing">375th Troop Carrier Group</a> at <a href="Girua%20Airport">Dobodura</a>, plus the <a href="65th%20Airlift%20Squadron">65th</a> and <a href="66th%20Troop%20Carrier%20Squadron">66th Troop Carrier Squadron</a>s of the <a href="403d%20Wing">403rd Troop Carrier Group</a> at <a href="Jacksons%20International%20Airport">Jackson's Field</a>. In addition, Prentiss could draw on the <a href="317th%20Airlift%20Group">317th Troop Carrier Group</a> at <a href="Archerfield%20Airport">Archerfield Airport</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">RAAF Base Townsville</a>, although it was not under his command. Postponing the operation from August to September 1943 allowed for the arrival of the <a href="433d%20Airlift%20Wing">433rd Troop Carrier Group</a> from the United States. Each squadron was equipped with 13 C-47 aircraft, and each group consisted of four squadrons, for a total of 52 aircraft per group.
The actual date was chosen by General Kenney based on the advice of his two weather-forecasting teams, one Australian and one American. Ideally, Z-Day would be clear from Port Moresby to Nadzab but foggy over New Britain, thereby preventing the Japanese air forces at Rabaul from intervening. Forecasting the weather days in advance with such precision was difficult enough in peacetime, but more so in wartime, when many of the areas from which the weather patterns developed were occupied by the enemy and data from them was consequently denied to the forecasters. When the two teams differed over the best possible date, Kenney "split the difference between the two forecasts and told General MacArthur we would be ready to go on the morning of the 4th for the amphibious movement of the 9th Division to Hopoi Beach and about nine o’clock on the morning of the 5th we would be ready to fly the 503rd Parachute Regiment to Nadzab."

Z-Day, 5 September 1943, dawned with inauspiciously bad weather. Fog and rain shrouded both the departure airfields, Jackson's and Ward's but, as the forecasters had predicted, by 0730 the fog began to dissipate. The first C-47 took off at 0820. The formation of 79 C-47s, each carrying 19 or 20 paratroops, was divided into three flights. The first, consisting of 24 C-47s from the 403rd Troop Carrier Group from Jackson's, carried 1st Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. The second, of 31 C-47s from the 375th Troop Carrier Group from Ward's, carried the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. The third, consisting of 24 C-47s of 317th Troop Carrier Group, from Jackson's, carried the 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. Each battalion had its own drop zone. The transports were escorted by 48 <a href="P-38%20Lightning">P-38 Lightning</a> fighters from the <a href="35th%20Fighter%20Wing">35th</a> and <a href="475th%20Air%20Base%20Wing">475th Fighter Group</a>s, 12 <a href="P-39%20Airacobra">P-39 Airacobra</a>s from the <a href="36th%20Fighter%20Squadron">36th Fighter Squadron</a>, <a href="8th%20Fighter%20Wing">8th Fighter Group</a> and 48 <a href="P-47%20Thunderbolt">P-47 Thunderbolt</a>s from the <a href="108th%20Air%20Refueling%20Wing">348th Fighter Group</a>.

When Kenney informed MacArthur that he planned to observe the operation from a B-17, MacArthur reminded Kenney of his orders to keep out of combat, orders that <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Kenneth%20Walker">Kenneth Walker</a> had disobeyed at the cost of his life. Kenney went over the reasons why he thought he should go, ending with "They were my kids and I was going to see them do their stuff." MacArthur replied "You’re right, George, we’ll both go. They’re my kids, too."

Three hundred and two aircraft from eight different airfields in the Moresby and Dobodura areas, made a rendezvous over Tsili Tsili at 10:07, flying through clouds, passes in the mountains, and over the top. "Not a single squadron," wrote General Kenney, "did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on the final flight down the Watut Valley, turned to the right down the Markham, and went directly to the target." Leading the formation were 48 <a href="North%20American%20B-25%20Mitchell">B-25</a>s from the <a href="38th%20Combat%20Support%20Wing">38th</a> and <a href="345th%20Bombardment%20Wing">345th Bombardment Groups</a> whose job was to "sanitise" the drop zones by dropping their loads of sixty <a href="Fragmentation%20%28weaponry%29">fragmentation</a> bombs and strafing with the eight <a href="M2%20Browning">.50-calibre machine guns</a> mounted in their noses. They were followed by seven <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">A-20s</a> of the <a href="3d%20Wing">3rd Bombardment Group (Light)</a>. Each carried four <a href="M10%20smoke%20tank">M10 smoke tank</a>s mounted under the wings. The smoke tanks were each filled with of the smoke agent FS. In two groups of two and one of three flying at at , they laid three smoke curtains adjacent to the three drop zones. The lead aircraft discharged two tanks, waited four seconds, then discharged the other two. The following aircraft went through the same procedure, creating a slight overlap to insure a continuous screen. Conditions were favourable, while the 85% <a href="humidity">humidity</a> kept the screens effective for five minutes and stopped their dispersal for ten.
Next came the C-47s, flying at at . Dropping commenced at 10:22. Each aircraft dropped all its men in ten seconds and the whole regiment was unloaded in four and a half minutes. Following the transports came five B-17s with their racks loaded with packages with parachutes, to be dropped to the paratroopers on call by panel signals as they needed them. This mobile supply unit stayed for much of the day, eventually dropping 15 tons of supplies. A group of 24 <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24</a>s and four B-17s, which left the column just before the junction of the Watut and the Markham attacked the Japanese defensive position at Heath's Plantation, about halfway between Nadzab and Lae. Five B-25 weather aircraft were used along the route and over the passes, to keep the units informed on weather to be encountered during their flights to the rendezvous. Generals MacArthur, Kenney, and Vasey observed the operation, from separate B-17s. Later, MacArthur received the <a href="Air%20Medal">Air Medal</a> for having "personally led the American paratroopers" and "skillfully directed this historic operation". During the operation, including the bombing of Heath’s, a total of of high-explosive bombs was dropped, of fragmentation bombs were dropped and 42,580 rounds of <a href=".50%20BMG">.50 calibre</a> and 5,180 rounds of <a href=".30-06%20Springfield">.30 calibre</a> ammunition were expended.

No air opposition was encountered, and only one C-47 failed to make the drop. Its cargo door blew off during the flight, damaging its elevator. It safely returned to base. Three paratroopers were killed in the drop; two fell to their deaths when their parachutes malfunctioned while another landed in a tree and then fell some to the ground. There were 33 minor injuries caused by rough landings. The three battalions met no opposition on the ground and formed up in their assembly areas. This took some time due to the tropical heat and the high grass.

Five C-47s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group carrying the gunners of the 2/4th Field Regiment took off from Ward's Airfield after the main force and landed at Tsili Tsili. After an hour on the ground, they set out for Nadzab. Most jumped from the first two aircraft. The next three aircraft dropped equipment, including the dismantled guns. The "pushers out" followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop. One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop. The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in the tall grass. Enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within two and a half hours of dropping, although to maintain surprise they did not carry out registration fire until morning. It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun. At 1515, two B-17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition. Their dropping was accurate, but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes.

Meanwhile, a force under Lieutenant Colonel J. T. Lang, consisting of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company, and detachments from the 7th Division Signals, 2/5th Field Ambulance and <a href="ANGAU">ANGAU</a>, with 760 native carriers, set out from Tsili Tsili on 2 September. Most of the force moved overland, reaching Kirkland's Crossing on 4 September, where it rendezvoused with B Company, <a href="Papuan%20Infantry%20Battalion">Papuan Infantry Battalion</a>. That night, a party of engineers and pioneers set out from Tsili Tsili in 20 small craft, sailed and paddled down the Watut and Markham Rivers to join Lang's force at Kirkland's Crossing. The small river-borne task force included 10 British 5-ton folding assault boats and Hoehn military <a href="folboat">folboat</a>s. which met up with 2/6 Independent Commandos who had reconnoitered the proposed crossing area with 8 of these folboats the day before. While neither river was deep, both were fast flowing, with <a href="shoal">shoal</a>s and hidden <a href="wikt%3Asnag">snag</a>s. Three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned. On the morning of 5 September, Lang's force was treated to the sight of the air force passing overhead. At this point, the Markham River formed three arms, separated by broad <a href="Bar%20%28river%20morphology%29">sand bars</a>. Two were fordable but the other was deep and flowing at . Using the folding boats and local timber, they constructed a <a href="pontoon%20bridge">pontoon bridge</a>, allowing the whole force to cross the river safely with all their equipment. That evening, they reached the Americans' position.

The next day they went to work on the airstrip with hand tools. Trees were felled, potholes filled in and a <a href="windsock">windsock</a> erected. Fourteen <a href="Military%20glider">glider</a>s were supposed to fly in three light <a href="tractor">tractor</a>s, three <a href="mower">mower</a>s, a wheeled <a href="Hay%20rake">rake</a> and other engineering equipment from Dobodura. Because the lack of opposition made immediate resupply non-urgent, and because he had doubts about the proficiency of the glider pilots, whom he knew had undergone only minimal training, General Blamey decided that the glider operation was not worth the risk to the glider pilots or their passengers and cancelled it, substituting instead the afternoon supply run by specially modified B-17s. Lacking mowers, the Kunai grass was cut by hand by the pioneers, sappers, paratroops and native civilians and burned, causing the destruction of some stores and equipment that had been lost in the long grass and "a swirl of black dust". By 11:00 on 6 September, the strip — which had not been used for over a year — had been extended to .

The first plane to land was an <a href="Piper%20J-3%20Cub%23World%20War%20II%20service">L-4 Piper Cub</a> at 0940 6 September, bringing with it Colonel Murray C. Woodbury, the commander of the U.S. Army's 871st Airborne Engineer Aviation Battalion. Three transports followed, nearly running down some of the throng working on the strip. Another 40 aircraft followed in the afternoon, many containing American and Australian engineers. The 871st followed the next day with its small air-portable <a href="bulldozer">bulldozer</a>s and <a href="grader">grader</a>s. They located a site for a new airstrip, which became known as No. 1, the existing one becoming No. 2. The site proved to be an excellent one; an old, dry riverbed with soil largely composed of <a href="gravel">gravel</a>. A gravel base and <a href="Marsden%20Matting">steel plank</a> was laid to accommodate the fighters based at Tsili Tsili that were in danger of bogging down when the weather deteriorated. By the end of October there were four airstrips at Nadzab, one of which was long and sealed with bitumen.
While engineers and anti-aircraft gunners arrived from Tsili Tsili, no infantry arrived from Port Moresby on 6 September because of bad flying weather over the <a href="Owen%20Stanley%20Range">Owen Stanley Range</a>, although the <a href="2/25th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/25th Infantry Battalion</a> was flown to Tsili Tsili. On 7 September, <a href="reveille">reveille</a> was sounded for the <a href="2/33rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/33rd Infantry Battalion</a> at 03:30 and the unit boarded trucks of the 158th General Transport Company that took it to marshalling areas near the airfields in preparation for the movement to Nadzab. At 04:20, B-24 Liberator 42-40682 "Pride of the Cornhuskers" of the <a href="43d%20Operations%20Group">43rd Bombardment Group</a> piloted by <a href="2nd%20Lieutenant">2nd Lieutenant</a> Howard Wood set out from Jackson's Airfield on a reconnaissance sortie to Rabaul, with a full load of of fuel and four bombs. It clipped a tree at the end of the runway, crashed into two other trees and exploded, killing all eleven crewmen on board instantly and spraying burning fuel over a large area. Five of the 158th General Transport Company's trucks containing men of the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion were hit and burst into flames. Every man in those trucks was killed or injured; 15 were killed outright, 44 died of their wounds and 92 were injured but survived. Despite the disaster, the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion flew out to Tsili Tsili as scheduled.

Due to the unpredictable weather, aircraft continued to arrive at Nadzab sporadically. Only the 2/25th Infantry Battalion and part of the 2/33rd had reached Nadzab by the morning of 8 September when Vasey ordered the commander of the 25th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier <a href="Ken%20Eather">Ken Eather</a>, to initiate the advance on Lae. That day there were 112 landings at Nadzab. On 9 September, as the advance began, the rest of the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab from Tsili Tsili, but while there were 116 landings at Nadzab, bad weather prevented the <a href="2/31st%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/31st Infantry Battalion</a> from leaving Port Moresby. Finally, on 12 September, after three non-flying days, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached Nadzab on some of the 130 landings on the two strips at Nadzab that day.

On 13 September, a platoon of the 2/25th Infantry Battalion came under very heavy fire from a concealed Japanese machine gun near Heath's Plantation that wounded a number of Australians, including Corporal W. H. (Billy) Richards, and halted the platoon's advance. Private <a href="Richard%20Kelliher">Richard Kelliher</a> suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all. He returned to his section, seized a <a href="Bren%20gun">Bren gun</a>, dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards, which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position. Kelliher was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>.

North of the main advance, a patrol from Lieutenant Colonel <a href="John%20J.%20Tolson">John J. Tolson</a>'s 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment, encountered a force of 200 Japanese crossing the Bumbu River on 15 September. The Americans engaged the Japanese force and reported inflicting heavy losses. The arrival of that day of the first units of Brigadier <a href="Ivan%20Dougherty">Ivan Dougherty</a>'s 21st Infantry Brigade at Nadzab at last allowed the paratroopers to be relieved.
By this time, the 9th Division was about East of Lae, while the 7th Division was away and "it appeared an odds-on bet that the 9th would reach Lae first". The 7th Division resumed its advance at dawn on 16 September. The last ten Japanese troops facing the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion were killed and the 2/25th Infantry Battalion passed through its position and headed for Lae. As they moved down the Markham Valley Road, they occasionally encountered sick Japanese soldiers who held the column momentarily. Brigadier Eather came up in his <a href="jeep">jeep</a> and started urging the <a href="Digger%20%28soldier%29">diggers</a> to hurry up. They were unimpressed. Eather, armed with a pistol, then acted as leading scout, with his troops following in a column of route behind him. The column entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese but aircraft of the Fifth Air Force strafed the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion and dropped parachute fragmentation bombs, wounding two men. Whitehead soon received a message sent in the clear from Vasey that read: "Only the Fifth Air Force bombers are preventing me from entering Lae." By early afternoon, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached the Lae airfield where it killed 15 Japanese soldiers and captured one. The 25th Infantry Brigade then came under fire from the 9th Division's 25-pounders, wounding one soldier. Vasey and Eather tried every available means to inform Wootten of the situation. A message eventually reached him through <a href="RAAF">RAAF</a> channels at 14:25 and the artillery was silenced.

On 8 September, Adachi ordered Nakano to abandon Salamaua and fall back on Lae. Nakano had already evacuated his hospital patients and artillery to Lae. On 11 September, his main body began to withdraw. By this time, it was clear that Blamey intended to cut off and destroy the 51st Division. After discussing the matter with <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> in Tokyo, Imamura and Adachi called off their plans to capture <a href="Bena%20Bena">Bena Bena</a> and <a href="Mount%20Hagen">Mount Hagen</a> and instructed Nakano and Shoge to move overland to the north coast of the Huon Peninsula while the <a href="20th%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">20th Division</a> moved from Madang to Finschhafen, sending one regiment down the Ramu valley to assist the 51st Division. The Salamaua garrison assembled at Lae on 14 September, and the Japanese evacuated the town over the next few days. It was a retreating band that contacted the 3rd Battalion, 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. The Japanese hurriedly altered their route before the Australians could intercept them.

Crossing the <a href="Saruwaged%20Range">Saruwaged Range</a> proved to be a gruelling test of endurance for the Japanese soldiers. They started out with ten days' rations but this was exhausted by the time they reached Mount Salawaket. The 51st Division had already abandoned most of its heavy equipment; now, many soldiers threw away their rifles. "The Sarawaged crossing", wrote Lieutenant General Kane Yoshihara, "took far longer than had been expected, and its difficulties were beyond discussion. Near the mountain summits the cold was intense and sleep was quite impossible all the cold night; they could only doze beside the fire. Squalls came, the ice spread and they advanced through snow under this tropical sky. Gradually the road they were climbing became a descending slope, but the inclination was so steep that if they missed their footing they would fall thousands and thousands of feet — and how many men lost their lives like that!"

In the end, the Japanese Army could take pride in conducting a creditable defence in the face of an impossible tactical situation. "Fortune and Nature, however, favoured a valiant defender despite the equally valiant striving of the attackers."

The 503rd Parachute Infantry lost three men killed and 33 injured in the jump. Another eight were killed and 12 wounded in action against the Japanese, and 26 were evacuated sick. The 2/5th Field Ambulance treated 55 jump casualties on 7 September. Between 5 and 19 September, the 7th Division reported 38 killed and 104 wounded, while another 138 were evacuated sick. To this must be added the 11 Americans and 59 Australians killed and 92 Australians injured in the air crash at Jackson's Airfield. Thus, 119 Allied servicemen were killed, 241 wounded or injured, and 166 evacuated sick. Japanese casualties were estimated at 2,200, but it is impossible to apportion them between the 7th and 9th Divisions.

The development of Nadzab depended on heavy construction equipment which had to be landed at Lae and moved over the Markham Valley Road. The job of improving the road was assigned to the 842nd Engineer Aviation Battalion, which arrived at Lae on 20 September but after a few days' work it was ordered to relieve the 871st Airborne Aviation Battalion at Nadzab. The 842nd reached Nadzab on 4 October but a combination of unseasonable rainfall and heavy military traffic destroyed the road surface and closed the road, forcing Nadzab to be supplied from Lae by air. The 842nd then had to resume work on the road, this time from the Nadzab end. Heavy rain was experienced on 46 of the next 60 days. The road was reopened on 15 December, allowing the 836th, 839th, 868th and 1881st Engineer Aviation Battalions and <a href="No.%2062%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 62 Works Wing RAAF</a> to move to Nadzab to work on the development of the airbase.

The airbase would eventually consist of four all-weather airfields. No 1 had a by runway surfaced with <a href="Marsden%20Matting">Marsden Matting</a> and a by runway surfaced with bitumen. No. 2 had a by runway partially surfaced with bitumen. No. 3 had a by runway surfaced with bitumen in the centre with of Marsden mat at either end. No. 4, an RAAF airfield named Newton after <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> <a href="William%20Ellis%20Newton">William Ellis Newton</a>, had two parallel by runways surfaced with bitumen. Nadzab became the Allied Air Forces' main base in New Guinea.

General Blamey declared the capture of Lae and Salamaua to be "a signal step on the road to Victory". Tolson described the 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment's operation at Nadzab as "probably the classic text-book airborne operation of World War II". Coming after the impressive but flawed performance of the airborne arm in the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>, Nadzab influenced thinking about the value of airborne operations.

However, the impact was far greater than anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had regarded the defeats in the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna%E2%80%93Gona">Battle of Buna–Gona</a> as setbacks only, and had continued to plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea">Western New Guinea</a>, the <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> and the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a>. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on as long as possible so as to delay the Allied advance.

Neil Harvey with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

<a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> was a member of <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948</a> and was undefeated in their 34 matches. This unprecedented feat by a <a href="Test%20cricket">Test</a> side touring England earned them the sobriquet "The Invincibles".

Aged 19, Harvey was the youngest player of the touring party. An attacking left-handed <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">middle-order batsman</a>, he had become the youngest Australian to score a Test <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> by compiling 153 in the Fifth Test against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> in the preceding Australian summer of 1947–48. However, Harvey struggled early on in the tour, having difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team in the first half of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with his increasing familiarity with local conditions and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> after an injury to <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>. Harvey scored 112 in a first innings counter-attack to keep Australia in contention after they had suffered a top-order collapse. Harvey hit the winning <a href="boundary%20%28cricket%29">boundary</a> in the second innings as Australia won the match with a Test world record successful run-chase of 3/404. He retained his place for the Fifth Test, ending the series with 133 runs at a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 66.50.

Overall, Harvey ended with 1,129 runs at 53.76 in the <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class matches</a> with four centuries, placing him sixth on the run-scoring aggregates and seventh in the batting averages for Australia. Harvey was an acrobatic fielder, regarded as the best in the Australian team. He was <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> in the Tests before he broke into the playing XI, and took several acclaimed catches throughout the tour, finishing with 17 catches as well as a solitary <a href="wicket">wicket</a> with his occasional <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>.

A somewhat diminutive left-handed middle-order batsman who was the second-youngest of <a href="Harvey%20brothers">six cricketing brothers</a>, Harvey made his debut in <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> for his state, <a href="Victoria%20cricket%20team">Victoria</a>, during the 1946–47 Australian season. The following year, at the age of 19, Harvey made his national debut in the Fourth Test against <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">India</a> in Australia in 1947–48 after a series of impressive performances at domestic level. In the Fifth Test at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, he hit 153 to break <a href="Archie%20Jackson">Archie Jackson</a>'s record for the youngest Australian to make a Test century. The innings ensured him a place on the 1948 "Invincibles" tour of England as the youngest member of the 17-man squad. He was more than six and a half years younger than the next youngest players of the team, <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a>. Speaking about Harvey's selection, his captain (and one of three team selectors), <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, opined: "He has the brilliance and daring of youth, and the likelihood of rapid improvement".

Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. Despite scoring a century in Australia's most recent Test, Harvey was made <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">12th man</a> and it appeared that he was not initially in Bradman's Test plans. Australia promptly crushed the hosts by an innings.

Harvey made his debut on English soil in the second tour match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>. Batting at No. 5, he came in at 3/316 and made 12, struggling against the local <a href="spin%20bowling">spinners</a>, as Australia collapsed to end on 448 before winning by an innings. Harvey played a key role in Australia's victory in the next match against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">damp pitch</a> that suited slower bowling. Harvey took two catches in the home side's first innings of 71. He made seven in the first innings as Australia replied with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 4/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory. No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat at No. 6, stand-in captain <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>—Bradman rested himself for the match—top-edged a <a href="pull%20shot">pull shot</a> and was caught to leave Australia at 5/20. To make matters worse, <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> was injured and could not bat, so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short leg</a>, who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it. Harvey then <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">swept</a> the next ball for a boundary. <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a> was out at 6/31 before Harvey and <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> steadied Australia. Harvey was reprieved on 12; he took several steps down the pitch to the bowling of <a href="Frank%20Smailes">Frank Smailes</a> and missed, but the wicketkeeper fumbled the <a href="stumping">stumping</a> opportunity. Harvey then hit the winning runs by lifting Smailes for a <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> over the sightscreen, ending unbeaten on 18 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>.

The Australians travelled to London to play <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. Harvey scored seven and struggled in contrast to the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head. His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval. The home team's captain <a href="Stuart%20Surridge">Stuart Surridge</a> lofted a drive down the ground, and Harvey ran 25 m from <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">wide long-on</a> and leapt in the air to catch the ball, which would have cleared the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being <a href="run%20out">run out</a> while batting with <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> as Australia piled on 4/414 <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> and defeated <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> by an innings in the following match.

Harvey was then rested as Australia crushed <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a> by an innings and 451 runs, its largest winning margin for the summer. During this match, the other batsmen set a world record for the most first-class runs scored in one day’s play, adding 721 on the opening day. Harvey returned for the innings victory against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, but scored only 23 as Australia amassed 431 in their only opportunity at the batting crease.

The next match was against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, and given Harvey's early struggles in English conditions and his failure to pass 25 in his first six innings, he was overlooked as Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.

After asking Bradman about the reason for his difficulties with the bat, Harvey was told that these were caused by rash shot selection and a tendency to hit the ball in the air. Bradman said "He was technically perfect in his shot production. He was batting well enough and simply getting out early." Harvey adapted his style and improved his performance. In the next match, he scored 36 and 76 not out on a turning pitch against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a> in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, putting on an unbroken century <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> with <a href="Ron%20Hamence">Ron Hamence</a> in the second innings as the match ended in a draw. Harvey was rested for the following match against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, which was also drawn.

Harvey returned in the next fixture against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> and made one as Australia were dismissed for 117 in reply to the home side's 195. It was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. However, Harvey did not get another chance with the bat as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets.

Harvey had one last chance to make his case for Test selection in the match at <a href="Hove">Hove</a> against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a>. It was the final county fixture before the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>. He came to the crease at 3/360 and put on stands of 93 and 97 with <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> and Hamence respectively to finish unbeaten on 100 in only 115 minutes. Australia declared at 5/549 when Harvey reached three figures and went on to complete an innings victory. Former Australian Test batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> described Harvey's innings as "a superb century, rich in youthful daring and stroke production". Harvey later rated it his best innings of the tour excluding the Test matches.

Up to this point, the reserve opener Brown had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 not out, and was on his third tour of England. In contrast, Harvey had totalled only 296 runs at 42.29 despite his unbeaten 100 against Sussex.

Brown thus gained selection for the First Test, batting out of position in the middle order while <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> and Morris opened, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India. This was the exact situation that had unfolded in the Worcestershire and MCC matches when Australia fielded their first-choice team; Harvey did not play and Brown batted out of position in the middle order. There was a chance of Harvey receiving a last-minute call-up when Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered.

Despite his omission, Harvey spent a large amount of the Test substituting as <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> for paceman <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>, who succumbed to a hamstring injury in the first innings. Lindwall was nevertheless able to jog between the wickets when Australia batted, without needing a <a href="runner%20%28cricket%29">runner</a>, but he did not take the field in the second innings. Fingleton said that Harvey was "by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides" and that Australia gained a substantial advantage through his presence on the ground. England captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be unable to field, but he did not formally object to the presence of Harvey. Former Australian Test cricket <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> said that Lindwall was demonstrably not "incapacitated" and that Yardley "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far". O'Reilly decried the benefit that Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far. English commentator <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world. Australia went on to defeat England by eight wickets although Brown made only 17.

Between Tests, Harvey was called in for the match against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, scoring only 14, while Brown was rested as Australia won by an innings. In the second match before the next Test, which was against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>, Harvey made 49 and 56 while Brown made 19 and 113 as an opener. Harvey hit the ball to all parts of the ground and Fingleton opined that "[Harvey] probably gained the respect of this most discerning crowd more quickly than any other cricketer in recent years". However, Brown retained his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's ahead of Harvey; Australia fielded an unchanged team. O'Reilly criticised the retention of Brown, who had appeared to be noticeably uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role. He said that despite the fact that Brown had made an unbeaten double century on his previous Test at Lord's in 1938, Loxton and Harvey had better claims to selection. Bradman’s men went on to a crushing win by 409 runs, although Brown made only 24 and 32 in the middle order.

The next match was against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and started the day after the Second Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so he was not able to bat in Australia's first innings, in which Harvey made 43 before being run out. In the second innings, Harvey caught Surrey captain <a href="Errol%20Holmes">Errol Holmes</a> from a leaping catch, snaffling the ball as it flew through a flock of pigeons. On the final day, Australia wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch the Australian <a href="John%20Bromwich">John Bromwich</a> play in the <a href="The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon">Wimbledon tennis</a> final. Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener alongside <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> and promised Bradman that he would reach the target quickly. Australia chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs. Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time for the championship-deciding match.

For the following match against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> before the Third Test, Brown did not play. Harvey came to the crease at 3/304 and put on 164 for the fourth wicket before his partner Morris was out for 294. He put on another 63 with Loxton before falling for 95. During his innings, Harvey repeatedly advanced out of the crease to attack the spinners. Loxton ended on 159 not out as Australia reached 7/774 declared, their highest score of the tour, which underpinned a dominant innings victory. Harvey and the other Australian batsmen repeatedly left their crease to charge and attack the off spin of <a href="Tom%20Goddard">Tom Goddard</a>, who ended with 0/186. Goddard had been touted as a possible England selection because the bowlers used in the first two Tests had failed to challenge the supremacy of Australia’s batsmen, but the tourists’ attack ended his prospects. Loxton's innings earned him Brown's middle-order position for the Third Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a>, which was a rain-affected draw.

During the drawn Third Test, Barnes was injured and <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> was used as a makeshift opener because Morris was the only specialist opener left in the team after the omission of Brown. In the meantime, Barnes's injury had opened up a vacancy for the Fourth Test. Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.

Despite his low score in the preceding match against Middlesex, Harvey was called into the team for the Fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> at the expense of Barnes. The selectors had overlooked Brown as a replacement for Barnes's opening position. Instead, vice-captain Hassett would move from the middle-order to accompany Morris at the top of the innings, while Harvey would slot into the middle-order.

England batted first and amassed 496. Australia began their reply on the second afternoon and Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists <a href="Shooter%20%28cricket%29">to stumps</a> at 1/63. The next morning, Hassett and Bradman fell in one <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> over to leave Australia at 3/68 with two new batsmen at the crease. Harvey came in bareheaded at No. 5 to join cavalier <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a> <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle Harvey told his senior partner "What's going on out here, eh? Let's get stuck into 'em". Harvey got off the mark by forcing the ball <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">behind point</a> for a single.

The pair launched a counterattack, with Miller taking the lead. He hoisted <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a>'s first ball over <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">square leg</a> for six. Miller shielded Harvey from Laker, as the young batsman was struggling against the <a href="off%20break">off break</a>s that were turning away from him, especially one ball that spun and bounced, beating his outside edge. Miller drilled an <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">off-drive</a> from Laker for four, and then hit another flat over his head, almost for six into the sightscreen. This allowed Australia to seize the initiative, and Harvey joined the fightback during the next <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>, hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker, the second of which almost cleared the playing area. He then took another boundary to reach 44, with Miller on 42. Miller then lifted Laker for a six over long off, and a four over long on from Yardley to reach 54. Miller <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">drove</a> the next ball <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">through cover</a> for four. Yardley responded by stacking the <a href="leg%20side">on side</a> with outfielders and <a href="leg%20theory">bowling outside leg stump</a>, challenging Miller to another hit for six. The batsman obliged, but edged the ball and was caught at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short fine leg</a> for 58. The partnership yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes, and was likened by "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>" to a "hurricane". Fingleton said that he had never "known a more enjoyable hour" of "delectable cricket". O'Reilly said that Miller and Harvey had counter-attacked with "such joyful abandon that it would have been difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to gather from their methods of going about it that they were actually retrieving a tremendously difficult situation". Arlott said that "two of the greatest innings of all Test cricket were being played" during the partnership.

At 4/189 Loxton came in to join Harvey, who continued to attack the bowling, unperturbed by Miller's demise. <a href="Ken%20Cranston">Ken Cranston</a> came on to bowl and Harvey <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">square drove and then hooked</a> to <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">deep square leg</a> for consecutive boundaries. Yardley then moved a man from fine leg to where the hook had gone; Harvey responded by <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Leg%20glance">glancing a ball</a> to the fielder's former position, collecting three more runs. Australia thus went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.

After lunch, Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled. Yardley took the <a href="cricket%20ball">new ball</a> in an attempt to trouble the batsmen with livelier bowling, but instead, Loxton began to settle in. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harvey’s knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. Loxton then dominated the scoring and brought up his 50 with a six. The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Nevertheless, it was an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match back from England's firm control. Harvey fell at 5/294, and Australia slumped to 8/355 before a counterattack by <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> saw them to 458, restricting England's lead to 38. O'Reilly said that Harvey's innings was one of "no inhibitions" and that it was "completely unspoiled by any preconceived plan to eliminate any particular shot". He added that it was "the very mirror of truth in the batting art", "delightfully untrammeled by the scourage of good advice or any other handicapping influence", and that Harvey's innings was the most pleasing he had seen since <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>'s 232 at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a> in 1938.

England then progressed to 0/129 in their second innings before Harvey intervened. On 65, <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> attempted a <a href="Pull%20shot">hook</a> from <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a>. Connecting with the middle of the bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground, but Harvey quickly ran across the ground and bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while still on the run. <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> said that it "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> [against Surrey]". O’Reilly doubted "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He added that the "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic". Later in the day, captain Yardley was caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot from Johnston.

After five minutes on the final morning, Yardley <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> at 8/365. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a <a href="road%20roller">heavy roller</a>, which would help to break up the wicket, thereby causing more uneven bounce and making the surface more likely to spin. The declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour the spin bowlers. However, Morris partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes to set up the win, although they were helped by England’s fielders, who missed several catching and stumping chances. Harvey came to the crease at 3/396 and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary.

Immediately after the Headingley Test, Harvey made 32 in a fleet-footed cameo attack against the local spinners as Australia amassed 456 and defeated <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> by an innings. In the next match against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, he came to the crease at the fall of third wicket and made nine runs before rain ended the match in the second innings. Harvey then made a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>, bowled by a big-turning <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a> from <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a> in the first innings as Australia defeated <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> by nine wickets; he was not required to bat in the second innings. Harvey was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, scoring two out of Australia's 282 in a rain-affected draw, which ended after the first day without reaching the second innings.

Although he had only scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests, Harvey was retained for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week leading up to the match had delayed the start, and Yardley’s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise, as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions. This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day, with Lindwall (6/20) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Australia had already passed England by the close of play, reaching 2/153. The next day, Harvey came to the crease at 4/243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit <a href="Jack%20Young%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Young</a> for a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Types%20of%20batting%20shots">straight-driven four and then pulled him</a> for another. Harvey then succumbed to <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a> for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a <a href="topspinner">topspinner</a> that <a href="loop%20%28cricket%29">dipped</a> more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which went in the air towards mid-off. Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal the series 4–0.

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Australia batted first against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> and Harvey made 60, including a 104-run stand with Brown before falling at 4/283, part of a collapse in which Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361. Despite stumbling with the bat, the tourists completed an innings victory. In the next match against the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England">Gentlemen of England</a>, Harvey was rested as Australia amassed 5/610 and won by an innings. He returned for the match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, putting on 187 for the second wicket with Hassett in 110 minutes. Harvey hit 14 fours and 2 sixes, both of which came in one over, in top-scoring with a "glorious" 126 as Australia compiled 5/560 declared and won by an innings and 374 runs. Harvey performed a similar feat in the following match against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a>, coming in at 3/237 and scoring 110, adding 175 in 110 minutes in conjunction with Hassett, who also made a second successive century as Australia declared at 7/522. Harvey reached his century in just 90 minutes. The match was washed out, but not before Harvey bowled for the first time during the tour and took his only first-class wicket for the season, that of <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a>. He ended with 1/15.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, Leveson-Gower’s team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> at the expense of <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>. Harvey made 23 before being bowled by <a href="Freddie%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Freddie Brown</a> as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. For the entire first-class tour, Harvey scored four centuries and aggregated 1,129 runs at 53.76.

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>. In the first match, Harvey was rested as the Australians took an innings victory. In the second match, Harvey scored four and then took 2/13 in the second innings as Australia ended their campaign with another innings victory.

At the age of 19, Harvey was the youngest player of the touring party—more than six and half years younger than all the other members of the squad. An attacking left-handed middle-order batsman, Harvey had become the youngest Australian to score a Test century, by making 153 in the Fifth Test against India in the preceding Australian summer. However, Harvey struggled early in the tour and had difficulty adapting to English conditions. After being omitted from the first-choice team in the early part of the tour, Harvey's performances improved with increasing familiarity with local conditions, and he was called into the team for the Fourth Test, where he batted at No. 5 behind Miller and in front of Loxton due to the injury to Barnes. Upon Barnes’ return for the Fifth Test, the trio were each pushed down one position.

Overall, Harvey ended with 1,129 runs at 53.76 in the first-class matches with four centuries, placing him sixth on the aggregates and seventh in the batting averages. He played the bulk of his 27 first-class innings between No. 4 and No. 6 in the batting order. Only three times did he bat elsewhere. He scored an unbeaten 73 in less than an hour in the second innings of the second match against Surrey as a makeshift opener, setting up a ten-wicket victory. He made 23 batting at No. 3 against Oxford University and one against Hampshire while batting at No. 7.

Harvey was an acrobatic fielder, regarded as the best in the Australian team. Fingleton said that Harvey was "by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides, who was to save many runs in the field". O'Reilly agreed Fingleton that Harvey was Australia's best fielder by far, Arlott went further, calling Harvey the best fielder in the world. He was twelfth man in the early Tests because of his fielding ability, before breaking into the playing XI and taking several acclaimed catches throughout the tour. He took 17 catches for the tour and claimed a solitary wicket with his occasional <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>, bowling only ten overs for the entire summer.

Sid Barnes with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948

<a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> was a key member of <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>'s famous <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948</a>. The team went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a <a href="Test%20cricket">Test side</a> touring England earned them the sobriquet "The Invincibles". A right-handed <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">opening batsman</a>, Barnes was part of Bradman's first-choice team and played in four of the five Tests—he missed one match due to injury—partnering the left-handed <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a>.

Barnes ended the <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class matches</a> with 1,354 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> at a <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> of 56.41 including three <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a>, placing him fifth in the aggregates and sixth in the averages among the Australians. Barnes found his best form in the Tests, yielding 329 runs at 82.25, ranking him third in the aggregates and second in the averages. He scored half-centuries in both innings of the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, before compiling a hard-hitting 141 in the second innings of the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, helping to set up victory in both matches. In the Third Test, Barnes was injured and hospitalised after being hit in the ribs by a <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> <a href="batting%20%28cricket%29">pull shot</a>. He returned the next day and attempted to bat, but collapsed again and had to be taken back to hospital for an extended stay, missing two weeks of cricket. After missing the Fourth Test, Barnes returned to score his third half-century for the series as Australia completed a 4–0 win with an <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings victory</a> in the Fifth Test.

Aside from his run-scoring, Barnes, who was well known for being eccentric, gained fame throughout the season for his <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielding</a> at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short leg</a>—just a few metres from the batsman—where he took 19 <a href="catch%20%28cricket%29">catches</a> for the season. Barnes stood much closer than others who fielded in the position, placing one foot on the edge of the <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitch</a>. His extreme proximity prompted questions about the legitimacy of his action and English captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> later admitted that Barnes had intimidated his batsmen.

Barnes had been a regular member of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team">Australian cricket team</a> since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and was on his second trip to England after making his Test debut there in 1938 before the war. During the 1946–47 Australian season, which saw <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> tour for five Tests, the home nation's senior opening batsman <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a> was injured. Barnes and debutant <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> had <a href="batting%20average">averaged</a> 73.83 and 71.85 respectively, playing in all five matches.

Barnes went to England in the Australian winter of 1947. In his autobiography, he claimed to have gone as a representative for an alcohol company, although appears to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply due to rationing. Once in England, he was approached by <a href="Burnley%20Cricket%20Club">Burnley</a> to play as a professional in <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a> cricket, which he did briefly before becoming disinterested and resigning. Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, as the Australian authorities frowned on those who played professionally in England. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control's</a> rule that wives were not allowed to travel with players, by being in the same overseas country.

Brown, Barnes and Morris shared the opening duties against the visiting <a href="India%20national%20cricket%20team">Indians</a>; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. With Brown recovered, the Australian selectors dropped Barnes for the first two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a>—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 <a href="run%20out">run out</a> as Australia completed a 4–0 series win. In the end, all three were selected for the England tour, though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wife—still living in Scotland—before he was confirmed. As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.

Barnes brought along half a tonne of baggage on the sea voyage to England, including a lot of food and drink, particularly alcohol, which was scarce due to the war and subject to rationing. There Barnes would sell his goods. During the journey, the players had to sign autographs on 5,000 sheets of paper with the team list. Barnes had a stamp of his signature made, and paid a young boy drinks to deal with the sheets, but he landed himself in trouble with captain <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> and manager <a href="Keith%20Johnson%20%28cricket%20administrator%29">Keith Johnson</a> when the boy stamped the sheets erratically, sometimes not adjacent to Barnes's position on the team list.

Australia traditionally fielded its strongest possible team in the tour opener, which was customarily against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>. Barnes <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">opened</a> with Morris, while reserve opener Brown batted out of position in the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">middle order</a>. The hosts won the toss and batted first, and Barnes took the last two <a href="catch%20%28cricket%29">catches</a> as Australia <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissed them</a> for 233. He delivered nine <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">overs</a> with his <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> and was the most <a href="economy%20rate">economical</a> Australian <a href="bowler%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a>, conceding ten runs without taking a <a href="Wicket%20%28dismissal%29">wicket</a>. When Australia batted, Barnes made 44 from 104 <a href="delivery%20%28cricket%29">balls</a> in 99 minutes before being the first batsman <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">to fall</a> at 1/79. Australia reached 462 and dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete a victory by an innings and 17 runs. During the second innings, Barnes took his first wicket for the tour, having <a href="Laddy%20Outschoorn">Laddy Outschoorn</a> <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23C">caught behind</a> by <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a> to spark a <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23C">collapse</a> that saw the home side <a href="Wicket%20%28dismissal%29">lose their last five wickets</a> for 47 runs. Barnes ended with 1/25 and took two catches in the second innings; all four of his catches for the match were from <a href="spin%20bowling">spinners</a>.

Morris was rested for the following match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, so Barnes partnered Brown at the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">top of the order</a>. <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">The pair put on</a> 46 before Brown fell. Barnes then put on 111 with Bradman for the second wicket before falling for 78 at 2/157 to a <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) decision the tourists regarded as a clear error. Unhindered, Australia made 448 and won by an innings. Barnes took two catches in the first innings, both from <a href="spin%20bowling">spinners</a>, and bowled four overs without success in the second innings. The Australians proceeded to play <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> at <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a>, on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">damp pitch</a> favourable to slower bowling. Bradman rested himself and Barnes as Australia came closest to losing a match for the whole tour. The tourists were 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory—effectively seven wickets down with one injured player—before scraping home to <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">win by four wickets</a>.
Barnes returned for the subsequent fixture against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, where Australia won the <a href="toss%20%28cricket%29">toss</a> and batted first. Barnes attacked immediately, and put on an <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">opening partnership</a> of 136 with Morris, before the latter fell. Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 for the second wicket before Barnes fell for 176. The tourists continued to build on the foundation laid by the top order and were eventually <a href="dismissal%20%28cricket%29">bowled out</a> for 632. Bradman’s bowlers dismissed Surrey for 141 and 195 to win by an innings after enforcing the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>. During the match, Barnes was involved in an oft-recalled incident. After a series of Australian <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeals</a> had been turned down in the match against Leicestershire by <a href="umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpire</a> <a href="Alec%20Skelding">Alec Skelding</a>, Barnes had remonstrated with him and told him he had problems with his eyesight. Barnes also complained about Skelding adjudging him lbw, saying the ball "wouldn't have hit another set of stumps" and telling the umpire to get a guide dog. A stray dog ran onto the field during the Surrey game. It caused a stoppage in play by evading the players and police for a few minutes. Eventually, Barnes used the ball to bait and trap the dog, which he then presented to Skelding stating: "You must need a dog. You're blind when you give those decisions [against Leicestershire] <a href="not%20out">not out</a>" and "Now all you want is a white stick". Skelding refused the offer, and after Barnes continued to pressure him into taking the dog, he called for an adjournment and left the playing arena. Barnes later wrote "Strange how I suggested he find himself a canine companion at 
Leicester ... and then one turned up ... Cricket's a funny game."

Barnes was rested for the following game against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>, which Australia won by an innings. In the next match against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, Barnes returned as Australia elected to bat first and went on to score a world record of 721 first-class runs in one day. Barnes opened with Brown and they laid the platform for the record-breaking total by combining for a stand of 145 before Barnes was out for 79 attempting a late cut. It was Australia's largest opening partnership on the tour to date and lasted 97 minutes. After completing their innings, the tourists proceeded to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the summer. In the first innings, Barnes fielded at point-blank range at <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">silly mid-on</a> when <a href="Ray%20Smith%20%28cricketer%29">Ray Smith</a> was batting against the bowling of <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>. Smith hit one ball past Barnes, narrowly missing his head, but the Australian vowed to continue standing in close proximity. In the next over, Smith drove a full ball from Toshack directly into Barnes's foot, who managed to hide any pain despite the ball having enough momentum to ricochet all the way to the boundary. The subsequent delivery was hit straight at Barnes's torso. Barnes reacted fast enough to get his hands on the ball, but it broke through and hit his chest before rebounding. He was able to grab the ball with one hand and Smith was out; Barnes then told the stunned batsman "I told you you wouldn't drive me away". Later, Barnes's torso and foot had to be attended to. Barnes finished off the match by <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">trapping</a> <a href="Peter%20Smith%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201908%29">Peter Smith</a> for 54 in the second innings after Australia enforced the follow on, claiming the last wicket to end a tidy spell of 1/11 from 9.4 overs. Barnes was rested for the following fixture against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, which resulted in another innings victory.

The following match was against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, it was a chance to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught <a href="John%20Deighton%20%28cricketer%29">John Deighton</a> and <a href="Jack%20Robertson%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Jack Robertson</a> and took 0/15 from four overs. During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short leg</a>, with one foot on the edge of the <a href="cricket%20pitch">cut strip</a>. According to retired Australian Test batsman <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>, himself a former fielder in the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Off%20and%20leg%20side%20fields">leg trap</a>, "[Barnes’s position] was the closest I have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29">hook</a> Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bowling aimed at his upper body</a>. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which was against the <a href="laws%20of%20cricket">laws of cricket</a>. Umpire <a href="Frank%20Chester%20%28umpire%29">Frank Chester</a>, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.

England and MCC captain <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> later admitted Barnes's close proximity throughout the season had a psychological effect on his batsmen, although the Australian did miss catches because he was too close to react to the oncoming ball.

The MCC match was followed by a draw against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20%28cricket%20ground%29">Old Trafford</a>; this was the first time the tourists had failed to win since arriving in England. Barnes made 31 in both innings after the first day was washed out; the match ended in a draw. Barnes was rested in the subsequent match against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, which saw a second consecutive draw. He returned for the next game against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>, as Australia had another scare. On a <a href="sticky%20wicket">drying pitch</a>, the hosts dismissed Australia for 117 in reply to 195; this was the first time the tourists had conceded a first innings lead on the tour. Barnes made 20. Hampshire fell for 103 in their second innings to leave Australia a target of 182, which was reached to seal an eight-wicket win, despite Barnes falling for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>. The final match before the First Test was against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> and Barnes was rested as Australia dismissed the hosts for 86 and replied with 5/549 <a href="declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> before completing another innings victory.

Having overcome food poisoning leading up to the match, Barnes was selected for the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, as were the other two openers in the squad. England elected to bat first, and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon. In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris at the top of the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an <a href="list%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">appeal against the light</a> after the first ball of the innings, which was a <a href="wide%20%28cricket%29">wide</a> by <a href="Bill%20Edrich">Bill Edrich</a>. Barnes walked down the pitch and was reported to have casually muttered to umpire <a href="Frank%20Chester%20%28umpire%29">Frank Chester</a> "Eh, the light!", which appeared to shock the official. During the previous Ashes series in Australia in 1946–47, Barnes continuously appealed against the light, forcing cricket authorities to limit the batting team to one appeal, after which only the umpire can call off play, at his own prerogative. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the <a href="cricket%20ball">new ball</a> attack of Edrich and <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> to <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23End%20of%20the%20day%27s%20play">reach stumps</a> at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on 6. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. However, Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon.

Ideal batting conditions and clear skies greeted the players on the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the <a href="crease%20%28cricket%29">crease</a>. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">drive</a> from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and <a href="handled%20the%20ball">handed it</a> to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.

Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before the latter was out for 31 after two hours of batting. Bradman came in and Yardley set a defensive field, employing <a href="leg%20theory">leg theory</a> to slow the scoring. The hosts’ captain packed the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> with fielders and ordered Bedser to bowl at <a href="Stump%20%28cricket%29%23Part%20of%20the%20wicket">leg stump</a>. Barnes reached his half-century after 135 minutes at the crease with a <a href="Pull%20shot">pull</a> for <a href="four%20%28cricket%29">four</a> from <a href="Charlie%20Barnett%20%28cricketer%29">Charlie Barnett</a>. The score progressed to 121 before Barnes <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut</a> <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> onto the thigh of <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> <a href="Godfrey%20Evans">Godfrey Evans</a>. The ball bounced away, but the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Umpire <a href="Ernest%20Cooke">Ernest Cooke</a> was unsure of whether Barnes had hit the ball into the ground before Evans took the catch, and consulted with Chester, who had been standing at point on the other side of the field, before ruling the batsman out. <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to leave Australia's total at 3/121. Australia went on to reach 509 all out on the third day, yielding a 344-run first innings lead.

With leading paceman <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a> injured, Australia’s bowling stocks were stretched and Barnes was brought on during England's second innings and as the fifth bowler to give the others some time to rest. Barnes delivered five overs and conceded 11 runs. In foggy and misty conditions, <a href="Joe%20Hardstaff%20junior">Joe Hardstaff junior</a> brought up England's 200 with a firmly-struck <a href="Pull%20shot">hook</a> that almost hit Barnes, who was standing at point-blank range at short leg and could not duck before the ball went past.

England were eventually out for 441 on the final day, leaving Australia a target of 98. Bradman’s men progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, including three boundaries, whereas Morris again lacked fluency. However, Barnes continued to score quickly, and 24 runs came from the first four overs. The tourists proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell for nine. Bradman came to the crease and fell for a duck after 12 minutes in the middle. This left Australia at 2/48; dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and rain appeared to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came; <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> joined Barnes and they took the tourists to the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes gave <a href="Jack%20Young%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Young</a> an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. Barnes tied the scores with a <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Sweep">swept</a> <a href="boundary%20%28cricket%29%23Scoring%20runs">boundary</a> and ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing the match was over. He tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and realising his mistake; Hassett proceeded to hit the winning run. Barnes ended unbeaten on 64 with 11 boundaries; he scored prolifically with his <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">square cut</a>. The next morning, he perused all of the newspapers, expecting to be heavily rebuked by analysts for reckless batting on the final day, but they instead focused on his captain's failure to score.

Between Tests, Barnes played in the match against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, which started the day after Trent Bridge. Barnes made 11 and bowled three wicketless overs as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. In the second match—a drawn fixture against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a>—before the Second Test, Barnes managed only a duck—bowled at the start of the match by a swinging <a href="yorker">yorker</a> from <a href="Ron%20Aspinall">Ron Aspinall</a>—and six.

Australia opted to field an unchanged lineup for the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, the home of cricket. Before the match, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century, and trained especially diligently in the lead-up to the Lord's fixture. He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match, and the refusal of the authorities at Lord's to allow him to practise there when he was in London a year earlier; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub. On the first morning, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, and Barnes continued his run of low scores since the First Test. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to complete a maiden. The debutant <a href="Alec%20Coxon">Alec Coxon</a> opened the bowling with Bedser and removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> at <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">short fine leg</a>. Barnes tried to knock the short delivery through <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">square leg</a> but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton, and leaving Australia at 1/3. They eventually reached 350 and bowled England out for 215 early on the third day.

The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings just after noon. On the second ball of the innings—bowled by Bedser—Barnes got off the mark to avoid his <a href="pair%20%28cricket%29">pair</a>. Coxon took the new ball at <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23E">the other end</a> and Barnes and Morris saw it off. In contrast to their English counterparts, the Australian opening pair began cautiously, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps, establishing a solid start for themselves. Keen to win his bet, Barnes was particularly determined. He survived a <a href="stumping">stumping</a> opportunity from Laker when he was 18; he came <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23D">down the pitch</a> and the ball bounced out of the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">footmarks</a> past the bat and narrowly missed the leg stump, but Evans fumbled the ball, which went away for four <a href="bye%20%28cricket%29">byes</a>, giving Barnes <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">a life</a>. Barnes took advantage of the let-off to combine with Morris for an opening stand of 122, as Yardley made frequent bowling changes in an attempt to disrupt the Australian pair. Morris stopped shuffling, while Barnes adopted a strategy of pre-emptively moving down the pitch to attack the <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> of Laker. Earlier in the tour, Barnes had often been <a href="bowled">bowled</a> or trapped <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">leg before wicket</a> (lbw) while trying to force <a href="off%20break">off break</a>s into the leg side <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23F">from the crease</a>. On this occasion, he drove Laker into the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23P">pavilion</a> for <a href="six%20%28cricket%29">six</a> and Australia reached 0/73 at the luncheon adjournment with Barnes on 25, an overall lead of 208.

After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper played and missed a few times before settling down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">covers</a>, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing his hand on his chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.

Barnes lingered for a further ten minutes on 96 before reaching his century with a <a href="Drive%20%28cricket%29">straight drive</a> from Laker. He had taken 255 minutes and hit ten fours in reaching triple figures. Having registered his century and fulfilled his bet, Barnes became particularly aggressive. He stepped out of his ground to attack Laker, but missed, as did Evans, who was unable to stop the ball as it spun down the leg side. Barnes dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs, including two consecutive shots over the <a href="Long%20on">long on boundary</a> and two fours. Barnes was finally removed for 141, caught on the boundary by <a href="Cyril%20Washbrook">Cyril Washbrook</a> from the bowling of Yardley. He struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings and the speed of his batting had allowed Australia to reach 2/296 in 277 minutes after a 174-run partnership with Bradman. Hassett was bowled first ball, so Miller came to the crease at 3/296 to face the <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> ball. He survived a loud lbw appeal to deny Yardley his hat-trick; Australia consolidated and eventually declared at 7/460 on the fourth day.

England faced a target of 596, which would have required a world record Test run-chase—no team had successfully chased down more than 400 for victory. Early on, Washbrook <a href="Pull%20shot">pulled</a> Lindwall for a four, almost collecting Barnes in the nose in his customary short leg position. Australia bowled out the hosts for 186 to win by 409 runs and take a 2–0 lead.

The next match was against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> and started the day after the Test. After 16 days of cricket in 20 calendar days, Barnes was rested as Australia completed a 10-wicket win. Barnes returned for the following game against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>. The tourists elected to bat first and Barnes—playing many square cuts—made 44 in an opening partnership of 102 with Morris, who went on to top-score with 290. Australia reached 7/774 declared, its highest score for the tour, laying the groundwork for a victory by an innings and 363 runs. When Australia was fielding, Barnes was not at his characteristic close-range position, but spent much of the time at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29">third man or fine leg</a> near the edge of the playing arena. At times, Barnes wandered about aimlessly between various positions, but Hassett, captaining in place of the resting Bradman, did not attempt to command him.

The teams reassembled at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings in his unfamiliar position in the middle order. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and England made 363. Barnes caught his first victim for the Test series, the diminutive debutant opener <a href="George%20Emmett">George Emmett</a>, who was surprised by a <a href="bouncer%20%28cricket%29">rising ball</a> from <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>. Emmett took his eyes from the ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms; the ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28. Barnes dropped two catches later in the day, but neither cost Australia substantially. <a href="Jack%20Crapp">Jack Crapp</a> hit <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a> to Barnes at short leg, who failed to hold the catch. However, Crapp did not capitalise and was out soon after. During the same middle session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unable to complete the reflex catch. However, Yardley was dismissed shortly after for 22. Tail-ender <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> came to the crease on the second morning and pulled a ball from <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> into the left ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, almost on the edge of the cut strip. According to Fingleton, Barnes "dropped like a fallen tree", and a minority of spectators loudly celebrated the injury. Briefly paralysed on his left side, he had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.

Australia came out to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one specialist opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes came out to bat upon <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>'s dismissal at 4/135, even though he had collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had told all rounder <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.

He made a painful single in 25 minutes of batting before it became too much. The bruising severely restricted his mobility and breathing, and he turned down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had come in at the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run. Barnes was taken from the ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days. He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell for single figures in the second innings. After the Test, Barnes—still injured—missed the ten-wicket victory over <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> at Lord's. The match was Australia's only fixture between Tests.

The teams headed to <a href="Headingley%20Stadium%23Headingley%20Carnegie%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> for the Fourth Test, with Barnes still unfit. Australia made two changes for the match. <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> came in for Barnes, while <a href="Ron%20Saggers">Ron Saggers</a> replaced <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a>—who had a finger injury—behind the stumps. "Wisden" commented that the England batsmen welcomed the freedom brought by the absence of Barnes from the forward short leg position. Brown was not recalled to open; instead, Hassett was promoted to the top of the order to partner Morris, while the teenager Harvey slotted into the middle-order. Hassett struggled, making 13 and 17, but Australia nevertheless completed a world record Test run-chase of 3/404 to seal the series with a seven-wicket win.

Barnes returned from injury after two and a half weeks on the sidelines immediately after the Fourth Test. He made 24 as Australia amassed 456 and defeated <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> by an innings. He delivered 14 overs in the second innings, taking 0/6, the most economical figures in the match apart from one bowler who bowled a solitary <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23M">maiden</a>. When Australia fielded, a point of interest for onlookers was where Barnes would field; he stayed at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29">mid-wicket</a>, well clear of the batsman. Barnes made 31 in the next game against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. After being given out lbw to <a href="Allan%20Watkins">Allan Watkins</a>, he walked off visibly showing his displeasure at the umpiring decision, believing the ball would have missed leg stump. The hosts fell for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.

Barnes was rested as Bradman’s men defeated <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> by nine wickets. He returned as the tourists faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on tour. Barnes top-scored in the first innings with 67, putting on an opening stand of 123 with Morris as Australia made 321. He continued his productivity with 90 in the second innings, adding 161 for the second-wicket with Bradman. The home side managed to hang on for a draw, seven wickets down in their second innings. Barnes was then rested for the non-first-class match against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Australia made 282 and had the hosts at 5/73 in reply when rain washed out the match after the first day.

Australia headed south to <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> for the Fifth Test. Barnes resumed his opening position, while Hassett returned to his customary position in the middle order. England won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>'s 6/20, Australia skittled England for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon.

In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the overcast skies cleared and the sun came out. Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves, taking less than an hour to push the Australians into the lead. O’Reilly felt the Australian openers wanted to prove "the pitch itself had nothing whatever to do with the English batting debacle". The only chance came when Barnes powerfully square cut Bedser low to point, where Young spilled the catch. When Young came on to bowl, his finger spin was expected to trouble the batsmen on a rain-affected surface, but he delivered little variation in pace and trajectory and Barnes in particular hit him repeatedly through the off side field. Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. They took the score to 117 before Barnes was caught behind from <a href="Eric%20Hollies">Eric Hollies</a> for 61, ending a 126-minute stand. Barnes stumbled forward to a fast-turning leg break that caught his outside edge. He had overbalanced and would have been stumped if he had failed to make contact with the ball. Australia finished at 389 on the second day and bowled out the hosts for 188 in the second innings, sealing victory by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4–0 series win.

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England undefeated. Barnes was rested as Australia defeated <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> by an innings immediately after the Fifth Test. In the subsequent game against the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">Gentlemen of England</a>, Barnes made only 19 before Australia declared at 5/610 against a team with eight Test players. Barnes sent down a total of eight overs for figures of 0/28 as Australia went on to complete an innings victory. Barnes made 42 before <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">retiring ill</a> in the next match against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>. Having batted first, the tourists went on to declare at 5/560 and won by an innings and 374 runs. In the following match against the <a href="South%20of%20England%20cricket%20team">South of England</a>, Barnes made a duck. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 before rain ended the match.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson-Gower">Leveson-Gower's</a> XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their selection, Bradman fielded a full-strength team; the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Johnson’s inclusion at the expense of <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a>. The Australian bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Barnes put on 102 with Morris before the latter fell for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the pair put on 225 for the second wicket. Barnes finished with 151, including 15 fours and 4 sixes, after throwing his wicket away to Laker's bowling, and Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against <a href="Scotland%20national%20cricket%20team">Scotland</a>. Barnes made five as Australia scored 236 in the first match. He then bowled nine overs—including seven <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">maidens</a>—and conceded nine runs as Australia won by an innings. Barnes was rested for the second match, which also ended in an innings victory.

Barnes played in four of the five Tests as a right-handed opening batsman, partnering the left-handed Morris, although he batted at No. 6 in the Third Test due to his rib injury. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, Brown being the third. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, generally to rest one from the match while the other two opened. Notable exceptions occurred in the first two Tests, the opening match against Worcestershire and the warm-up match against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team and as a result, Brown played out of position in the middle order while Morris and Barnes opened. An occasional <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> bowler, Barnes delivered only 65.4 overs during the first-class matches, five of which were in Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.

Barnes ended the first-class tour with 1,354 runs at 56.41 including three centuries, placing him fifth in the aggregates and sixth in the averages among the tourists. Barnes's form peaked in the Tests, scoring 329 runs at 82.25; among the Australians he ranked third in the aggregates and second in the averages.

An eccentric and strong-willed character who was not afraid to go against convention, Barnes stationed himself as close to the bat as possible when fielding at either <a href="Cricket%20fielding%20positions">forward short-leg or silly point</a>. The tour report in the 1949 edition of "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" judged Barnes's fielding to be as important as his batting in the team’s success: 

However, Barnes received criticism for this approach, including from Fingleton, who fielded there during his playing career. A letter was published in English newspapers, questioning Bradman on whether Barnes's position was legitimate—the writer thought Barnes's close proximity yielded an unfair advantage over the batsmen. Bradman later touted Barnes as the best fieldsman he had seen in the position, while England skipper Yardley admitted Barnes had worried the home team's players. Fingleton said that if the position was unfair, then it was the umpires' duty to take action. He further said the batsmen should have tried to deter Barnes from standing so close by aiming shots at him, deeming the Australian to be "of great value in a nuisance capacity throughout the tour". After several near-misses, he was finally hit in the Third Test and missed two weeks of cricket, but he was not injured again after his resumption. Barnes took 19 catches for the season, although only one came in the Tests.

Barnes used the opportunity of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals. When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, he stayed in the capital and made deals at the London Exhibition. During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople. An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to avoid paying <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">customs duties</a> on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee. Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players. Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.

At the beginning of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.

The Board had a secret dossier documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection. The matter came to a head when a letter attributed to man named Jacob Raith was published in the paper, criticising Barnes's character, and praising the board, which prompted Barnes to sue with the intention of prising out an explanation for his omission. Cricket administrators were called to testify about the matter and more details became public. According to cricket historian <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a>, "it was effectively the Board, not Raith, in the dock".

<a href="Keith%20Johnson%20%28cricket%20administrator%29">Keith Johnson</a>, the team manager during the 1948 tour, became the centre of attention. He wrote and had always claimed that the touring party had been completely harmonious and loyal. A series of administrators came forward to say that Barnes had misbehaved on the 1948 tour, even though Johnson's official report had made no mention of any problems. There were also positive reports. <a href="Aubrey%20Oxlade">Aubrey Oxlade</a>, the chairman of the board, said that the batsman's indiscretions were "childish things" and "not serious at all". <a href="Frank%20Cush">Frank Cush</a>, another board member who had supported Barnes's inclusion, replied "none at all" when asked if there were any legitimate reasons for excluding Barnes. Selector <a href="Chappie%20Dwyer">Chappie Dwyer</a> said "I have a very high opinion of him as a cricketer ... and I have no objection to him as a man".

Johnson was called as a witness, and under questioning, a different story came out. Johnson agreed that his written report of the 1948 tour had said that the team had behaved "in a manner befitting worthy representatives of Australia" and that "on and off the field their conduct was exemplary". However, in a verbal report, Johnson said he had drawn the board's attention to various misdemeanours by Barnes during the 1948 tour that, in his opinion, were sufficiently serious to warrant the player's exclusion from future Australian Test sides. Johnson said that Barnes had shown a "general reluctance for anything savouring of authority". The misdeeds included taking pictures as the Australian team was presented to the royal family on the playing arena during the Second Test at Lord's, asking permission to travel alone in England—Barnes' family was living in Scotland at the time—and "abducting" <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> Toshack to play tennis during the match at Northamptonshire on a court "300 yards from the pavilion". Under cross-examination, Johnson said that Barnes's photography of the royal family at Lord's was the most serious incident. He admitted he had not known that Barnes had received permission to take the photos. Barnes's lawyer then established that his client had then shown the films to raise money for various charities. He further showed that Barnes had not agitated when reminded of the policy against players meeting with family members on tour. However, Johnson believed that the cumulative effect of the misdeeds "warranted omission from the team" and he saw no problem in the fact that his verbal advice to the board recommending Barnes' exclusion was at odds with the written report on the 1948 tour. Under cross-examination, Johnson admitted that "I don't always write what I think", and ended up being embarrassed by Barnes's lawyer. The case collapsed on its second day, after Barnes was issued with a public apology regarding the letter. After the libel trial, Johnson resigned from all cricket administration, while Barnes continued to be overlooked. Although the court case portrayed "an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered", it did little to alter the board's culture towards players.

Clare Stevenson

Clare Grant Stevenson, <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">AM</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a> (18 July 1903 – 22 October 1988) was the inaugural Director of the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> (WAAAF), from May 1941 to March 1946. As such, she was described in 2001 as "the most significant woman in the history of the Air Force". Formed as a branch of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in March 1941, the WAAAF was the first and largest uniformed women's service in <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">Australia during World War II</a>, numbering more than 18,000 members by late 1944 and making up over thirty per cent of RAAF ground staff.

Born and educated in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, Stevenson was an executive with the <a href="Berlei">Berlei</a> company when she was appointed Director WAAAF. Initially ranked <a href="Squadron%20Leader">squadron officer</a>, she rose to become <a href="Group%20Captain">group officer</a> by April 1942. Stevenson resumed her civilian career following her discharge from the Air Force in 1946. Long active in adult education and social welfare, she helped form aid organisations including the Carers Association of New South Wales (now Carers NSW) after retiring from Berlei in 1960. Stevenson was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> and a <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Member of the Order of Australia</a> for her services to the community and to female veterans.

Born on 18 July 1903 in <a href="Wangaratta">Wangaratta</a>, Victoria, Clare Grant Stevenson was the fifth of six children of Robert Logan Grant Stevenson and his wife Ada Pollie, née Griffiths. When Clare was four her family moved to <a href="Essendon%2C%20Victoria">Essendon</a>, where she attended <a href="Lowther%20Hall%20Anglican%20Grammar%20School">Winstow Girls' Grammar School</a> and <a href="Essendon%20High%20School">Essendon High School</a>, completing her intermediate and leaving certificates. In 1922, she entered the Faculty of Science at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, but switched to education after failing chemistry in her final year. Stevenson was a <a href="Field%20hockey">hockey</a> <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">blue</a> and was active in several campus groups, including the Students' Representative Council and the Science Club. She became President of the Committee of Melbourne University Women, and graduated in 1925 with a <a href="Diploma%20of%20Education">Diploma of Education</a>.
Stevenson began her working career with the <a href="World%20YWCA">YWCA</a> in 1926. A strong advocate for continuing education, during her first two years with the association she organised night classes for workers in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. She served as General Secretary of the <a href="Rockhampton%2C%20Queensland">Rockhampton</a>, Queensland, branch of the YWCA from 1929 to 1931. In 1932 she took up a position as a training and research officer at <a href="Berlei">Berlei</a>, and from 1935 to 1939 represented the company in London as a senior executive. Stevenson had returned to Australia and was based in Sydney, supervising Berlei's product research and the training of sales staff, at the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">outbreak of World War II</a>.

Late in 1940, Stevenson was nominated to be the first Director of the planned <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force</a> (WAAAF). Although keen to support the war effort in some capacity, she refused owing to the administrative and social obstacles she foresaw in the role; her appointment went ahead regardless on 21 May 1941. The <a href="Air%20Member%20for%20Personnel%20%28Australia%29">Air Member for Personnel</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Henry%20Wrigley">Henry Wrigley</a>, had selected Stevenson on the basis of her management background, academic qualifications and knowledge of women's organisations, and because she was not a "socialite". Despite her misgivings, Stevenson felt she had no choice but to accept the appointment, which took effect on 9 June.

Established on 25 March 1941 in response to lobbying by women wanting to serve in the war, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Navy</a>. Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June; this number would grow to around a thousand by the end of the year. For the first three months of its existence the WAAAF had been under the temporary command of Flight Officer <a href="Mary%20Bell%20%28aviator%29">Mary Bell</a>, wife of an RAAF <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> and former Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an organisation of female pilots and ground staff that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force. Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson's appointment, rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity; she later rejoined at Wrigley's request, on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than <a href="Flying%20Officer">flight officer</a>.

In her role as Director, Stevenson was responsible for training, morale and welfare of all WAAAF staff. Philosophically committed to equal opportunity regardless of gender and social background, from the outset she had to deal with discrimination by government authorities, many of whom had been against the creation of such a service. The <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>, <a href="Harold%20Thorby">Harold Thorby</a>, declared that "aviation takes women out of their natural environment, the home and the training of the family", and several senior Air Force officers, including the man later known as the "Father of the RAAF", Air Marshal <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, and the Director of Personnel Services, Group Captain <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>, also fought the proposal. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Chief Marshal <a href="Charles%20Burnett%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Sir Charles Burnett</a>, a <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> commander who appreciated how the <a href="Women%27s%20Auxiliary%20Air%20Force">Women's Auxiliary Air Force</a> (WAAF) had proved itself during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a> in 1940, supported its establishment but lost some interest after his preferred choice as Director, his daughter Sybil-Jean, a serving WAAF officer, was ruled out. The Federal government decreed that WAAAF staff would be paid two-thirds of what a male doing the equivalent trade received. They could be arbitrarily dismissed for disciplinary offences without recourse to a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>, could only enter RAAF messes by invitation, and could expect to be saluted as a courtesy, not as a rule. Author Joyce Thomson contends that such conditions made the women "uniformed civilians". Women were at first enrolled for renewable twelve-month periods rather than enlisted as permanent staff; only in 1943 did the WAAAF become part of the Permanent Air Force.

Stevenson considered housing, uniforms, and recruit training to be her first priorities after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No. 1 WAAAF Depot in <a href="Malvern%2C%20Victoria">Malvern</a>, Victoria, she was "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place". She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform. Stevenson was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing officer</a> on 1 October 1941, and <a href="Group%20Captain">group officer</a> on 1 April 1942, which was to be the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member. She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF. To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job. She was quoted in the <a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">Adelaide "Advertiser"</a> as saying, "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will come in on a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later." Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff. Colonel <a href="Sybil%20Irving">Sybil Irving</a>, the head of the <a href="Australian%20Women%27s%20Army%20Service">Australian Women's Army Service</a> (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson "did the most pertinent pioneering work" in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces. For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director "a difficult job and often a lonely one".

Early in 1943 a policy change was mooted to remove female officers from the technical musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these roles. In opposing this, Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel, Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a>, and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore <a href="John%20McCauley%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">John McCauley</a>. She told McCauley, "I contend that it is a waste of money and training to take women <a href="cipher">cipher</a> officers, women from Signals (S4) and casualty ... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job", and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions, and not simply for administration and welfare. McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, the Chief of the Air Staff. Jones backed Lukis' authority, and the latter sent what Joyce Thomson described as a "stinging rebuke" to Stevenson, who was forced to apologise. In any event, women officers continued to be employed in technical positions as the WAAAF expanded over the next two years, peaking in strength at 18,667 members in October 1944. As of July that year, women comprised thirty-one per cent of Air Force ground staff and filled sixty-one trades, all previously occupied by men. By the end of the war around 27,000 women had served in the WAAAF.

In a July 1945 performance assessment, Joe Hewitt, now an air commodore and the Air Member for Personnel, wrote that Stevenson had "displayed great keenness in the performance of her duties and considerable resourcefulness in the solution of difficult problems". She continued to lead the WAAAF following the cessation of hostilities, retiring on medical grounds on 22 March 1946. Suffering reduced muscle function in her left arm and pain on the left side of her face and neck, she was diagnosed with <a href="neuritis">brachial neuritis</a>, traced to <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a> and <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> injections received the previous May in preparation for a proposed visit to <a href="Manila">Manila</a> that never eventuated. In her last annual address to the WAAAF as its Director, Stevenson encouraged its members to make use of their service experience when they returned to civilian life:

To "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>", she contended:

Presented with a jewelled brooch as a farewell gift by her fellow officers, Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex-WAAAF member to study social work at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30 September 1946. It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF, the <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Women's Royal Australian Air Force</a> (WRAAF). WRAAF members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972, and five years later were integrated with the RAAF.

Following her discharge from the WAAAF, Stevenson resumed her career as a senior executive with Berlei, and remained with the company until her retirement in 1960. Parallel to her work at Berlei, she was a trustee of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, maintaining her links with the organisation for the next forty years. The fund administered surplus monies from wartime service canteens for the families of former soldiers. Stevenson obtained a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Education">Bachelor of Education</a> degree from the University of Melbourne in 1948. A founding patron of the Council of Ex-Servicewomen's Associations, she was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE) in the 1960 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> for her welfare work on behalf of female veterans. She helped set up the Scholarship Trust Fund for Civilian Widows' Children in 1963, and was a research officer with the New South Wales Council on the Ageing (COTA) from 1969 to 1978. In 1975, Stevenson was involved in establishing the <a href="Kings%20Cross%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kings Cross</a> Community Aid and Information Service, serving for a time as President and as a member of the Management Committee until 1987.

Stevenson founded the Carers Association of New South Wales, and became its first President, in 1980. While serving with COTA in 1974, she had prepared a report titled "Dedication" concerning the levels of assistance given to the elderly by their family and friends. This led to her forming in 1976 a subcommittee of COTA made up of <a href="Caregiver">carers</a>, from which she later created the Carers Association as an independent organisation. As President of the association, Stevenson lobbied for the establishment of a Carers Pension in New South Wales, which was legislated in 1985. She is commemorated at the Carers Association (now Carers NSW) by the Clare Stevenson Memorial Lectures.

In 1981, to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the formation of women's services in World War II, Stevenson was asked to lead the female contingent in the <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> parade in Sydney. She published "The WAAAF Book", a collection of reminiscences by former members of the service, with Honor Darling in 1984. Stevenson was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Member of the Order of Australia</a> (AM) in the 1988 <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Australia">Australia Day Honours</a> for her services to the community and her welfare work with veterans. Her hobbies included reading, classical music and, in her younger days, surfing. Unmarried, Clare Stevenson died in <a href="Mona%20Vale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mona Vale</a> on 22 October 1988, leaving her body to the University of Sydney.

Lactifluus volemus

Lactifluus volemus, formerly known as Lactarius volemus, is a species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the family <a href="Russulaceae">Russulaceae</a>. It is widely distributed in the <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a>, in <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> regions of Europe, North America and Asia as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of Central America and Asia. A <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l fungus, its <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> grow on the ground at the base of various species of trees from summer to autumn, either individually or in groups. It is valued as an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible mushroom</a>, and is sold in markets in Asia. Several other "Lactifluus" mushrooms resemble "L. volemus", such as the closely related edible species "<a href="Lactifluus%20corrugis">L. corrugis</a>", but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution, visible <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, and microscopic characteristics. "L. volemus" produces a white <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> and has roughly spherical <a href="spore">spore</a>s about 7–8 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s in diameter.

The colour of the "L. volemus" mushroom varies from <a href="apricot%20%28color%29">apricot</a> to <a href="tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a>, and the <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> may be up to 11 cm ( in) wide. The pale golden yellow <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> on the underside of the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of <a href="latex">latex</a> ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s weeping milk cap and voluminous-latex milky. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several <a href="sterol">sterol</a>s related to <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a>, some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a <a href="natural%20rubber">natural rubber</a> that has been chemically characterized. <a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> analysis suggests that "Lactifluus volemus" represents several species or <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, rather than a single <a href="taxon">taxon</a>.

The first mention of "Lactifluus volemus" in the scientific literature was in <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a>'s 1753 "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>", under the name "Agaricus lactifluus". In 1821, Swedish mycologist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> called it "Agaricus volemus" in his "<a href="Systema%20Mycologicum">Systema Mycologicum</a>". In this work he proposed a grouping of related species (called a "tribus", or tribe) within the genus "Agaricus", which he named "Galorrheus". Fries later recognised "Lactarius" as a distinct genus in his 1838 "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici", citing "Galorrheus" as a <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a>. Although Linnaeus had published the species before Fries, Fries's name is <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanctioned</a> and thus has <a href="Priority%20%28nomenclature%29">nomenclatural priority</a>. In 1871 <a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a> raised most of Fries's tribes to generic rank, and so renamed the species "Galorrheus volemus". The <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "L. volemus" var. "subrugosus" was identified by <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> in 1879, but is now classified as a separate species, "<a href="Lactifluus%20corrugis">L. corrugis</a>". In 1891, <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> moved the species into "Lactifluus", which was afterwards long considered a synonym of "Lactarius" but confirmed as a separate genus through <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a> in 2008 and subsequent taxonomical rearrangements within the family Russulaceae.

Another historical synonym is "Lactarius lactifluus", used by <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> in 1886, a renaming based on Linnaeus's "Agaricus lactifluus". "Lactarius wangii", reported by Hua-An Wen and Jian-Zhe Ying to be a new species from China in 2005, was synonymised two years later with "L. volemus".

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> ""volemus"" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "vola", meaning "the hollow of the hand", suggestive of Fries's reference to the large amount of latex "flowing enough to fill the hand". <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s for "L. volemus" include the weeping milk cap, the tawny milkcap, the orange-brown milky, the voluminous-latex milky, the lactarius orange, the fishy milkcap, and the apricot milk cap. In the <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>n mountains of the United States, the mushroom is called a "leatherback" or a "bradley". The latter name may originate from its German name "Brätling".

"Lactifluus volemus" was the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the <a href="section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Dulces" in <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Lactarius", and is currently classified in "Lactifluus" section "Lactifluus". The group around this "L. volemus" includes species with a dry cap, abundant latex, and a white or pale cream <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a>. Because the closely related "L. corrugis" has overlapping <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> characters, including similar colouration in the cap and stem, it has been difficult to reliably distinguish between the two species. The difficulty in discerning the two is exacerbated by the fact that both species have several colour forms: Japanese specimens of "L. volemus" may have a red cap, a yellow cap with a long stem, or a velvet-like surface texture; the caps of "L. corrugis" may be either red, commonly <a href="rust%20%28color%29">rust</a>-coloured. In 2005, Japanese researchers clarified the relationships between these two species and others in section "Dulces" using <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>, and by comparing differences in <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a> composition, <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, and taste. The colour variants group <a href="phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> into different <a href="clade">subclades</a>, suggesting that they might better be considered as "different species, subspecies, or varieties". A 2010 molecular study of "L. volemus" of northern Thailand found that 79 tested specimens could be divided into 18 distinct phylogenetic species; six of these were described as new species: "<a href="Lactarius%20acicularis">Lactifluus acicularis</a>", "<a href="Lactarius%20crocatus">L. crocatus</a>", "<a href="Lactarius%20distantifolius">L. distantifolius</a>", "<a href="Lactarius%20longipilus">L. longipilus</a>", "<a href="Lactarius%20pinguis">L. pinguis</a>" and "<a href="Lactarius%20vitellinus">L. vitellinus</a>".

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> of "Lactifluus volemus" has a fleshy and firm <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity: it starts off convex, with edges curved inwards, then later grows flat with a depression in the middle. With a typical diameter of 5 to 11 cm (2– in), its colour ranges from apricot to <a href="tawny%20%28color%29">tawny</a>. The cap colouration, however, is somewhat variable, as has been noted in Asian, European, and North American specimens. The <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>, whose height varies between 4 and 12 cm ( and 5 in), and which is typically between thick, has a slightly lighter colouration than the cap. It is firm, with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length. The <a href="Lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are <a href="adnation">adnate</a> to slightly <a href="decurrent">decurrent</a>, brittle, narrow, quite closely spaced and sometimes forked. Normally a pale golden yellow colour, the gills turn brown when bruised. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae, short gills that do not extend to the stem. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is whitish and firm. The mushroom smells somewhat fishy; one source suggests the odour is "like a dead <a href="shad">shad</a>, which anglers will tell you is probably the most malodorous freshwater fish". The odour is concentrated when the fruit bodies are dried. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the abundant <a href="latex">latex</a>, so plentiful that a small nick on the gills will cause it to "weep" the milky substance. The latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is whitish. The <a href="spore">spore</a>s are roughly spherical, translucent (<a href="hyaline">hyaline</a>), and typically measure 7.5–10.0 by 7.5–9.0 µm. The spore surface is <a href="wikt%3Areticulate">reticulate</a>—covered with ridges that form a complete network. The ridges are up to 0.8 µm high and have conspicuous projections up to 1.2 µm high. The spore-bearing cells of the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, are club-shaped, hyaline, four-spored, and have dimensions of 40–62 by 7.2–10.4 µm. Interspersed among the basidia are sterile cells called <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the side of a gill) are roughly spindle- to club-shaped, and measure 48–145 by 5–13 µm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) may be spindle-, club-, or awl-shaped (<a href="wikt%3Asubulate">subulate</a>), or intermediate in between these forms, and measure 27–60 by 5–7 µm. Additionally, there are cystidia present on both the surface of the cap and the stem. If a drop of <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">ferric sulphate</a> (used as a <a href="Chemical%20Tests%20used%20in%20Mushroom%20Identification%23Iron%20salts">chemical test in mushroom identification</a>) is applied to the mushroom flesh, it will immediately stain dark bluish-green.

The <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "Lactifluus volemus" var. "flavus" was described by <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> and <a href="Lexemuel%20Ray%20Hesler">Lexemuel Ray Hesler</a> in their 1979 <a href="monograph">monograph</a> of North American "Lactarius" species. This rare variety, found in the southeastern United States (ranging from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and extending west to <a href="Texas">Texas</a>), has a cap that stays yellow throughout its development. It also has slightly smaller spores than the regular variety: 6.5–9.0 by 6–8 µm. Some authors have considered the rarely collected "L. volemus" var. "oedematopus", found in central and southern Europe, to be a distinct variety distinguished from the common variety by a darker reddish-brown cap and a swollen stem. This assessment is not universally accepted, possibly because it falls within the range of morphological variation shown by the main variety. "L. volemus" var. "asiaticus" was named in 2004 based on Vietnamese specimens; associating with <a href="Khasi%20Pine">Khasi pine</a> ("Pinus khasya"), it has small, dull brown, velvety fruit bodies. In general, little taxonomical significance has been ascribed to the several varieties of "L. volemus" that have been proposed.

"Lactifluus volemus" is closely related to "L. corrugis", and generally similar in appearance. "L. corrugis" usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found. The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: "L. corrugis" has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8 µm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia. The species "<a href="Lactarius%20austrovolemus">Lactifluus austrovolemus</a>" is closely related, but has more crowded gills, while "<a href="Lactarius%20lamprocystidiatus">L. lamprocystidiatus</a>" can only be reliably distinguished from "L. volemus" by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller. Both "L. austrovolemus" and "L. lamprocystidiatus" are known only from <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. "<a href="Lactifluus%20hygrophoroides">Lactifluus hygrophoroides</a>" also resembles "L. volemus", but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.

Some species of the genus "Lactarius" are also similar: The tropical African "<a href="Lactarius%20chromospermus">Lactarius chromospermus</a>" has a superficial resemblance to "L. volemus", but the former species, in addition to its African distribution, can be identified by its cinnamon-brown spore print—unique in the <a href="Russulaceae">Russulaceae</a>. "<a href="Lactarius%20subvelutinus">Lactarius subvelutinus</a>" is also similar to "L. volemus", but lacks the fishy odour, has a dull yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, and a white latex that does not change colour.

Despite the unappealing fishy scent that develops after the mushroom is picked, "Lactifluus volemus" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> and recommended for culinary usage, though, typical of milk caps, it has a slightly granular texture that some may find unappetizing. The odor disappears during cooking. The latex only has a mild taste. The species is considered good for novice mushroom hunters to eat, and is best prepared by slow cooking to prevent it from becoming too hard; specimens that have been rehydrated after having been dried will require longer cooking times to eliminate the grainy texture. The mushroom has also been suggested for use in <a href="casserole">casserole</a>s and thick sauces. <a href="Pan%20frying">Pan frying</a> is not a recommended cooking technique, due to the large amounts of latex it exudes. "L. volemus" is one of several species of milk caps that are sold in <a href="farmer%27s%20market">rural markets</a> in <a href="Yunnan%20Province">Yunnan Province</a>, China, and it is among the most popular wild edible mushroom species collected for consumption and sale in Nepal. In their 2009 book on milk caps of North America, Bessette and colleagues consider the mushroom "the best-known and most popular edible milk mushroom" in the eastern United States. A Turkish study of the nutritional composition of the fruit bodies concluded that "L. volemus" is a good source of <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a> and <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s.

Two elderly people developed a transient pancreatitis after consuming "L. volemus" in central <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> in Turkey. Both had eaten the mushroom, which they knew as "Tirmit", many times before. The condition resolved spontaneously.

Fruit bodies contains a unique <a href="sterol">sterol</a> molecule called volemolide, a <a href="derivative%20%28chemistry%29">derivative</a> of the common fungal sterol <a href="ergosterol">ergosterol</a> that may have application in fungal <a href="chemotaxonomy">chemotaxonomy</a>. A 2001 study identified a further nine sterols, three of which were previously unknown to science. According to the authors, these types of highly <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>ated compounds—similar to sterols found in marine <a href="soft%20coral">soft coral</a> and <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s—are rare in fungi. The mushroom also contains <a href="volemitol">volemitol</a> (D-glycero-D-mannoheptitol), a seven-carbon <a href="sugar%20alcohol">sugar alcohol</a> first isolated from the species by the French scientist <a href="%C3%89mile%20Bourquelot">Émile Bourquelot</a> in 1889. Volemitol occurs as a <a href="monosaccharide">free sugar</a> in many plant and <a href="brown%20alga">brown alga</a>l species.

Due to their natural <a href="polyisoprene">polyisoprene</a> content (1.1–7.7% by <a href="Dry%20matter">dry weight</a> of fruit bodies), "L. volemus" fruit bodies can also be used to produce <a href="rubber">rubber</a>. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a> homologue of <a href="polyprenol">polyprenol</a>, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two "trans" <a href="isoprene">isoprene</a> units, a long sequence of "cis" isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> or <a href="fatty%20acid%20ester">fatty acid ester</a>. <a href="Biosynthesis">Biosynthetically</a>, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound "trans","trans"-<a href="farnesyl%20pyrophosphate">farnesyl pyrophosphate</a>, and is thought to terminate by <a href="ester">ester</a>ification of <a href="polyisoprenyl%20pyrophosphate">polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate</a>. The enzyme <a href="isopentenyl-diphosphate%20delta%20isomerase">isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase</a> has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in "L. volemus" and several other milk cap species.

Like all milk caps, "L. volemus" forms <a href="mycorrhiza">ectomycorrhizae</a>, mutually beneficial <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a> grow around the <a href="root">root</a> of the plant and between its <a href="cortex%20%28botany%29">cortical</a> cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> and <a href="deciduous">broad-leaved</a> trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in <a href="sphagnum">peat moss</a> beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.

Fruit bodies can be inhabited by species of <a href="Limoniidae">limoniid</a> flies, such as "<a href="Discobola%20marginata">Discobola marginata</a>" or "<a href="Limonia%20yakushimensis">Limonia yakushimensis</a>", as well as several species of fungi-dwelling <a href="mite">mite</a>s. The flies are hosts for the mites in a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> association known as "phoresis", whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.

"Lactifluus volemus" is found in warm <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> regions and as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. The fungus is widely distributed throughout Europe, although it is in decline in some countries, and has become rare enough in the Netherlands (and <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>) to be considered <a href="local%20extinction">locally extinct</a>. In the Americas, the northern limit of its distribution reaches southern Canada east of the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>, and the species extends south to the East Coast of the United States and Mexico, and beyond into Central America (Guatemala). It is also known from Asia, including China (<a href="Qinling%20Mountains">Qinling Mountains</a>, <a href="Guizhou%20Province">Guizhou Province</a>, and <a href="Yunnan%20Province">Yunnan Province</a>), Japan, India, Korea, Nepal, and Vietnam. Collections have also been made from the Middle East, including Iran and Turkey.

Gomphus clavatus

Gomphus clavatus, <a href="common%20name">commonly known</a> as pig's ears or the violet chanterelle, is an <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species of <a href="fungus">fungus</a> in the genus "<a href="Gomphus%20%28fungus%29">Gomphus</a>" native to Eurasia and North America. The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> is vase- or fan-shaped with wavy edges to its rim, and grows up to wide and tall. The upper surface or <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is orangish-brown to <a href="Lilac%20%28color%29">lilac</a>, while the lower <a href="basidiospore">spore</a>-bearing surface, the <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>, is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> or pores, and is a distinctive purple color. <a href="Species%20description">Described</a> by <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> in 1774, "G. clavatus" has had several name changes and many alternative scientific names, having been classified in the genus <a href="Cantharellus">Cantharellus</a> (also called chanterelles), though it is not closely related to them.

Typically found in <a href="Temperate%20coniferous%20forest">coniferous forests</a>, "G. clavatus" is <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l, and is associated with tree species in a variety of <a href="coniferous">coniferous</a> genera, particularly <a href="spruce">spruce</a>s and <a href="fir">fir</a>s. It is more common at elevations of greater than , in moist, shady areas with plenty of <a href="Plant%20litter">leaf litter</a>. Although widespread, "G. clavatus" has become rare in many parts of <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and extinct in the British Isles. It has been placed on the national <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Red Lists</a> of threatened fungi in 17 different European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats">Bern Convention</a>.

German naturalist <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> described "Elvela" (subsequently "<a href="Helvella">Helvella</a>") "purpurascens" in 1774. Austrian naturalist <a href="Franz%20Xaver%20von%20Wulfen">Franz Xaver von Wulfen</a> gave it the name "Clavaria elveloides" in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the <a href="Abies">fir</a> tree forests around <a href="Klagenfurt">Klagenfurt</a> in August and was common around <a href="H%C3%BCttenberg%2C%20Austria">Hüttenberg</a>. He recorded that poor people ate it, giving it the local name "hare's ear". In 1796, mycologist <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> <a href="species%20description">described</a> "G. clavatus" as "Merulius clavatus", noting that it grew in grassy locations in woods. He noted it was the same species that Schäffer had described. The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a>—derived from the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> word "clava" (club) and meaning "club-shaped"—refers to the shape of young fruit bodies. In his 1801 "Synopsis methodica fungorum", Persoon placed "Merulius clavatus" (recognising two <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">varieties</a>—"violaceus" and "spadiceus") in the <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Gomphus" within "Merulius".

British botanist <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> used Persoon's name, transferring the violet chanterelle to the genus "Gomphus" in 1821. As it was the first named member of the genus it became the <a href="type%20species">type species</a>. The starting date of fungal <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of Swedish naturalist <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a>, which meant the name required <a href="sanctioned%20name">sanction</a> by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. Thus the species was written as "Gomphus clavatus" (Pers.: Fr.) Gray. A 1987 revision of the <a href="International%20Code%20of%20Botanical%20Nomenclature">International Code of Botanical Nomenclature</a> set the starting date at May 1, 1753, the date of publication of the "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>", by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a>. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority. Persoon followed suit in treating "Gomphus" as a separate genus in his 1825 work "Mycologia Europaea". Here he recognized "M. clavatus" as the same species as "Clavaria truncata" described by <a href="Casimir%20Christoph%20Schmidel">Casimir Christoph Schmidel</a> in 1796, calling the taxon "Gomphus truncatus".

Fries himself declined to keep the genus separate, instead classifying "Gomphus" as a "tribus" (<a href="subgenus">subgenus</a>) within the genus "Cantharellus" in his 1821 work "<a href="Systema%20Mycologicum">Systema Mycologicum</a>", the species becoming "Cantharellus clavatus". He recognized four varieties: "violaceo-spadiceus", "carneus", "purpurascens" and "umbrinus". Swiss mycologist <a href="Louis%20Secretan">Louis Secretan</a> described three <a href="taxon">taxa</a>—"Merulius clavatus carneus", "M. clavatus violaceus" and "M. clavatus purpurascens"—in his 1833 work "Mycographie Suisse". Many of his names have been rejected for <a href="nomenclature%20codes">nomenclatural</a> purposes because Secretan had a narrow <a href="species%20concept">species concept</a>, dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a> consistently. Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum", placing it in a <a href="series%20%28botany%29">series</a>—"Deformes"—in the genus "Craterellus".
<a href="Paul%20Kummer">Paul Kummer</a> raised many of Fries' "tribi" (subgenera) to genus rank in his 1871 work "Der Führer in die Pilzkunde", classifying the violet chanterelle in the genus "<a href="Thelephora">Thelephora</a>". Jacques Emile Doassans and <a href="Narcisse%20Th%C3%A9ophile%20Patouillard">Narcisse Théophile Patouillard</a> placed it in the genus "Neurophyllum" (also spelt "Nevrophyllum") in 1886, removing it from "Cantharellus" on account of its orange spores. <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a> discarded the name in 1887 and returned "G. clavatus" to "Cantharellus". In 1891, German botanist <a href="Otto%20Kuntze">Otto Kuntze</a> published "<a href="Revisio%20generum%20plantarum">Revisio generum plantarum</a>", his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice. He coined the genus "Trombetta" to incorporate the violet chanterelle, hence giving it the name "Trombetta clavata". However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists.

<a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a> treated "Gomphus" as a section within "Cantharellus" in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the two genera. In 1966 <a href="E.%20J.%20H.%20Corner">E. J. H. Corner</a> described a small-spored variety, "G. clavatus" var. "parvispora", from specimens collected in <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>; it is not considered to have independent <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> significance.

Research in the early 2000s combining the use of <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>-based characters has resulted in a reshuffling of the species concept in "Gomphus"; as a result, "G. clavatus" is considered the only "Gomphus" species in North America. Comparison of the <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a>s of species "Gomphus brevipes" and "Gomphus truncatus" has shown them to be genetically identical to "G. clavatus", and they may be treated as <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>.

"Gomphus clavatus" is commonly known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> of the <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a>, although this vernacular name is also used for "<a href="Discina%20perlata">Discina perlata</a>". Other English <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle. Gray coined the name clubbed gomphe. In the <a href="Sherpa%20language">Sherpa language</a> of Nepal the fungus is known as "Eeshyamo" ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in a <a href="Sherpa%20people">Sherpa family</a>.

The <a href="basidiocarp">basidiocarp</a>s, or fruit bodies, of immature "Gomphus clavatus" are club-shaped and have one cap or <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">pileus</a>, but later spread out and have a so-called "merismatoid" appearance—several vase-shaped caps rising from a common stem. The fruit body is up to wide and tall, fan-shaped with wavy edges. The upper surfaces of the fruit bodies are covered with brown <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e (microscopic filaments) that form small, distinct patches towards the margin, but combine to form a continuous felt-like fine-haired area, or <a href="Trichome%23Plant%20trichomes">tomentum</a>, over the center of the cap. The color of the upper cap surface is orange-brown to violet, but fades to a lighter brown with age. The cap margins of older mushrooms can be quite ragged. The lower spore-bearing surface—the hymenium—is wrinkled, often with folds and pits, and violet to brown in color. The solid <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stem</a>, which is continuous with the cap, is wide, tall, and covered with fine hairs that become coarser (hispid) towards the base. It is often compound, with several fruit bodies arising from the basal portion. Fruit bodies may bruise reddish-brown where handled. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> can be whitish-pink to <a href="lilac%20%28color%29">lilac</a> or cinnamon-buff. Thick under the center of the cap, it thins out towards the margins. It can be crunchy, though it is softer than that of the chanterelle. The taste and odor are mild. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is yellow to orange-yellow.

The <a href="Basidiospores">spores</a> are elliptical, wrinkled or slightly warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>. They are <a href="nonamyloid">nonamyloid</a>, meaning they have a negative <a href="color%20reaction">color reaction</a> with the <a href="iodine">iodine</a> in <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>. The spore-bearing structures, the <a href="basidia">basidia</a>, are elongated or club-shaped, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (glassy or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5 μm. "G. clavatus" does not contain <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a>, the sterile cells associated with basidia in many species. <a href="Clamp%20connection">Clamp connection</a>s are present.

"<a href="Gomphus%20crassipes">Gomphus crassipes</a>", found in Spain and North America, can only be reliably distinguished from "G. clavatus" with the use of a microscope. Its basidiospores are generally longer (11–17 by 5.5–7 μm) and have a more finely wrinkled surface. "<a href="Pseudocraterellus%20pseudoclavatus">Pseudocraterellus pseudoclavatus</a>" (formerly classified in "Gomphus") is a lookalike species that grows under conifers in the central United States and westward, also differing on microscopic characters and reaction to <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>. "<a href="Turbinellus%20floccosus">Turbinellus floccosus</a>" and "<a href="Turbinellus%20kauffmanii">T. kauffmanii</a>" are of similar shape but their caps are covered in scales. The edible blue chanterelle ("<a href="Polyozellus%20multiplex">Polyozellus multiplex</a>") could be confused with "G. clavatus", but has distinctive spores.

Growing on the ground, "Gomphus clavatus" mushrooms appear singly, in clusters or clumps, or even occasionally <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s. The species is typically found in <a href="coniferous%20forest">coniferous forest</a>s, and with a preference for moist, shady areas with deep <a href="Plant%20litter">leaf litter</a>, or rotten wood debris on the ground. It is equally common in older or younger stands of trees. Fruit bodies are easily missed because their colors blend with those of the forest floor. It is more common at elevations of greater than . "Gomphus clavatus" has been reported as forming symbiotic (<a href="mycorrhizal">mycorrhizal</a>) associations with a variety of trees: "<a href="Abies%20alba">Abies alba</a>", "<a href="Abies%20cephalonica">Abies cephalonica</a>", "<a href="Abies%20firma">Abies firma</a>", "<a href="Abies%20nephrolepis">Abies nephrolepis</a>", "<a href="Abies%20religiosa">Abies religiosa</a>", "<a href="Picea">Picea</a>" species, "<a href="Pinus%20densiflora">Pinus densiflora</a>", "<a href="Pseudotsuga%20menziesii">Pseudotsuga menziesii</a>", and "<a href="Tsuga%20heterophylla">Tsuga heterophylla</a>". It is also reported with beech ("<a href="Fagus%20sylvatica">Fagus sylvatica</a>") in Europe.

In Asia, "Gomphus clavatus" has been reported from China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, and Pakistan. European countries where the fungus has been reported include Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Turkey. In North America, the fungus has been found across Canada, Mexico, and the United States, where it is abundant in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>.

In Europe, "Gomphus clavatus" appears on the national <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Red Lists</a> of threatened fungi in 17 countries and is one of 33 species of fungi proposed for international conservation under the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats">Bern Convention</a>. Due to a substantial decline in sightings, "Gomphus clavatus" became a legally protected species in Hungary on September 1, 2005. It also has legal protection in <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> and Slovenia. The species formerly occurred in the British Isles, but has not been seen since 1927 and is now regarded as extinct. The fungus faces <a href="habitat%20loss">loss</a> and degradation of its habitat; <a href="Eutrophication%23Terrestrial%20ecosystems">eutrophication</a> (increased <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s in the soil) is another potential threat. "Gomphus clavatus" was selected as the 1998 "Pilz des Jahres" ("Mushroom of the Year") by the <a href="Deutschsprachige%20Mykologische%20Gesellschaft">German Mycological Society</a>, partly to highlight its vulnerable status.

"Gomphus clavatus" is <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a>; it is rated as choice by some, while others find it tasteless. It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture that has been regarded as suiting red meat dishes. Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause <a href="gastrointestinal%20distress">gastrointestinal distress</a> in susceptible individuals. The flesh becomes bitter with age, and older specimens may be infested with insects. Insect infestation is unlikely if the weather is cool. "G. clavatus" has been used for cooking for some time—Fries included it in his 1867 book "Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar" ("Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden"). It is highly regarded by the <a href="Zapotec%20peoples">Zapotec people</a> of <a href="Ixtl%C3%A1n%20de%20Ju%C3%A1rez">Ixtlán de Juárez</a> in <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, Mexico, and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of <a href="Sagarmatha%20National%20Park">Sagarmatha National Park</a> in Nepal.

<a href="Extract">Extract</a>s prepared from "G. clavatus" fruit bodies have a high antioxidant activity, and a high concentration of <a href="phenols">phenolic</a> and <a href="flavonoid">flavonoid</a> compounds.

Myriostoma

Myriostoma is a fungal <a href="genus">genus</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Geastraceae">Geastraceae</a>. The genus is <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a>, containing the single species Myriostoma coliforme. It is an <a href="Geastrales">earthstar</a>, so named because the <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing sac's outer wall splits open into the shape of a star. The inedible fungus has a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, and has been found in Africa, Asia, North and South America, and Europe, where it grows in <a href="humus">humus</a>-rich forests or in <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s, especially on well-drained and sandy soils. A somewhat rare fungus, it appears on the <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Red Lists</a> of 12 European countries, and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for <a href="protected%20species">protection</a> under the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats">Bern Convention</a> by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi.

The <a href="Sporocarp%20%28fungi%29">fruit body</a>, initially shaped like a <a href="puffball">puffball</a>, is encased within an outer covering that splits open from the top to form rays. These rays curve down to expose an inner papery spore case, which contains the fertile <a href="spore">spore</a>-bearing tissue, the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>. The fungus is unique among the earthstars in having a spore case that is supported by multiple stalks, and is perforated by several small holes suggestive of its <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s salt-shaker earthstar and pepperpot. It is the largest of the earthstar fungi, and reaches diameters of up to . Its spherical spores have elongated warts that create a ridge-like pattern on their surface. The spores are dispersed when falling water hits the outer wall of the spore sac, creating puffs of air that force the spores through the holes.

The species was first mentioned in the scientific literature by <a href="Samuel%20Doody">Samuel Doody</a> in the second edition of <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a>'s "Synopsis methodica stirpium Britannicarum" in 1696. Doody briefly described the mushroom like so: "fungus pulverulentus, coli instar perforatus, cum volva stellata" (a powdery mushroom, perforated like a colander, with a star-shaped volva), and went on to explain that he found it in 1695 in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>.It was first <a href="species%20description">described scientifically</a> as a new species in 1776 from collections made in England by <a href="James%20Dickson%20%28botanist%29">James Dickson</a>, who named it "Lycoperdon coliforme". He found it growing in roadside banks and hedgerows among nettles in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> and <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. <a href="Nicaise%20Auguste%20Desvaux">Nicaise Auguste Desvaux</a> first defined and published the new genus "Myriostoma" in 1809, with the species renamed "Myriostoma anglicum" (an <a href="illegitimate%20name">illegitimate renaming</a>). <a href="Christian%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christian Hendrik Persoon</a> had previously placed the species in "<a href="Geastrum">Geastrum</a>" in 1801, while <a href="Samuel%20Frederick%20Gray">Samuel Frederick Gray</a> would in 1821 describe the genus "Polystoma" for it. "Myriostoma coliforme" received its current and final name when <a href="August%20Carl%20Joseph%20Corda">August Carl Joseph Corda</a> moved Dickson's name to "Myriostoma" in 1842, replacing Desvaux's name.

In North America the fungus began to be reported in the late 19th century, first from <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> by <a href="Charles%20Horton%20Peck">Charles Horton Peck</a>, and later from <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, collected by <a href="Lucien%20Underwood">Lucien Underwood</a> in 1891; both findings were reported by <a href="Andrew%20Price%20Morgan">Andrew Price Morgan</a> in April 1892. In 1897, Melville Thurston Cook also reported having collected it the year before from "Albino Beach". <a href="Curtis%20Gates%20Lloyd">Curtis Gates Lloyd</a> described "Bovistoides simplex" from a South African specimen in 1919, but in 1942, <a href="William%20Henry%20Long">William Henry Long</a> examined that specimen and concluded that it was a weathered spore sac of "M. coliforme" that had become detached from the outer star-shaped exoperidium. This conclusion was confirmed in a later study of the material.

"Myriostoma" had been <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> in the family <a href="Geastraceae">Geastraceae</a> until 1973, when British mycologist <a href="Donald%20Dring">Donald Dring</a> placed it in the Astraeaceae based on the presence of trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the <a href="peridium">peridium</a> to the central core of the fruit body) in the <a href="gleba">gleba</a>, and the absence of a true <a href="hymenium">hymenium</a>. In his 1989 <a href="monograph">monograph</a>, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that "Myriostoma" and "Geastrum" are closely related.

Czech naturalist and mycologist <a href="V%C3%A1clav%20Jan%20Stan%C4%9Bk">Václav Jan Staněk</a> proposed a <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "capillisporum" in 1958, which has been sunk back into <a href="synonym%20%28biology%29">synonymy</a> with the species. "M. coliforme" is the sole species in "Myriostoma", making the genus <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic</a>. Because the original <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> material has been lost, in 1989 Sunhede suggested that Dickson's illustration in his 1776 publication (tab. III: 4a & b) be used as the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a>.

The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words "colum", meaning "strainer", and "forma", meaning "shape"—Berkeley's <a href="common%20name">vernacular</a> name "Cullenden puff-ball" also refers to a <a href="colander">colander</a>. Gray called it the "sievelike pill-box". The generic name is from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> words , meaning "countless" and , meaning "mouth" (the source of the technical term <a href="stoma">stoma</a>). The species is commonly known as the "salt-and-pepper shaker earthstar" or simply the "pepperpot".

The <a href="sporocarp%20%28fungus%29">fruit bodies</a> start their development underground or buried in <a href="leaf%20litter">leaf debris</a>, linked to a strand of <a href="mycelium">mycelium</a> at the base. As they mature, the exoperidium (the outer tissue layer of the peridium) splits open into 7 to 14 rays which curve backward; this pushes the fruit body above the <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. Fully opened specimens can reach dimensions of from ray tip to tip. The rays are of unequal size, with tips that often roll back inward. They comprise three distinct layers of tissue. The inner pseudoparenchymatous layer (so named for the resemblance to the tightly packed cells of plant <a href="parenchyma">parenchyma</a>) is fleshy and thick when fresh, and initially pale beige but darkening to yellow or brown as it matures, often cracking and peeling off in the process. The exterior mycelial layer, often matted with fine leaf debris or dirt, usually cracks to reveal a middle fibrous layer, which is made of densely packed <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e 1–2.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> wide. The base of the fruit body is concave to vaulted in shape, and often covered with adhering dirt. The roughly spherical spore sac (endoperidium) measures in diameter, and is supported by a cluster of short columns shaped like flattened spheres. It is gray-brown in color, and minutely roughened with small, lightly interconnected warts. There are several to many evenly dispersed mouths, the <a href="ostiole">ostiole</a>s, mainly on the upper half of the endoperidium. They are roughly circular with <a href="Glossary%20of%20botanical%20terms%23fimbriate">fimbriate</a> edges. The inedible fruit bodies have no distinct taste, although dried specimens develop an odor resembling <a href="curry%20powder">curry powder</a> or <a href="bouillon%20cube">bouillon cube</a>s.

Like many earthstars, the fungus uses the force of falling raindrops to help disperse the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the <a href="spore">spore</a> sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the ostioles. This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures that start at the base of the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent at the base of the spore sac. The columellae are not connected to the ostioles, but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The <a href="capillitia">capillitia</a> (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5 μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, <a href="nonamyloid">nonamyloid</a>, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2 μm high. They measure 3.9–4.8 μm in diameter (without ornamentation), and 5.4–7.0 μm including the ornamentation.

"Myriostoma coliforme" is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size—being the largest earthstar fungus—as well as the multiple openings on its spore sack and stalk supporting the sack. Historically, it was thought that the holes might have been a result of insects. This was discussed and rejected by <a href="Thomas%20Jenkinson%20Woodward">Thomas Jenkinson Woodward</a> in 1797: It has been doubted whether these mouths might not be accidental, and formed by insects after the expansion of the plant. But this (not to mention their regularity, and that each is furrowed by its border of cilia) is clearly disproved, from the marks of the projections formed by the mouths being seen on the expanded rays, when freshly opened ... I have likewise found an abortive plant, in which the seed did not ripen; but which had numerous projecting papillae on the head, where the mouths should have been formed.

"Myriostoma" is <a href="saprobic">saprobic</a>, deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter. Fruit bodies grow grouped in well-drained or sandy soil, often in the partial shade of trees. The species occurs in deciduous forests and <a href="mixed%20forest">mixed forest</a>s, gardens, along hedges and grassy road banks, and grazed grasslands. In the Northern Hemisphere, it tends to grow on well-drained south-facing slopes, while it prefers a similar habitat on north-facing slopes in Australia. In Europe, its major habitat is <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian</a> mixed forests dominated by "<a href="Salix%20alba">Salix alba</a>" and "<a href="Populus%20alba">Populus alba</a>" along the great rivers. In <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, it has been collected at elevations above where it appears to favor the mamane ("<a href="Sophora%20chrysophylla">Sophora chrysophylla</a>") forest.

The species is widespread, being known in its natural habitat from all five continents, but is not found in abundance. "Myriostoma coliforme" is rare in Europe, where it appears on the <a href="Regional%20Red%20List">Regional Red List</a>s of 12 countries, and is one of 33 candidate species for listing in Appendix I of the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20European%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Habitats">Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats</a> (the "Bern Convention"). Although originally described from England, it was considered extinct in mainland Britain until it was found again in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> in 2006 near <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>, one of its original localities—it had been last reported in the country in 1880. The fungus is considered extinct in Switzerland. Its most northerly location is southern Sweden, although it is generally rare in northern Europe. It is similarly widespread but rarely encountered in North America, although there may be isolated localities, like <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, where it is more abundant. In Australia, where its range is limited to the central <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> coast, it may have been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> from exotic plant material.

Rampart Dam

A project proposed in 1954 by the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> to <a href="dam">dam</a> the <a href="Yukon%20River">Yukon River</a> in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> for <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric power</a> called Rampart Dam or Rampart Canyon Dam. Planned for <a href="Rampart%20Canyon">Rampart Canyon</a> (also known as Rampart Gorge) just southwest of the village of <a href="Rampart%2C%20Alaska">Rampart, Alaska</a> and about west-northwest of <a href="Fairbanks%2C%20Alaska">Fairbanks, Alaska</a>, the resulting dam would have created a lake roughly the size of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>, making it the largest man-made <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a> in the world. The plan for the dam itself called for a concrete structure high with a top length of about . The proposed power facilities would have consistently generated between 3.5 and 5 <a href="gigawatt">gigawatt</a>s of electricity, based on the flow of the river as it differs between winter and summer.

Though supported by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, the project was canceled after objections were raised. <a href="Alaska%20Natives">Native Alaskans</a> in the area protested the threatened loss of nine villages that would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the <a href="Yukon%20Flats">Yukon Flats</a>, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of <a href="waterfowl">waterfowl</a>. <a href="Fiscal%20conservatism">Fiscal conservatives</a> opposed the dam on the grounds of its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.

Because of these objections, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a> formally opposed construction of the dam in 1967, and the project was shelved. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nevertheless completed its engineering study of the project in 1971, and the final report was released to the public in 1979. In 1980, U.S. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> created the <a href="Yukon%20Flats%20National%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Yukon Flats National Wildlife Sanctuary</a>, which formally protected the area from development and disallowed any similar project.

From its headwaters in the <a href="Coast%20Mountains">Coast Mountains</a>, the Yukon River flows northwest, across the Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the <a href="Porcupine%20River">Porcupine River</a> at the settlement of <a href="Fort%20Yukon">Fort Yukon</a>. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the <a href="Tanana%20River">Tanana</a> and <a href="Koyukuk%20River">Koyukuk</a> rivers before looping south, then north into <a href="Norton%20Sound">Norton Sound</a> in the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a>.

During the river's flow through eastern Alaska, and before it intersects the Tanana River, the Yukon flows through the Central Plateau region of Alaska. During the millions of years of its flow, it has cut through ridges, forming canyons in some places near its juncture with the Tanana. One of the deepest of these canyons is known as Rampart Gorge, or Rampart Canyon. The gorge is located downstream of the village of Rampart, upstream of the village of Tanana, and immediately downstream from the mouth of Texas Creek. It is named for the nearby village of <a href="Rampart%2C%20Alaska">Rampart, Alaska</a>, a former gold-mining community now home to <a href="Subsistence%20economy">subsistence</a> fishermen.

At the proposed dam site, the river is wide and has an elevation of <a href="above%20sea%20level">above sea level</a>. On the south bank, the land rises sharply to a ridge high. North of the river, the bank rises to before ascending gradually northwest to the <a href="Ray%20Mountains">Ray Mountains</a>. Below the surface of the ground are patches of <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a>, and the area is seismically active. An earthquake measuring 6.8 on the <a href="Richter%20Scale">Richter Scale</a> struck the region in 1968, and a 5.0 earthquake hit the area in 2003. Geologically, <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a> predominates, and <a href="quartz">quartz</a> can be seen in places.

Hydrologically, the portion of the river upstream of the proposed dam drains about . On average, the Yukon flows at a rate of through the canyon, with the fastest flow occurring in the later part of May and the first part of June, and the slowest flow occurring after the river has frozen over. This occurs no later than early November and lasts until mid April.

In 1944, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers considered building a bridge across Rampart Gorge as part of a project to extend the <a href="Alaska%20Railroad">Alaska Railroad</a> from Fairbanks to <a href="Nome%2C%20Alaska">Nome</a> to facilitate <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> shipments to the Soviet Union during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The war ended before the project got beyond the planning stages, and the bridge idea was scrapped.

As early as 1948, U.S. Government officials eyed the Rampart site for its hydroelectric potential. A report by Joseph Morgan, chief of the Alaska Investigations Office for the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">United States Bureau of Reclamation</a> declared, "The demand for electric power supply in the [Alaska] Territory is expanding so rapidly that new installations of hydroelectric power plants are needed." Morgan's report listed 72 potential hydroelectric power sites in Alaska, but the Rampart site was one of the few to have a potential capacity of more than 200,000 kilowatts.

In his report, Morgan addresses the potential of the site: Reconnaissance topography indicates several potential dam sites in Lower Ramparts, but the best site probably will be found about downstream from the village of Rampart. ... this site on the Yukon River would easily be one of the major potential hydroelectric power developments in North America.

The first serious consideration of a dam project was made in a 1954 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers assessment of the resources of the Yukon and <a href="Kuskokwim%20River">Kuskokwim River</a> basin. Engineers considered Rampart Canyon to be a prime site for a hydroelectric dam. In April 1959, four months after President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> signed Alaska's declaration of statehood, junior U.S. Senator from Alaska <a href="Ernest%20Gruening">Ernest Gruening</a> passed a resolution calling for the Corps of Engineers to begin an official study of the project, and $49,000 was allocated by the federal government for that purpose. Preliminary estimates said the project would cost $900 million (1959 dollars) and generate 4.7 million kilowatts of electricity. At the time, the largest hydroelectric project in Alaska was the <a href="Eklutna%20River">Eklutna Dam</a>, which produced just 32,000 kilowatts.

The project competed with the smaller-scale <a href="Susitna%20Hydroelectric%20Project">Susitna Hydroelectric Project</a> proposed by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation for south-central Alaska, but thanks to Gruening's support and that of other backers, the Rampart project took precedence. The <a href="Rivers%20and%20Harbors%20Act%20of%201960">Rivers and Harbors Act of 1960</a> passed by the U.S. Congress in that year included a $2 million appropriation to conduct a full four-year feasibility study of the project, including its economic feasibility and the impact it would have on fish and wildlife. In March 1961, a team of engineers from the Corps' Alaska district began drilling operations at the site to determine bedrock depth and gather other data. To examine the economic feasibility of the dam, the Corps of Engineers created the <a href="Rampart%20Economic%20Advisory%20Board">Rampart Economic Advisory Board</a> (REAB) in February 1961. The REAB hired <a href="David%20E.%20Lilienthal">David E. Lilienthal</a>'s <a href="Development%20and%20Resources%20Corporation">Development and Resources Corporation</a> in April to complete the study, and a team of Corps engineers and REAB members arrived in the state in June to study the Rampart project first-hand. At that time, Sen. Gruening estimated that the project would cost roughly $1.2 billion to complete.

As investigation and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers reached an agreement with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.

The interim Corps of Engineers report was released in December 1963, and reported that building the dam was feasible from an engineering standpoint. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> supported the project, and lobbied for an appropriation of $197,000 (1963 dollars) to continue study of the project. The needed money was included in a House appropriations bill, and studies continued. The initial report included some figures about the size of the project. The dam would be a concrete structure high and about long. It would raise the height of the Yukon River from above sea level to approximately . The resulting reservoir would be long, wide, and have a surface area greater than that of Lake Erie. The power facilities for the project would produce a maximum of 5 gigawatts of electricity. In total, the proposed reservoir was anticipated to cover an area of and have a capacity of .

In April 1964, the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (FWS) released its report on the project. Though only a part of the larger Department of the Interior study, the FWS report came down strongly opposed to the dam on the grounds that it would irrevocably destroy the Yukon Flats, a critical waterfowl breeding ground. In January 1965, the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a> set aside almost of land for construction of the dam and reservoir. It was a typical process that had been done for other dam projects several times before, but the amount of land to be set aside generated several months of hearings before the decision.

In June 1964 the Natural Resources Council asked Stephen H. Spurr, dean of the Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an authority on forestry and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaska's projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (silver) salmon. It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats. There would also have been a sharp decline in both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals: muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurr's report noted: "[It]is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the animal population supported by the inundated habitat."

In March 1966 Spurr's team issued its final report, finding that the dam was not a cost-effective investment.

In January 1965, the Department of the Interior completed its three-volume, 1,000-page study of the Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies of the impact on the region's Alaska Native population. <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a> then created a task force to review the findings before he made a final decision. Throughout 1965 and 1966, opponents and proponents of the project funded studies of their own, aimed either at supporting or rejecting the arguments for the dam.

In June 1967, the Department of the Interior made its final recommendation and suggested that the dam not be built. Secretary Udall cited the fish and wildlife losses that would result, the availability of less-costly alternatives, and the fact that no recreational benefits would accrue.

Despite the Interior Department's rejection of the overall Rampart Dam project, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continued its engineering feasibility study on the project. That plan was completed on June 25, 1971, and it included most of the previous federal documents pertaining to the project, including the electricity market studies published by the Department of the Interior in 1965, the Fish and Wildlife study of 1964, and other studies about the economic feasibility of the project. A detailed description of potential construction methods and the overall plan for the project were included, as were reports about the site's geography and hydrology. In total, the report encompassed two volumes including more than 480 pages. Because the construction season at the site is only five months, the Corps of Engineers projected that several decades would be needed to build the dam and associated structures.

Due to the lack of any land transportation route to the dam site, the first stage of construction would have involved the building of a temporary road from <a href="Manley%20Hot%20Springs%2C%20Alaska">Eureka</a>, about away, to the dam site. Consideration also was given to the extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to the site. A period of about four years would have been required for preconstruction planning, including detailed construction surveying and finalizing the design of the dam, <a href="Power%20station">powerhouse</a>, and other structures. Engineers estimated that after the four years of final planning and surveying, three years would be needed to dig river diversion tunnels and construct the <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a>s needed to clear the Yukon River <a href="streambed">streambed</a> for construction. Housing and construction offices also would have been constructed for workers on the south bank of the site, and the cost for this effort was included in overall cost proposals for the project.

Site clearing and foundation work would have been scheduled to begin after completion of the diversion work in the seventh year of the project. The first pouring of concrete was scheduled for the project's eighth year, and work on the powerhouse would have begun in the 11th year. Owing to the large size of the reservoir, engineers estimated that the diversion tunnels would be closed in the 13th year, allowing construction to pace the filling of the new lake. The reservoir would have reached a pool elevation of in the 21st year, the dam would have been completed to elevation in the 25th year, and the reservoir would have been filled to the full level in the 31st year after the project's start. The installation of power generators was planned to follow as needed, with the last unit scheduled for installation by the 45th year of the project.

In total, the dam would have consisted of a <a href="concrete">concrete</a> gravity structure with a structural height of and a <a href="hydraulic%20head">hydraulic height</a> of . At the elevation of , the dam would have stretched for from north to south. On the south bank would have been a concrete gravity <a href="spillway">spillway</a> with a crest at elevation and a maximum flow of at maximum pool elevation. The power facilities would have consisted of twenty-two 266,000 kilowatt units and two 10,000 kilowatt service units.

Materially, building the dam would have required of concrete aggregate, of rock fill, and another of various other types of fill. Engineers suggested that some of the material could be found at the site, but the remainder would have to be brought from outside sources.

At the projected pool elevation of , the resulting reservoir would have had a total capacity of . The full pool length would have been about , and the maximum width would have been . The resulting lake would have had approximately 3,600 miles (5,800 km) of shoreline and a total surface area of about . Because the Yukon also is a transportation route, transshipment facilities were planned for below and above the dam site and would have been connected by road and rail links. Because of the large size of the proposed reservoir and the need to allow some flow of the Yukon River downstream of the dam site for river navigation and fishing, engineers anticipated that filling the reservoir would take no fewer than 16 years to complete.

The Rampart Dam's large size had a correspondingly large price tag. The Corps of Engineers anticipated spending $618.4 million (1970 dollars) on construction of the physical dam alone, another $492 million for power-generating equipment, and $1.39 billion in total. That total included $15.59 million for relocating Alaskans from the area to be flooded, $56 million for fish and wildlife facilities to mitigate the anticipated losses, and $39.7 million for roads and bridges to access the area. After completion of the dam, the Corps of Engineers estimated that operation and maintenance of the project would cost $6.5 million annually, including $570,000 for replacement power equipment and $2 million for the maintenance of fish and wildlife facilities.

From the initial planning stages, proponents and opponents speculated that the large size of the reservoir created by the dam could affect the weather in Interior Alaska and the Yukon. Several studies were conducted in regards to these potential changes, and most of the reports hypothesized an effect similar to the weather that occurs around <a href="Great%20Slave%20Lake">Great Slave Lake</a> and <a href="Lake%20Baikal">Lake Baikal</a>, both of which were of similar sizes and latitudes to the proposed reservoir. Forecasts predicted the lake would hold in heat longer during the autumn, thus keeping area temperatures slightly warmer than normal. In the spring, however, the area around the lake would have been prone to increased precipitation due to the phenomenon of <a href="lake-effect%20snow">lake-effect snow</a>. In the summer, the long periods of daylight would have caused the land around the lake to become warmer than the lake itself, also creating the possibility of storms.

Support for the dam project came from a variety of sources, but supporters tended to use three primary arguments in favor of its construction: the electricity generated by the project would be cheap and plentiful, industries would be attracted to Alaska by the cheap electricity, and the dam's construction would have minimal impact on the environment and human populations.

During the campaign that preceded the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201960">1960 U.S. Presidential election</a>, both candidates—<a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and John F. Kennedy—made campaign stops in Alaska. Both men gave their support to the Rampart Dam project, with Kennedy saying, "I see the greatest dam in the free world at Rampart Canyon, producing twice the power of the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a> to light homes and mills and cities and farms all over Alaska." Nixon, arriving three months after Kennedy, said, "As far as Rampart Canyon Dam is concerned, certainly you can expect progress, more progress, I believe, in our administration than his".

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers leaders strongly supported the project in its initial phases. In 1960, Harold Moats of the Corps' Alaska district said, "Rampart Canyon, the big one, is Alaska's most valuable resource, and as it is developed, Alaska will take her rightful place in the family of states contributing richly to the economy of the nation and the welfare of the whole free world."

In early September 1963, a group of Alaska businesspeople, local government leaders, and industry representatives met at <a href="McKinley%20Park%2C%20Alaska">McKinley</a> Park Lodge to organize lobbying efforts in favor of the dam. The resulting organization was called the Yukon Corporation for Power for America, later shortened to Yukon Power for America, Inc. The organization began with a $100,000 budget, which it used to produce "The Rampart Story", a color brochure distributed in Alaska and Washington, D.C. to promote the dam project.

Alaska senator Ernest Gruening remained a staunch backer of the project from its inception to its cancellation, and made it a major personal political priority. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most of the Alaska Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the project. In the years that followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization. Among the group's members was <a href="Ted%20Stevens">Ted Stevens</a>, who was appointed in 1968 as one of Alaska's representatives to the U.S. Senate.

As planned, the dam would have produced roughly 34 <a href="terawatt%20hour">terawatt hour</a>s annually, nearly 50 times the total energy use for the entire state of Alaska in 1960 (700 gigawatt hours). Gruening, in particular, believed that the dam would have an effect similar to that of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s, with cheap electricity providing the economic basis of the region. Dam proponents also suggested that the electricity might be transmitted to the rest of the United States, lowering utility prices in those states by increasing the amount of available power. Anthony Netboy, a <a href="salmon">salmon</a> biologist employed by Yukon Power for America, claimed that one day, "a housewife in Phoenix or L.A. will fry her eggs at breakfast with electricity generated on the far-off Yukon."

Supporters of the project suggested that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as <a href="Aluminium%20production">aluminum smelting</a>, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process the hundreds of millions of <a href="Board%20foot">board feet</a> of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.

At the time Rampart Dam was being considered, Alaska as a whole, and Interior Alaska in particular, was sparsely settled. The <a href="1960%20United%20States%20Census">1960 United States Census</a> recorded just 226,127 people as residents of Alaska, making it the least-populated state in the United States at that time. Interior Alaska contained about 28,000 residents, and promoters suggested that the dam's benefits would vastly outweigh the costs to the few residents who would be displaced. An unnamed Gruening staffer once said the area to be flooded by the dam was worthless, containing "not more than ten flush toilets. Search the whole world and it would be difficult to find an equivalent area with so little to be lost through flooding." In a 1963 letter responding to a "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" article about the dam, Gruening wrote, As for the 2,000 Athabascan Indians, they could not but be better off than they are now. Their villages are flooded intermittently by the Yukon. Their habitations are miserable and their livelihood a bare subsistence supplemented by relief. Construction of the Rampart Dam will give them ample gainful employment, and in their new locations, chosen by them on the lake's borders, they will have better homes, better community facilities and a permanent income from now nonexistent activities, generated by the lake.

In the same letter, Gruening also promoted the possibility of the dam creating a thriving tourism industry in Interior Alaska, a hypothesis that was raised by other dam supporters as well. Greuning stated that the project would be similar to <a href="Lake%20Powell">Lake Powell</a>, in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including <a href="water%20skiing">water skiing</a> and <a href="picnic">picnic</a>king.

Opposition to the project was based on three separate objections to its construction: ecological, human, and financial. Conservation groups opposed the dam's construction because it would flood the Yukon Flats, a large wetland area that provides breeding ground for millions of waterfowl and habitat for game and fur-bearing animals. Alaska Native groups objected to the project's human cost—the need to relocate more than 1,500 people and 9 villages—and Native groups outside the reservoir area objected to the potential devastation of the Yukon River salmon population. The third objection to construction of the dam stemmed from its high cost and the belief that cheap electricity would not be enough to attract industry to Alaska.

In late 1960, the <a href="Alaska%20Conservation%20Society">Alaska Conservation Society</a> became the first large conservation group to oppose construction of the dam. The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative <a href="Susitna%20Hydroelectric%20Project">Susitna Hydroelectric Project</a> to supply Alaska's electric needs. This was followed in early 1961 by an <a href="Alaska%20Sportsmen%27s%20Council">Alaska Sportsmen's Council</a> resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies of the impact of the project on fish and game stocks. In April of that year, "<a href="Alaska%20magazine">Alaska Sportsman</a>" magazine took a formal stand against the project.

The <a href="California%20Fish%20and%20Game%20Commission">California Fish and Game Commission</a> was among the first non-Alaska conservation groups to oppose construction of the dam, saying in 1963 that it would inundate the Yukon Flats, an area of wetlands that is among North America's largest waterfowl breeding grounds. Following that objection, other groups began to organize during the 1963 <a href="North%20American%20Wildlife%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20Conference">North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference</a>. Fifteen conservation groups pooled a total of $25,000 at the meeting to begin an independent scientific study of the project and start an opposition campaign.

In the spring of 1964, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released a report on the impact of dam construction on the Flats. The report strongly opposed construction of the dam, saying in part, "Nowhere in the history of water development in North America have the fish and wildlife losses anticipated to result from a single project been so overwhelming." The report also pointed out the threat the dam would pose to the Yukon River's large salmon population, which swim upstream each year to spawn. <a href="Arthur%20Laing">Arthur Laing</a>, Canada's <a href="Minister%20of%20Northern%20Affairs%20and%20National%20Resources%20%28Canada%29">minister of northern affairs and natural resources</a>, also expressed alarm at the potential waterfowl losses and the threat the dam posed to Canada's portion of the Yukon River salmon population.

A May 1965 article in "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" magazine by author Paul Brooks illustrated the growing protests of conservationists concerned about the project. After traveling the Yukon River, Brooks hypothesized that construction of the dam would be catastrophic from an ecological and human standpoint, would cost an exorbitant amount of money, and that the claims of attracting industry and tourism to Alaska were greatly exaggerated. In real terms, he estimated that construction of the dam would eliminate the habitat for 1.5 million ducks, 12,500 geese, 10,000 cranes, 270,000 salmon, 12,000 <a href="moose">moose</a>, and seven percent of Alaska's fur-bearing animals. Similar articles appeared in magazines such as "<a href="Field%20and%20Stream">Field and Stream</a>", which called the project "a catastrophe of major proportions", and the "<a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">Audubon Society Magazine</a>", said the dam "would negate 30 years of endeavor in waterfowl preservation. Even sporting magazine "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" got into the act, asking if the cost of so many waterfowl would be worth building the dam.

In planning the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing the relocation of an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was <a href="Fort%20Yukon%2C%20Alaska">Fort Yukon</a>, which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the Yukon Flats came together to form an organization called <a href="Gwitchya%20Gwitchin%20Ginkhye">Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye</a>, which lobbied against the project. The "<a href="Tundra%20Times">Tundra Times</a>", an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly in opposition to the project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the Yukon River were against the dam. <a href="Don%20Young">Don Young</a>, Alaska's representative to the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, was elected to the <a href="Alaska%20Legislature">Alaska Legislature</a> in 1964 from Fort Yukon on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.

A survey of the archeological and paleontological potential of the Yukon Flats, conducted in 1965, objected to the potential loss of the area. In part, it said, "... it may be said that relatively speaking, the archaeological potential of the Rampart Impoundment area is great; the practical difficulties of field work will have to be overcome in order to obviate the possible loss of what may be some of the most important prehistoric records in North America."

The Canadian government also strongly opposed the Rampart Dam project. According to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Washington%20%281871%29">Treaty of Washington</a>, signed in 1871, Canada was allowed free navigation of the Yukon River. It was feared that construction of the dam would block navigation routes and violate the treaty.

Opposition to the dam project also arose in concern of the dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and <a href="Fiscal%20conservatism">fiscal conservatives</a> protested the proposal on the grounds that the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it was unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.

In his 1966 analysis of the project's economic feasibility, Michael Brewer refuted the conclusions of the 1962 federal study, saying that the ability of the dam to pay for itself was "an exercise in speculation". He also wrote that even if the dam was built and cheap electricity made available, "Alaska did not possess a competitive advantage". He concluded by saying that the project was "not economically efficient". Because of arguments like these, the common belief among informed observers outside Alaska was that the project was designed to benefit Alaska alone, and thus could almost be considered "foreign aid." An editorial in "The New York Times" summed up non-Alaska opinions when it asked if the dam project was "the world's biggest <a href="Boondoggle%20%28project%29">boondoggle</a>".

Owing to increasing public pressure, in June 1967, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a> announced he was strongly opposed to the dam, citing economic and biological factors as well as the drastic impact on the area's native population. Though this effectively ended the project, planning continued to go ahead until the final Army Corps of Engineers report was released in 1971 and recommended the project "not be undertaken at this time". Alaska governor <a href="William%20Allen%20Egan">William Allen Egan</a> protested the statement, saying the report was out of date due to population growth in Alaska and rising demand for electricity.

The report was duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers confirmed the project no longer was justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized the creation of the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the Yukon Flats, a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.

In summer 1985, the last remnants of the dam project were eliminated when the 8.96 million acres (36,300 km) set aside for development of the dam were released by the Bureau of Land Management for other uses.

The controversy surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing shift in the environmental movement during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving the natural beauty of a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> in the United States during the first half of the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.

Among Alaska Natives, the Rampart Dam project encouraged organization and the creation of communications links between various like-minded communities and tribal groups. When the <a href="Trans-Alaska%20Pipeline%20System">Trans-Alaska Pipeline</a> was proposed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Native organizations that had formed to oppose Rampart Dam were revived in opposition to the pipeline. Only after Native land claims were recognized in the <a href="Alaska%20Native%20Claims%20Settlement%20Act">Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act</a> did the pipeline progress.

Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy

On June 5, 1968, presidential candidate <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> was mortally wounded shortly after midnight at the <a href="Ambassador%20Hotel%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Ambassador Hotel</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Earlier that evening, the 42-year-old junior senator from <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> was declared the winner in the <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> and <a href="Primary%20elections%20in%20the%20United%20States">California presidential primaries</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201968">1968 election</a>. He was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. <a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">PDT</a> on June 6, about 26 hours after he had been shot.

Following dual victories in the California and South Dakota primary elections for the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> nomination for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, Senator Kennedy spoke to journalists and campaign workers at a live televised celebration from the stage of his headquarters at the Ambassador Hotel. Shortly after leaving the podium and exiting through a kitchen hallway, he was mortally wounded by multiple shots fired from a handgun. Kennedy died in the <a href="Good%20Samaritan%20Hospital%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Good Samaritan Hospital</a> 26 hours later. The shooter was 24-year-old <a href="Sirhan%20Sirhan">Sirhan Sirhan</a>. In 1969, Sirhan was convicted of murdering the senator and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1972. A freelance newspaper reporter recorded the shooting on audio tape, and the aftermath was captured on film.

Kennedy's remains were taken to <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20New%20York">St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York</a> for two days of public viewing before a funeral Mass was held on June 8. His funeral train traveled from New York to Washington, D.C., and throngs of spectators lined the route to view the journey. His body was interred at night in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> near his brother <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John</a>. His death prompted the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a> to protect presidential candidates. Vice President <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> was also a presidential candidate; he went on to win the Democratic nomination but ultimately lost the election to <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>.

The assassination of Robert Kennedy has been exploited for the purpose of spreading unfounded <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination%20conspiracy%20theories">conspiracy theories</a>; to date, no credible evidence has emerged that Sirhan was not the shooter, or that he didn't act alone. Kennedy and <a href="Huey%20Long">Huey Long</a> of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> (in 1935) are the only two sitting <a href="List%20of%20assassinated%20American%20politicians">United States Senators to be assassinated</a>.

Kennedy was 22 years old in 1948 when he <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%27s%201948%20visit%20to%20Palestine">visited the British Mandate of Palestine</a> and wrote dispatches for "<a href="The%20Boston%20Post">The Boston Post</a>" about the trip and its effect on him. During his stay, he wrote that he grew to admire the Jewish inhabitants of the area, and he became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel when he became a Senator. Appointed <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">United States Attorney General</a> in December 1960 by his brother, President <a href="John%20Fitzgerald%20Kennedy">John Fitzgerald Kennedy</a>, he served in that post from January 1961 until his resignation on September 3, 1964, in order to run for election to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. Opposing incumbent Republican <a href="Kenneth%20Keating">Kenneth Keating</a>, his first attempt at elective office scored a tight race win in an otherwise landslide <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> year. He took office as Senator from New York on January 3, 1965.

The run-up to the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201968">1968 presidential election</a> under President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> was a period of great social unrest. There were riots in major cities amid Johnson's attempts to introduce anti-poverty and anti-discrimination legislation, and there was significant opposition to the ongoing <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

The <a href="assassination%20of%20Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</a> on April 4, 1968, led to <a href="King%20assassination%20riots">further riots</a> in several cities. Kennedy entered the race for the Democratic Party's nomination for president on March 16, four days after Senator <a href="Eugene%20McCarthy">Eugene McCarthy</a> received a large percentage of the vote in the <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> primary against the incumbent President (42 percent to Johnson's 49 percent). Two weeks later, President Johnson announced that he was no longer seeking re-election, and Vice President <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> announced that he would seek the presidency a month later. Humphrey did not participate in any primaries, but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates. Following the California primary, Kennedy was in second place with 393 delegates compared to Humphrey's 561 and McCarthy's 258.

The 1968 California presidential primary elections were held on Tuesday, June 4. The statewide results gave Kennedy 46 percent and McCarthy 42 percent. Four hours after the polls closed in California, Kennedy claimed victory in the state's Democratic presidential primary. He spoke by phone with South Dakota Senator <a href="George%20McGovern%231968%20presidential%20and%20Senate%20campaigns">George McGovern</a>. At approximately 12:10 a.m. <a href="Pacific%20time%20zone">PDT</a> on June 5, he addressed his campaign supporters in the <a href="Ambassador%20Hotel%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Ambassador Hotel</a>'s Embassy Room ballroom in the <a href="Mid-Wilshire%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Mid-Wilshire</a> district of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. At the time, the government provided <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a> protection for an incumbent president, but not for presidential candidates. Kennedy's only security was provided by former <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agent William Barry and two unofficial bodyguards: Olympic decathlon gold medalist <a href="Rafer%20Johnson">Rafer Johnson</a> and former football player <a href="Rosey%20Grier">Rosey Grier</a>. Kennedy had welcomed contact with the public during the campaign, and people had often tried to touch him in their excitement.

Kennedy planned to walk through the ballroom when he had finished speaking. He ended the speech by stating: "My thanks to all of you; and now it's on to Chicago, and let's win there!" He was on his way to another gathering of supporters elsewhere in the hotel. Reporters wanted a press conference, and campaign aide <a href="Fred%20Dutton">Fred Dutton</a> decided that Kennedy would forgo the second gathering and instead go through the hotel's kitchen and pantry area behind the ballroom to the press area. Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said, "No, it's been changed. We're going this way." Barry and Dutton began clearing a way for Kennedy to go left through swinging doors to the kitchen corridor, but Kennedy was hemmed in by the crowd and followed "maître d'hôtel" Karl Uecker through a back exit.

Uecker led Kennedy through the kitchen area, holding his right wrist, but frequently releasing it as Kennedy shook hands with people whom he encountered. Uecker and Kennedy started down a passageway narrowed by an ice machine against the right wall and a steam table to the left. Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with busboy Juan Romero, just as <a href="Sirhan%20Sirhan">Sirhan Sirhan</a> stepped down from a low tray-stacker beside the ice machine, rushed past Uecker, and repeatedly fired an eight-shot <a href=".22%20Long%20Rifle">.22 Long Rifle</a> caliber <a href="Iver%20Johnson%23Robert%20Kennedy%20assassination">Iver Johnson Cadet 55-A revolver</a>.

Kennedy fell to the floor, and bodyguard William Barry hit Sirhan twice in the face while others, including writer <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>, forced him against the steam table and disarmed him, as he continued firing his gun in random directions. Five other people were wounded in addition to Kennedy: William Weisel of <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a>, Paul Schrade of the <a href="United%20Automobile%20Workers">United Automobile Workers</a> union, Democratic Party activist Elizabeth Evans, Ira Goldstein of the Continental News Service, and Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll.

After a minute, Sirhan wrestled free and grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. Barry went to Kennedy and placed his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: "I knew immediately it was a .22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't be so bad, but then I saw the hole in the Senator's head, and I knew". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, "Is everybody OK?" and Romero responded, "Yes, everybody's OK." Kennedy then turned away and said, "Everything's going to be OK." This moment was captured by "Life" photographer <a href="Bill%20Eppridge">Bill Eppridge</a> and Boris Yaro of the "Los Angeles Times" and became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion concerning who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager and brother-in-law <a href="Stephen%20Edward%20Smith">Stephen Edward Smith</a>. Another witness stated that a female in a polka-dot dress had exclaimed repeatedly, "We killed him," before running away. Video footage of her testimony can be seen in the Netflix series "Bobby Kennedy for President".

Kennedy's wife <a href="Ethel%20Kennedy">Ethel</a> was three months pregnant; she stood outside the crush of people at the scene seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to recognize her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy had "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his face, as if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, "Don't lift me", which were his last words, as he lost consciousness shortly after. He was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged his heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so that she could hear his heart beating.

After about 30 minutes, Kennedy was transferred several blocks to <a href="Good%20Samaritan%20Hospital%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">the Hospital of the Good Samaritan</a> to undergo surgery. A gymnasium near the hospital was set up as temporary headquarters for the press and news media to receive updates on his condition. Surgery began at 3:12 a.m. and lasted three hours and 40 minutes. At 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, spokesman <a href="Frank%20Mankiewicz">Frank Mankiewicz</a> announced that Kennedy's doctors were "concerned over his continuing failure to show improvement"; his condition remained "extremely critical as to life".

Kennedy had been shot three times. One bullet was fired at a range of perhaps and entered behind his right ear, dispersing fragments throughout his brain. The other two entered at the rear of his right armpit; one exited from his chest and the other lodged in the back of his neck. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, he was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting.

Frank Mankiewicz left the hospital and walked to the gymnasium where the press and news media were set up for continuous updates on the situation. At 2 a.m. on June 6, Mankiewicz approached the podium, took a few moments to compose himself, and made the official announcement:

Sirhan Sirhan (born March 19, 1944) is a Palestinian Arab with Jordanian citizenship, born in Jerusalem, who held strongly anti-<a href="Zionism">Zionist</a> beliefs. A diary was found during a search of his home, and he wrote on May 19: "My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more and more of an unshakable obsession. RFK must die. RFK must be killed. Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated... Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68." It has been suggested that the date of the assassination is significant because it was the first anniversary of the start of the <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a> between Israel and its Arab neighbors. When Sirhan was booked by police, they found a newspaper article in his pocket that discussed Kennedy's <a href="Robert%20F.%20Kennedy%27s%201948%20visit%20to%20Palestine">support for Israel</a>; Sirhan testified at his trial that he began to hate Kennedy after learning of this support. In 1989, he told <a href="David%20Frost">David Frost</a> in prison: "My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians". Some scholars view the assassination as one of the first major incidents of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab–Israeli conflict in the Middle East.

The interpretation that Sirhan was motivated by Middle Eastern politics has been criticized as an oversimplification which ignores his psychological problems. Sirhan's lawyers attempted to use a defense of diminished responsibility during the trial, while Sirhan himself tried to confess to the crime and change his plea to guilty on several occasions. He testified that he had killed Kennedy "with 20 years of malice aforethought". The judge did not accept this confession and it was later withdrawn.

Sirhan was convicted of the murder of Robert Kennedy on April 17, 1969, and was sentenced six days later, to death. In 1972, the sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole after the <a href="California%20Supreme%20Court">California Supreme Court</a> invalidated all pending death sentences that were imposed prior to 1972, due to its ruling in "<a href="California%20v.%20Anderson">California v. Anderson</a>". Since that time, Sirhan has been denied parole 15 times and is currently confined at the <a href="Richard%20J.%20Donovan%20Correctional%20Facility">Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility</a> in southern San Diego County. His lawyers have claimed that he was framed, and he claims to have no memory of his crime.

The <a href="Iver%20Johnson">Iver Johnson</a> <a href=".22%20caliber">.22 caliber</a> revolver that Sirhan Sirhan used to assassinate Robert F. Kennedy originated from Albert Leslie Hertz, a resident of <a href="Alhambra%2C%20California">Alhambra</a> just south of <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena, California</a>. He originally bought the gun to protect his own business during the 1965 <a href="Watts%20riots">Watts riots</a>, but never used it and kept it in its original wrapping paper and box. Hertz's wife decided the gun was too dangerous and gave it to her daughter, Dana Westlake. Westlake didn't use it and gave the gun to her next-door neighbor, George Erhard. Erhard later sold the gun to Sirhan Sirhan's brother, Munir Bishara Sirhan, known as "Joe", who George knew was working at Nash's department store at the corner of Arroyo and Colorado in Pasadena. At the time, Erhard was looking to seek more money from the gun sale to finance some work on his car.

In the interview with the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a>, Munir said that his brother asked him to obtain a gun because he wanted to visit a rifle range. Munir explained to them that rifle ranges rented guns, in which Sirhan replied "I don't want to get involved. I don't want a signature." Sirhan later asked him if he knew any gun owners, and Munir told investigators that "I don't know why my brother wanted it, you know, wanted anything to do with guns." This request was due to the fact Sirhan was a non-citizen which was illegal under California law for an alien to purchase firearms. Munir later approached Erhard in the parking lot of Nash's store and Ernard showed him the pistol. At this point, Munir said that he asked Ernard to bring the gun to Sirhan's house, since his brother was interested of buying it. He stated that he and Ernard went to Sirhan Sirhan's home and met him at the dining room, where the three agreed to a sale price: Munir produced $19 and Sirhan paid the $6 balance. However, the LAPD Summary Report stated that:

It is likely that Munir and Sirhan purchased the gun in such a clandestine manner because they were both aware that it was unlawful for aliens to own handguns. Sirhan first shot the gun in March 1968 and practiced with it about a half dozen times between March and May 1968. He said he "liked guns."' Munir said Sirhan kept the gun in the glove compartment of his De Soto. Munir often heard Sirhan playing with something that made a "click, click" sound, and he believed it was the gun." Munir had been "frightened" by the look in Sirhan's eye when his brother handled the gun. In fact Munir was so worried he made Sirhan swear on their dead sister, Aida, that he would not use the gun in a "bad" way. Sirhan had violated three California laws merely by possessing the pistol he used to kill Robert Kennedy. Thus, if Sirhan were simply an unwitting patsy involved in a conspiracy, the conspirators must have knowingly chosen a man who had been risking the whole conspiratorial venture by possessing an illegal weapon and firing it at a police range. Had Sirhan been caught with the illegal weapon, the purported conspiracy would have collapsed.

At the time of the shooting, <a href="NBC">NBC</a> and <a href="ABC%20News">ABC News</a> were signing off from their electoral broadcasts, while the <a href="CBS">CBS</a> coverage had already concluded. CBS coverage began 21 minutes after the shooting with Joseph Benti, then preparing his anchoring duties for "The <a href="CBS%20Morning%20News">CBS Morning News</a>", from the election studio at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York; <a href="Walter%20Cronkite">Walter Cronkite</a> joined him a half hour later. <a href="Mike%20Wallace">Mike Wallace</a> had co-anchored the primary election coverage with Cronkite and Benti, and he appeared briefly after the shooting. CBS reporters <a href="Terry%20Drinkwater">Terry Drinkwater</a> and David Schumacher delivered on-camera updates and interviews from the Ambassador; colleagues <a href="Roger%20Mudd">Roger Mudd</a> and <a href="John%20Hart%20%28journalist%29">John Hart</a> phoned in reports to New York. Later, Mudd presented on-camera updates on Kennedy's condition from Good Samaritan Hospital.

At ABC, <a href="Howard%20K.%20Smith">Howard K. Smith</a> signed off and the closing billboard aired followed by a wide studio shot of Smith, co-anchor <a href="Bill%20Lawrence%20%28news%20personality%29">Bill Lawrence</a>, and staff with the graphic "Race to the White House: California Primary" on screen (accompanied by the <a href="John%20Philip%20Sousa">John Philip Sousa</a> march <a href="The%20Thunderer">The Thunderer</a> as theme music). When the theme completed, after a moment of silence and a "please stand by" announcement, a portion of the theme was played again. Announcer Carl Caruso then alerted viewers to "please stand by for a special report," with the wide shot and graphic still on air, as the theme played a third time. During the long static shot, the ABC camera captured live the panic and bewilderment in the New York studio. Two and a half minutes more passed before Smith returned to air to say, "Ladies and gentlemen, we have kept the air on because we have heard an alarming report that Robert Kennedy was shot in that ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles." Smith would clarify that word was received about the sound of gunfire a short time earlier, but they had waited to receive additional confirmation about what happened before making any announcements. Meanwhile, the ABC reporters at the Ambassador crowded into the kitchen where Kennedy had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported, but all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. One of the ABC reporters at the Ambassador was <a href="Bob%20Clark%20%28television%20reporter%29">Bob Clark</a>, who had also reported from Dallas on the assassination of <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. Clark and <a href="Marlene%20Sanders">Marlene Sanders</a> later reported from Good Samaritan Hospital. At about 7:00 a.m. EST, <a href="Frank%20Reynolds">Frank Reynolds</a> joined Smith at the New York anchor desk. <a href="Sam%20Donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> contributed reports from the ABC bureau in Washington.

NBC was also about to sign off in New York when anchor <a href="Frank%20McGee%20%28journalist%29">Frank McGee</a> received a telephone call on camera, apparently informing him of the shooting. A visibly stunned McGee spent the next few minutes filling time until he was ready to inform viewers that Kennedy had been shot. NBC reporter <a href="Charles%20Quinn">Charles Quinn</a> was one of the first to report from the scene of the shooting, telling viewers, "He's lying here on the floor. Senator Kennedy has been shot. He's been shot. There's blood on the floor." Quinn and colleague Lew Allison gave updates and conducted interviews from the hotel ballroom and lobby; <a href="Sander%20Vanocur">Sander Vanocur</a> reported from a temporary studio in the hotel, interviewing eyewitnesses and others involved in events surrounding the shooting. NBC anchors <a href="Chet%20Huntley">Chet Huntley</a> and <a href="David%20Brinkley">David Brinkley</a> had co-anchored the primary coverage with McGee, and they returned to the Burbank anchor desk at about 4:15 a.m. EST. <a href="Jack%20Perkins%20%28reporter%29">Jack Perkins</a> reported for NBC from Good Samaritan Hospital.

CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.

Mutual News was among the first to broadcast a report from the assassination location, because reporter Andrew West of <a href="KEIB">KRKD</a>, a <a href="Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a> radio affiliate in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, captured on audio tape the sounds of the immediate aftermath of the shooting but not the actual shooting itself, using his reel-to-reel tape recorder and attached microphone. He had just recorded Kennedy's victory speech from the podium, and he followed Kennedy and his entourage to the kitchen pantry. West turned his recorder on again seconds after Kennedy was shot and started reporting the developments. Several seconds later, West gave an on-the-spot account of the struggle with Sirhan in the hotel kitchen pantry, shouting at Rafer Johnson to "Get the gun, Rafer, get the gun!" and telling others to "get a hold of his thumb and break it, if you have to! Get his thumb! Hold him, hold him! We don't want another <a href="Lee%20Harvey%20Oswald">Oswald</a>!". Reporter West finished his audio recording, went to a telephone, connected his tape recorder, and called Mutual West in San Francisco, co-located with radio stations KKHI-AM-FM. Producer John Hawkins had shut down KKHI/Mutual West operations at Midnight and was heading out the door, but answered the unexpected call. Hawkins recalls West screaming "roll a tape, Kennedy's been shot, roll a tape." Hawkins recorded as West spoke a live introduction then played his tape. Hawkins sent the complete recording to Mutual's New York headquarters over a dedicated line. Soon after, Mutual News broadcast Andrew West's dramatic report to all radio stations which were monitoring for Mutual News bulletins overnight. As additional Mutual News stations returned to the air or resumed newscasts (often at 6:00AM) West's report was widely broadcast, and picked up by other stations and networks. KKHI radio could have been the first to broadcast West's report just after Midnight, but it was already off the air until 6:00AM (KKHI-AM-FM were classical music stations).

Los Angeles <a href="CBS%20radio">CBS radio</a> affiliate <a href="KNX%20%28AM%29">KNX (AM)</a> interrupted its rundown of local primary returns to provide coverage of the shooting. KNX also simulcast coverage from KNXT-TV (now <a href="KCBS-TV">KCBS-TV</a>) with anchor <a href="Jerry%20Dunphy">Jerry Dunphy</a>, which was also fed nationwide on the CBS Radio Network in the initial hours after the shooting. Over the following week, NBC devoted 55 hours to the shooting and aftermath, ABC 43, and CBS 42, with all three networks preempting their regular coverage and advertisements to cover the story.

As with the <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">1963 assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy</a>, Robert Kennedy's death has been the subject of widespread analysis. Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime, or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case.

In November 2006, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s "<a href="Newsnight">Newsnight</a>" program presented research by filmmaker <a href="Shane%20O%27Sullivan%20%28filmmaker%29">Shane O'Sullivan</a> alleging that several <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA</a> officers were present on the night of the assassination. Three men who appear in films and photographs from the night of the assassination were positively identified by former colleagues and associates as former senior CIA officers who had worked together in 1963 at <a href="JMWAVE">JMWAVE</a>, the CIA's main anti-Castro station based in Miami. They were JMWAVE Chief of Operations <a href="David%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Morales">David Morales</a>, Chief of Maritime Operations Gordon Campbell and Chief of Psychological Warfare Operations <a href="George%20Joannides">George Joannides</a>. However, several people who had known Morales, including family members, were adamant that he was not the man who O'Sullivan said was Morales. After O'Sullivan published his book, assassination researchers <a href="Jefferson%20Morley">Jefferson Morley</a> and <a href="David%20Talbot">David Talbot</a> also discovered that Campbell had died of a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> in 1962, six years prior to the assassination of Kennedy. In response, O'Sullivan stated that the man on the video may have used Campbell's name as an alias. He then took his identifications to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Police%20Department">Los Angeles Police Department</a> whose files showed the men he identified as Campbell and Joannides to be Michael Roman and Frank Owens, two <a href="Bulova">Bulova</a> sales managers attending the company's convention in the Ambassador. O'Sullivan stood by his allegations stating that the Bulova watch company was a "well-known CIA cover".

The location of Kennedy's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him, because some witnesses assert that Sirhan faced west as Kennedy moved through the pantry facing east. This has led to the suggestion that a second gunman actually fired the fatal shot, a possibility supported by Chief Medical Examiner and Coroner for the <a href="County%20of%20Los%20Angeles">County of Los Angeles</a> <a href="Thomas%20Noguchi">Thomas Noguchi</a> who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch. Other witnesses, though, said that Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands as Sirhan approached, facing north and so exposing his right side.

During a re-examination of the case in 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered expert examination of the possibility of a second gun having been used, and the conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory. As recently as 2008, eyewitness <a href="John%20Pilger">John Pilger</a> asserted his belief that there must have been a second gunman.

In 2007, it was revealed that forensic expert Philip Van Praag had analyzed an audiotape of the shooting known as the Pruszynski recording in which Van Praag had discovered acoustic evidence that a second gun had been involved in the assassination. Van Praag found that 13 shots were fired even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds, its maximum bullet capacity, and Sirhan had no opportunity to reload it. Van Praag states the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible from Sirhan's gun alone. Forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena examined Van Praag's findings and corroborated the presence of more than eight gunshots on the tape along with over-lapping shots, all of this indicating the presence of a second shooter. Similar corroboration came from forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Other acoustic experts, however, have claimed that they could find no more than eight shots recorded on the audiotape. The Pruszynski recording was uncovered in 2004 by CNN's Brad Johnson; its existence had been unknown to the general public previously.

On February 22, 2012, Sirhan's lawyers <a href="William%20Francis%20Pepper">William Francis Pepper</a> and Laurie Dusek filed a court brief in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second gunman fired the shots that killed Kennedy. It was the fourth and final in a series of federal briefs filed under the <a href="writ%20of%20habeas%20corpus">writ of habeas corpus</a> by Pepper and Dusek beginning in October 2010. Judge <a href="Beverly%20Reid%20O%27Connell">Beverly Reid O'Connell</a> denied the petition in 2015.

Following Kennedy's <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a> on June 6, his remains were taken to Manhattan, where his closed casket was viewed by thousands at St. Patrick's Cathedral. The funeral mass was held on the morning of June 8.
Kennedy's younger brother, <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20Massachusetts">Massachusetts Senator</a> <a href="Ted%20Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>, delivered the eulogy with the words:

Immediately following the mass, Kennedy's body was transported by a slow-moving train to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations, paying their respects as the train passed by.

On the way to the cemetery, the funeral procession passed through Resurrection City, a <a href="shantytown">shantytown</a> protest set up as part of the <a href="Poor%20People%27s%20Campaign">Poor People's Campaign</a>. The procession stopped in front of the <a href="Lincoln%20Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a>, where residents of Resurrection City joined the group and sang "<a href="The%20Battle%20Hymn%20of%20the%20Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>".

<a href="Grave%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Kennedy was buried</a> near his older brother <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John</a>, in Arlington National Cemetery, in the first burial to have ever taken place there at night; the second was the burial of his younger brother Ted in 2009.

After Kennedy's assassination, Congress altered the <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">Secret Service</a>'s mandate to include protection for presidential candidates. The remaining candidates were immediately protected under an executive order issued by Lyndon Johnson, putting a strain on the poorly resourced Secret Service.

At the time of his death, Kennedy was substantially behind Humphrey in convention delegate support, but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary. Only thirteen states held primaries that year, meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference. Historian <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger%20Jr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.</a>, and others have argued that Kennedy's broad appeal and <a href="charisma">charisma</a> would have been sufficiently convincing at the <a href="1968%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1968 Democratic National Convention</a> to give him the nomination. Historian <a href="Michael%20Beschloss">Michael Beschloss</a> believed that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination. Humphrey, after a National Convention in Chicago marred by <a href="1968%20Democratic%20National%20Convention%20protest%20activity">violence in the streets</a>, was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground. He ultimately lost the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201968">general election</a> to Republican <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> by the narrow popular vote margin of 43.4 percent to 42.7 percent. Nixon won by a more decisive 301–191 margin in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral vote</a>.

Kennedy's assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s. Juan Romero, the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot, later said, "It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second."

<a href="Jack%20Newfield">Jack Newfield</a>, a reporter that had been traveling with the campaign, expressed his feelings on the effect of the assassination, closing his memoir on Kennedy with:

Kennedy's blood-stained shirt, tie and jacket are now in the possession of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20District%20Attorney">Los Angeles County District Attorney</a>. Controversy arose in 2010, when Kennedy's clothing was transported to the California Homicide Investigators Association conference in Las Vegas, where they were included in a temporary public display of never-before-seen artifacts from crime scenes related to prolific serial killers and infamous murders, such as the <a href="Black%20Dahlia">Black Dahlia</a> murder and the killing of Hollywood actress <a href="Sharon%20Tate">Sharon Tate</a>. The items and Kennedy's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit, with the LAPD apologizing to the Kennedy family.

Until 1987, the <a href="LAPD">LAPD</a> retained the original files, reports, transcripts, fragments of the bullets that struck Kennedy and the four other bystanders in the kitchen pantry, the <a href=".22%20caliber">.22 caliber</a> <a href="Iver-Johnson">Iver-Johnson</a> handgun used by Sirhan, Kennedy's blood-stained clothes and other artifacts related to the assassination. In 1987, the LAPD donated the entire evidence collection (except for Kennedy's clothes) to the <a href="California%20State%20Archives">California State Archives</a> in <a href="Sacramento">Sacramento</a> for permanent preservation.

The Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives of the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Dartmouth">University of Massachusetts Dartmouth</a> (known as the <a href="Southeastern%20Massachusetts%20University">Southeastern Massachusetts University</a> prior to 1991) also contain a large collection of materials on the assassination, located at the Claire T.

Amagi-class battlecruiser

The was a <a href="ship%20class">series</a> of four <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s planned for the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> (IJN) as part of the <a href="Eight-eight%20fleet">Eight-eight fleet</a>. The ships were to be named "Amagi", , "Atago", and "Takao" (initially named ), after the mountains <a href="Mount%20Amagi">Amagi</a>, <a href="Mount%20Akagi">Akagi</a>, <a href="Mount%20Atago">Atago</a>, and <a href="Jingo-ji">Takao</a>. The "Amagi" design was essentially a lengthened version of the battleship, but with a thinner armored <a href="belt%20armor">belt</a> and <a href="deck%20armor">deck</a> and a modified secondary <a href="Artillery%20battery">battery</a> arrangement.

Limitations imposed by the 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> prevented the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s. "Amagi" and "Akagi" were both intended for conversion, but an <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">earthquake</a> damaged the hull of "Amagi" so extensively that the ship was scrapped. "Akagi" was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction as part of the "<a href="Kido%20Butai">Kido Butai</a>" during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, participating in the Japanese attack on <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> before being sunk at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Battle of Midway</a>.

The ships had a planned displacement of and at <a href="full%20load">full load</a>. The class design was long at the <a href="Length%20at%20the%20waterline">waterline</a>, and <a href="Length%20overall">overall</a>. The ships would have had a <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="Draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of and would have used four propeller shafts, powered by Gihon <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s. The design staff intended to use turbines, which were to be powered by 19 Kampon <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s, eleven of which were oil-fired, while the other eight were to have mixed oil and coal for fuel. This system was designed to provide for a top speed of . The planned fuel stores amounted to 3,900 tons of oil and 2,500 tons of coal. The ships had a planned cruising speed of , and with full fuel stores, the ships would have had a maximum range of .

The ships were to be equipped with a main battery of ten <a href="41%20cm/45%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">L/45 guns</a> guns in five twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, although an L/50 gun tested in 1920 might have been used instead. The guns fired <a href="Armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing projectiles</a> with a <a href="propellant">propellant</a> charge at , at a <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a> between 1.5 and 2.5 rounds per minute. Each gun had 90 rounds and an approximate barrel life of 250–300 shots. The turrets would have been arranged along the centerline: two superfiring turrets fore, and three in line aft of the <a href="superstructure">superstructure</a>. The gun turrets weighed 1,004 tons (1,020 mt), and allowed for depression of −5 degrees and <a href="Elevation%20%28ballistics%29">elevation</a> of 30 degrees.

The secondary battery was to have consisted of sixteen <a href="14%20cm/50%203rd%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun">L/50 guns</a> mounted in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s along the center of the ship. These guns fired projectiles and used of propellant at a <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of . The guns had a maximum elevation of 25 degrees, which enabled a maximum range of . Four, later increased to six, <a href="12%20cm/45%2010th%20Year%20Type%20naval%20gun"></a> L/45 anti-aircraft guns were to have been mounted amidships, along with eight above-water <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s.

It was planned that the "Amagi" class would be protected by a <a href="Belt%20armor">main belt</a> thick, sloped at 12 degrees, and a <a href="torpedo%20bulkhead">torpedo bulkhead</a> thick. The main battery <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s were designed to have between of armor plating, and the <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> would have had armor ranging in thickness from to a maximum of . Deck armor was to have been thick.

Experiences in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> convinced naval war planners that more fast capital ships were needed, so on 4 April 1907, the <a href="Imperial%20Defence%20Council">Imperial Defence Council</a> approved an <a href="Eight-eight%20fleet">"Eight-eight"</a> policy. This plan originally called for a fleet of eight <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and eight <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s that would all be under ten years old (later changed to eight <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s and reduced to eight years old). However, the advent of the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> battleship crippled this plan at the beginning; given Japan's weak and underdeveloped economy and the enormous strain that had been put on it during the Russo-Japanese War (Japan emerged from the war victorious, but bankrupt), the launch of was a "disaster" for Japan.

In 1907, Japan was halfway to the eight-eight, with two newly delivered battleships (the ) in the fleet and two more (the ) and four armored cruisers authorized or under construction. In addition, three more battleships and four armored cruisers had been authorized, though not funded. However, naval technology was changing; older battleships, including all of Japan's battleships in commission or under construction, were quickly rendered obsolete with the commissioning of HMS "Dreadnought" (hence the terms dreadnought and <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>), and armored cruisers were seemingly useless in the face of the new battlecruisers being laid down by Great Britain and Germany. The IJN recognized this, and proposed in 1909 that two battlecruisers be ordered from British plans, with one to be built in Great Britain and one to be built at home. These two ships became the . Another pair of "Kongo"s were later built in Japan.

In 1910, there was still authorization for one battleship and four armored cruisers. This battleship, a more heavily armored version of the "Kongō"-class battlecruisers, became Japan's first <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a>, . With these ships, Japan appeared to be getting closer to the eight-eight goal; however, these new ships represented a "new level of naval strength" for the IJN, and they made all previous Japanese capital ships obsolete. This meant that any naval planner aiming for an eight-eight fleet would have to call for seven more battleships and four more battlecruisers at a time when Japan was trying to weather a worldwide economic depression.

After proposals from the IJN in 1911 and 1912 for massive shipbuilding programs, the Cabinet compromised down to a "four-four" plan; under this, three new battleships (the other ship and the two ships) and no new battlecruisers were authorized. The Navy did not agree, and instead called for an "eight-four" fleet, while the Imperial Defence Council called for the original eight-eight. The Cabinet relented, and by July 1914, it was decided to aim first for an eight-four fleet, followed by the eight-eight fleet. The eight-four plan was presented to the <a href="Diet%20of%20Japan">Diet of Japan</a> in 1915; it aimed to have the eight battleships and four battlecruisers by 1923 with the building of two and two s. The problem with this was that the old plan intended all of the ships of the eight-eight fleet to be under eight years old; by the time these new ships were completed, "Fusō" and the first two "Kongō" ships would be past their replacement age.

The plan was approved in 1917, along with funding for two battlecruisers which became the "Amagi" class. In late 1917, the Navy proposed to expand the eight-four plan by adding two more battlecruisers; this was approved, and two more "Amagi"-class ships were ordered. However, having eight gun ships (four battleships and four battlecruisers) on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan, which was spending about a third of its national budget on the Navy. The massive size and scale of its building program was rapidly driving up the cost of naval construction and armament.

 was the first ship of the class to be laid down; construction began on 6 December 1920 at the naval yard in <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>. "Amagi" followed ten days later at the <a href="Yokosuka%2C%20Kanagawa">Yokosuka</a> naval yard. The projected completion dates for the first pair of ships were December and November 1923, respectively. "Atago" was laid down in <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a> at the <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries">Kawasaki</a> shipyard on 22 November 1921, and was projected to be finished in December 1924. "Takao", the fourth and final ship of the class, was laid down at the <a href="Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a> shipyard in <a href="Nagasaki">Nagasaki</a> on 19 December 1921, and was also projected to be completed in December 1924.

The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, signed in February 1922, greatly reduced the tonnage allowed for capital ships in the signatory nations. The treaty also instituted a moratorium on new warship construction; battlecruisers canceled under this included one class each from Japan, the United States, and Great Britain: the "Amagi" class, the and the <a href="G3%20battlecruiser">G3 class</a>, respectively. The treaty did allow for battleship and battlecruiser hulls currently under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers, but only if these new carriers were kept under a 27,000-ton limit. Considering that the "Amagi" class were designed to displace at full load in their battlecruiser configuration, this would have been a rather difficult displacement to obtain. However, the Americans also had the same problem when designing a conversion of their "Lexington" class, so an exception, spearheaded by US <a href="Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Assistant Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%2C%20Jr.">Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.</a>, was added to the treaty that gave the five signatories the option of converting up to two capital ships that were under construction to 33,000-ton aircraft carriers. This resulted in the United States and Japan quickly reordering two ships each. Japan chose "Amagi" and "Akagi", the two ships nearest to completion, for conversion.

The September 1923 <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">Great Kantō earthquake</a> in Tokyo caused significant stress damage to the hull of "Amagi". The structure was too heavily damaged to be usable, and conversion work was abandoned. "Amagi" was stricken from the navy list and sold for scrapping, which began on 14 April 1924. The other two ships, "Atago" and "Takao", were officially canceled two years later (31 July 1924) and were <a href="ship%20breaking">broken up</a> for scrap in their <a href="slipway">slipway</a>s. The incomplete , on which work had stopped on 5 February 1922, was reordered as a carrier to replace "Amagi".

The conversion of "Akagi" began on 19 November 1923, and was completed in March 1927. However, the strange assortment of flight decks fitted on "Akagi"—a main landing deck superimposed over two short take-off decks—proved unsatisfactory, and the ship was withdrawn from active service in 1935 for modernization. The lower two flight decks were removed, the main deck was lengthened to , and a third elevator was added. Refitting was completed in 1938. "Akagi" supported operations off China in early 1939 and 1940, and underwent an overhaul in November 1940.

"Akagi" served as Vice Admiral <a href="Ch%C5%ABichi%20Nagumo">Chūichi Nagumo</a>'s <a href="flagship">flagship</a> in the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> on 7 December 1941. Nagumo's "<a href="Kido%20Butai">Kido Butai</a>"—composed of the carriers "Akagi", "Kaga", , , , and , supported by escorts—launched two waves of airstrikes on the American base at Pearl Harbor in a devastating surprise attack. American losses included four battleships and two destroyers sunk and nearly 200 aircraft destroyed.

On 19 February 1942, aircraft from "Akagi", "Hiryū", "Sōryū", and "Kaga" participated in the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">bombing of Darwin, Australia</a>. On 27 February, their bombers severely damaged the old American carrier , which was subsequently scuttled by her escort.

"Akagi" and the carriers "Hiryū" and "Sōryū" were sent in March 1942 with a mixed force of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers to the Indian Ocean to engage the British fleet there and to support planned attacks on <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>. In the <a href="Easter%20Sunday%20Raid">Easter Sunday Raid</a> on 5 April, aircraft from the carriers struck the British base at <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, destroying a number of aircraft and sinking an armed merchant cruiser and the old destroyer in the harbor. The Japanese fleet also spotted the heavy cruisers and at sea; both ships were sunk in an overwhelming air attack. On 9 April the carriers attacked British installations at <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, destroying aircraft and sinking the carrier , the destroyer , and the corvette .

In late May 1942, in an effort to draw out and destroy the elusive American carriers, Japanese forces organized attacks on the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands%20Campaign">Aleutian Islands</a> in Alaska and <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Midway Atoll</a> in the Western Pacific. Nagumo, aboard "Akagi", led "Kaga", "Sōryū", and "Hiryū" and the support ships of the First Carrier Striking Force to Midway. In the initial attack, Japanese planes neutralized a small force of fighter aircraft and inflicted heavy damage to American installations. Torpedo planes and dive-bombers sent from Midway to harry the Japanese fleet had little effect, but the Japanese attack plan had been deciphered by codebreakers, and the American carriers' planes were already en route. Torpedo bombers from , , and joined the attack in succession, forcing the Japanese carriers to maneuver violently to avoid torpedoes and rendering them unable to launch additional aircraft. American dive-bombers, arriving late after difficulty locating the fleet, soon landed fatal strikes on "Akagi", "Kaga", and "Sōryū". "Yorktown", handicapped by hits from "Hiryū"s bombers, managed to return to the fight only to take two torpedo hits a couple of hours later. The burning "Yorktown" was abandoned, but her scouts pinpointed "Hiryū"s location, and bombers from "Enterprise" put "Hiryū" out of action with four bomb strikes. Japan lost all four carriers of the First Carrier Striking Force at Midway.

Horses in World War I

The use of horses in World War I marked a transitional period in the evolution of armed conflict. <a href="Cavalry">Cavalry</a> units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but over the course of the war, the vulnerability of horses to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of <a href="tank">tank</a>s, which would ultimately replace cavalry in <a href="shock%20tactics">shock tactics</a>. While the perceived value of the <a href="horses%20in%20warfare">horse in war</a> changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.

All of the major combatants in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (1914–1918) began the conflict with cavalry forces. <a href="Second%20Reich">Germany</a> stopped using them on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> soon after the war began, but continued limited use on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a> well into the war. The <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> used cavalry extensively during the war. On the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> side, the United Kingdom used mounted infantry and <a href="Charge%20%28warfare%29">cavalry charges</a> throughout the war, but the United States used cavalry for only a short time. Although not particularly successful on the Western Front, Allied cavalry did have some success in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle Eastern theatre</a>, against a weaker and less technologically advanced enemy. Russia used cavalry forces on the Eastern Front, but with limited success.

The military mainly used horses for logistical support; they were better than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling <a href="artillery">artillery</a>, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their manure and carcasses. The value of horses, and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 some troops were told that the loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the <a href="blockade%20of%20Germany">blockade of Germany</a> prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied U.S. Army was short of horses.

Conditions were severe for horses at the front; they were killed by artillery fire, suffered from skin disorders, and were injured by <a href="poison%20gas">poison gas</a>. Hundreds of thousands of horses died, and many more were treated at veterinary hospitals and sent back to the front. Procuring <a href="fodder">fodder</a> was a major issue, and Germany lost many horses to starvation. Several memorials have been erected to commemorate the horses that died. Artists, including <a href="Alfred%20Munnings">Alfred Munnings</a>, extensively documented the work of horses in the war, and horses were featured in war poetry. Novels, plays and documentaries have also featured the horses of World War I.

Many British tacticians outside of the cavalry units realized before the war that advances in technology meant that the era of mounted warfare was coming to an end. However, many senior cavalry officers disagreed, and despite limited usefulness, maintained cavalry regiments at the ready throughout the war. Scarce wartime resources were used to train and maintain cavalry regiments that were rarely used. The continued tactical use of the cavalry charge resulted in the loss of many troops and horses in fruitless attacks against machine guns.

Early in the war, cavalry skirmishes occurred on several fronts, and horse-mounted troops were widely used for reconnaissance. Britain's cavalry were trained to fight both on foot and mounted, but most other European cavalry still relied on the <a href="shock%20tactics">shock tactic</a> of mounted charges. There were isolated instances of successful shock combat on the Western Front, where cavalry divisions also provided important mobile firepower. Beginning in 1917, cavalry was deployed alongside tanks and aircraft, notably at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a>, where cavalry was expected to exploit breakthroughs in the lines that the slower tanks could not. This plan never came to fruition due to missed opportunities and the use of machine guns by German forces. At Cambrai, troops from Great Britain, Canada, India and Germany participated in mounted actions. Cavalry was still deployed late in the war, with Allied cavalry troops harassing retreating German forces in 1918 during the <a href="Hundred%20Days%20Offensive">Hundred Days Offensive</a>, when horses and tanks continued to be used in the same battles. In comparison to their limited usefulness on the Western Front, "cavalry was literally indispensable" on the Eastern front and in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle East</a>.

Great changes in the tactical use of cavalry were a marked feature of World War I, as improved weaponry rendered frontal charges ineffective. Although cavalry was used with good effect in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, at the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Third Battle of Gaza</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo</a>, generally the mode of warfare changed. Tanks were beginning to take over the role of shock combat. The use of <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>, barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Following the war, the armies of the world powers initiated a process of mechanization in earnest, and most cavalry regiments were either converted to mechanized units or disbanded. Historian G.J. Meyer writes that "the Great War brought the end of cavalry". From the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> into the 20th century, cavalry had dominated battlefields, but from as early as the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, their value in war was declining as artillery became more powerful, reducing the effectiveness of shock charges. The Western Front in World War I showed that cavalry was almost useless against modern weaponry, and it also reinforced that they were difficult to transport and supply. British cavalry officers, far more than their continental European counterparts, persisted in using and maintaining cavalry, believing that mounted troops would be useful for exploiting infantry breakthroughs, and under the right circumstances would be able to face machine guns. Neither of these beliefs proved correct.

Britain had increased its cavalry reserves after seeing the effectiveness of mounted <a href="Boers">Boers</a> during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> (1899–1902). Horse-mounted units were used from the earliest days of World War I: on August 22, 1914, the first British shot of the war in France was fired by a cavalryman, <a href="Edward%20Thomas%20%28British%20Army%20soldier%29">Edward Thomas</a> of the <a href="4th%20Royal%20Irish%20Dragoon%20Guards">4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards</a>, near <a href="Casteau">Casteau</a>, during a patrol in the buildup to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons">Battle of Mons</a>. Within 19 days of Britain beginning mobilization for war, on August 24, 1914, the <a href="9th%20Lancers">9th Lancers</a>, a cavalry regiment led by <a href="David%20Campbell%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">David Campbell</a>, engaged German troops with a squadron of <a href="4th%20Dragoon%20Guards">4th Dragoon Guards</a> against German infantry and guns. Campbell obeyed his orders to charge, although he believed the more prudent course of action would have been to fight dismounted. The charge resulted in a British loss of 250 men and 300 horses. On September 7, Campbell's troops charged again, this time towards the German <a href="1st%20Guard%20Dragoons">1st Guard Dragoons</a>, another lancer cavalry regiment. In the same year, the British <a href="Household%20Cavalry">Household Cavalry</a> completed their penultimate operation on horseback—the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allied</a> <a href="Great%20Retreat">retreat from Mons</a>.

Upon reaching the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Aisne">Aisne River</a> and encountering <a href="trench%20warfare">the trench system</a>, cavalry was found ineffective. While cavalry divisions were still being formed in Britain, cavalry troops quickly became accustomed to fighting dismounted. Britain continued to use cavalry throughout the war, and in 1917, the Household Cavalry conducted its last mounted charge during a diversionary attack on the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a> at <a href="Arras">Arras</a>. On the orders of <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Douglas%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a>, the <a href="Life%20Guards%20%28British%20Army%29">Life Guards</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Blues</a>, accompanied by the men of the <a href="10th%20Hussars">10th Hussars</a>, charged into heavy machine gun fire and barbed wire, and were slaughtered by the German defenders; the Hussars lost two-thirds of their number in the charge. The last British fatality from enemy action before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice</a> went into effect was a cavalryman, George Edwin Ellison, from C Troop <a href="5th%20Royal%20Irish%20Lancers">5th Royal Irish Lancers</a>. Ellison was shot by a sniper as the regiment moved into <a href="Mons">Mons</a> on November 11, 1918.

Despite their lackluster record in Europe, horses proved indispensable to the British war effort in Palestine, particularly under Field Marshal <a href="Edmund%20Allenby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allenby">Edmund Allenby</a>, for whom cavalry made up a large percentage of his forces. Most of his mounted troops were not British regular cavalry, but the <a href="Desert%20Mounted%20Corps">Desert Mounted Corps</a>, consisting of a combination of Australian, New Zealand, Indian units and English <a href="Yeomanry">Yeomanry</a> regiments from the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a>, largely equipped as <a href="mounted%20infantry">mounted infantry</a> rather than cavalry. By mid-1918, Turkish intelligence estimated that Allenby commanded around 11,000 cavalry. Allenby's forces crushed the Turkish armies in a running series of battles that included the extensive use of cavalry by both sides. Some cavalry tacticians view this action as a vindication of cavalry's usefulness, but others point out that the Turks were outnumbered two to one by late 1918, and were not first-class troops. Horses were also ridden by the British officers of the <a href="Egyptian%20Camel%20Transport%20Corps">Egyptian Camel Transport Corps</a> in Egypt and the Levant during the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>s.

Indian cavalry participated in actions on both the Western and Palestinian fronts throughout the war. Members of the <a href="1st%20Indian%20Cavalry%20Division">1st</a> and <a href="2nd%20Indian%20Cavalry%20Division">2nd Indian Cavalry Division</a>s were active on the Western Front, including in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. During the battle of the Somme, the 20th Deccan Horse made a successful, mounted charge, assaulting a German position on Bazentin Ridge. The charge overran the German position, partially due to the effect on morale, as most soldiers were aware of cavalry's ineffectiveness in the west, and were therefore shocked to see it. A charge by the <a href="5th%20%28Mhow%29%20Cavalry%20Brigade">5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade</a> of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by barbed wire and machine guns. Such successful endings were unusual occurrences during the war. Several Indian cavalry divisions joined Allenby's troops in the spring of 1918 after being transferred from the Western Front.

When the war began, <a href="Lord%20Strathcona%27s%20Horse%20%28Royal%20Canadians%29">Lord Strathcona's Horse</a>, a Canadian cavalry regiment, was mobilized and sent to England for training. The regiment served as infantry in French trenches during 1915, and were not returned to their mounted status until February 16, 1916. In the defense of the <a href="Somme%20%28department%29">Somme</a> front in March 1917, mounted troops saw action, and Lieutenant <a href="Frederick%20Maurice%20Watson%20Harvey">Frederick Harvey</a> was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his actions. Canadian cavalry generally had the same difficulties as other nations in breaking trench warfare deadlocks and were of little use on the front lines. However, in the spring of 1918, Canadian cavalry was essential in halting the last major German offensive of the war. On March 30, 1918, Canadian cavalry charged German positions in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moreuil%20Wood">Battle of Moreuil Wood</a>, defeating a superior German force supported by machine gun fire. The charge was made by Lord Strathcona's Horse, led by <a href="Gordon%20Flowerdew">Gordon Flowerdew</a>, later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the charge. Although the German forces surrendered, three-quarters of the 100 cavalry participating in the attack were killed or wounded in the attack against 300 German soldiers.

The <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Mounted%20Division">Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division</a> (known as the ANZAC Mounted Division) was formed in Egypt in 1916, after the <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</a> (ANZAC) was disbanded. Comprising four brigades, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a> and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Mounted%20Rifles%20Brigade">New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade</a>. All had fought at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> dismounted. In August the division's dynamic capabilities were effectively combined with the static 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Romani">Battle of Romani</a>, where they repelled an attempted Ottoman attack on the Suez Canal. This victory stopped the advance of <a href="Friedrich%20Kre%C3%9F%20von%20Kressenstein">Kress von Kressenstein</a>'s Expeditionary Force (3rd Infantry Division and Pasha I formation) towards the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> and forced his withdrawal under pressure. An Ottoman garrison at <a href="Battle%20of%20Magdhaba">Magdhaba</a> was defeated in December 1916 by the division with the <a href="Imperial%20Camel%20Corps%20Brigade">Imperial Camel Corps Brigade</a> attached and the other major Ottoman fortification at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rafa">Rafah</a> was captured in January 1917. They participated mounted in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">First Battle of Gaza</a> in March, and the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Third Battle of Gaza</a> (including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Battle of Beersheba</a>) in October 1917. They attacked dismounted in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Second Battle of Gaza</a> in April 1917. In 1918, the ANZAC and <a href="Australian%20Mounted%20Division">Australian Mounted Division</a>s, along with the <a href="Yeomanry%20Mounted%20Division">Yeomanry Mounted Division</a> in the <a href="Desert%20Mounted%20Corps">Desert Mounted Corps</a>, conducted two attacks across the <a href="First%20Transjordan%20attack%20on%20Amman%20%281918%29">Jordan River to Amman</a> in March, then moved on to <a href="Second%20Transjordan%20attack%20on%20Shunet%20Nimrin%20and%20Es%20Salt">Es Salt</a> in April. The Australian Mounted Division were armed with swords mid year, and as part of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo</a> captured <a href="Amman">Amman</a> (capturing 10,300 prisoners), <a href="Battle%20of%20Nazareth%20%281918%29">Nazareth</a>, <a href="Capture%20of%20Jenin">Jenin</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Samakh">Samakh</a> in nine days. After the <a href="Armistice%20of%20Mudros">Armistice</a> they participated in the reoccupation of Gallipoli in December.

The ANZAC and Australian Mounted Divisions carried rifles, bayonets and machine guns, generally using horses as swift transport and dismounting to fight. Troops of four men were organised, so that three were fighting while the fourth held the horses. Sometimes they fought as mounted troops: at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Battle of Beersheba</a> during the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a> in 1917, the Australian Mounted Division's <a href="4th%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">4th Light Horse Brigade</a> made what is sometimes called "the last successful cavalry charge in history", when two regiments successfully overran Turkish trenches. They formed up over a wide area, to avoid offering a target for enemy artillery, and galloped into machine gun fire, equipped only with rifles and bayonets. Some of the front ranks fell, but most of the brigade broke through, their horses <a href="jumping%20%28horse%29">jumping</a> the trenches into the enemy camp. Some soldiers dismounted to fight in the trenches, while others raced on to Beersheba, to capture the town and its vital water supplies. The charge was "instrumental in securing Allenby's victory [in Palestine]".

The Australians primarily rode <a href="Waler%20horse">Waler horse</a>s. The English cavalry officer, Lieutenant Colonel RMP Preston <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">DSO</a>, summed up the animals' performance in his book, "The Desert Mounted Corps:"
... (November 16th, 1917) The operations had now continued for 17 days practically without cessation, and a rest was absolutely necessary especially for the horses. Cavalry Division had covered nearly 170 miles ... and their horses had been watered on an average of once in every 36 hours ... The heat, too, had been intense and the short rations,  lb of grain per day without bulk food, had weakened them greatly. Indeed, the hardship endured by some horses was almost incredible. One of the batteries of the Australian Mounted Division had only been able to water its horses three times in the last nine days—the actual intervals being 68, 72 and 76 hours respectively. Yet this battery on its arrival had lost only eight horses from exhaustion, not counting those killed in action or evacuated wounded ... The majority of horses in the Corps were Walers and there is no doubt that these hardy Australian horses make the finest cavalry mounts in the world ...

Before the war began, many continental European armies still considered the cavalry to hold a vital place in their order of battle. France and Russia expanded their mounted military units before 1914. Of the Central Powers, Germany added thirteen regiments of mounted riflemen, Austria–Hungary expanded their forces, and the Bulgarian army also readied the cavalry in their army. When the Germans invaded in August 1914, the Belgians had one division of cavalry.

French cavalry had similar problems with horses on the Western Front as the British, although the treatment of their horses created additional difficulties. Opinion generally was that the French were poor horsemen: "The French cavalryman of 1914 sat on his horse beautifully, but was no horsemaster. It did not occur to him to get off his horse's back whenever he could, so there were thousands of animals with sore backs ...". One French general, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Sordet">Jean-François Sordet</a>, was accused of not letting horses have access to water in hot weather. By late August 1914, a sixth of the horses in the French cavalry were unusable. The French continued to eschew mounted warfare when in a June 1918 charge by French lancers the horses were left behind and the men charged on foot.

Russia possessed thirty-six cavalry divisions when it entered the war in 1914, and the Russian government claimed that its horsemen would thrust deep into the heart of Germany. Although Russian mounted troops entered Germany, they were soon met by German forces. In the August 1914 <a href="Battle%20of%20Tannenberg%20%281914%29">Battle of Tannenberg</a>, troops led by German Field Marshal <a href="Paul%20von%20Hindenburg">Paul von Hindenburg</a> and Lieutenant-General <a href="Erich%20Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> surrounded the Russian <a href="Second%20Army%20%28Russian%20Empire%29">Second Army</a> and destroyed the mounted force of <a href="Don%20Cossacks">Don Cossacks</a> that served as the special guard of Russian General <a href="Alexander%20Samsonov">Alexander Samsonov</a>. Other Russian cavalry units successfully harassed retreating Austro-Hungarian troops in September 1914, with the running battle eventually resulting in the loss of 40,000 of the 50,000 men in the Austro-Hungarian <a href="XIV%20Tyrolean%20Corps">XIV Tyrolean Corps</a>, which included the <a href="6th%20Mounted%20Rifle%20Regiment">6th Mounted Rifle Regiment</a>. Transporting cavalry created a hardship for the already strained Russian infrastructure, as the great distances they needed to be moved meant that they had to be transported by train. Approximately the same number of trains (about 40) were required to transport a cavalry division of 4,000 as to transport an infantry division of 16,000.

The cavalries of the Central Powers, Germany and Austria–Hungary, faced the same problems with transport and the failure of tactics as the Russians. Germany initially made extensive use of cavalry, including a lance-against-lance battle with the British in late 1914, and an engagement between the British <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Cavalry Brigade</a> and the German <a href="4th%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28German%20Empire%29">4th Cavalry Division</a> in the lead-up to the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Marne">First Battle of the Marne</a> in September 1914. That battle ended "decidedly to the disadvantages of the German cavalry", partially due to the use of artillery by the accompanying British <a href="L%20%28N%C3%A9ry%29%20Battery%20Royal%20Horse%20Artillery">L Battery</a> of <a href="horse%20artillery">horse artillery</a>. The Germans stopped using cavalry on the Western Front not long after the beginning of the war, in response to the Allied Forces' changing battle tactics, including more advanced weaponry. They continued to use cavalry to some extent on the Eastern Front, including probes into Russian territory in early 1915. The Austrians were forced to stop using cavalry because of large-scale equipment failures; Austrian military saddles were so poorly designed as to rub the skin off the <a href="back%20%28horse%29">back</a> of any horse not already hardened to the equipment from parade ground practice; only a few weeks into the war half of all Austrian cavalry mounts were disabled, and the rest nearly so.

In 1914, the <a href="Second%20Constitutional%20Era%20%28Ottoman%20Empire%29">Ottoman Turks</a> began the war with one cavalry regiment in the <a href="Turkish%20Army">Turkish army corps</a> and four reserve regiments (originally formed in 1912) under the control of the <a href="Turkish%20Third%20Army">Turkish Third Army</a>. These reserve regiments were composed of <a href="Kurdish%20people">Kurds</a>, rural Turks and a few Armenians. The performance of the reserve divisions was poor, and in March 1915 the forces that survived were turned into two divisions totalling only two thousand men and seventy officers. Later that month, the best regiments were consolidated into one division and the rest disbanded. Nonetheless, cavalry was used by Ottoman forces throughout 1915 in engagements with the Russians, and one cavalry unit even exchanged small arms fire with a submarine crew in the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> in early 1915. Turkish cavalry was used in engagements with the British, including the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Third Battle of Gaza</a> in late 1917. In this battle, both sides used cavalry forces as strategic parts of their armies. Cavalry continued to be involved in engagements well into 1918, including in <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29%23Situation%20from%20the%20fall%20of%20Jerusalem%20to%20September%201918">conflicts near the Jordan River</a> in April and May that year, which the Ottomans called the First and Second Battles of Jordan, part of the lead-up to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo</a>. By September 1918, regular army cavalry forces were stationed throughout the Turkish front, and the only remaining operationally ready reserve forces in the Ottoman military were two cavalry divisions, one formed after the initial problems in 1915.

By 1916, the United States Cavalry consisted of 15,424 members organized into 15 regiments, including headquarters, supply, machine-gun and rifle troops. Just before formally joining the war effort, the US had gained significant experience in 1916 and 1917 during the <a href="Pancho%20Villa%20Expedition">Pancho Villa Expedition</a> in Mexico, which helped to prepare the US Cavalry for entry into World War I. In May 1917, a month after the US declaration of war, the <a href="National%20Defense%20Act%20of%201916">National Defense Act</a> went into effect, creating the 18th through the 25th US Cavalry regiments, and later that month, twenty more cavalry regiments were created. However, British experiences during the first years of the war showed that trench warfare and weapons that included machine guns and artillery made cavalry warfare impractical. Thus, on October 1, eight of the new cavalry regiments were converted to field artillery regiments by order of Congress, and by August 1918, twenty <a href="National%20Army%20%28USA%29">National Army</a> horse units were converted to thirty-nine trench mortar and artillery batteries. Some horse units of the <a href="2d%20Stryker%20Cavalry%20Regiment">2nd</a>, <a href="3d%20Armored%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">3rd</a>, <a href="6th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th</a> and <a href="15th%20Cavalry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">15th</a> Cavalry regiments accompanied the US forces in Europe. The soldiers worked mainly as <a href="groom%20%28horses%29">grooms</a> and <a href="farrier">farrier</a>s, attending to <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Remount%20Service">remounts</a> for the artillery, medical corps and transport services. It was not until late August 1918 that US cavalry entered combat. A provisional squadron of 418 officers and enlisted men, representing the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, and mounted on convalescent horses, was created to serve as scouts and couriers during the <a href="St.%20Mihiel%20Offensive">St. Mihiel Offensive</a>. On September 11, 1918, these troops rode at night through <a href="no%20man%27s%20land">no man's land</a> and penetrated five miles behind German lines. Once there, the cavalry was routed and had to return to Allied territory. Despite serving through the <a href="Meuse-Argonne%20Offensive">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a>, by mid-October the squadron was removed from the front with only 150 of its men remaining.

Horses were used extensively for <a href="Train%20%28military%29">military trains</a>. They were used to pull ambulances, carry supplies and <a href="wikt%3Aordnance">ordnance</a>. At the beginning of the war, the German army depended upon horses to pull its field kitchens, as well as the ammunition wagons for artillery brigades. The <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a> used horses to pull cable wagons, and the promptness of messengers and <a href="Despatch%20rider">dispatch riders</a> depended on their mounts. Horses often drew artillery and steady animals were crucial to artillery effectiveness. The deep mud common in some parts of the front, caused by damaged drainage systems flooding nearby areas, made horses and mules vital, as they were the only means of getting supplies to the front and guns moved from place to place. After the April 1917 <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a>, one Canadian soldier recalled, "the horses were up to their bellies in mud. We'd put them on a picket line between the wagon wheels at night and they'd be sunk in over their fetlocks the next day. We had to shoot quite a number."

Thousands of horses were employed to pull field guns; six to twelve horses were required to pull each gun. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a>, horses were used to recover guns captured by the British from no man's land. In one instance, two teams of sixteen horses each had their <a href="horse%20hoof">hooves</a>, tack and pulling chains wrapped to reduce noise. The teams and their handlers then successfully pulled out two guns and returned them to British lines, the horses jumping a trench in the process and waiting out an artillery barrage by German troops on the road they needed to take.

Dummy horses were sometimes used to deceive the enemy into misreading the location of troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with <a href="glanders">glanders</a>, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns in their ability to move artillery on the Eastern Front.

The value of horses was known to all. In 1917 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>, men at the front understood that "at this stage to lose a horse was worse than losing a man because after all, men were replaceable while horses weren't." For Britain, horses were considered so valuable that if a soldier's horse was killed or died he was required to cut off a hoof and bring it back to his commanding officer to prove that the two had not simply become separated.

To meet its need for horses, Britain imported them from Australia, Canada, the USA, and Argentina, and requisitioned them from British civilians. <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> ordered that no horses under should be confiscated, at the request of many British children, who were concerned for the welfare of their <a href="pony">ponies</a>. The British <a href="Army%20Remount%20Service">Army Remount Service</a>, in an effort to improve the supply of horses for potential military use, provided the services of high quality <a href="stallion">stallion</a>s to British farmers for breeding their <a href="mare">broodmares</a>. The already rare <a href="Cleveland%20Bay">Cleveland Bay</a> was almost wiped out by the war; smaller members of the breed were used to carry British troopers, while larger horses were used to pull <a href="artillery">artillery</a>. New Zealand found that horses over fared worse than those under that height. Well-built <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s of 15 hands and under worked well, as did compact horses of other breeds that stood . Larger <a href="crossbred">crossbred</a> horses were acceptable for regular work with plentiful rations, but proved less able to withstand short rations and long journeys. Riflemen with tall horses suffered more from fatigue, due to the number of times they were required to mount and dismount the animals. Animals used for draught work, including pulling artillery, were also found to be more efficient when they were of medium size with good endurance than when they were tall, heavy and long-legged.

The continued resupply of horses was a major issue of the war. One estimate puts the number of horses that served in World War I at around six million, with a large percentage of them dying due to war-related causes. In 1914, the year the war began, the British Army owned only about 25,000 horses. This shortfall required the US to help with remount efforts, even before it had formally entered the war. Between 1914 and 1918, the US sent almost one million horses overseas, and another 182,000 were taken overseas with American troops. This deployment seriously depleted the country's equine population. Only 200 returned to the US, and 60,000 were killed outright. By the middle of 1917, Britain had procured 591,000 horses and 213,000 mules, as well as almost 60,000 camels and oxen. Britain's Remount Department spent £67.5 million on purchasing, training and delivering horses and mules to the front. The British Remount Department became a major multinational business and a leading player in the international horse trade, through supplying horses to not only the British Army but also to Canada, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Portugal, and even a few to the US. Shipping horses between the US and Europe was both costly and dangerous; <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> officials calculated that almost seven times as much room was needed per ton for animals than for average wartime cargo, and over 6,500 horses and mules were drowned or killed by shell fire on Allied ships attacked by the Germans. In turn, New Zealand lost around 3 percent of the nearly 10,000 horses shipped to the front during the war.

Due to the high casualty rates, even the well-supplied American army was facing a deficit of horses by the final year of the war. After the <a href="First%20United%20States%20Army">American First Army</a>, led by General <a href="John%20J.%20Pershing">John J. Pershing</a>, pushed the Germans out of the <a href="Forest%20of%20Argonne">Argonne Forest</a> in late 1918, they were faced with a shortage of around 100,000 horses, effectively immobilizing the artillery. When Pershing asked <a href="Ferdinand%20Foch">Ferdinand Foch</a>, <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal of France</a>, for 25,000 horses, he was refused. It was impossible to obtain more from the US, as shipping space was limited, and Pershing's senior supply officer stated that "the animal situation will soon become desperate." The Americans, however, fought on with what they had until the end of the war, unable to obtain sufficient supplies of new animals.

Before World War I, Germany had increased its reserves of horses through state-sponsored <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a>s () and annuities paid to individual horse breeders. These breeding programs were designed specifically to provide high-quality horses and mules for the German military. These efforts, and the horse-intensive nature of warfare in the early 20th century, caused Germany to increase the ratio of horses to men in the army, from one to four in 1870 to one to three in 1914. The breeding programs allowed the Germans to provide all of their own horses at the beginning of the war. Horses were considered army reservists; owners had to register them regularly, and the army kept detailed records on the locations of all horses. In the first weeks of the war, the German army mobilized 715,000 horses and the Austrians 600,000. Overall, the ratio of horses to men in Central Powers nations was estimated at one to three.

The only way Germany could acquire large numbers of horses after the war began was by conquest. More than 375,000 horses were taken from German-occupied French territory for use by the German military. Captured Ukrainian territory provided another 140,000. The <a href="Ardennes%20%28horse%29">Ardennes</a> was used to pull artillery for the French and Belgian armies. Their calm, tolerant disposition, combined with their active and flexible nature, made them an ideal artillery horse. The breed was considered so useful and valuable that when the Germans established the Commission for the Purchase of Horses in October 1914 to capture Belgian horses, the Ardennes was one of two breeds specified as important, the other being the <a href="Belgian%20%28horse%29">Brabant</a>. The Germans were not able to capture the horses belonging to the Belgian royal family, as they were successfully evacuated, although they captured enough horses to disrupt Belgian agriculture and breeding programs. Horses used for the transport of goods were also taken, resulting in a fuel crisis in Belgium the next winter as there were no horses to pull coal wagons. The Germans sold some of their captured horses at auction. Prevented by the Allies from importing remounts, the Germans ultimately ran out of horses, making it difficult for them to move supplies and artillery, a factor contributing to their defeat.

Battle losses of horses were approximately 25 percent of all war-related equine deaths between 1914 and 1916. Disease and exhaustion accounted for the remainder. The highest death rates were in East Africa, where in 1916 alone deaths of the original mounts and remounts accounted for 290% of the initial stock numbers, mainly due to infection from the <a href="tsetse%20fly">tsetse fly</a>. On average, Britain lost about 15 percent (of the initial military stock) of its animals each year of the war (killed, missing, died or abandoned), with losses at 17 percent in the French theatre. This compared to 80 percent in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, 120 percent in the <a href="Boer%20War">Boer War</a> and 10 percent in peacetime. During some periods of the war, 1,000 horses per day were arriving in Europe as remounts for British troops, to replace horses lost. Some horses, having collapsed from exhaustion, drowned in ankle-deep mud, too tired to lift their heads high enough to breathe. Equine casualties were especially high during battles of attrition, such as the 1916 <a href="Battle%20of%20Verdun">Battle of Verdun</a> between French and German forces. In one day in March, 7,000 horses were killed by long-range shelling on both sides, including 97 killed by a single shot from a French naval gun. By 1917, Britain had over a million horses and mules in service, but harsh conditions, especially during winter, resulted in heavy losses, particularly amongst the <a href="Clydesdale%20horse">Clydesdale horse</a>s, the main breed used to haul the guns. Over the course of the war, Britain lost over 484,000 horses, one horse for every two men. A small number of these, 210, were killed by poison gas.

Feeding horses was a major issue, and horse <a href="fodder">fodder</a> was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated the amount of food they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.

Animals bolstered morale at the front, due to the soldiers' affection for them. Some recruitment posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses could also be a health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but fast-moving battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.
Many horses died as a result of the conditions at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, <a href="poison%20gas">poison gas</a> attacks that injured their <a href="respiratory%20system%20of%20the%20horse">respiratory systems</a> and skin, and skin conditions such as <a href="mange">mange</a>. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with <a href="feedbag">feedbag</a>s and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. In one year, 120,000 horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and <a href="horse%20trailer">horse trailer</a>s were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with <a href="equine%20influenza">equine influenza</a>, <a href="ringworm">ringworm</a>, <a href="colic">sand colic</a>, sores from fly bites, and <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> among the illnesses that affected them. British <a href="Royal%20Army%20Veterinary%20Corps">Army Veterinary Corps</a> hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.

When the war ended, many horses were killed due to age or illness, while younger ones were sold to <a href="horse%20slaughter">slaughterhouses</a> or to locals, often upsetting the soldiers who had to give up their beloved mounts. There were 13,000 Australian horses remaining at the end of World War I, but due to quarantine restrictions, they could not be shipped back to Australia. Two thousand were designated to be killed, and the remaining 11,000 were sold, most going to India as remounts for the British Army. Of the 136,000 horses shipped from Australia to fighting fronts in the war, only one, Sandy, was returned to Australia. New Zealand horses were also left behind; those not required by the British or Egyptian armies were shot to prevent maltreatment by other purchasers. The horses left behind did not always have good lives – the <a href="Brooke%20Hospital%20for%20Animals">Brooke Trust</a> was established in 1930 when a young British woman arrived in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, only to find hundreds of previously Allied-owned horses living in poor conditions, having been sold to Egyptians after the cessation of the war. In 1934, the Old War Horse Memorial Hospital was opened by the trust, and is estimated to have helped over 5,000 horses that had served in World War I; as of 2011, the hospital continues to serve equines in the Cairo area.

The horse is the animal most associated with the war, and memorials have been erected to its service, including that at <a href="St%20Jude%27s%20Church%2C%20Hampstead%20Garden%20Suburb">St. Jude on the Hill</a>, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, which bears the inscription "Most obediently and often most painfully they diedfaithful unto death." The <a href="Animals%20in%20War%20Memorial">Animals in War Memorial</a> in London commemorates animals, including horses, that served with the British and their allies in all wars. The inscription reads: "Animals In War. This monument is dedicated to all the animals that served and died alongside British and allied forces in wars and campaigns throughout time. They had no choice." In <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>, a monument by <a href="Lake%20of%20the%20Isles">Lake of the Isles</a> is dedicated to the horses of the Minnesota 151st Field Artillery killed in battle during World War I.

The men of the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">Australian Light Horse Brigade</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand%20Mounted%20Rifles%20Brigade">New Zealand Mounted Rifles</a> who died between 1916 and 1918 in Egypt, Palestine and Syria are commemorated by the <a href="Mounted%20Memorial%2C%20Canberra">Desert Mounted Corps Memorial</a>, or Light Horse Memorial, on <a href="Anzac%20Parade%2C%20Canberra">Anzac Parade</a>, in Canberra, Australia. The original version of this monument was in <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a> in Egypt, and was mostly destroyed during the <a href="1956%20Suez%20War">1956 Suez War</a>. A piece from the original memorial, a shattered horse's head, was brought back to Australia and used as part of a new statue in the A is for Animals exhibition honoring animals who have served with the Australian military. The exhibition also contains the preserved head of Sandy, the only horse to return to Australia after the war.
<a href="War%20artist">War artist</a> <a href="Alfred%20Munnings">Alfred Munnings</a> was sent to France in early 1918 as an official war artist with the Canadian Cavalry Brigade. The <a href="Canadian%20Forestry%20Corps">Canadian Forestry Corps</a> invited Munnings to tour their work camps in France after seeing some of his work at the headquarters of General Simms, the Canadian representative. He produced drawings, watercolors, and paintings of their work, including "Draft Horses, Lumber Mill in the Forest of Dreux" in 1918. Forty-five of his paintings were displayed at the Canadian War Records Exhibition at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>, many of which featured horses in war. Numerous other artists created works that featured the horses of World War I, including <a href="Umberto%20Boccioni">Umberto Boccioni</a> with "Charge of the Lancers" and <a href="Terence%20Cuneo">Terence Cuneo</a> with his celebrated postwar painting of the saving of the guns at <a href="Battle%20of%20Le%20Cateau">Le Cateau</a> during the <a href="Retreat%20from%20Mons">Retreat from Mons</a>. During World War I, artist <a href="Fortunino%20Matania">Fortunino Matania</a> created the iconic image "Goodbye Old Man" that would be used by both British and American organizations to raise awareness of the suffering of animals affected by war. The painting was accompanied by a poem, "The Soldiers Kiss", that also emphasized the plight of the horse in war.

Writing poetry was a means of passing the time for soldiers of many nations, and the horses of World War I figured prominently in several poems. In 1982, <a href="Michael%20Morpurgo">Michael Morpurgo</a> wrote the novel "<a href="War%20Horse%20%28novel%29">War Horse</a>", about a cavalry horse in the war. The book was later adapted into a successful <a href="War%20Horse%20%28play%29">play of the same name</a>, and also into a screenplay, with <a href="War%20Horse%20%28film%29">the movie</a>, released on December 25, 2011 in the United States. In January 2010, the <a href="History%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">History Channel</a> aired a documentary entitled "The Real War Horse", depicting the horses of World War I.

2009 New York's 20th congressional district special election

The 2009 special election for the 20th congressional district of New York was held on March 31, 2009, to fill the vacancy created in January 2009 when the district's representative, <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congresswoman</a> <a href="Kirsten%20Gillibrand">Kirsten Gillibrand</a>, was appointed <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20New%20York">US senator from New York</a>, replacing <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, who had been appointed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> in the <a href="Obama%20administration">Obama administration</a>. The two major-party candidates were <a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrat</a> <a href="Scott%20Murphy">Scott Murphy</a>, a private businessman, and <a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican</a> <a href="Jim%20Tedisco">Jim Tedisco</a>, the <a href="minority%20leader">minority leader</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">New York State Assembly</a>. A third-party candidate, <a href="Libertarian%20Party%20of%20New%20York">Libertarian</a> Eric Sundwall, was initially included in the race, but later removed from the ballot.

<a href="New%20York%27s%2020th%20congressional%20district">New York's 20th congressional district</a> has historically been conservative, and early polls favored Tedisco, but by February 2009 the race was considered a toss-up. The Republican Party considered the election to be a referendum on President Obama's <a href="Economic%20policy%20of%20Barack%20Obama">economic policy</a> and as such, injected significant funding into Tedisco's campaign, using well-known Republicans such as former <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a>, <a href="Minority%20Leader%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressional Minority Leader</a> <a href="John%20Boehner">John Boehner</a>, and former <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">New York Governor</a> <a href="George%20Pataki">George Pataki</a> for support. Democrats used Senator Gillibrand, <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a>, and an endorsement from <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> to support the Murphy campaign.

Major issues brought up during the campaign were the candidates' positions on President Obama's <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">stimulus plan</a>, which Tedisco did not take a stance on until late in the race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the <a href="AIG%20bonus%20payments%20controversy">AIG bonus scandal</a>. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy <a href="talking%20point">talking point</a> was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.

The race was so close that one early vote count had the candidates tied at 77,225 votes each. Absentee ballots decided the election; ballots were accepted until April 13. While Tedisco had been ahead in early counts, by April 10 Murphy was leading, and by April 23 Murphy had a 401-vote advantage. Tedisco conceded the race the following day, and Murphy was sworn in on April 29. Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy's clear support of the <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">stimulus package</a> were credited for his success.

New York's 20th district in 2009 encompassed all or part of <a href="Columbia%20County%2C%20New%20York">Columbia</a>, <a href="Dutchess%20County%2C%20New%20York">Dutchess</a>, <a href="Delaware%20County%2C%20New%20York">Delaware</a>, <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20New%20York">Essex</a>, <a href="Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York">Greene</a>, <a href="Otsego%20County%2C%20New%20York">Otsego</a>, <a href="Rensselaer%20County%2C%20New%20York">Rensselaer</a>, <a href="Saratoga%20County%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga</a>, <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20New%20York">Warren</a>, and <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20New%20York">Washington</a> counties. Traditionally conservative, it had been considered a <a href="safe%20seat">safe seat</a> for Republicans until <a href="Blue%20Dog%20Democrat">Blue Dog Democrat</a> Kirsten Gillibrand defeated <a href="incumbent">incumbent</a> <a href="John%20E.%20Sweeney">John E. Sweeney</a> in <a href="New%20York%27s%2020th%20congressional%20district%20election%2C%202006">the 2006 election</a>. In November 2008, the Republican Party held an enrollment advantage of 70,632 registered voters across the district, down from a 93,337-voter advantage when the district lines were drawn by the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> in 2002. Although Republican <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> carried the district by an eight-point margin in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202004">2004 presidential election</a>, Democrat <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> won the district <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">in 2008</a> by a three-point margin, or approximately 10,000 votes of over 330,000 cast. Gillibrand was reelected in 2008 by 24 points, a fourfold increase over her 2006 margin.

One of Barack Obama's first decisions as president-elect was to appoint <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>, US Senator from New York and former <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202008">Democratic presidential primary opponent</a>, as <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a>; Clinton resigned her Senate seat to take the position. The district's seat became vacant in January 2009 when <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20York">Governor</a> <a href="David%20Paterson">David Paterson</a> appointed Gillibrand to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> to replace Clinton. On February 23, 2009, Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the special election as March 31, 2009. Under state law, Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a special election until July 2010. Both the <a href="Stuart%20Rothenberg">Rothenberg</a> Political Report and the <a href="Cook%20Political%20Report">Cook Political Report</a> listed the race as a toss-up.

In lieu of <a href="political%20party">party</a> <a href="Primary%20election">primaries</a>, the party nominees were chosen by a weighted vote among the county committees. The weight of the vote depended on the population of registered party voters (Republican or Democrat) in a given county.

<a href="New%20York%20Senate">State Senator</a> <a href="Betty%20Little">Betty Little</a> and former state Assembly minority leader and <a href="New%20York%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%202006">2006 Republican gubernatorial candidate</a> <a href="John%20Faso">John Faso</a> had been in the running for the Republican nomination. Richard Wager, a former aide to <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">New York City Mayor</a> <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a>, and State Senator <a href="Stephen%20Saland">Stephen Saland</a> had also been mentioned. <a href="Alexander%20Treadwell">Alexander "Sandy" Treadwell</a>, the former <a href="New%20York%20Secretary%20of%20State">New York Secretary of State</a> and <a href="New%20York%27s%2020th%20congressional%20district%20election%2C%202008">2008 U.S. House challenger</a>, had announced he would not run. On January 24, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">State Assembly</a> <a href="Minority%20Leader">Minority Leader</a> <a href="Jim%20Tedisco">Jim Tedisco</a> received the endorsement of Saratoga County's Republican chairman, while the <a href="Greene%20County%2C%20New%20York">Greene County</a> GOP endorsed Faso.

Jim Tedisco was the eventual Republican nominee, winning the <a href="Grand%20Old%20Party">GOP</a> nomination on January 27, 2009. Tedisco represented the 110th Assembly District, which includes a significant portion of Saratoga County. Tedisco's primary residence was not in the congressional district, although he did own a house in <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga Springs</a> and much of his assembly district overlapped the congressional district. This issue would become a major talking point during the campaign.

On January 31, "<a href="The%20Post-Star">The Post-Star</a>" reported that the Democrats had narrowed the field of potential candidates from over two dozen applicants down to six. The Democratic chairpersons met with all six candidates at a <a href="diner">diner</a> in Albany on February 1, and selected <a href="Scott%20Murphy">Scott Murphy</a> of <a href="Glens%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Glens Falls</a>, president of the Upstate Venture Association of New York, as their candidate. Other confirmed candidates included <a href="Saratoga%20County">Saratoga County</a> Democratic Chairman Larry Bulman, former <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> goaltender <a href="Mike%20Richter">Mike Richter</a>, <a href="Coxsackie%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Coxsackie</a> Town Supervisor Alex Betke, and <a href="Tracey%20Brooks">Tracey Brooks</a>, failed candidate for the nomination for the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%20in%20New%20York%2C%202008%23District%2021">21st district election in 2008</a>.

New York allows <a href="electoral%20fusion">electoral fusion</a>, which is an arrangement allowing two or more <a href="Qualified%20New%20York%20parties">qualified parties</a> to list the same candidate on a ballot. The <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20New%20York%20State">Conservative Party</a> chose to cross-endorse Tedisco on February 9, while the <a href="Working%20Families%20Party">Working Families Party</a> gave its endorsement to Murphy on February 17. On March 1, the <a href="Independence%20Party%20of%20New%20York">Independence Party</a>, the largest third party in the 20th district, gave its endorsement to Murphy. This was the first time the Independence Party had endorsed a Democrat in the district.

Eric Sundwall, Chair of the <a href="Libertarian%20Party%20of%20New%20York">New York Libertarian Party</a>, was the Libertarian candidate for the seat. However, he was removed from the ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on the ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.

The campaigns agreed to hold four debates. The first debate took place on March 2, between Tedisco and Murphy. The second debate, sponsored by <a href="WMHT%20%28TV%29">WMHT</a> and the "<a href="Times%20Union%20%28Albany%29">Times Union</a>", took place on March 19 between Murphy and Libertarian candidate Eric Sundwall. Jim Tedisco held a <a href="town%20hall%20meeting">town hall meeting</a> rather than attend, claiming the debate was not one of the four originally agreed upon. The third debate took place on March 23 and the final debate was on March 26.

Strategists from both parties viewed the outcome of the race as a "referendum on President Obama's handling of the <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20United%20States">economy</a>". Chairman <a href="Michael%20Steele">Michael Steele</a> of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> said the special election was the first of three elections that were "incredibly important" for the Republicans to win. The Republican leadership made this race a top priority, and Chairman Steele, former Governor <a href="George%20Pataki">George Pataki</a>, <a href="House%20Minority%20Leader">House Minority Leader</a> <a href="John%20Boehner">John Boehner</a>, and former <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a> <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> helped Tedisco with fundraising. Steele visited the district twice. On the Democratic side, Senator Gillibrand appeared in commercials and <a href="robocalls">robocalls</a> for Murphy, and Senator <a href="Chuck%20Schumer">Chuck Schumer</a> helped Murphy's campaign with fundraising. Less than a week before the election, President Obama formally endorsed Murphy in a mass email to supporters and urged supporters to organize and vote for Murphy. A radio ad <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> recorded for Murphy was released on March 25. That same day, <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> (DNC) Chairman <a href="Tim%20Kaine">Tim Kaine</a> emailed 500 of the party's top donors asking them to contribute to Murphy's campaign.
The RNC spent $100,000 on Tedisco's behalf. The <a href="Democratic%20Congressional%20Campaign%20Committee">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a> spent $150,000 and the <a href="Service%20Employees%20International%20Union">Service Employees International Union</a> spent $315,000 for Murphy. The <a href="New%20York%20State%20United%20Teachers">New York State United Teachers</a> made an effort to call its members on Murphy's behalf, while the <a href="National%20Right%20to%20Life">National Right to Life</a>, <a href="National%20Republican%20Trust%20Political%20Action%20Group">National Republican Trust</a> and <a href="New%20York%20State%20Rifle%20and%20Pistol%20Association">New York State Rifle and Pistol Association</a> organizations paid for ads and mailings supporting Tedisco.

Each candidate aimed to discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the <a href="National%20Republican%20Congressional%20Committee">National Republican Congressional Committee</a> (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.

Murphy spent the first months of the campaign criticizing Tedisco's early refusal to disclose his position on President Obama's <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act</a>. When Tedisco came out in opposition to the legislation on March 16, Murphy responded by writing "it's just shameful it took well over a month for Assemblyman Tedisco to finally admit that he'd vote 'No'". Murphy's campaign described Tedisco as a career Albany politician.

By mid-March, a provision in the stimulus package that grandfathered in bonuses paid to executives at troubled insurance giant <a href="AIG">AIG</a> and other <a href="Troubled%20Assets%20Relief%20Program">TARP</a> recipients became a campaign issue. Tedisco, who had been criticized by Murphy for opposing the package, used the <a href="AIG%20bonus%20payments%20controversy">outrage over the AIG bonuses</a> to reframe the debate. On March 19, Tedisco called for the resignation of <a href="United%20States%20Treasury%20Secretary">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Tim%20Geithner">Tim Geithner</a> over the AIG controversy. Murphy responded by insisting that the stimulus package was necessary for job creation.

With 100 percent of precincts reporting, initial counts from the election had Murphy leading by about 60 votes out of over 150,000 cast. Columbia County's Board of Elections amended its tally the following day, reducing Murphy's lead to 25 votes. The lead alternated between the two candidates throughout early recanvassing; at one point the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Board%20of%20Elections">New York State Board of Elections</a> had listed the election at a zero-vote margin, with each candidate having exactly 77,225 votes. By April 2, Tedisco was ahead by 12 votes. He resigned the position of Assembly Minority Leader on April 5 in preparation for a transition to Congress, and was replaced by <a href="Brian%20Kolb">Brian Kolb</a> the following day. On April 7, Tedisco was ahead by 97 votes. The close tally meant that absentee ballots would decide the race.

All ballots, absentee ballot envelopes, and voting machines were impounded under a court injunction sought by state Republicans. Under the court order, absentee ballots were counted in central locations rather than individual precincts. Of the 10,000 absentee ballots sent out to voters, 6,000 were returned. Absentee ballots mailed within the United States had to be received by April 7 to be counted. The deadline for overseas (including military) ballots was extended to April 13 after the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> sued the state to ensure they would have a reasonable chance of being counted. Counting of the absentee ballots due by April 7 began on April 8 under a <a href="New%20York%20State%20Supreme%20Court">New York State Supreme Court</a> ruling sought by Murphy's campaign.

The legality of about 600 absentee ballots were contested during the count, including Senator Gillibrand's ballot. By April 23, Murphy was ahead by 401 votes, and Tedisco conceded the following day. Murphy was sworn in on April 29. The official results came out in May and had Murphy winning the election with 80,833 votes (50.23%) against Tedisco's 80,107 votes (49.77%).

Murphy's victory was credited to a <a href="coattail%20effect">coattail effect</a> from Barack Obama's <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">election in 2008</a>. His support of the stimulus package and Tedisco's failed attempt at clearly explaining his (Tedisco's) opposition to the package also had an impact. Further explanations for the Republican defeat ranged from accusations that Tedisco "dither on the stimulus bill", to intimations that Tedisco only became his party's nominee by manipulating the selection process. In an editorial, the "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>" contended that being an "Albany careerist" and running confusing campaign ads had hurt Tedisco. Tedisco's loss immediately made him appear vulnerable to Democrats hoping to capture his seat in the Assembly.

The day after being sworn in, Murphy hired Todd Schulte, his campaign manager, as his new chief of staff. He also hired one of Governor Paterson's aides, Maggie McKeon, as his communications director. For his district director, Murphy turned to Rob Scholz, a Republican. Scholz had worked on Murphy's campaign and had received praise from Larry Bulman, the chairman of the Saratoga County Democratic Committee. Within a month of being elected, Murphy opened offices in Saratoga Springs and <a href="Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Hudson</a>. Murphy served the remainder of his term, but lost a reelection bid on November 2, 2010, to challenger <a href="Chris%20Gibson%20%28New%20York%20politician%29">Chris Gibson</a>, a retired <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>.
