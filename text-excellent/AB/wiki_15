Southern Rhodesia in World War I

When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany at the start of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in August 1914, settler society in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>, then <a href="company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">administered</a> by the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a>, received the news with great patriotic enthusiasm. The Company <a href="administrator%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">administrator</a>, <a href="William%20Henry%20Milton">Sir William Milton</a>, wired the UK government, "All Rhodesia ... ready to do its duty". Although it supported Britain, the Company was concerned about the possible financial implications for its chartered territory should it make direct commitments to the war effort, particularly at first, so most of the colony's contribution to the war was made by Southern Rhodesians individually—not only those who volunteered to fight abroad, but also those who remained at home and raised funds to donate food, equipment and other supplies.

Starting immediately after the outbreak of war, parties of white Southern Rhodesians paid their own way to England to join the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. Most Southern Rhodesians who served in the war enlisted in this way and fought on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, taking part in many of the major battles with an assortment of British, South African and other colonial units, most commonly the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a>, which recruited hundreds of men from the colony, and created homogenous Rhodesian platoons. Troopers from Southern Rhodesia became renowned on the Western Front for their marksmanship, a result of their frontier lifestyle. Some of the colony's men served in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a>, one of the two predecessors of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. The <a href="Rhodesia%20Regiment">Rhodesia Regiment</a>, the <a href="Rhodesia%20Native%20Regiment">Rhodesia Native Regiment</a> and the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Police">British South Africa Police</a> served in the <a href="African%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">African theatre</a> of the conflict, contributing to the <a href="South-West%20Africa%20Campaign">South-West African</a> and <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">East African campaigns</a>.

Though it was one of the few combatant territories not to raise fighting men through <a href="conscription">conscription</a>, proportional to white population, Southern Rhodesia contributed more manpower to the British war effort than any other dominion or colony, and more than Britain itself. White troops numbered 5,716, about 40% of white men in the colony, with 1,720 of these serving as <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned officers</a>. The Rhodesia Native Regiment enlisted 2,507 black soldiers, about 30 black recruits scouted for the Rhodesia Regiment, and around 350 served in British and South African units. Over 800 Southern Rhodesians of all races lost their lives on operational service during the war, with many more seriously wounded.

The territory's contributions during the First World War became a major entry in many histories of the colony, and a great source of pride for the white community, as well as for some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant <a href="responsible%20government">self-government</a> in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">unilaterally declared independence</a> from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.

At the time of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (also known as the First World War or the Great War), <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> was <a href="company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">administered</a> by the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a>, which had controlled it and <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The <a href="white%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white</a> population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern Rhodesia had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the <a href="chartered%20company">Chartered Company</a> and those who advocated <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a>, which would make Southern Rhodesia a <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing colony</a> within the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a>, which had been formed in 1910. Following the intervention of the war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.

Before 1914, Southern Rhodesia's police force was the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Police">British South Africa Police</a> (BSAP), first raised in 1889 and reconstituted into a more permanent form in 1896. This paramilitary, mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country's standing army. Organised along military lines, it served in the <a href="First%20Matabele%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Matabele%20War">Second Matabele War</a>s of the 1890s, operated on Britain's side in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Anglo-Boer War</a> of 1899–1902 (alongside the specially-raised <a href="Rhodesia%20Regiment">Rhodesia Regiment</a>), and by 1914 comprised about 1,150 men (including officers). Reserves existed in the form of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, an all-white amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers in a conventional war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only.

When Britain declared war on Germany at 23:00 <a href="Greenwich%20Mean%20Time">Greenwich Mean Time</a> on 4 August 1914, the British Empire's <a href="dominion">dominion</a>s and colonies automatically became involved as well. Word of this reached the Southern Rhodesian capital <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a> during the night. Early on 5 August, the Company <a href="administrator%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">administrator</a> <a href="William%20Henry%20Milton">Sir William Milton</a> wired <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Whitehall</a>: "All Rhodesia united in devoted loyalty to King and Empire and ready to do its duty." A few hours later he officially announced to the populace that Southern Rhodesia was at war. The "<a href="The%20Herald%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Rhodesia Herald</a>" and "Bulawayo Chronicle" newspapers published special editions the same day to spread the news; it took about half a week for word to reach the whole country, but <a href="jingoism">jingoistic</a> demonstrations began in the major towns almost immediately.

In the words of the historian <a href="Peter%20McLaughlin">Peter McLaughlin</a>, the Southern Rhodesian settlers "seemed to out-British the British" in their patriotic zeal, so it was to the frustration of many of them that the Company did not immediately commit to any martial action. While it sent supportive messages to Whitehall, the Company felt it could not raise any kind of expeditionary force without first considering the implications for its administrative operations; as a commercial concern, it was possible for the Company to go bankrupt. Who would foot the bill for war expenditure, its hierarchy pondered: the Company itself, the Rhodesian taxpayers or the British government?

As the local newspapers filled with letters from readers clamouring for Rhodesian troops to be mustered and despatched to Europe post-haste, the administration limited its initial contribution to posting a section of BSAP troopers to the <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Bridge">Victoria Falls Bridge</a> to guard against possible German attack from <a href="German%20South-West%20Africa">South-West Africa</a> though the <a href="Caprivi%20Strip">Caprivi Strip</a>. In early September, an indignant letter to the "Rhodesia Herald" from Colonel <a href="Raleigh%20Grey">Raleigh Grey</a>, a major figure in local business, politics and military matters, accused the Company of bringing "a slur on a British country" by doing so little.

A few days after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an amorphous entity intended to accommodate the many white men who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the <a href="Legion%20of%20Frontiersmen">Legion of Frontiersmen</a> and other local organisations mirrored the <a href="Pals%20battalion">Pals battalion</a>s in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.

The Company suggested to the UK government that it might despatch 500 troopers from the Rhodesian Reserves to Europe to act as an all-Southern Rhodesian unit on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> (in Belgium and France), but the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> in London replied that such an expeditionary force would be more practically deployed in Africa, within the South African forces. When the Company relayed this idea south, the South Africans said they were happy to take the Southern Rhodesians, but only if they enlisted independently in existing Union regiments. The Company found itself in the unusual position of having a prospective expeditionary force that nobody wanted. Unwilling to wait, some Southern Rhodesian would-be soldiers made their own way to England to join the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> directly, as individuals or in groups. By the end of October 1914, about 300 were on their way.

In terms of fighting manpower, Southern Rhodesia's main contribution to World War I was in the <a href="trench%20warfare">trenches</a> of the Western Front. As the white Southern Rhodesians in this theatre joined the British Army separately, at different times and under their own steam (or were already connected to specific units as reservists), they were spread across dozens of regiments, including the <a href="Black%20Watch">Black Watch</a>, the <a href="Coldstream%20Guards">Coldstream Guards</a>, the <a href="Grenadier%20Guards">Grenadier Guards</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>, as well as many South African units and others. During the war's opening months, Southern Rhodesian volunteers who could not afford to travel to England were assisted by a private fund set up by <a href="Ernest%20Lucas%20Guest">Ernest Lucas Guest</a>, a Salisbury lawyer and Anglo-Boer War veteran who also organised an accompanying recruitment campaign for European service. Guest stopped recruiting at the Company's request after it created the <a href="Rhodesia%20Regiment">1st Rhodesia Regiment</a>, an expeditionary force to South and South-West Africa, in October 1914.

A link developed during the war with the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a> (KRRC), whose Southern Rhodesian contingent—numbering a few hundred, chiefly in its 2nd and 3rd Battalions—was the largest on the Western Front. The connection with this particular corps began as the result of a chance conversation aboard the ship that took the first batch of Southern Rhodesians from <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> in late 1914. The <a href="Henry%20Paulet%2C%2016th%20Marquess%20of%20Winchester">16th Marquess of Winchester</a>, who had links with Rhodesia dating back to the 1890s, was also aboard the ship, returning from a visit to the colony. Encountering Captain <a href="John%20Banks%20Brady">John Banks Brady</a>, the officer of Irish origin who led the volunteers, the Marquess asked where his party was headed. Brady enthusiastically replied that they were going to war together in France. The Marquess suggested to Brady that since it might be difficult to prevent his men from being split up during the enlistment process, it might be a good idea for the Rhodesians to join the KRRC, where he could keep an eye on them through his connections with the <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>-based regiment. The Southern Rhodesian contingent duly mustered into the KRRC. A designated Rhodesian platoon, widely referred to thereafter as "the Rhodesian Platoon", was formed under Brady at the KRRC training camp at <a href="Sheerness">Sheerness</a>, on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>.
As a rule, the white Rhodesians overseas combined stridently pro-British attitudes with an even stronger pride in Rhodesia. Many of them saw participation in the war, particularly in distinct "Rhodesian" formations, as a step towards forging a distinctive national identity, like those of Australia and the other more mature British dominions, and building a case for Southern Rhodesian self-government. The existence of an explicitly Rhodesian Platoon in the KRRC endeared the regiment to the Southern Rhodesian public, and attracted many of the colony's volunteers who arrived in England later in the war; in time, the KRRC formed further Rhodesian platoons from additional personnel. While the average Rhodesian colonial, living on the frontier of the Empire, was at least casually acquainted with rifles, most Englishmen had never held one. At Sheerness, Brady's Rhodesian Platoon won a reputation for fine sharpshooting, and set a regimental record score at the shooting range.

Once posted to France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost immediately began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often took a few months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive <a href="battle%20cry">battle cry</a> that their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of <a href="Shona%20language">Shona</a> and <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20language">Sindebele</a> (two African languages) instead of English.
Trench warfare was a dreadful ordeal for soldiers, and the Southern Rhodesians, coming from the open <a href="veld">veld</a> of southern Africa, had a particularly difficult time getting used to the cold and the mud. Brady reported that some of his men had contracted <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a> within 48 hours of reaching the trenches. Despite this, the KRRC's Rhodesians acquitted themselves well in the eyes of their superiors; Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Edward%20Hutton%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Sir Edward Hutton</a>, who wrote a history of the KRRC, commented that the Southern Rhodesian contingent "earned for itself great reputation for valour and good shooting". Southern Rhodesians became especially valuable to the KRRC as designated <a href="sniper">sniper</a>s, <a href="grenadier">grenadier</a>s, <a href="Lewis%20Gun">Lewis Gun</a>ners and other specialists. While discussing a KRRC sniper section, Hutton singles its Southern Rhodesian members out for their fine marksmanship, commenting that "accustomed to <a href="Big-game%20hunting">big game shooting</a>, [they] particularly excelled in this system of 'snipers', and inflicted continual losses upon the enemy". In their 2008 history of sniping, Pat Farey and Mark Spicer highlight the prowess of South African and Rhodesian sharpshooters on the Western Front, and claim that one group of 24 southern Africans collectively accounted for over 3,000 German casualties and fatalities.
So many Southern Rhodesians were withdrawn from the trenches for officer training that in mid-1915 Brady appealed through the Salisbury and <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a> presses for more volunteers to replace those who had been commissioned. A platoon of Southern Rhodesians with the 2nd Battalion, KRRC took part in the "big push" of 1 July 1916, the <a href="First%20day%20on%20the%20Somme">first day</a> of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Battle of the Somme</a>, charging German positions elsewhere on the line early that morning. There were 90 Rhodesians on the eve of the attack and only 10 alive and unwounded afterwards. On the Somme battlefield itself, Rhodesians were among those at <a href="Battle%20of%20Delville%20Wood">Delville Wood</a>, which began on 14 July. This was the South African <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28South%20Africa%29">1st Infantry Brigade</a>'s first engagement, and some of the colonials <a href="blackface">blacked up</a> and imitated <a href="Zulu%20Kingdom">Zulu</a> battle cries and war dances. Despite suffering casualties of catastrophic proportions—about 80% of the brigade's personnel were killed, wounded or captured—they took the Wood and held it as ordered until they were relieved on 20 July. By the time of its withdrawal, the South African Brigade, originally numbering 3,155 (123 officers and 3,032 other ranks), had been reduced to 19 officers and 600 men. Delville Wood was later described by <a href="B.%20H.%20Liddell%20Hart">Sir B H Liddell Hart</a> as "the bloodiest battle hell of 1916". "God knows I never wish to see such horrible sights again," a Southern Rhodesian veteran of the battle wrote home; "at times I wished it would come fast, anything to get out of that terrible death-trap and murderous place."

German <a href="Chemical%20weapons%20in%20World%20War%20I">gas attacks</a> were among the most traumatic experiences for the Southern Rhodesians in Europe. One Rhodesian survivor of a gas attack described the sensation as like "suffocation, [or] slow drowning". The Germans used both disabling agents, such as <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> and the more severe <a href="Sulfur%20mustard">mustard gas</a>, and lethal chemicals like <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> and <a href="phosgene">phosgene</a>. Though generally not fatal, gas attacks caused extreme physical discomfort and pain, often to the point where soldiers lost consciousness. Mustard gas in particular caused blistering of the skin, vomiting and internal and external bleeding. The British Army issued <a href="gas%20mask">gas mask</a>s, but according to Brady these did little to help the men. Injuries sustained to the eyes, lungs and nasal passages in gas attacks were often extremely debilitating and lasting, remaining with the men for years after the war.

In July 1917, a KRRC Rhodesian platoon received lofty praise from a senior British officer, who described the colonials as "absolutely first-class soldiers and great gentlemen, every bit as good as soldiers ... as our old <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Expeditionary Force</a>". Around the same time, a platoon of Southern Rhodesians in the KRRC took part in an engagement near <a href="Nieuwpoort%2C%20Belgium">Nieuwpoort</a> in <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, where it and the <a href="Northamptonshire%20Regiment">Northamptonshire Regiment</a> manned positions on the eastern banks of the river <a href="Yser">Yser</a>. After a heavy artillery bombardment, German infantry and marines charged the British positions and surrounded the Rhodesian platoon. Brutal hand-to-hand fighting ensued in which most of the Southern Rhodesians were killed and some were taken prisoner. The "Bulawayo Chronicle" ran a eulogy for them soon after, comparing their <a href="last%20stand">last stand</a> to that of <a href="Allan%20Wilson%20%28army%20officer%29">Allan Wilson</a>'s <a href="Shangani%20Patrol">Shangani Patrol</a> in 1893. Later in 1917, a Rhodesian platoon in the KRRC fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>, near <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> in western Flanders.

The Western Front continued to receive Southern Rhodesian troops right up to the end of the war, including veterans of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment's campaign in East Africa. During the conflict's latter stages, the British Army sent some of its Southern Rhodesian officers to the Western Front to promote the colony's benefits, hoping to encourage emigration there by British servicemen after the war.

The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, including a platoon of 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the <a href="Macedonian%20Front">Salonika Front</a> in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled down over the course of the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed. Most of the men had been killed in action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.

Some Southern Rhodesians mustered into the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> (RFC), which merged with the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> in April 1918 to form the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. Towards the end of the war, the service of airmen from the dominions and colonies was observed by the issuing of shoulder patches denoting the wearer's country of origin: from October 1918, Southern Rhodesians received labels marked "". One of the territory's first military aviators was Lieutenant Arthur R H Browne, a fighter pilot from <a href="Mvuma">Umvuma</a> in the Southern Rhodesian <a href="Midlands%20Province">Midlands</a>, who was attached to No. 13 Squadron, RFC. He was killed in action in a <a href="dogfight">dogfight</a> on 5 December 1915; his aircraft, donated by the people of <a href="Kadoma%2C%20Zimbabwe">Gatooma</a> in western <a href="Mashonaland">Mashonaland</a>, was Gatooma No. 2, one of five aeroplanes purchased by Southern Rhodesian public donations. From Dryden Farm, near the south-western border town of <a href="Plumtree%2C%20Zimbabwe">Plumtree</a>, came Lieutenant Frank W H Thomas, an RFC combat pilot who won the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>, as well as the French "<a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre</a>" (with palms), before he died on 5 January 1918 from wounds attained on operational service.

Lieutenant Daniel S "Pat" Judson, born in Bulawayo in 1898, became the first Rhodesia-born airman in history when he joined the RFC in April 1916. He was severely wounded while bombing enemy positions in March 1918, but recovered and remained in the unit until April 1919. The first <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a> born in Rhodesia was Major <a href="George%20Lloyd%20%28aviator%29">George Lloyd</a>, nicknamed "Zulu", who joined No. 60 Squadron in April 1917, and won four aerial victories before transferring to No. 40 Squadron in July 1917, where he won four more. He received the Military Cross in March 1918 for "conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty", and also won the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> later that year. Second Lieutenant David "Tommy" Greswolde-Lewis, a born and bred Bulawayan, was the <a href="List%20of%20victories%20of%20Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">80th and final</a> pilot defeated by <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Manfred von Richthofen</a>, the German ace widely known as the Red Baron. Richthofen downed Lewis just north-east of <a href="Villers-Bretonneux">Villers-Bretonneux</a> on 20 April 1918; the Rhodesian's aircraft caught fire in mid-air, and when it crashed he was thrown from the wreckage. The Baron's bullets had hit Lewis' compass, goggles, coat and trouser leg, but he was practically unhurt, having suffered only minor burns. He spent the rest of the war a German prisoner.

The Great War airman associated with Southern Rhodesia who ultimately earned the most distinction was <a href="Sir%20Arthur%20Harris%2C%201st%20Baronet">Arthur Harris</a>, originally from England, who joined the Royal Flying Corps in late 1915 after serving as a <a href="bugle">bugle</a>r with the 1st Rhodesia Regiment in South-West Africa. Harris alternated between Britain and France during the latter part of the war. He led <a href="No.%2045%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 45 Squadron</a> over the Western Front in 1917, destroying five German aircraft and winning the Air Force Cross, and afterwards commanded <a href="No.%2044%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 44 Squadron</a> in Britain. Intending to return to Southern Rhodesia after the war, he wore a "" flash on his uniform during the hostilities, but ended up staying with the RAF as a career officer. He finished the war a major, rose through the ranks during the interwar period and became famous during World War II as "Bomber Harris", the head of <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">RAF Bomber Command</a>.

Apart from the capture of <a href="Luhonono">Schuckmannsburg</a> in the Caprivi Strip by a combined force of BSAP and <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia%20Police">Northern Rhodesia Police</a> on 21 September 1914, the British South Africa Company's own armed forces and police remained almost totally uninvolved in the war until the following month. The South African Prime Minister, the former Boer general <a href="Louis%20Botha">Louis Botha</a>, had told Britain that the Union could both handle its own security during the hostilities and defeat German South-West Africa without help, so the Imperial garrison had been sent to the Western Front. Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Manie%20Maritz">Manie Maritz</a>—an ex-Boer commander who now headed a column of <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a>-speaking Union troops—defected to the Germans in mid-September, hoping to spark an uprising that would overthrow British supremacy in South Africa and restore the old <a href="Boer%20Republic">Boer Republic</a>s. Botha requested the 500-man column that the Chartered Company had raised, hoping to reduce the possibility of further defections by interspersing his own forces with firmly pro-British Rhodesians. The expeditionary force was promptly formalised in Salisbury, and named the <a href="Rhodesia%20Regiment">1st Rhodesia Regiment</a> after the unit of Southern Rhodesian volunteers that had fought in the Anglo-Boer War. Apart from a small contingent of <a href="Northern%20Ndebele%20people">Matabele</a> (or Ndebele) scouts, the unit was all white.
After six weeks' training in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, the last stop before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. Notwithstanding these grand farewells, the <a href="Maritz%20Rebellion">Maritz Rebellion</a> was all but over by the time the Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at <a href="Bloemfontein">Bloemfontein</a>. The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed. The Rhodesians garrisoned Bloemfontein for about a month, then redeployed to Cape Town, where they underwent further training for the <a href="South-West%20Africa%20Campaign">South-West Africa Campaign</a> as part of South Africa's Northern Force, which Botha personally commanded.

During late December 1914, Northern Force travelled to the South African <a href="Enclave%20and%20exclave">exclave</a> of <a href="Walvis%20Bay">Walvis Bay</a>, about halfway up the coast of German South-West Africa. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment disembarked on 26 December 1914.

Northern Force made up the northern prong of a pincer movement designed by Botha to encircle the German forces in South-West Africa. Two smaller South African columns came from the Cape and the Orange Free State (the latter coming over the deserts of <a href="Bechuanaland">Bechuanaland</a>). The principal target was Windhoek, the capital of South-West Africa. The field of operations was arid and barren in the extreme; water was a precious commodity, so the South Africans and Southern Rhodesians brought thousands of tons of it with them. In the of desert between Walvis Bay and Windhoek, temperatures could rise to above in the daytime, then drop below freezing at night, all while desert winds blew sand and dust into every bodily and mechanical orifice. Germany based much of its defensive strategy in South-West Africa around the assumption that no enemy commander could feasibly attempt to advance across the desert from Walvis Bay to Windhoek, but Botha resolved to do exactly that.

The South African offensive from Walvis Bay began in February 1915, when Northern Force took <a href="Swakopmund">Swakopmund</a>—the nearest German coastal settlement, about north—without facing major resistance. The Germans almost immediately retreated, leaving behind explosive booby traps and other improvised weapons. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment first engaged the Germans while Northern Force moved east across the desert, taking part in a number of minor skirmishes and suffering its first two fatalities in a German ambush. To overcome the natural difficulties of the desert terrain, Botha used fast-moving mounted or mechanised troops rather than regular infantry, so the Southern Rhodesian contingent played little part in the main advance on Windhoek. The Rhodesians guarded the construction of a railway inland for much of the campaign, but participated in Northern Force's victory over the Germans at Trekkopjes, losing Lieutenant Hollingsworth (killed in action) and five enlisted men (wounded). Windhoek surrendered to Botha in July 1915, effectively ending the South-West African front of the war. The local German population did not embark on a <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla</a> campaign after Windhoek's fall.

The 1st Rhodesia Regiment was soon posted back to Cape Town, where many of the troopers voiced their dissatisfaction at the lack of fighting in South-West Africa, and requested discharge so they could join the war in Europe. Superiors assured the men that they would see action in East Africa if they stayed, but failed to convince most of them; the 1st Rhodesia Regiment promptly disbanded due to a lack of personnel. The majority of the South-West Africa veterans boarded ship for England to enlist in the British Army, while others mustered into South African units already billed for European service.

<a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a>, acquired by Germany during the 1880s, covered roughly , and by 1914 was home to about 5,000 white settlers, most of whom were of German origin. German East African soldiery at the outbreak of war comprised 216 German officers and enlisted men, and 2,450 "<a href="askari">askari</a>s" (native soldiers); police numbered 45 whites and 2,154 "askaris". Because of the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s domination of the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, German East Africa was largely isolated from outside help. It therefore fought a war of improvisation, judicious resource management and unorthodox strategy. During the conflict, its military strength grew to a peak of 3,300 whites and anywhere between 15,000 and 30,000 "askaris", all commanded by "Generalmajor" <a href="Paul%20von%20Lettow-Vorbeck">Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck</a>.

Based around the overflow of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, a core of personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved that they might have to travel to Europe to be sure of doing so. Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.

Because it was raised with less urgency, the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment received better training than the 1st. The course lasted eight weeks, a fortnight longer than the original regiment's training period, and focused heavily on route marching, parade drill, and, in particular, marksmanship—recruits were trained to shoot accurately at ranges of up to . The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment left Salisbury on 8 March 1915, moving east to the port of <a href="Beira%2C%20Mozambique">Beira</a> in <a href="Portuguese%20Mozambique">Portuguese Mozambique</a>, from where they sailed to <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a> in British <a href="Kenya%20Colony">Kenya</a>, on German East Africa's north-eastern flank. Travelling aboard the SS "Umzumbi", the battalion disembarked in Kenya less than a week after leaving Salisbury. It was immediately sent inland to the operational area around <a href="Mount%20Kilimanjaro">Mount Kilimanjaro</a>, within sight of which it set up camp. On 20 March, the regiment was inspected by General J M Stewart of the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a>. "I had expected to see a regiment that would require some training," Stewart said; "I will pay you the highest compliment by sending you to the front today." So began the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment's contribution to the <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">East African Campaign</a>.

The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment operated with some success during its first year on the front. It usually defeated German units that it encountered, but the Germans, using proto-guerrilla tactics, tended to retreat before they could be overrun. Though generally outnumbered and outgunned throughout the campaign, the Germans had the advantage early on of longer-range artillery than the British; from July to August 1916, 2RR was prevented from moving out of the Kenyan town of <a href="Makindu">Makindu</a> for nearly a month by German bombardment. The huge marching distances, difficult terrain and uncertainty of surroundings meant that the regiment's men were forced to develop enormous stamina and resilience if they were not to be invalided home.

Tropical disease killed or rendered ineffective far more 2RR men than the Germans did; at times the regiment was reduced to an effective strength of under 100 by the vast myriad of potential ailments, including <a href="trench%20fever">trench fever</a>, <a href="blackwater%20fever">blackwater fever</a>, <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a> and many others. The 1,038 personnel who served with 2RR in East Africa collectively went into hospital 2,272 times, and there were 10,626 incidences of illness—in other words, the average 2RR soldier was hospitalised twice and reported sick 10 times. In January 1917, only 91 of the regiment's men were considered fit for duty; it was no longer an effective fighting force, and the white Southern Rhodesian manpower did not exist to continue reinforcing it. It was therefore withdrawn from East Africa that month. Those men who were healthy enough to return home arrived back in Salisbury on 14 April 1917, receiving a tumultuous welcome, but the majority of 2RR remained in medical care overseas for some time afterwards.

The Company briefly considered sending a revived 2nd Rhodesia Regiment to the Western Front, but the British Army promptly rejected this idea, saying that the unit would be impractical for trench warfare because of its small size. The battalion was thereupon dissolved, but most of its remaining men went to war in Europe anyway, generally with South African units.

By late 1915, British forces in the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's south-western flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. <a href="Francis%20Chaplin">Francis Drummond Chaplin</a>, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 "askaris", and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would foot the bill for the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British <a href="Colonial%20Office">Colonial Office</a>—recruitment began in May.

Initial recruitment efforts principally targeted the Matabele, who made up about 20% of the colony's black population, because they enjoyed a popular reputation among whites for being great warriors; the unit was therefore originally called the "Matabele Regiment". This was changed to the more inclusive "<a href="Rhodesia%20Native%20Regiment">Rhodesia Native Regiment</a>" (RNR) on 15 May 1916, as the ranks proved to be more diverse than expected, and included large numbers of <a href="Shona%20people">Mashona</a>s and other ethnicities. In particular, a disproportionately high number of volunteers came from the <a href="Kalanga%20people">Kalanga</a> tribe, a numerically diminutive community in the colony's south-west. The RNR was organised largely along linguistic and cultural lines, with companies and platoons of Matabele, Mashona, <a href="Yao%20people%20%28East%20Africa%29">Wayao</a> and others. White officers attached to the unit were often recruited because they knew an African language, or could give orders in <a href="Fanagalo">Chilapalapa</a>, a <a href="pidgin">pidgin</a> of English and several African tongues often referred to by whites of the time as "kitchen kaffir". The ranks' diversity sometimes led to confusion when messages or directives were not properly understood. It became common for black troopers accused of disobeying or ignoring commands to claim ignorance of the language in which they had been ordered.

Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel A J Tomlinson, the RNR, comprising 426 "askaris" and about 30 white officers, left Salisbury in July 1916 for Beira. They continued on to <a href="Zomba%2C%20Malawi">Zomba</a>, in Nyasaland, where they were to receive further training closer to the field of operations. When they arrived, the local situation had shifted significantly, so the RNR instead went to New Langenberg, in German East Africa, just north of <a href="Lake%20Malawi">Lake Nyasa</a>. At New Langenberg the regiment went through a short training course, and was issued with six machine guns. When the unit's training period ended in October 1916 it was divided; one company of RNR men went to Buhora, about north-east, while the rest went south to Weidhaven, on the north banks of Lake Nyasa, from where they moved east to <a href="Songea">Songea</a>, which they were ordered to "hold ... until reinforced". Apart from a company of men sent to patrol the road back to Weidhaven, the RNR proceeded to garrison Songea.

The Germans, who had left Songea only a few weeks before, sent two columns to retake it during early November 1916—250 "askaris" marched from Likuyu, and 180 more (with two machine guns) set off from Kitanda. The latter German column spotted the RNR company that was patrolling the road, and at Mabogoro attacked the advance guard, which was commanded by Sergeant (later Lieutenant) <a href="Frederick%20Charles%20Booth">Frederick Charles Booth</a>. The Rhodesians were caught by surprise, and many panicked, running about and firing randomly. Booth restored discipline and led the defence until reinforcements arrived. The Germans then retreated and continued towards Songea. During this contact, Booth advanced towards enemy fire to rescue a wounded scout who was lying in the open, and brought him back alive; for this and subsequent actions, Booth received the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> in June 1917.
The German column from Kitanda reached Songea early in the morning on 12 November 1916, and unsuccessfully attempted a frontal assault on the well-entrenched Rhodesian positions. After the German column from Likuyu arrived in the afternoon, the Germans laid siege to Songea for 12 days before retreating towards Likuyu on the 24th. The Rhodesians were relieved the following day by a South African unit. The RNR then moved back to Litruchi, on the other side of Lake Nyasa, from where they sailed to the German East African town of <a href="Mwaya">Mwaya</a>, where they were reunited with the RNR contingent that had gone to Buhora. This second column had ambushed a group of Germans, who were moving towards Northern Rhodesia with a naval gun salvaged from <a href="SMS%20K%C3%B6nigsberg%20%281905%29">SMS "Königsberg"</a> (which had been sunk at <a href="Battle%20of%20Rufiji%20Delta">Rufiji Delta</a> about a year before); after pocketing the Germans, the Rhodesians captured both them and the naval gun.

In Southern Rhodesia, Company officials judged the RNR to have been a success so far, and so decided in January 1917 to raise a second battalion. The unit already in the field was at this time designated 1st Battalion, abbreviated to "1RNR", while the new formation was called 2nd Battalion, or "2RNR". Recruitment was soon under way. Conscious of the difficulty that had been found in persuading rural Mashonas and Matabele to join the 1st Battalion in 1916, organisers for 2RNR principally targeted black men from other countries, in particular migrant workers from Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia; Nyasalanders eventually made up nearly half of the regiment. By the start of March, about 1,000 recruits were training in Salisbury. Meanwhile, 1RNR was instructed to guard the Igali Pass, near the border with Northern Rhodesia, to prevent a column of Germans from threatening the settlements of <a href="Mbala%2C%20Zambia">Abercorn</a> and Fife. When the Germans slipped through, the Rhodesians were pulled back to a position between the two towns and instructed to defend either one as circumstances dictated. The Germans did not launch an attack, however, instead setting up camp in their own territory at <a href="Galula">Galula</a>.

The Southern Rhodesian commanders planned to destroy the German column by taking advantage of the regional geography; the Germans had <a href="Lake%20Rukwa">Lake Rukwa</a> to their back, and the rivers Songwe and Saisi on their respective left (eastern) and right flanks, effectively hemming them in if they were attacked. The plan was that elements of 1RNR would hold the Saisi while a battalion of the <a href="King%27s%20African%20Rifles">King's African Rifles</a> (KAR) manned the Songwe; the rest of 1RNR would then push the Germans back towards the lake. But Tomlinson interpreted his orders as requiring immediate action, and attacked before the two flanking lines were in place on the rivers. The offensive had some successes at first, even though Tomlinson was outnumbered, but the 450 Germans, armed with three "Königsberg" field guns and 14 machine guns, soon withdrew to the higher ground at St Moritz Mission. The Germans counterattacked over the following week. Colonel R E Murray, who commanded a column of BSAP men about away, did not assist Tomlinson, and 1RNR took great losses while repulsing the attack: 58 RNR men were killed, and the Germans captured three Rhodesian machine guns. Tomlinson was blamed by most for the debacle, but he insisted for years afterwards that he had only been following orders from Murray to hold his ground. He expressed incredulity at Murray's failure to reinforce him. An enquiry into the matter was avoided when Tomlinson was wounded and invalided home soon after the battle.

On 5 April 1917, 1RNR crossed the Songwe River into German East Africa and advanced south-east towards Kitanda. It moved up the winding Lupa River, crossing it at each turn, for 53 days, and by mid-June was north of its target. When it was then ordered to backtrack north to <a href="Rungwe%20District">Rungwe</a>, it covered the in 16 days. Several scholars highlight the distances marched by the RNR, and comment that their physical endurance must have been remarkable, particularly given the speed at which they moved. "One can only marvel at the hardiness and fortitude of these men who matter-of-factly marched distances unthinkable to modern Western soldiers," the historian Alexandre Binda writes. McLaughlin contrasts the RNR's black troopers with the white soldiers of the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, commenting that the former proved far more resilient to tropical diseases (though not immune), and amazed white observers by not just adapting to the difficult East African conditions, but often marching in a day. In June 1917, Sergeant Rita (or Lita), a black <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a> later described by Tomlinson as "a splendid soldier", received the highest award ever given to an RNR "askari", the <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a>, "for conspicuous gallantry in action on many occasions. His example and influence with his men is incalculable".

The 1st Battalion harassed the constantly moving German <a href="flying%20column">flying column</a> during August and September 1917. Two <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>s were won by RNR soldiers during this time: Sergeant Northcote rescued a wounded "askari" under German fire in late August, and a few days later Corporal Suga, himself lightly injured, dragged his wounded commanding officer Lieutenant Booth out of the open and into cover. The 2nd Battalion, comprising Major Jackson at the head of 585 "askaris" and 75 whites, left Salisbury on 16 September 1917, and joined the front on 16 October, when it arrived at Mbewa on the north-eastern shore of Lake Nyasa, intending to ultimately merge with 1RNR. After 1RNR spent two months garrisoning Wiedhaven and 2RNR underwent further training, the two forces joined on 28 January 1918 (becoming known as the 2nd Rhodesia Native Regiment), and immediately made their way south in pursuit of Lettow-Vorbeck's Germans, who were by now down to an effective strength of less than 2,000, and moving through Portuguese Mozambique.

In late May 1918, the two-year service contracts signed by the original 500 RNR volunteers expired, and the majority of those who had not already been discharged—just under 400 men—went home. While passing through <a href="Mutare">Umtali</a> on their way to Salisbury, the soldiers encountered the RNR's original commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Tomlinson, whom they promptly mobbed, excitedly chanting "nkosi, nkosi" (which roughly means "chief" in Sindebele). In the capital, the RNR men were met at the railway station by thousands of people, including a number of prominent government, military and religious figures. Chaplin, the territorial administrator, gave a speech in which he applauded the troops for "upholding the good name of Rhodesia" and for having played "no insignificant part in depriving the Germans of their power in Africa".

In Mozambique, the RNR encountered Lettow-Vorbeck's supply column near Mtarika on 22 May 1918. It wiped it out (capturing two German officers, two German "askaris", 34 Portuguese "askaris" and 252 carriers), but as the supply column had been marching between the main German column and its rearguard, Lettow-Vorbeck was then able to attack the RNR from both sides. The contact lasted until darkness fell, and the RNR held its position. Lettow-Vorbeck then moved further south, with the RNR following. This pursuit continued for the rest of the war, with Lettow-Vorbeck avoiding contacts so far as was possible and constantly resupplying his men by briefly occupying isolated towns. The RNR chased the German column for over around Mozambique and the eastern districts of Northern Rhodesia, but never caught up with him. After Lettow-Vorbeck formally surrendered at Abercorn on 25 November 1918, the RNR returned to Salisbury, where the men were discharged during 1919. The regiment existed on paper for two more years before it was formally disbanded in February 1921.

Southern Rhodesian troops during World War I were all volunteers. Particularly during the war's early stages, not all male settlers of fighting age were expected to abandon their civilian lives for service abroad. Many of them were in vital industries like mining, and the Company administration did not grant financial allowances to support the families of married soldiers, so at least at first, only bachelors in non-essential positions were generally considered to have any moral obligation to sign up. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment, raised in early 1915, explicitly barred married men from its ranks to preempt the tribulations that might befall their families while they were gone. Men of service age who remained at home were pressured by the national and local press to contribute to local security by joining the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers or the Rhodesian Reserves; editorials told readers that men who failed to do so were not fulfilling their patriotic duty, and warned that <a href="conscription">conscription</a> might be required if not enough joined up.

The idea of conscription ran contrary to British political tradition, but the sheer scale of the Western Front led to its institution in Britain in January 1916. The "Rhodesia Herald" and "Bulawayo Chronicle" newspapers broadcast the news in special editions. While some settlers supported the extension of the same system to white Southern Rhodesians, it was also opposed in many quarters. The British South Africa Company feared that the loss of skilled white workers might jeopardise its mining operations, crucial to the colonial economy, while the Rhodesian Agricultural Union contended that white farmers had to stay on the land for similar reasons. Some, mindful of <a href="John%20Chilembwe">John Chilembwe</a>'s <a href="Chilembwe%20uprising">anticolonial uprising</a> in Nyasaland in early 1915, felt that it was necessary to keep a core of male settlers in the colony to guard against a repeat of the Mashona and Matabele rebellions of the 1890s.

By late 1916, most settlers in the colony who were inclined to volunteer had already done so. To free up white manpower, some suggested the recruitment of older men for local service so more of the younger volunteers could go overseas. In 1917, the Chartered Company set up a committee to consider the question of national defence both during the war and thereafter; its report, released in February 1918, described reliance on volunteers as inefficient, and recommended the institution of compulsory service for whites, even after the war (no mention was made of using black troops in the future). The Company published proposals the following month to register all white males aged between 18 and 65 with a view to some form of conscription, but this provoked widespread and vocal dissent, particularly from farmers. In the face of this opposition the administration vacillated until it quietly dropped the idea after the armistice.

The British South Africa Company had reservations about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's resources to the war effort, in part because of its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose sharply, and exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal <a href="ferrochrome">ferrochrome</a>. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>, near <a href="Esigodini">Essexvale</a> in southern <a href="Matabeleland">Matabeleland</a> in May 1917.

Southern Rhodesia's other main economic arm, farming, performed less strongly during the war, partly because the Chartered Company prioritised the strategically important mines at the behest of British officials. Southern Rhodesian farmers were optimistic at the outbreak of war, surmising that the Empire would become desperate for food and that they would be essentially immune to inflation because they grew their own crops. While these conclusions were on the whole accurate, logistical complications made it difficult for Rhodesian food to be exported, and as in mining there was often a shortage of labour. There were a number of drives to increase agricultural yield with the hope of feeding more people in Britain, but because Southern Rhodesia was so far away it was difficult for the colony to make much of an impact. One of the main culinary contributions the territory made to the British wartime marketplace was Rhodesian butter, which first reached England in February 1917.

The war began to adversely affect the economy in late 1917. The Company threatened petrol rationing in November 1917, and in early 1918 it raised the colonial <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> to help balance the books. By the end of the hostilities the Company had spent £2 million on the 
war effort, most of which was covered by the Rhodesian taxpayers; the Company covered some of the expenditure itself, and also received a small amount of financial aid from the UK government.

Mass media on both sides in the conflict tried to motivate their respective populations and justify the war's continuation by creating an image of the enemy so grotesque and savage that surrender became unthinkable. Like the major newspapers in Britain, the "Rhodesia Herald" and the "Bulawayo Chronicle" became key <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> tools, regularly printing stories of German atrocities, massacres and other war crimes alongside articles simply entitled "War Stories" that told of British Army soldiers carrying out deeds of Herculean bravery. <a href="Anti-German%20sentiment">Anti-German sentiment</a> abounded in the territory throughout the conflict, and periodically intensified, often concurrently with the reporting of particularly unsavoury incidents.

During the initial peak of Germanophobia, which lasted the first few months of the conflict, many German and Austrian men of military age who lived in Rhodesia were arrested (officially as "prisoners of war") and sent to internment camps in South Africa. <a href="Gertrude%20Page">Gertrude Page</a>, one of the colony's most famous novelists, wrote an open letter in response, vouching for the loyalty of a young German in her employ, and received a number of replies accusing her of being unpatriotic. The second period of intensification began following the <a href="sinking%20of%20the%20RMS%20Lusitania">sinking</a> of the British passenger liner <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a> by a German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a> on 7 May 1915. The "Rhodesia Herald" ran an editorial soon after calling on the Company administration to intern all remaining German and Austrian residents and to close their businesses. A town assembly in Umtali sent the administrator a resolution asking him to confiscate all property in the colony owned by subjects of Germany and Austria within 48 hours "in view of German barbarity". Most of Southern Rhodesia's remaining German and Austrian residents were soon sent to the camps in South Africa.

Further periods of intensified anti-German feeling in the Rhodesias followed the execution by the Germans of the British nurse <a href="Edith%20Cavell">Edith Cavell</a> in Belgium in October 1915 ("the Crowning Crime", the "Bulawayo Chronicle" called it), the escalation of <a href="German%20strategic%20bombing%20during%20World%20War%20I">bombing raids</a> by German <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a>s on British cities during 1917, and the British reportage the same year of the "<a href="Kadaververwertungsanstalt">Kadaververwertungsanstalt</a>" atrocity story—that the Germans supposedly rendered down battlefield corpses from both sides to make products such as <a href="nitroglycerine">nitroglycerine</a> and lubricants.

A small elite of black urbanites, mostly raised and educated at <a href="Mission%20%28Christianity%29">Christian missions</a>, existed in Southern Rhodesia by the time of the war, and these generally identified themselves strongly with settler society and, by extension, the war effort. But the vast majority of black people in the colony retained their traditional tribal lifestyles of rural subsistence farming, and for most of them, as McLaughlin comments, the war "could have been fought between aliens from different planets for all their connection with events in Europe". Some felt obliged to "fight for their country", seeing the travails of Rhodesia and the Empire as their own also, but the great bulk of tribal public opinion was detached, seeing the conflict as a "white man's war" that did not concern them. Those who favoured the latter line of thinking cared not so much about the conflict itself but more about how its course might affect them specifically. For example, widespread interest was aroused soon after the outbreak of war when rumours began to fly between the rural black communities that the Company planned to conscript them. News of the Maritz Rebellion prompted a fresh rumour among the Matabele that Company officials might confiscate tribal livestock to feed the white troops going south. None of this actually occurred.

The Chartered Company's native commissioners began to fear a possible tribal rebellion during early 1915. Herbert Taylor, the chief native commissioner, believed that foreign missionaries were secretly encouraging rural black people to emulate the Chilembwe revolt in Nyasaland, and telling them (falsely) that the British were exterminating the natives there. There were few actual attempts to topple the administration in Southern Rhodesia, but the Company still took precautions. Aware that Mashona "<a href="svikiro">svikiro</a>" (spirit mediums) had been instrumental in inciting and leading insurgencies against Company rule during the late 1890s, the native commissioners enacted new legislation designed to imprison any "svikiro" who gained significant popularity.

The only real threat of a black rebellion in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted to make clear that the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in <a href="Insiza%20%28District%29">Insiza</a> district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the <a href="syncretism">syncretist</a> <a href="Church%20of%20the%20White%20Bird">Church of the White Bird</a> in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR on the grounds that the British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.

The colony's small Afrikaner community was split on the issue of war. Some supported the United Kingdom out of loyalty to Rhodesia, but others were still bitter about the Anglo-Boer War and showed little interest in fighting the Germans. In the rural areas, where <a href="Afrikaner%20nationalism">Afrikaner nationalism</a> was strongest, the Germans were perceived by some Boer farmers as potential liberators from British domination. Southern Rhodesian Afrikaners were often accused of undermining the British war effort. While some leaders of the community publicly came out in support of the war and offered to provide troops, others put pressure on Afrikaans-speakers not to volunteer. When recruitment for the Rhodesia Native Regiment began in 1916, there were reports of potential black recruits being urged not to join up by their Afrikaans-speaking employers.

As is common in frontier societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: at the time of the First World War, white females were outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.

The contribution to the war made by Southern Rhodesia's white female population generally comprised organising and running donation drives, comforts committees and other similar enterprises. They sent the troops "comforts parcels", which contained balaclavas, mittens and scarves that they had knitted, as well as newspapers, soap, food (including cakes and sweets), and minor luxuries. These packages did much to raise the morale of the men, particularly those who were in German captivity. Women were also largely responsible for handling mail between Rhodesian soldiers and their relatives and friends back home. After the armistice, they organised financial assistance for those discharged Southern Rhodesian men in England who could not afford to come home, and arranged visits for those convalescing in English hospitals.

As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women during the war presented men not wearing military uniform with <a href="white%20feather">white feather</a>s (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, as many of the men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the "Rhodesia Herald" and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.

Black women played a minor role in units such as the Rhodesia Native Regiment, <a href="camp%20follower">accompanying</a> the black soldiers into the operational area and performing domestic tasks like washing and cooking. Many of these were local East African women who had formed attachments with RNR soldiers. Officers tolerated the presence of these women in the interest of morale, aware that attempting to take them away from the men would probably lead to mutiny.

Southern Rhodesian settlers set up a number of wartime funds, including funds to aid war victims, funds to provide the troops with tobacco and other supplies, funds to assist orphans and widows, funds to buy aeroplanes, and others. These raised about £200,000 in all. Much of this went to the Prince of Wales National Relief Fund in Britain, which was founded when the war started; Southern Rhodesian branches of the fund were promptly organised in several towns and ultimately consolidated into the Rhodesian War Relief Fund. This body donated 25% of its receipts to the Prince of Wales Fund and 75% to local concerns.

The Tobacco Fund, set up in September 1914, was particularly successful. Public donors bought Southern Rhodesian tobacco, cigarettes and pipe tobacco to send to the British forces. This was intended not only to comfort the troops, but also to advertise the prospect of post-war emigration to Rhodesia. The labels on the tobacco tins depicted a map of Africa with the sun shining on Rhodesia, accompanied by the slogan "The World's Great Sunspot". In a similar vein, "Sunspot" was the name given to the Rhodesian cigarettes that British soldiers received. During the war, British and colonial soldiery collectively chewed and smoked 59,955 two-ounce (57 g) tins of donated Southern Rhodesian tobacco, 80,584 two-ounce tins of equivalent pipe tobacco, and 4,004,000 Sunspot cigarettes (in packs of 10). Another similar undertaking saw six tons (roughly 6,100 kg) of local citrus fruits sent to wounded British Army personnel in South Africa and England.

Starting in July 1915, Southern Rhodesians raised funds to buy aeroplanes for the Royal Flying Corps. The colony ultimately bought three aircraft, each of which cost £1,500—they were named Rhodesia Nos. 1, 2 and 3. Residents of the town of Gatooma also set up their own drive, which funded the purchase of two more planes, Gatooma Nos. 1 and 2.

The black elite in the towns donated to the settlers' patriotic funds and organisations, and also set up their own. A war fundraising tea organised by black Salisburians in early March 1915 boasted entertainment in the form of a black choir, as well as the presence of Taylor and a junior native commissioner, each of whom gave speeches in English, Sindebele and Shona. Rural black people, by contrast, did not generally understand the concept of donating money to war funds, and misinterpreted encouragement to do so as being threatened with a new tax. When the Matabele chief Gambo began collecting war donations from his people in early 1915, also urging other chiefs to do the same, he took care to thoroughly explain the war fund's purpose and the voluntary nature of contributing, but some villagers still misunderstood and came to believe they would have livestock confiscated if they did not give money. The Company ultimately sent officials around the countryside to clarify the matter.

The Kalanga, a small community in the south-west that provided a disproportionately large number of volunteers for the Rhodesia Native Regiment, also proved conspicuous for their extremely generous financial donations; in June 1915, they collectively donated £183, "a staggering sum", the historian Timothy Stapleton comments, to the Prince of Wales Fund.

The <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a>, often referred to at the time as "Spanish flu", spread quickly into Southern Rhodesia from South Africa in October 1918. A week after the first case was reported in Salisbury, over 1,000 people were infected. Public buildings in the towns were converted into makeshift hospital wards, appeals were put out for trained nurses to attend the sick, and soup kitchens were set up to feed children whose parents were too ill to look after them. Newspapers in the colony published basic instructions on how to deal with the disease. The mine compounds, where hundreds of black labourers lived and worked together in close proximity, were worst affected. The whole country was ultimately infected, with even the most remote villages reporting deaths. Many members of the Rhodesia Native Regiment were infected, and 76 of them died from the disease having survived the war. By the time the pandemic had ended in Southern Rhodesia around mid-November 1918, thousands had been killed.

News of the armistice on 11 November 1918 reached Southern Rhodesia the same day, and was announced to the town of Salisbury by the repeated blowing of the klaxon at the <a href="Castle%20Brewery">Castle Brewery</a>. Hysterical street parties started almost immediately, and in the evening the people let off fireworks and lit a huge bonfire on Salisbury <a href="kopje">kopje</a>. Bulawayo celebrated with a street party that continued uninterrupted for over 48 hours. Smaller towns marked the armistice with their own celebratory functions and events.

Once the frivolities had ended, minds turned to post-war policy, and particularly how soldiers returning from Europe would be reintegrated into society. The Company had already, in 1916, set aside of farmland to be given free of charge to white war veterans. In early 1919 it set up a government department to help returning men find work. Many former soldiers failed to find jobs, and some remained unemployed for years after they returned home. Some of the more seriously wounded from the European theatre never came back at all, instead remaining in England because of the better medical facilities and public benefits. Demobilised Western Front veterans began to arrive back in Rhodesia in January 1919, and continued to do so for nearly a year afterwards. On 30 May 1919, the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Council">Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council</a> passed a resolution thanking the territory's veterans.

The Southern Rhodesian tribal chiefs collectively sent their own statement to King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>.

Proportional to white population, Southern Rhodesia had contributed more personnel to the British armed forces in World War I than any of the Empire's dominions or colonies, and more than Britain itself. About 40% of white males in the colony, 5,716 men, put on uniform, with 1,720 doing so as <a href="officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned officers</a>. Black Southern Rhodesians were represented by the 2,507 soldiers who made up the Rhodesia Native Regiment, the roughly 350 who joined the British East Africa Transport Corps, British South Africa Police Mobile Column and <a href="South%20African%20Native%20Labour%20Corps">South African Native Labour Corps</a>, and the few dozen black scouts who served with the 1st and 2nd Rhodesia Regiments in South-West and East Africa. Southern Rhodesians killed in action or on operational duty numbered over 800, counting all races together—more than 700 of the colony's white servicemen died, while the Rhodesia Native Regiment's black soldiers suffered 146 fatalities.

Accounts of white Southern Rhodesian soldiers' wartime experiences started to be published in the 1920s. The conflict became a key entry in many national histories, though the role played by black troops was often minimised in these accounts. The colony's wartime contributions became a source of great pride for much of the Southern Rhodesian white community, as well as for some black Africans; whites were particularly proud that they had had the highest enlistment rate in the British Empire during the war. A national war memorial, a stone <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>, high, was funded by public donations and built in Salisbury in 1919. Soldiers, one black and one white, were depicted in <a href="relief">relief</a> on plaques on each side; the inscriptions below read "1914–1918—We fought and died for our King." Five years later, Lieutenant-Colonel J A Methuen organised the erection on a kopje near Umtali of a stone cross, tall, to memorialise the country's fallen black soldiers. This monument remains to this day, as does the bronze plaque at its foot, which reads "To the Glory of God and in Memory of Africans Who Fell. 1914–1918."
Southern Rhodesia's contributions to the Imperial war effort helped it to become regarded by Britain as more mature and deserving of responsible government, which Whitehall granted in 1923. The territory was made a self-governing colony, just short of full dominion status. Charged with its own defence, Salisbury introduced the selective conscription of white males in 1926, and reformed the Rhodesia Regiment the following year. The territory's association with the King's Royal Rifle Corps endured in the form of affiliation between the KRRC and the Rhodesia Regiment's new incarnation, which adopted aspects of the KRRC uniform and a similar regimental insignia. The new Rhodesia Regiment was granted the original's World War I battle honours and colours by George V in 1929.

In <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20in%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Southern Rhodesia again enthusiastically stood behind the UK, symbolically declaring war on Germany in support of Britain before any other colony or dominion. Over 26,000 Southern Rhodesians served in the Second World War, making the colony once more the largest contributor of manpower, proportional to white population, in all of the British Empire and Commonwealth. As in World War I, Southern Rhodesians were distributed in small groups throughout the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Dedicated Rhodesian platoons again served in the KRRC, and the <a href="Rhodesian%20African%20Rifles">Rhodesian African Rifles</a>, raised in 1940, were in many ways a resurrection of the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Military aviation, already associated with the colony following the First World War, became a great Southern Rhodesian tradition during the Second, with the colony providing <a href="No.%2044%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 44</a>, <a href="No.%20237%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 237</a> and <a href="No.%20266%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 266</a> Squadrons and other personnel to the Royal Air Force, as well as <a href="List%20of%20British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan%20facilities%20in%20Southern%20Rhodesia">training</a> in Southern Rhodesia for 8,235 <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> airmen.

By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' service on Britain's behalf in the World Wars, particularly the Second, was an integral part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20military%20involvement%20in%20the%20Malayan%20Emergency">Malaya</a>, <a href="Colony%20of%20Aden">Aden</a> and Cyprus, as well as <a href="Operation%20Vantage">Operation "Vantage"</a> in Kuwait. The colonial government's <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> in 1965 was deliberately made on 11 November, <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 <a href="Central%20Africa%20Time">local time</a>, during the customary <a href="two-minute%20silence">two-minute silence</a> to remember the fallen.

After the country's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>'s administration pulled down many monuments and plaques making reference to the fallen of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that went against what the modern state stood for. This view was partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, as well as those memorialising members of the <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Security Forces</a> killed during the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Bush War</a> of the 1970s. Many Zimbabweans today see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that had more to do with the white community than the indigenous black majority, and most have little interest in its contributions to those conflicts.

The country's fallen of the two World Wars today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas. The national war memorial obelisk still stands, but the relief sculptures and inscriptions have been removed. The stone cross monument near Mutare (as Umtali is now <a href="Place%20names%20in%20Zimbabwe">called</a>) is one of the few memorials that remains intact and in its place, atop what is now called Cross Kopje; its meaning has been largely forgotten.

Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar

The Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar is a commemorative gold coin that was struck in 1904 and 1905 as part of the United States Government's participation in the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Centennial%20Exposition">Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition</a>, held in the latter year in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. Designed by <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, the coin did not sell well and less than a tenth of the authorized mintage of 250,000 was issued.

The <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, the first American overland exploring party to reach the Pacific Coast, was led by <a href="Meriwether%20Lewis">Meriwether Lewis</a> and <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a>. Between 1804 and 1806, its members journeyed from St. Louis to the Oregon coast and back, providing information and dispelling myths about the large area obtained by the United States in the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> of 1803. The Portland fair commemorated the centennial of that trip.

The coins were, for the most part, sold to the public by numismatic promoter <a href="Farran%20Zerbe">Farran Zerbe</a>, who had also vended the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition%20dollar">Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar</a>. As he was unable to sell much of the issue, surplus coins were melted by the Mint. The coins have continued to increase in value, and today are worth between hundreds and thousands of dollars, depending on condition. The Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar is the only American coin to be "two-headed", with a portrait of one of the expedition leaders on each side.

The <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>, by the United States from France in 1803, more than doubled the area of the American nation. Seeking to gain knowledge of the new possession, President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> obtained an appropriation from Congress for an exploratory expedition, and appointed his <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">private secretary</a>, <a href="Meriwether%20Lewis">Meriwether Lewis</a>, to lead it. A captain in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, Lewis selected <a href="William%20Clark%20%28explorer%29">William Clark</a>, a former Army lieutenant and younger brother of <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> hero <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a>, as co-leader of the expedition. Lewis and William Clark had served together, and chose about thirty men, dubbed the <a href="Corps%20of%20Discovery">Corps of Discovery</a>, to accompany them. Many of these were frontiersmen from Kentucky who were in the Army, as well as boatmen, and others with necessary skills. The expedition set forth from the St. Louis area on May 14, 1804.

Journeying up the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a>, Lewis and Clark met <a href="Sacagawea">Sacagawea</a>, a woman of the <a href="Lemhi%20Shoshone">Lemhi Shoshone</a> tribe. Sacagawea had been captured by another tribe and sold as a slave to <a href="Toussaint%20Charbonneau">Toussaint Charbonneau</a>, a French-Canadian trapper, who made her one of his wives. Both Charbonneau and Sacagawea served as interpreters for the expedition and the presence of the Native American woman (and her infant son, <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Charbonneau">Jean Baptiste Charbonneau</a>) helped convince hostile tribes that the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a> was not a war party. A great service Sacagawea rendered the expedition was to aid in the purchase of horses, needed so the group could cross the mountains after they had to abandon the Missouri approaching the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a>. One reason for her success was that the Indian chief whose aid they sought proved to be Sacagawea's brother.

The expedition spent the winter of 1804–1805 encamped near the site of <a href="Bismarck%2C%20North%20Dakota">Bismarck, North Dakota</a>. They left there on April 7, 1805 and came within view of the Pacific Ocean, near <a href="Astoria%2C%20Oregon">Astoria, Oregon</a>, on November 7. After exploring the area, they departed eastward on March 23, 1806 and arrived in St. Louis six months to the day later. Only one of the expedition members died en route, most likely of appendicitis. While they did not find the mammoths or salt mountains reputed to be in the American West, "these were a small loss compared to the things that were gained". In addition to knowledge of the territories purchased by the US, these included the establishment of relations with Native Americans and increased public interest in the West once their diaries were published. Further, the exploration of the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a> later aided American claims to that area. In gratitude for their service to the nation, Congress gave Lewis and Clark land grants and they were appointed to government offices in the West.

Beginning in 1895, Oregonians proposed honoring the centennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with a fair to be held in Portland, a city located along the party's route. In 1900, a committee of Portland business men began to plan for the event, an issue of stock was successful in late 1901, and construction began in 1903. A long drive to gain federal government support succeeded when President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> signed an appropriations bill on April 13, 1904. This bill allocated $500,000 to exposition authorities, and also authorized a gold dollar to commemorate the fair, with the design and inscriptions left to the discretion of the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>. The organizing committee was the only entity allowed to purchase these from the government, and could do so at face value, up to a mintage limit of 250,000.

Numismatist <a href="Farran%20Zerbe">Farran Zerbe</a> had advocated for the passage of the authorization. Zerbe was not only a coin collector and dealer, but promoted the hobby through his traveling exhibition, "Money of the World". Zerbe, president of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> from 1908 to 1910, was involved in the sale of commemorative coins for over 20 years, beginning in 1892. The Portland exposition's authorities placed him in charge of the sale of the gold dollar.

Details of the preparation of the commemorative dollar are lost; the Mint destroyed many records in the 1960s. Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a> was responsible for the designs.

Numismatic historians <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> and <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> both suggest that Barber most likely based his designs on portraits of Lewis and of Clark by American painter <a href="Charles%20Willson%20Peale">Charles Willson Peale</a> found in Philadelphia's <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a>. Taxay deemed Barber's efforts, "commonplace". The piece is the only American coin to be "two-headed", bearing a single portrait on each side.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on American coinage, pointed out that some people liked the Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar as it depicted historic figures who affected the course of American history, rather than a bust intended to be <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a>, and that Barber's coin presaged the 1909 <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a> and the 1932 <a href="Washington%20quarter">Washington quarter</a>. Nevertheless, Vermeule deprecated the piece, as well as the earlier American gold commemorative, the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition%20dollar">Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar</a>. "The lack of spark in these coins, as in so many designs by Barber or Assistant Engraver (later Chief Engraver) <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">Morgan</a>, stems from the fact that the faces, hair and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." According to Vermeule, when the two engravers collaborated on a design, such as the 1916 <a href="McKinley%20Birthplace%20Memorial%20dollar">McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar</a>, "the results were almost oppressive".

The Philadelphia Mint produced 25,000 Lewis and Clark Exposition dollars in September 1904, plus 28 more, reserved for inspection and testing at the 1905 meeting of the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>. These bore the date 1904. Zerbe ordered 10,000 more in March 1905, dated 1905. The Mint struck 35,000 plus assay pieces in March and June in case Zerbe wanted to buy more, doing so in advance as the Philadelphia Mint shut down in the summer, but as he did not order more, the additional 25,000 were melted.

The Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar was the first commemorative gold coin to be struck and dated in multiple years. A total of 60,069 pieces were struck, from both years, of which 40,003 were melted. According to numismatists Jim Hunt and Jim Wells in their 2004 article on the coin, "the poor reception afforded the coin at the time of issue virtually guaranteed their rarity for future generation".

The Lewis and Clark Centennial and American Pacific Exposition and Oriental Fair opened in Portland on June 1, 1905. It was not designated as an international exposition, and did not draw much publicity even within the United States. Nevertheless, two and a half million people visited the fair between Opening Day and the close on October 14. Sixteen foreign nations accepted invitations from organizers to mount exhibits at the exposition. There was the usual broad array of concessions and <a href="midway%20%28fair%29">midway</a> attractions to entertain visitors. Among Americans who displayed exhibits at the fair were prominent cartoonist and animal fancier <a href="Homer%20Davenport">Homer Davenport</a> and long-lived pioneer <a href="Ezra%20Meeker">Ezra Meeker</a>. The exposition was one of the few of its kind to make a profit, and likely contributed to a major increase in Portland's population and economy between 1905 and 1912.
Funds from the sale of the coin were designated for the completion of a statue to Sacagawea in a Portland park. There was little mention of the dollar in the numismatic press. <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a> speculates that Dr. George F. Heath, editor of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", who opposed such commemoratives, declined to run any press releases that Zerbe might have sent. Nevertheless, an article appeared in the August 1905 issue, promoting the exhibit and dollar. As it quotes Zerbe and praises his efforts, it was likely written by him. Zerbe concentrated on bulk sales to dealers, as well as casual ones at the fair at a price of $2; he enlisted Portland coin dealer D.M. Averill & Company to make retail sales by mail. There were also some banks and other businesses that sold coins directly to the public. Averill ran advertisements in the numismatic press, and in early 1905, raised prices on the 1904 pieces, claiming that they were near exhaustion. This was a lie: in fact the 1904-dated coins sold so badly that some 15,000 were melted at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>. Zerbe had Averill sell the 1905 issue at a discounted price of ten dollars for six pieces. As he had for the Louisiana Purchase dollar, Zerbe made the coins available mounted in spoons or in jewelry. Little else is known regarding the distribution of the gold dollars.

The coins were highly unpopular in the collecting community, which had seen the Louisiana Purchase coin decrease in value since its issuance. Nevertheless, the value of the Lewis and Clark issue did not drop below issue price, but steadily increased. Despite a slightly higher number of coins recorded as extant, the 1905 issue is rarer and more valuable than the 1904; Bowers speculates that Zerbe may have held some pieces only to cash them in, or surrender them in 1933 when President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> called in most gold coins. The 1905 for many years traded for less than the 1904, but by 1960 had matched the earlier version's price and in the 1980s surpassed it. The 2014 edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (the "Red Book") lists the 1904 at between $900 and $10,000, depending on condition, and the 1905 at between $1,200 and $15,000. One 1904, in near pristine <a href="coin%20grading">MS-68 condition</a>, sold in 2006 at auction for $57,500.

Despite the relative failure of the coin issue, <a href="Sacajawea%20and%20Jean-Baptiste">the statue of Sacagawea</a> was duly erected in a Portland park, financed by coin sales. In 2000, Sacagawea joined Lewis and Clark in appearing on a gold-colored dollar coin, with the issuance of <a href="Sacagawea%20dollar">a circulating coin</a> depicting her and her son.

Wordless novel

The wordless novel is a narrative genre that uses sequences of captionless pictures to tell a story. As artists have often made such books using <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> and other <a href="relief%20printing">relief printing</a> techniques, the terms woodcut novel or novel in woodcuts are also used. The genre flourished primarily in the 1920s and 1930s and was most popular in Germany.

The wordless novel has its origin in the <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionist</a> movement of the early 20th century. The typically <a href="Socialism">socialist</a> work drew inspiration from medieval woodcuts and used the awkward look of that medium to express <a href="angst">angst</a> and frustration at <a href="social%20injustice">social injustice</a>. The first such book was the Belgian <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a>'s "<a href="25%20Images%20of%20a%20Man%27s%20Passion">25 Images of a Man's Passion</a>", published in 1918. The German <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a> and other artists followed Masereel's example. <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a> brought the genre to the United States in 1929 when he produced , which inspired other American wordless novels and a parody in 1930 by cartoonist <a href="Milt%20Gross">Milt Gross</a> with "<a href="He%20Done%20Her%20Wrong">He Done Her Wrong</a>". Following an early-1930s peak in production and popularity, the genre waned in the face of competition from <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>s and anti-socialist <a href="censorship%20in%20Nazi%20Germany">censorship in Nazi Germany</a> and the US.

Following World War II, new examples of wordless novels became increasingly rare, and early works went out of print. Interest began to revive in the 1960s when the American comics <a href="fandom">fandom</a> subculture came to see wordless novels as prototypical book-length comics. In the 1970s, the example of the wordless novel inspired cartoonists such as <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a> and <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> to create book-length non-genre comics—"<a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>s". Cartoonists such as <a href="Eric%20Drooker">Eric Drooker</a> and <a href="Peter%20Kuper">Peter Kuper</a> took direct inspiration from wordless novels to create wordless graphic novels.

Wordless novels use sequences of expressive images to tell a story. <a href="Socialism">Socialist</a> themes of struggle against <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> are common; scholar Perry Willett calls these themes "a unifying element of the genre's aesthetic". In both formal and moral aspects, they draw from <a href="Expressionism">Expressionist</a> graphics, <a href="Expressionism%20%28theatre%29">theatre</a>, and <a href="German%20Expressionism">film</a>. Wordless novelists such as <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a> appropriated the awkward aesthetic of mediaeval woodcuts to express their anguish and revolutionary political ideas and used simple, traditional iconography. Text is restricted to title and chapter pages, except where text is a part of the scene, such as in signs.

The storytelling tends to be melodramatic, and the stories tend to focus on struggles against social oppression in which characters are silenced by economic, political, and other social forces. The characters are clearly delineated as good or evil—the good drawn sympathetically and the evil with the contempt of the artist's moral indignation.

Most wordless novelists were not prolific; few besides Masereel and <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a> produced more than a single book. The books were designed to be mass-produced for a popular audience, in contrast to similar but shorter portfolios by artists such as <a href="Otto%20Dix">Otto Dix</a>, <a href="George%20Grosz">George Grosz</a>, and <a href="K%C3%A4the%20Kollwitz">Käthe Kollwitz</a>, which were produced in limited editions for collectors. These portfolios of typically from eight to ten prints also were meant to be viewed in sequence. Wordless novels were longer, had more complex narratives, and were printed in sizes and dimensions comparable to those of novels. A large influence was the most popular silent visual medium of the time: <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s. Panning, zooming, slapstick, and other filmic techniques are found in the books; Ward said that in creating a wordless novel, he first had to visualize it in his head as a silent film.

Typically, wordless novels used <a href="relief%20printing">relief printing</a> techniques such as <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s, <a href="wood%20engraving">wood engraving</a>, <a href="metalcut">metalcut</a>s, or <a href="linocut">linocut</a>s. One of the oldest printing techniques, relief printing has its origins in 8th-century China and was introduced to Europe in the 15th century. It requires an artist to draw or transfer an image to a printing block; the areas not to be printed (the white areas) are cut away, leaving raised areas to which ink is applied to make prints. The monochrome prints were usually in black ink, and occasionally in a different colour such as <a href="sienna">sienna</a> or orange. Relief printing is an inexpensive but labour-intensive printing technique; it was accessible to socially conscious artists who wanted to tell wordless stories of the working classes.

In 15th-century mediaeval Europe, woodcut <a href="block%20book">block book</a>s were printed as religious guides; particularly popular was the . The early 16th century saw block books disappear in favour of books printed with the <a href="movable%20type">movable type</a> of <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a>'s presses. Woodcut printing persisted into the 16th century under artists such as <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Dürer</a>, <a href="Hans%20Holbein%20the%20Younger">Holbein</a>, and <a href="Jost%20Amman">Amman</a>, after which engraving techniques superseded woodcuts. Pioneered by <a href="Thomas%20Bewick">Thomas Bewick</a>, wood engraving enjoyed popularity beginning in the 18th century, until the method gave way by the 19th century to more advanced printing methods such as <a href="lithography">lithography</a>.

<a href="Post-Impressionism">Post-impressionist</a> artist <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a> revived woodcut printing in the late-19th century, favouring it for its <a href="Primitivism">primitivist</a> effect. Early in the 20th century, woodcut artists such as Käthe Kollwitz (1867–1945) and <a href="Max%20Klinger">Max Klinger</a> (1857–1920) published portfolios of woodcuts, thematically linked by themes of social injustice. Expressionist graphic artists such as <a href="Max%20Beckmann">Max Beckmann</a> (1884–1950), Otto Dix (1891–1969), Kollwitz, and <a href="Karl%20Schmidt-Rottluff">Karl Schmidt-Rottluff</a> (1884–1976) were inspired by an early-20th-century revival of interest in mediaeval graphic arts—in particular Biblical woodcut prints such as the . These artists used the awkward look of woodcut images to express feelings of anguish.

The wordless novel grew out of the Expressionist movement. The Belgian Frans Masereel (1889–1972) created the earliest example, "<a href="25%20Images%20of%20a%20Man%27s%20Passion">25 Images of a Man's Passion</a>", in 1918. It was a commercial success and was followed by "<a href="Passionate%20Journey">Passionate Journey</a>", which at 167 images was Masereel's longest book. It was also the most commercially successful, particularly in Germany, where copies of his books sold in the hundreds of thousands throughout the 1920s and had introductions by writers such as <a href="Max%20Brod">Max Brod</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Hesse">Hermann Hesse</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Mann">Thomas Mann</a>. Masereel's books drew strongly on Expressionist theatre and film in their exaggerated but representational artwork with strong contrasts of black and white.

Masereel's commercial success led other artists to try their hands at the genre; themes of oppression under capitalism were prominent, a pattern set early by Masereel. At age thirteen, Polish-French artist <a href="Balthus">Balthus</a> drew a wordless story about his cat; it was published in 1921 with an introduction by poet <a href="Rainer%20Maria%20Rilke">Rainer Maria Rilke</a>. In "<a href="Destiny%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Destiny</a>" (1926), <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a> (1888–1955) produced a work with greater nuance and atmosphere than Masereel's bombastic works; where Masereel told tales of Man's struggle against Society, Nückel told of the life of an individual woman. "Destiny" appeared in a US edition in 1930 and sold well there.

<a href="Cl%C3%A9ment%20Moreau">Clément Moreau</a> (1903–1988) first tried his hand at the genre with the six-plate "Youth Without Means" in 1928. <a href="Istv%C3%A1n%20Szegedi-Sz%C3%BCts">István Szegedi-Szüts</a> (1892–1959), a Hungarian immigrant to England, made a wordless book in brush and ink called "My War" (1931). In simple artwork reminiscent of <a href="Sumi-e">Japanese brush painting</a>, Szegedi-Szüts told of a Hungarian cavalryman disillusioned by his World War I experiences. <a href="Helena%20Bocho%C5%99%C3%A1kov%C3%A1-Dittrichov%C3%A1">Helena Bochořáková-Dittrichová</a> (1894–1980) was the first woman to produce a wordless novel, "<a href="Childhood%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Childhood</a>" (1931), which presented middle-class life, rather than the working-class struggle found in the works of Masereel or Nückel. Bochořáková described her books as "cycles" rather than novels. <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> artist <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a> made the silent collage novel "<a href="Une%20semaine%20de%20bont%C3%A9">Une semaine de bonté</a>" in 1934. Following World War II, (1890–1968), a member of the German Expressionist group <a href="Die%20Br%C3%BCcke">Die Brücke</a>, produced "The Tightrope Walker and the Clown" (1949).

In 1926, the American Lynd Ward (1905–1985) moved to Leipzig to study graphic arts; while there, he discovered the works of Masereel and Otto Nückel. He produced six such works of his own; he preferred to call them "pictorial narratives". The first, (1929), was his most popular. Ward used wood engraving rather than woodcutting and varied image sizes from page to page. sold 20,000 copies, and other American artists followed up on this success with their own wordless novels in the 1930s.

Cartoonist <a href="Milt%20Gross">Milt Gross</a>'s "<a href="He%20Done%20Her%20Wrong">He Done Her Wrong</a>" (1930) was a parody of the genre; the book uses varying panel designs akin to those of comics: the action sometimes takes place outside the panel borders and "dialogue balloons" show in images what the characters are saying. Cartoonist and illustrator <a href="William%20Gropper">William Gropper</a>'s "Alay-oop" (1930) tells of three entertainers' disappointed dreams. In "Abraham Lincoln: Biography in Woodcuts" (1933) Charles Turzak documented <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">the American president</a>. Animator <a href="Myron%20Waldman">Myron Waldman</a> (1908–2006) wrote a wordless tale of a plump young woman looking for a glamorous husband. The book, "Eve" (1943), also uses "picture balloons" as "He Done Her Wrong" does.

Inspired by mediaeval religious block books and working in an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> style, American illustrator James Reid (1907–1989) produced one wordless novel, "The Life of Christ" (1930); due to the book's religious content, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> barred its importation under its <a href="Religion%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">policies on religion</a>.

In 1938, Italian-American <a href="Giacomo%20Patri">Giacomo Patri</a> (1898–1978) produced his only wordless novel, the linocut "White Collar". It chronicles the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash and was intended to motivate <a href="white-collar%20worker">white-collar worker</a>s to unionize. It also deals with controversial topics such as abortion, accessibility of health care for the poor, and loss of Christian faith. From 1948 to 1951, Canadian <a href="Laurence%20Hyde%20%28artist%29">Laurence Hyde</a> (1914–1987) produced his single wordless novel, the woodcut "<a href="Southern%20Cross%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Southern Cross</a>", in response to the American <a href="Nuclear%20testing%20at%20Bikini%20Atoll">atomic tests in the Bikini Atoll</a>. The work tells of an American evacuation of an island for nuclear tests, where one family is left behind. Polish-American <a href="Si%20Lewen">Si Lewen</a>'s (1918– ) first book, "The Parade: A Story in 55 Drawings" (1957), won praise from <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> for its anti-war message. Canadian George Kuthan's "Aphrodite's Cup" (1964) is an erotic book drawn in an ancient Greek style. In the early 21st century, Canadian <a href="George%20Walker%20%28printmaker%29">George Walker</a> made wordless woodcut novels, beginning with "Book of Hours" (2010), about the lives of those in the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a> complex just before the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.

The popularity of wordless novels peaked around 1929 to 1931, when "<a href="Sound%20film">talkies</a>" were introduced and began to supersede silent films. In the 1930s the Nazis in Germany suppressed and detained many printmakers and banned Masereel's works as "<a href="degenerate%20art">degenerate art</a>". Following World War II, US censors suppressed books with socialist views, including the works of Lynd Ward, on whom the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> kept files over his socialist sympathies; this censorship has made early editions of wordless novels scarce collectors' items in the US.

By the 1940s, most artists had given up on the genre. The most devoted practitioners, Masereel and Ward, moved on to other work for which they became better known; Masereel's obituary did not even mention his wordless novels. Many wordless novels remained out of print until the rise of the graphic novel revived interest amongst readers and publishers in the early 21st century.

There have been sporadic examples of textless comics ("<a href="Pantomime%20comics">Pantomime comics</a>") throughout the medium's history. In the US, there were comic strips such as <a href="Otto%20Soglow">Otto Soglow</a>'s "<a href="The%20Little%20King">The Little King</a>", begun in 1931, and <a href="Carl%20Thomas%20Anderson">Carl Anderson</a>'s "<a href="Henry%20%28comics%29">Henry</a>", begun in 1932. German cartoonist <a href="E.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BO.%20Plauen">E. O. Plauen</a>'s wordless domestic comic strip "<a href="Father%20and%20Son%20%28comics%29">Father and Son</a>" (1934–37) was popular in Germany, and was collected in three volumes. <a href="Antonio%20Proh%C3%ADas">Antonio Prohías</a>'s textless "<a href="Mad%20%28magazine%29">Mad</a>" magazine feature "<a href="Spy%20vs.%20Spy">Spy vs. Spy</a>" began in 1961.

Cartoonist <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a> (1917–2005) first came upon the work of Lynd Ward in 1938. Eisner was an early pioneer in the <a href="American%20comic%20book">American comic book</a> industry and saw in Ward's work a greater potential for comics. Eisner's ambitions were rebuffed by his peers, who saw comics as no more than low-status entertainment. Eisner withdrew from the commercial comics industry in the early 1950s to do government and educational work. He returned in the 1970s when the atmosphere had changed and his readers and peers seemed more receptive to his ambitions. In 1978, he began a career of creating book-length comics, the first of which was "<a href="A%20Contract%20with%20God">A Contract with God</a>"; the book was marketed as a "graphic novel", a term that became standard towards the end of the 20th century. Eisner called Ward "perhaps the most provocative graphic storyteller" of the 20th century. He wrote that Ward's "<a href="Vertigo%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Vertigo</a>" (1937) required considerable investment from readers in order to fill in the story between images.

Interest in the wordless novel revived with the rise of the graphic novel. Comics fans discussed the works of Masereel and others in fanzines, and the discussions turned to talk of the <a href="Great%20American%20Novel">Great American Novel</a> being made in comics. These discussions inspired cartoonist <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> (b. 1948), who in 1973 made a four-page strip, "Prisoner on the Hell Planet", in an Expressionist style inspired by Ward's work. Spiegelman later incorporated the strip into his graphic novel "<a href="Maus">Maus</a>" (1992).

While graphic novels generally use captions and dialogue, cartoonists such as <a href="Eric%20Drooker">Eric Drooker</a>, <a href="Peter%20Kuper">Peter Kuper</a>, , <a href="Brian%20Ralph">Brian Ralph</a>, <a href="Masashi%20Tanaka">Masashi Tanaka</a>, <a href="Lewis%20Trondheim">Lewis Trondheim</a>, and Billy Simms have made wordless graphic novels. As Gross did in "He Done Her Wrong", 's wordless "oeuvre" uses textless <a href="Speech%20balloon">word balloons</a> containing symbols, icons, and other images. The influence of the wordless novel is prominent in Drooker's "Flood" (1992) and Kuper's "The System" (1997), both metaphorical stories that focus on social themes. Since 2011, the <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University%20Libraries">Pennsylvania State University Libraries</a> and the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Center%20for%20the%20Book">Pennsylvania Center for the Book</a> have awarded the annual Lynd Ward Prize for Graphic Novel, a cash prize established by Ward's daughters to highlight their father's influence on the development of the graphic novel.

Ghost Stories (magazine)

Ghost Stories was a U.S. <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> that published 64 issues between 1926 and 1932. It was one of the earliest competitors to "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", the first magazine to specialize in the fantasy and occult fiction genre. It was a companion magazine to "<a href="True%20Story%20%28magazine%29">True Story</a>" and "<a href="True%20Detective%20Stories">True Detective Stories</a>", and focused almost entirely on stories about ghosts, many of which were written by staff writers but presented under pseudonyms as true confessions. These were often accompanied by faked photographs to make the stories appear more believable. "Ghost Stories" also ran original and reprinted contributions, including works by <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>, <a href="Carl%20Richard%20Jacobi">Carl Jacobi</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a>. Among the reprints were <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>'s "The Last Seance" (under the title "The Woman Who Stole a Ghost"), several stories by <a href="H.G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="The%20Signal-Man">The Signal-Man</a>". The magazine was initially successful, but began to lose readers, and in 1930 was sold to <a href="Harold%20Hersey">Harold Hersey</a>. Hersey was unable to reverse the magazine's decline, and "Ghost Stories" ceased publication at the start of 1932.

Fantasy and occult fiction had often appeared in popular magazines prior to the twentieth century, but the first magazine to specialize in the genre, "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", did not appear until 1923. "Ghost Stories", which was launched by <a href="Bernarr%20Macfadden">Bernarr Macfadden</a> in July 1926, was one of "Weird Tales"' earliest competitors. Macfadden also published true confession magazines such as "<a href="True%20Story%20%28magazine%29">True Story</a>"; "Ghost Stories" followed this format, with the contents mostly produced by the publisher's staff writers, and attributed in print to a first-person narrator. The magazine was initially printed on <a href="Slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick</a> paper, which was sufficiently good quality to allow photographs to be used, and many of the stories had accompanying photographs purporting to be of their protagonists. These were replaced by line drawings when the magazine switched to pulp paper in July 1928. "Ghost Stories" occasionally printed contributions from outside writers, including "The Apparition in the Prize Ring", by <a href="Robert%20E.%20Howard">Robert E. Howard</a>, under the pseudonym "John Taverel". Popular writers such as <a href="Frank%20Belknap%20Long">Frank Belknap Long</a>, <a href="Hugh%20B.%20Cave">Hugh B. Cave</a>, <a href="Victor%20Rousseau">Victor Rousseau</a>, <a href="Stuart%20Palmer">Stuart Palmer</a>, and Robert W. Sneddon all sold stories to "Ghost Stories", though the quality suffered because of the limited scope the magazine's formula gave them. <a href="Carl%20Richard%20Jacobi">Carl Jacobi</a>'s first published story, "The Haunted Ring", appeared in the final issue.

In addition to original material, "Ghost Stories" included a substantial number of reprints, including well-known Victorian ghost stories such as "<a href="The%20Signal-Man">The Signalman</a>" by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, and "The Open Door" by <a href="Mrs.%20Oliphant">Mrs. Oliphant</a>. <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>'s "The Last Seance" appeared in the November 1926 issue, under the title "The Woman Who Stole a Ghost", and six stories by <a href="H.G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a> were reprinted, including ghost stories such as "<a href="The%20Red%20Room%20%28Wells%29">The Red Room</a>" and stories with less obvious appeal to "Ghost Stories"' readership, such as "Pollock and the Porroh Man". <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s "The Captain of the Polestar" appeared in the April 1931 issue, and he also contributed a non-fiction piece, "Houdini's Last Escape", which appeared in March 1930.

Macfadden set up an arrangement with Walter Hutchinson, a U.K. publisher, to exchange suitable material with "The Sovereign Magazine" and "Mystery-Story Magazine", two of Hutchinson's U.K. genre pulps, and many stories appeared on both sides of the Atlantic as a result.

The magazine was initially fairly successful, but sales soon began to fall. In March 1930 <a href="Harold%20Hersey">Harold Hersey</a> bought the magazine from Macfadden and took over as editor, but he was unable to revive the magazine's fortunes. In 1931 the schedule slipped to bimonthly, and three issues later the magazine ceased publication, probably because readers grew bored: the limited scope meant that the contents of the magazine eventually became predictable. The final issue was dated December 1931/January 1932.

"Ghost Stories" was published by Bernarr Macfadden, under the imprint Constructive Publishing Co., of Dunellin, New Jersey, until the March 1930 issue, after which it was taken over by Good Story Magazine Co. of New York, which was run by Harold Hersey, who had earlier edited "<a href="The%20Thrill%20Book">The Thrill Book</a>". The editorial director of Constructive Publishing during MacFadden's ownership was <a href="Fulton%20Oursler">Fulton Oursler</a>; his assistants, Harry A. Keller, W. Adolphe Roberts, George Bond, Daniel Wheeler, and Arthur B. Howland, each (in that order) spent close to a year editing, though the dates of transition between them are not known. When Hersey took over, his assistant was Stuart Palmer.

The magazine began as a slick, in <a href="bedsheet">bedsheet</a> format and switched to pulp layout with the July 1928 issue; it remained as a pulp until the end of its run with the exception of eight issues in large pulp format from April to December 1929. There were 64 issues, with six issues per volume, except for the last volume which included only four issues. The price was 25 cents throughout; it had 128 pages when pulp-sized, and 96 pages when a bedsheet and when it was a large pulp.

No anthologies have selected their contents solely from "Ghost Stories", but two magazines have done so: "True Twilight Tales" and "Prize Ghost Stories", both published by League Publications, a subsidiary of the company that owned the rights to the original stories, <a href="Macfadden%20Communications%20Group%23Macfadden/Bartell">MacFadden-Bartell</a>. "Prize Ghost Stories" published one issue, dated 1963, and "True Twilight Tales" published two, dated Fall 1963 and Spring 1964: both magazines were in large pulp format, with 96 pages, priced at 50 cents. The first issue of "True Twilight Tales" was edited by Helen Gardiner, who probably also was the editor of "Prize Ghost Stories"; the second issue of "True Twilight Tales" was edited by John M. Williams. There may have been other issues of both titles, as neither was numbered.

Imperator torosus

Imperator torosus, commonly known as the brawny bolete, is a species of <a href="bolete">bolete</a> fungus in the family <a href="Boletaceae">Boletaceae</a>. It is native to <a href="southern%20Europe">southern Europe</a> east to the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and Israel. It is generally associated with <a href="deciduous%20tree">deciduous tree</a>s such as <a href="hornbeam">hornbeam</a>, <a href="oak">oak</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a> in warm, dry locales. Although generally rare in Europe, it appears to be relatively common in <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>. Appearing in summer and autumn on <a href="Calcareous">chalky</a> soils, the stocky <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> have an ochre <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to 20 cm (8 in) across, yellow pores on the cap underside, and a <a href="wine%20%28color%29">wine-red</a> to brown or blackish <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> up to long by wide. The pale yellow <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> changes to different colours when broken or bruised depending on age; younger mushrooms become reddish, and older ones additionally take on bluish tones.

<a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> and Christopher Theodor Hök first <a href="species%20description">described</a> this species as "Boletus torosus" in 1835, a name by which it came to be known for many years. Modern <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a> shows that it is only distantly related to "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>"—the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of "<a href="Boletus">Boletus</a>"—and it was duly placed in the new <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Imperator%20%28fungus%29">Imperator</a>" in 2015.

Eating raw mushrooms of this species leads to <a href="Mushroom%20poisoning">vomiting and diarrhea</a>. Gastrointestinal symptoms have also occurred after eating cooked specimens, though some people have eaten it without ill effects.

Swiss mycologist <a href="Louis%20Secretan">Louis Secretan</a> described the brawny bolete as "Boletus pachypus" in his 1833 work "Mycographie Suisse". Many of his names have been rejected for <a href="nomenclature%20codes">nomenclatural</a> purposes because Secretan had a narrow <a href="species%20concept">species concept</a>, dividing many <a href="taxon">taxa</a> into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a> consistently. Swedish mycologists <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> and Christopher Theodor Hök described "Boletus torosus" in 1835 based on Secretan's "B. pachypus"—distinct from the "B. pachypus" described by Fries himself. Fries reported in his 1838 book "Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum" that he had not actually observed the species, and he did not designate a <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> or illustration. The <a href="botanical%20name">specific epithet</a> "torosus", which derives from <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, means "muscular". In the United Kingdom, it is known <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> as the "brawny bolete". The <a href="German%20language">German</a> name "Ochsen-Röhrling" means "oxen bolete" and the <a href="French%20language">French</a> "bolet vigoureux" is "strong bolete".

French naturalist <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> transferred the species to the now-obsolete genus "Dictyopus" in 1886, which resulted in the <a href="Synonym%20%28biology%29">synonym</a> "Dictyopus torosus". "Boletus xanthocyaneus", first described by <a href="Henri%20Romagnesi">Henri Romagnesi</a> in 1948 as "Boletus purpureus" var. "xanthocyaneus" and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist <a href="Carlo%20Luciano%20Alessio">Carlo Luciano Alessio</a> to be synonymous with "B. torosus". Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013, Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used "B. torosus" for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of "<a href="Imperator%20rhodopurpureus">Boletus rhodopurpureus</a>" or "<a href="Imperator%20luteocupreus">B. luteocupreus</a>" (both now placed in the genus "Imperator"). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, and that this was the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a <a href="neotype">neotype</a> specimen from this region.

Within the large genus "Boletus", the brawny bolete was <a href="classification%20%28biology%29">classified</a> in the <a href="section%20%28biology%29">section</a> "Luridi", which included species producing medium to large <a href="basidiocarp">fruit bodies</a> with thick, swollen stipes, and minute pores. In 1996, Czech mycologist <a href="Ji%C5%99%C3%AD%20Hlav%C3%A1%C4%8Dek">Jiří Hlaváček</a> further subdivided the section "Luridi", defining and naming the subsection "Torosi"—for "B. torosus"—to contain boletes that strongly bruised blue-black with handling.

In a <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular</a> analysis of Boletaceae <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>, the brawny bolete was most closely related to "Boletus luteocupreus"; these two species formed a <a href="clade">clade</a> that was <a href="sister%20group">sister</a> to "<a href="Suillellus%20luridus">B. luridus</a>". Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that "B. torosus" and many (but not all) red-pored boletes were part of a "dupainii" clade (named for "<a href="Rubroboletus%20dupainii">B. dupainii</a>"), well-removed from the core group of "<a href="Boletus%20edulis">Boletus edulis</a>" (the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of genus "Boletus") and relatives within the <a href="Boletineae">Boletineae</a>. This indicated that the brawny bolete and its relatives needed to be placed in a new genus. It was made the type species of the new genus "<a href="Imperator%20%28fungus%29">Imperator</a>", becoming "Imperator torosus", in 2015.

Quite heavy compared with other mushrooms of similar size, the stocky <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> contains relatively high amounts of <a href="chitin">chitin</a>. Holding the brawny bolete has been described as "having a stone in your hand". The <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> is in diameter. Hemispherical when young, it extends and flattens into a convex and finally a flattish shape, sometimes forming a slight depression in the centre. Initially curled downward and inward, the cap margin gradually turns outward, eventually flattening in maturity, and sometimes protruding beyond the pored undersurface. The surface texture starts slightly velvety, but becomes smoother and hairless with age; in moist weather, the cap is slightly sticky. Changing over time, the colour of the cap is initially vivid yellow or golden yellow, then ochre, then darkening in age to brown. However, if the <a href="cap%20cuticle">cap cuticle</a> is bruised, or even touched, there are sudden changes in the colour that depend on the age of the mushroom: young, yellow caps become cherry-red, while ochre-brown cap tissue bruises to reddish-purple. These colour changes soon give way to bluish or greyish tones, which, when combined, give the cap a <a href="Variegation">variegated</a> appearance.

The pores on the cap underside are round and small, the <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>-yellow colour of the pore surface becoming less intense with age. The squat <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stipe</a> measures long by thick. Egg-shaped when young, it lengthens somewhat as the mushroom grows, but is still bulbous in maturity; a mature stipe is typically a little shorter than the diameter of the cap. It is initially roughly the same colour as the cap, but as it matures, develops a <a href="wine%20%28color%29">wine-red</a> colouration near the base and a dirty brown to bluish-black colouration elsewhere. The surface has a mesh-like pattern (reticulation) that has a colour development similar to that of the cap: initially yellow, then purplish, and finally dark brown. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is thick and hard. It is yellow, except for the stipe base where it is deep red or dark brownish in older mushrooms. The pores, stipe and flesh turn greenish-blue with bruising or cutting. The smell is unpleasant, but the taste is mild.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is olive-brown. The smooth oval <a href="spore">spore</a>s measure 12–15 by 5–6 <a href="micrometre">μm</a>, and sometimes have an internal oil drop. <a href="Basidia">Basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 22–34 by 8–9 μm. The fusiform (fuse-shaped) <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> are colourless with oil droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8 μm. <a href="Cap%20cuticle">Cap cuticle</a> tissue is in the form of a trichoderm, where the outermost <a href="hyphae">hyphae</a> emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These cylindrical, interwoven hyphae contain <a href="septum">septa</a>.

The Mediterranean species "<a href="Boletus%20poikilochromus">Boletus poikilochromus</a>" somewhat resembles "I. torosus", but can usually be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, "B. poikilochromus" does not feature the colour change of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in "I. torosus". "Imperator luteocupreus" and "Caloboletus radicans" are also similar but the pores of the former are red, and the flesh of the latter has a bitter taste.

Several <a href="Chemical%20tests%20in%20mushroom%20identification">chemical tests</a> can be used to distinguish "I. torosus" from other similar boletes, such as "I. rhodopurpureus". "I. torosus" displays the following characteristic colour changes with tests performed on cut flesh less than 12 hours old: <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonium hydroxide</a> (NHOH)–yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring; <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a> (KOH)– deep <a href="buff%20%28color%29">buff</a> (instantly); <a href="ferrous%20sulphate">ferrous sulphate</a> (FeS0)–no change; <a href="Melzer%27s%20reagent">Melzer's reagent</a>–dark blue; <a href="phenol">phenol</a>–blue green (very slow); <a href="formalin">formalin</a>–mid blue (slow).

Like many boletes, "Imperator torosus" causes gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting when eaten raw. These reactions can also happen to some people when the mushroom is eaten cooked, though others have consumed it with no ill effects. In a 1994 study, researchers Ulrich Kiwitt and Hartmut Laatsch looked for the <a href="Disulfiram">antabuse</a>-like compound <a href="coprine">coprine</a> in "<a href="Suillellus%20luridus">Suillellus luridus</a>" and similar species that had been suspected of inducing Antabuse-like reactions with alcohol. Coprine ingestion results in heat and flushing in the face, tingling in arms and legs, nausea and vomiting, and <a href="tachycardia">increased heart rate</a> within five to ten minutes of consuming alcohol. They found none in the suspect species, but did find indications for it in "Imperator torosus". They concluded that the most likely explanation for historical poisoning incidents was a misidentification of "I. torosus" with "Suillellus luridus", though they could not rule out the latter species containing a hitherto unidentified compound causing alcohol-related reactions. No clinical cases of alcohol-related sensitivity have been recorded for "I. torosus".

"Imperator torosus" is native to southern Europe east to the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> and Israel. A <a href="mycorrhiza">mycorrhiza</a>l species, the fungus is generally associated with <a href="deciduous%20tree">deciduous tree</a>s such as <a href="hornbeam">hornbeam</a> ("Carpinus"), <a href="oak">oak</a> ("Quercus") and <a href="beech">beech</a> ("Fagus") in warm, dry locales, and is generally rare in Europe. In the United Kingdom, it is listed as a "priority species"—a <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a> requiring conservation action under the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan">UK Biodiversity Action Plan</a>. Similarly, it is on the list of protected species of macrofungi in <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>. It appears to be relatively common in Hungary. It is found under Palestine oak ("<a href="Quercus%20calliprinos">Quercus calliprinos</a>") in the Bar'am forest in <a href="Upper%20Galilee">Upper Galilee</a>. Fruitings typically occur from July to September in <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> (chalky) soil, with fruit bodies appearing either singly or in small groups.

No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF

No. 1 Aircraft Depot (No. 1 AD) was a maintenance unit of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). Formed in July 1921 at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, it relocated to the nearby <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Laverton</a> in March 1926. As well as servicing aircraft and other equipment, in its early years the depot supported survey flights in Australia and the Pacific region. It was also responsible for training maintenance staff.

No. 1 AD's strength increased from 350 staff in the 1930s to over 2,000 during World War II, when it assembled, tested and repaired aircraft ranging from <a href="De%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">Tiger Moth</a> trainers to <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a> fighters to <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> heavy bombers. It also undertook aircraft research and development.

Shortly after World War II, No. 1 AD introduced the first jets into RAAF service. In 1961, it ceased airframe maintenance, but continued to service aero engines. By the 1970s, the depot's main focus was ground-based equipment, though it still handled some aircraft components. No. 1 AD was disbanded in December 1994, its functions having been taken over by other units and private contractors. At the time of its disbandment, it was the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation.

No. 1 Aircraft Depot (No. 1 AD) was one of the first units formed by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> after the new service was established (initially as the Australian Air Force) on 31 March 1921. The original components of No. 1 AD became known as such in April 1921, though the unit did not formally come into existence until July. Prior to this it comprised two elements in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, one at <a href="Spotswood%2C%20Victoria">Spotswood</a> handling the equipment of the <a href="Imperial%20Gift">Imperial Gift</a> (128 surplus aircraft and associated spare parts donated by Great Britain following World War I), and another at <a href="Fitzroy%20North%2C%20Victoria">North Fitzroy</a> responsible for motor vehicle repair. When No. 1 AD was officially established at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, on 1 July, the Spotswood component was dissolved, while North Fitzroy continued to operate as a detachment. The unit's inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Bill Anderson</a>, who was also in overall charge of Point Cook.

In January 1922, the depot was organised into a headquarters that controlled stores, aircraft repair, and engine repair sections. The vehicle repair section at North Fitzroy was transferred to Point Cook that April. Point Cook's corrosive seaside atmosphere was however deemed an unsuitable long-term location for aircraft maintenance; the base also lacked railway infrastructure, necessary for transporting large aircraft parts. In September 1921, the government had purchased land at <a href="Laverton%2C%20Victoria">Laverton</a>, near a railway station inland from Point Cook, for the express purpose of constructing a dedicated home for No. 1 AD as the "warehouse of the Air Force". The depot, staffed by eight officers and seventy-seven other ranks, relocated to the <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Laverton%20Base">new base</a> on 1 March 1926. It occupied a large hangar that included an administration block, which along with living quarters and ancillary buildings had cost <a href="Australian%20pound">£</a>300,000 to build.

As well as receiving, assembling, testing and maintaining RAAF equipment, No. 1 AD was responsible for supporting research flights. In July 1927, it was the departure point for the Northern Survey Flight, comprising a <a href="de%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BHavilland%20DH.50">de Havilland DH.50</a> and two <a href="Airco%20DH.9">Airco DH.9</a>s, which reconnoitred air routes and landing grounds in <a href="Northern%20Australia">northern</a> and <a href="central%20Australia">central Australia</a> under the command of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Wing Commander <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>. The following month, No. 1 AD formed the Papuan Survey Flight, consisting of two <a href="Supermarine%20Seagull%20%281921%29">Supermarine Seagull III</a> amphibious biplanes under the command of Flight Lieutenant <a href="Ellis%20Wackett">Ellis Wackett</a>, which photographed the <a href="Territory%20of%20Papua">Papuan</a> and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>n coasts as far north as <a href="Aitape">Aitape</a>. Anderson, now a wing commander, returned to command the depot from April to August 1929, handing over to Wing Commander <a href="Adrian%20Cole%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Adrian Cole</a>, who served in the post until December 1932.
By the mid-1930s, No. 1 AD comprised 350 staff; the overall strength of the RAAF at this time was under 2,000. The depot serviced a range of aircraft that included the <a href="Westland%20Wapiti">Westland Wapiti</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Bulldog">Bristol Bulldog</a>, <a href="Hawker%20Demon">Hawker Demon</a>, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">de Havilland Dragon Rapide</a>, <a href="Avro%20643%20Cadet">Avro Cadet</a>, <a href="Avro%20Anson">Avro Anson</a>, and <a href="North%20American%20NA-16">North American NA-16</a>. The NA-16 was later augmented by the purchase of the more advanced <a href="North%20American%20NA-33">North American NA-33</a>, which was licensed and built in Australia by the <a href="Commonwealth%20Aircraft%20Corporation">Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation</a> as the <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">CAC Wirraway</a>. To cope with the Government's decision to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit Training Section, incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant <a href="Charles%20Eaton%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Charles Eaton</a> on 1 March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1 September 1936. No. 1 AD also commenced formal training courses for aircraft <a href="Fitter%20%28occupation%29">fitters</a> and <a href="Rigger%20%28industry%29">riggers</a> in 1935, leading to the formation of No. 1 School of Technical Training five years later.

In December 1935, No. 1 AD's workshops, under the command of Squadron Leader <a href="Arthur%20William%20Murphy">Arthur Murphy</a>, specially modified a Wapiti and a <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland Gipsy Moth</a> for <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> conditions, to enable an Air Force team led by Flight Lieutenant (later <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a>) Eric Douglas and Flying Officer <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a> to rescue explorer <a href="Lincoln%20Ellsworth">Lincoln Ellsworth</a>, who was presumed lost on a journey across the continent. On 3 May 1937, Recruit Training Squadron acquired a new sub-unit, the Communications and Survey Flight, utilising <a href="Tugan%20Gannet">Tugan Gannet</a>s and Dragon Rapides for ongoing photographic survey work; the squadron was re-formed as No. 1 Recruit Depot on 2 March 1940. Coupled with its aircraft assembly and test facilities, the recruit training unit made Laverton an obvious choice for the establishment of future RAAF squadrons. No. 1 AD's commanding officers during this decade included Wing Commanders <a href="Frank%20McNamara%20%28VC%29">Frank McNamara</a> (February 1933 to April 1936), <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> (April 1936 to January 1938), and Arthur Murphy (January 1938 to May 1940).

Although many squadrons were raised at RAAF Station Laverton during World War II, the base's prime focus continued to be its aircraft depot. Following the outbreak of hostilities in September 1939, No. 1 AD began expanding to handle the RAAF's growing number of training and combat aircraft, among them the Wirraway, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">de Havilland Tiger Moth</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20Hudson">Lockheed Hudson</a>, <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>, and <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawk</a>. The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible for the maintenance of in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No. 1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortresses</a>.

In March 1940, the RAAF began dividing Australia and New Guinea into <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control zones</a>; No. 1 AD came under the auspices of <a href="Southern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Southern Area Command</a>, which was headquartered in Melbourne and was responsible for RAAF units located in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. The depot spawned Nos. 1 and 2 Aircraft Parks, which were dedicated to aircraft assembly, in April–May 1940, and No. 1 Replenishing Unit, which was responsible for the upkeep of ordnance and ammunition at units in Southern Area, in June 1942. In October that year, control of No. 1 AD was transferred from Southern Area Command to the recently formed <a href="No.%204%20Group%20RAAF">No. 4 Maintenance Group</a>, also headquartered in Melbourne, which took over responsibility for maintenance units in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.

No. 1 AD undertook research and development on various aircraft types, including <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a>s, <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>s, and <a href="CAC%20Woomera">Wackett Woomeras</a>. It also ran comparative performance studies on Spitfires, Boomerangs, Kittyhawks, <a href="Brewster%20F2A%20Buffalo">Brewster Buffalos</a>, and <a href="Mitsubishi%20A6M%20Zero">Mitsubishi Zeros</a>. In the case of the Boomerang, 105 CA-12 models were delivered to No. 1 AD for testing between July 1942 and June 1943. As soon as the aircraft began arriving, the depot commenced handling and armament trials that continued for six months, identifying and overcoming such issues as the aircraft's guns freezing at high altitudes, and unusual levels of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> in the cockpit. Fighter aces <a href="Alan%20Rawlinson">Alan Rawlinson</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilfred Arthur</a>, along with a <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> pilot, conducted comparative trials between a Boomerang, a Kittyhawk, a Buffalo, and a <a href="Bell%20P-39%20Airacobra">Bell Airacobra</a>. The depot began despatching the Boomerangs to their operational units in March 1943, and the following month performance-tested a <a href="Turbocharger">turbocharged</a> version of the CA-14, though this model never entered production. No. 1 AD's Special Duties and Performance Flight was responsible for conducting performance trials during the early war years; in December 1943 it became a separate organisation, No. 1 Aircraft Performance Unit, which would evolve into the <a href="Aircraft%20Research%20and%20Development%20Unit%20RAAF">Aircraft Research and Development Unit</a> (ARDU) in 1947.

One of the depot's wartime commanding officers was Wing Commander <a href="John%20Lerew">John Lerew</a>, who held the post from December 1942 until November 1943. During his tenure, after investigating the crash of a <a href="Vultee%20A-31%20Vengeance">Vultee Vengeance</a>, he designed a clip to prevent the accidental release of the pilot's safety harness, which was later adopted for all such harnesses. By January 1945, No. 1 AD's strength had increased to its highest level of 2,339 staff.

After the war, No. 1 AD was responsible for introducing the first jets into RAAF service. A <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a> made its first flight in Australia from Laverton in 1946. By May 1947, No. 1 AD had assembled the first <a href="de%20Havilland%20Vampire">de Havilland Vampire</a> jet in Australia for its maiden flight. In October the same year, the first helicopter in RAAF service, a <a href="Sikorsky%20H-5">Sikorsky S-51</a>, arrived at the depot. That month, No. 1 AD also completed fitting out a <a href="Douglas%20Dakota">Douglas Dakota</a> with an office, a lounge suite, and a kitchenette for service as the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General's</a> VIP transport, operated out of Laverton by No. 1 Communication Unit. In 1950, the depot received the sole high-performance piston-engined <a href="CAC%20CA-15">CAC CA-15</a> to be built, which had been sent to be "converted to components" (scrapped). No. 1 AD took delivery of the first Australian-built <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jet bomber in July 1953. Shortly afterwards, it modified the three Canberras of <a href="No.%201%20Long%20Range%20Flight%20RAAF">No. 1 Long Range Flight</a> prior to the unit taking part in the <a href="1953%20London%20to%20Christchurch%20air%20race">1953 London-to-Christchurch air race</a>. In September that year, the first Australian-built <a href="CAC%20Sabre">Sabre</a> jet fighter was delivered.

As part of the RAAF's reorganisation from a geographically based command-and-control system to one based on function, No. 4 Maintenance Group was superseded by <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Command</a> on 1 October 1953. In September 1959, No. 1 AD came under the control of <a href="RAAF%20Support%20Command">Support Command</a>, formed when Maintenance Command was amalgamated with <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training Command</a>. Between June 1950 and October 1960, No. 1 AD maintained a detachment at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Tocumwal">RAAF Station Tocumwal</a>, New South Wales, to store obsolete aircraft awaiting disposal.

By 1961, when all airframe maintenance at Laverton was transferred to <a href="No.%202%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">Nos. 2</a> and <a href="No.%203%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">3 Aircraft Depots</a>, No. 1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No. 1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No. 3 Aircraft Depot at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland, to prepare for the introduction of the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No. 1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Williamtown">RAAF Bases Williamtown</a>, Amberley, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Townsville">Townsville</a>, <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Darwin">Darwin</a> and <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Pearce">Pearce</a>), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).

On 6 November 1981, the Governor-General, <a href="Zelman%20Cowen">Sir Zelman Cowen</a>, presented the <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">Queen's Colour</a> to No. 1 AD. By September the following year the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as <a href="electoplate">electroplating</a>, <a href="Optical%20fiber">fibre optics</a>, and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, <a href="Aermacchi%20MB-326">Macchi MB-326</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet</a> jets. From 1986, restructuring and outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services. In February 1990, No. 1 AD came under the control of <a href="RAAF%20Logistics%20Command">Logistics Command</a>, formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components. By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and private contractors, and it was disbanded on 2 December 1994. No. 1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating maintenance depot of any air force.

No. 1 AD was commanded by the following officers:

Law school of Beirut

The law school of Beirut (also known as the law school of Berytus and the school of Roman law at Berytus) was a center for the study of <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a> in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> located in <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> (). It flourished under the patronage of the <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>s and functioned as the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>'s preeminent center of <a href="jurisprudence">jurisprudence</a> until its destruction in AD 551.

The law schools of the Roman Empire established organized repositories of imperial <a href="Constitution%20%28Roman%20law%29">constitutions</a> and institutionalized the study and practice of jurisprudence to relieve the busy imperial courts. The archiving of imperial constitutions facilitated the task of <a href="jurist">jurist</a>s in referring to legal <a href="precedent">precedent</a>s. The origins of the law school of Beirut are obscure, but probably it was under <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> in the first century. The earliest written mention of the school dates to 239 AD, when its reputation had already been established. The school attracted young, affluent Roman citizens, and its professors made major contributions to the <a href="Corpus%20Juris%20Civilis">Codex of Justinian</a>. The school achieved such wide recognition throughout the Empire that Beirut was known as the "Mother of Laws". Beirut was one of the few schools allowed to continue teaching jurisprudence when <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> shut down other provincial law schools.

The course of study at Beirut lasted for five years and consisted in the revision and analysis of classical legal texts and imperial constitutions, in addition to case discussions. Justinian took a personal interest in the teaching process, charging the bishop of Beirut, the governor of <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia Maritima</a> and the teachers with discipline maintenance in the school.

The school's facilities were destroyed in the aftermath of a <a href="551%20Beirut%20earthquake">massive earthquake</a> that hit the Phoenician coastline. It was moved to <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a> but did not survive the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Levant">Arab conquest</a> of 635 AD. Ancient texts attest that the school was next to the ancient Anastasis church, vestiges of which lie beneath the <a href="Saint%20George%20Greek%20Orthodox%20Cathedral">Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral</a> in <a href="Beirut%20Central%20District">Beirut's historic center</a>.

As the guarantor of justice, the <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> was expected to devote substantial amounts of time to judicial matters. He was the <a href="Executive%20magistrates%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">chief magistrate</a> whose major prerogative ("<a href="Ius">jus</a>") was the ordering of all public affairs, for which he could demand assistance from anyone at any time.

With legal appeals, petitions from subjects and judicial queries of magistrates and <a href="Roman%20governor">governors</a>, the emperors were careful to consult with the <a href="jurist">jurist</a>s ("iuris consulti"), who were usually secretaries drafted from the <a href="Roman%20equestrian%20order">equestrian order</a>. From the reign of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a> (27 BC–AD 14), jurists began compiling organized repositories of imperial <a href="edict">edict</a>s ("constitutiones"), and legal scholarship became an imperially sponsored function of administration. Every new judicial decision was founded on archived legal precedents and earlier deliberations. The edict repositories and the imperially sponsored legal scholarship gave rise to the earliest law school system of the <a href="Western%20world">Western world</a>, aimed specifically at training professional jurists.

During the reign of Augustus, <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> was established under the name "Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus" (and granted the status of "<a href="Ius%20Italicum">Ius Italicum</a>") as a <a href="Colonia%20%28Roman%29">colony</a> for <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> veterans from the <a href="Legio%20V%20Macedonica">fifth Macedonian</a> and the <a href="Legio%20III%20Gallica">third Gallic</a> legions. It was chosen as a regional center instead of the more prominent Phoenician cities of <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> and <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, which had a history of belligerence against Rome.
Beirut was first mentioned in writing as a major center for the study of law in the 239 works of <a href="Gregory%20Thaumaturgus">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, the bishop of <a href="Niksar">Neo-Caesarea</a>. Other early written sources do not mention when the law school was established, and the date is much debated among modern historians and scholars. <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> suggested its founding may have been directed by locally born Emperor <a href="Alexander%20Severus">Alexander Severus</a>, who reigned during AD 222–235; this hypothesis had been supported by <a href="Gilles%20M%C3%A9nage">Gilles Ménage</a>, a late 17th-century French scholar. Italian jurist <a href="Scipione%20Gentili">Scipione Gentili</a>, however, attributed the school's foundation to Augustus, while 19th-century German theologian <a href="Karl%20Hase">Karl Hase</a> advocated its establishment shortly after the victory at Actium (31 BC). Adolf Friedrich Rudorff dated it to the reign of <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, while Franz Peter Bremer suggested that it opened around 200, based on Thaumaturgus.

<a href="Theodor%20Mommsen">Theodor Mommsen</a> linked the establishment of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces. After arriving in Beirut, these were translated into <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a>, <a href="publishing">published</a> and archived. This function was first recorded in 196 AD, the date of the earliest constitutions contained in the <a href="Codex%20Gregorianus">Gregorian Codex</a>, but the city is thought to have served as a repository since earlier times. The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult archived documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of <a href="Caesarea%20Maritima">Caesarea Maritima</a> and <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> lacked.

The 3rd-century emperors <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and <a href="Maximian">Maximian</a> issued constitutions exempting the students of the law school of Beirut from compulsory service in their hometowns. In the 4th century, the Greek <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>ian <a href="Libanius">Libanius</a> reported that the school attracted young students from affluent families and deplored the school's instructional use of <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, which was gradually abandoned in favor of Greek in the course of the century.
By the 5th century, Beirut had established its leading position and repute among the Empire's law schools; its teachers were highly regarded and played a chief role in the development of legal learning in the East to the point that they were dubbed “ecumenical masters”. From 425, the law school of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> closed those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and <a href="Athens">Athens</a> in 529 because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.

On July 9, 551, the Phoenician coastal cities were devastated by a high-magnitude earthquake. In Beirut the earthquake was followed by a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> and a fire that obliterated the city. In the aftermath, 30,000 people lost their lives, including many students from abroad. Justinian allocated funds to rebuild Beirut, and the law school was temporarily moved to the southern Phoenician city of <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, pending reconstruction; the best teachers, however, moved to Constantinople. Misfortune hit Beirut again in 560 AD when a massive fire ravaged the recovering city. The law school was not reopened, and all prospect for its return was abandoned with the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Levant">Arab conquest</a> in 635 AD.

The study course at the law school of Beirut was restricted to <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a>; it did not cover the local laws of the province of Phoenicia. Ancient texts provide an idea of the curriculum, the teaching method, the course languages and its duration.

Potential students were expected to have undergone grammar, rhetoric and encyclopedic sciences studies. Another prerequisite was the mastery of Greek and Latin, given that the classical legal references and imperial constitutions used in the teaching program were written in Latin. The aspirants could pursue their preparatory studies in public schools or have private tutors.

Little is known about the Beirut law school's curriculum before the 5th century. The "<a href="Scholia%20Sinaitica">Scholia Sinaitica</a>" and the "<a href="Scholia">Scholia</a>" to the "<a href="Basilika">Basilica</a>" provide glimpses of the school's <a href="teaching%20method">teaching method</a>, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze legal texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as <a href="Ulpian">Ulpian</a>. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.

Jurisprudence was taught in Latin, even in the law schools of the East, but toward the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century, Latin was supplanted by Greek at Beirut, which was the long-established <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of the eastern territories of the Roman Empire. A similar shift probably occurred at the school of Constantinople at about the same time.

The "Omnem" constitution at the beginning of the <a href="Digest%20%28Roman%20law%29">Digest</a> is the only source of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of <a href="Gaius%20%28jurist%29">Gaius</a>, Ulpian, <a href="Aemilius%20Papinianus">Papinian</a> and <a href="Julius%20Paulus%20Prudentissimus">Paulus</a>. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' "<a href="Responsa">Responsa</a>"; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, "Dupondii"; second, "Edictales"; third, "Papinianistae"; fourth, "Lytae".

Justinian's "Omnem" constitution fixed the duration of the legal course in the schools of Beirut and Constantinople at five years. The courses consisted of lectures and self-study using materials advanced in his "<a href="Corpus%20Juris%20Civilis">Corpus Juris Civilis</a>", namely the "<a href="Institutes%20of%20Justinian">Institutiones</a>" (Institutes), "<a href="Digest%20%28Roman%20law%29">Digesta</a>" (Digest) and "<a href="Codex%20Justinianus">Codex</a>" (Code). First-year students were lectured on the Institutes and on the first part of the Digest; second-year students were taught the greater part of the Digest, and third-year students had to learn various texts from Papinian and the "leges singulares". There were no lectures during the course's fourth year but the pupils studied the remainder of the Digest. Nicknames were still given according to the year of study, but Justinian changed the name of first-year students from the frivolous "Dupondii" (which means "two pennies") to "Iustiniani novi" and dubbed fifth-year students "Prolytae".
At the end of the course, graduands were given certificates allowing them to work as court advocates or in the imperial civil service.

Ancient texts reveal the names and deeds of some of the most notable law professors at the Beirut school. The scarce sources include historical accounts, works of legal scholarship, anthologies, ancient correspondences and funerary inscriptions.

<a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>-based rhetoric teacher Libanius wrote many letters of correspondence to Domninus the Elder, a 4th-century law school professor. In 360, Libanius invited Domninus to leave Beirut and teach with him at the rhetoric school of Antioch. Domninus apparently declined the offer, since later correspondence to him from Libanius, between 361 and 364, served as recommendations for law school candidates.

The most brilliant era of Beirut's law school, spanning the century between 400 and 500, was known as the era of the "Ecumenical Masters" (Greek: τῆς οἰκουμένης διδάσκαλοι). During this period, a succession of seven highly esteemed law masters was largely responsible for the revival of legal education in the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>. The seven revered masters, cited with praise by 6th-century scholars, were <a href="Cyrillus">Cyrillus</a>, <a href="Patricius%20%28jurist%29">Patricius</a>, <a href="Domninus%20%28jurist%29">Domninus</a>, <a href="Demosthenes%20%28jurist%29">Demosthenes</a>, <a href="Eudoxius%20%28jurist%29">Eudoxius</a>, <a href="Leontius%20%28jurist%29">Leontius</a> and <a href="Amblichus">Amblichus</a>.

Cyrillus was the founder of the ecumenical school of jurists. He is believed to have taught as of or . Styled "the great" due to his reputation as a teacher, he was known for his direct use of ancient sources of law and for interpreting jurists such as Ulpian and Papinian. Cyrillus wrote a precise treatise on definitions that supplied the materials for many important "scholia" appended to the first and second titles of the eleventh book of the "Basilica".
Patricius was praised in the third preface of the Justinian Digest ("Tanta-Dedoken") as a distinguished professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut at the turn of the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius. The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian <a href="Zacharias%20Rhetor">Zacharias Rhetor</a>, who was his first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20the%20East">Praetorian prefect of the East</a> under Emperor <a href="Anastasius%20I%20Dicorus">Anastasius I</a> between 503 and 504, and became <a href="Magister%20militum">Magister militum</a> in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian. His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's "Libri ad Edictum".

Historical sources also tell of Euxenius, a teacher at the Beirut law school who taught during the times of the "Ecumenical Masters". Euxenius was the brother of the city's bishop Eustathius and was involved in the 460 religious controversy caused by <a href="Pope%20Timothy%20II%20of%20Alexandria">Timothy Aelurus</a>, which opposed the <a href="Miaphysitism">Miaphysites</a> to the followers of the <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a>.
<a href="Dorotheus%20%28jurist%29">Dorotheus</a>, Anatolius (son of Leontius) and Julianus were school professors contemporary to Justinian I. The first two were summoned to the imperial court and commissioned to draft the "Digesta". Under the supervision of <a href="Tribonian">Tribonian</a>, Dorotheus also collaborated with Theophilus, a Constantinopolitan law teacher, in drafting the "Institutiones". Julianus, the last known professor of Beirut's law school, was extolled by Theaetetus as "the light of the law". After the earthquake, Julianus left Beirut and settled in Constantinople, where he authored the "<a href="Novellae%20Constitutiones">Epitome Iuliani</a>" in 555.

Under Justinian, there were eight teachers in the law schools of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>, presumably four in each of Beirut and Constantinople's schools. Justinian mandated the supervision and enforcement of discipline in the school of Beirut to the teachers, the city's bishop and the <a href="Praeses">governor</a> of Phoenicia Maritima.

While most of the law school's students are not remembered by history, ancient historians and sources recount the stories of some of those who were deemed notable and achieved fame.

According to <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius of Caesarea</a>, <a href="Pamphilus%20of%20Caesarea">Pamphilus of Caesarea</a> was born into a rich family in Beirut in the latter half of the 3rd century and attended its law school. Pamphilus later became the <a href="presbyter">presbyter</a> of Caesarea Maritima and the founder of its extensive Christian library. He is celebrated as a martyr by both the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>. Eusebius also tells of martyred brothers <a href="Aphian">Aphian</a> and <a href="Aedesius%20of%20Alexandria">Aedesius</a>, born to a noble <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>n family. They converted to Christianity while studying law in Beirut and were persecuted and executed for their beliefs.

Fourth-century historian <a href="Eunapius">Eunapius</a> wrote of <a href="Anatolius">Anatolius</a>, a high-ranking Roman official known to his enemies as "Azutrio". Anatolius occupied the offices of consul of Syria, <a href="vicarius">vicarius</a> of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Asia">Diocese of Asia</a>, <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of Constantinople, <a href="List%20of%20urban%20prefects%20of%20Constantinople">urban prefect of Constantinople</a> in 354, and <a href="Praetorian%20prefecture%20of%20Illyricum">Praetorian prefect of Illyricum</a> until his death in 360. In his account of Anatolius, Eunapius summarized: "He reached the summit of the science of law. Nothing about this is surprising because Beirut, his homeland, is the mother and nurse of these studies".
Libanius' correspondence with Gaianus of Tyre discusses the latter's achievements after his graduation from the law school of Beirut; Gaianus became the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20governors%20of%20Syria%23Consularis%20Governors%20of%20Syria%20Phoenicia%20%28c.%20295%20to%20c.%20395%29">consular governor of Phoenicia</a> in 362.
<a href="Gaza%20City">Gazan</a> lawyer and church historian <a href="Sozomen">Sozomen</a>, also a law student at Beirut, wrote in his "Historia Ecclesiastica" about <a href="Triphyllius">Triphyllius</a>, a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received legal training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher <a href="Saint%20Spyridon">Saint Spyridon</a> for his <a href="atticism">atticism</a> and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.

Zacharias Rhetor studied law at Beirut between 487 and 492, then worked as a lawyer in Constantinople until his imperial contacts won him the appointment as bishop of <a href="Mytilene">Mytilene</a>. Among Rhetor's works is the biography of <a href="Severus%20of%20Antioch">Severus</a>, the last miaphysite patriarch of Antioch and one of the founders of the <a href="Syriac%20Orthodox%20Church">Syriac Orthodox Church</a>, who had also been a law student in Beirut as of 486. Another late 5th-century student was <a href="John%20Rufus">John Rufus</a>, an anti-<a href="Chalcedonian%20Christianity">Chalcedonian</a> priest who moved to <a href="Maiuma">Maiuma</a> after the expulsion of his master, <a href="Peter%20the%20Fuller">Peter the Fuller</a>. In Maiuma, John Rufus authored the "Plerophoriae" and the "Life of <a href="Peter%20the%20Iberian">Peter the Iberian</a>".

Historically, Roman "stationes" or "auditoria", where teaching was done, stood next to public libraries housed in temples. This arrangement was copied in the Roman colony at Beirut. The first mention of the school's premises dates to 350, but the description does not specify its location. In the 5th century, Zacharias Rhetor reported that the school stood next to the "Temple of God", the description of which permitted its identification with the Byzantine Anastasis cathedral.

At the turn of the 20th century, archaeological excavations in the <a href="souq">souq</a> between the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral and <a href="Saint%20George%20Maronite%20Cathedral%2C%20Beirut">Saint George Cathedral of the Maronites</a> unearthed a funerary <a href="stele">stele</a> etched with an epitaph to a man named Patricius, "whose career was consecrated for the study of law". The epitaph was identified as being dedicated to the famous 5th-century law school professor. In 1994, archaeological diggings underneath the Saint George Greek Orthodox Cathedral in <a href="Beirut%20Central%20District">Beirut Central District</a>'s Nejmeh Square identified structural elements of the Anastasis cathedral, but they were restricted to an area of and failed to unearth the interred school.

The law school of Beirut supplied the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent because of the affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession. A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor <a href="Leo%20I%20the%20Thracian">Leo I</a>. The edict ordered that candidates for the bar of the Eastern <a href="praetorian%20prefect">praetorian prefect</a>ure had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them at one of the recognized law schools of the Empire.

The in-depth studies of the classical legal works in Beirut, and later in Constantinople, conferred an unprecedented scientific dimension to jurisprudence; this academic movement gave rise to the minds behind Justinian's legal reforms. As a result of the new understanding of the classical legal texts, the imperial laws of the late 5th and early 6th centuries were clearer and more coherent than those of the early <a href="Postclassical%20Era">Postclassical Era</a>, according to legal historian George Mousourakis and other scholars.

The school garnered accolades throughout its existence and was bestowed with the title "Berytus Nutrix Legum" (Beirut, Mother of Laws) by Eunapius, Libanius, Zacharias Rhetor and finally by Emperor Justinian. His 533 "Omnem" constitution read:
These three works which we have composed we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities as well as in the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.

From the 3rd century, the school tolerated Christian teachings, producing a number of students who would become influential church leaders and bishops, such as <a href="Pamphilus%20of%20Caesarea">Pamphilus of Caesarea</a>, <a href="Severus%20of%20Antioch">Severus of Antioch</a> and <a href="Aphian">Aphian</a>. Under <a href="Cyrillus">Cyrillus</a>, the first of the Ecumenical Masters, the Christian faith was consolidated as an integral element of the legal training.

Two professors from the law school of Beirut, Dorotheus and Anatolius, had such a repute for their wisdom and knowledge that they were especially praised by Justinian in the opening of his "Tanta" constitution. The emperor summoned both professors to assist his minister Tribonian in compiling the Codex of Justinian, the Empire's body of civil laws issued between 529 and 534. The "Tanta" passage reads:
Dorotheus, an illustrious man, of great eloquence and quæstorian rank, whom, when he was engaged in delivering the law to students in the most brilliant city of Berytus, we, moved by his great reputation and renown, summoned to our presence and made to share in the work in question; again, Anatolius, an illustrious person, a magistrate, who, like the last, was invited to this work when acting as an exponent of law at Berytus, a man who came of an ancient stock, as both his father Leontius and his grandfather Eudoxius left behind them an excellent report in respect of legal learning...

For centuries following its compilation, the work of Justinian's commission was studied and incorporated into the legal systems of different nations and has profoundly impacted the <a href="Byzantine%20law">Byzantine law</a> and the <a href="Western%20law">Western legal tradition</a>. Peter Stein asserts that the texts of ancient Roman law have constituted "a kind of legal supermarket, in which lawyers of different periods have found what they needed at the time."
The "Corpus Juris Civilis" remained the basis of Byzantine law until the publication of the "<a href="Byzantine%20law%23Ecloga">Ecloga legum</a>" in 741 by Emperor <a href="Leo%20III%20the%20Isaurian">Leo III</a> and his son and co-regent <a href="Constantine%20V">Constantine V</a>. The "Ecloga" was a shortened and more philanthropic version of the Codex of Justinian, whose dispositions were more in tune with <a href="Christian%20values">Christian values</a>. It was written in Greek, since Latin had fallen into disuse, and its provisions continued to be applied in later centuries in the neighboring Balkan and Asia Minor regions, with surviving translations in <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a>, <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> and <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. Emperor <a href="Basil%20I">Basil I</a>, who ruled in the 9th century, issued the "Prochiron" and the "Epanagoge", which were legal compilations invalidating parts of the "Ecloga" and restoring the Justinian laws. The "Prochiron" served as the basis for the legal writings of the 12th-century first archbishop of Serbia, <a href="Saint%20Sava">Saint Sava</a>. His legal compilation was intended for the <a href="Serbian%20Orthodox%20Church">Serbian church</a> but the influential work was adopted as the basic constitution for the Bulgarian and Russian orthodox churches. Around 900, Emperor <a href="Leo%20VI%20the%20Wise">Leo VI</a> commissioned the "Basilica", a Greek rewriting of the Justinian laws that is considered the ancestor of modern Greece's law until the enactment of the Code of 1940.

The Codex of Justinian also had a great influence on Western law, particularly on the legal history and tradition of western Europe and its American colonies. In Italy, a single complete copy of the Justinian Digest survived and lay forgotten until its rediscovery in 1070. In 1088, <a href="Irnerius">Irnerius</a>, a jurist and teacher of the liberal arts in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, was the first to teach the newly recovered Digest and the rest of Justinian's books. He and his successors explained the Roman laws to their students by means of glosses or explanatory notes written on the edges or between the text lines. The Roman legal concepts resulting from the studies of these "<a href="glossator">glossator</a>s" spread to the universities and law courts of Europe. The Roman law revival that started in Italy, during the Middle Ages, was taken up by France, the Netherlands and Germany in later centuries. The enactment of the German Civil Code in 1900 put an end to the application of extant forms of law derived from the Justinian codes in most European states.

The reputation of Beirut as "mother of laws" reemerged in modern times. In 1913, <a href="Paul%20Huvelin">Paul Huvelin</a>, the first dean of the newly established <a href="Saint%20Joseph%20University">Université Saint-Joseph</a>'s Faculty of Law, dedicated the inaugural speech to the classical law school of Beirut in an effort to confer legitimacy to the new academy. The epithet "Berytus Nutrix Legum" is used as a motto and as part of the emblem of the Beirut Bar Association, founded in 1919. It is also featured in the seal and flag of the Municipality of Beirut.

Ward first encountered the wordless novel with <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28wordless%20novel%29">The Sun</a>" (1919) while studying art in Germany in 1926. He returned to the United States in 1927 and established a career for himself as an illustrator. He found <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a>'s wordless novel "<a href="Destiny%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Destiny</a>" (1926) in New York City in 1929, and it inspired him to create such a work of his own. appeared a week before the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>; it nevertheless enjoyed strong sales and remains the best-selling American wordless novel. Its success inspired other Americans to experiment with the medium, including cartoonist <a href="Milt%20Gross">Milt Gross</a>, who parodied in "<a href="He%20Done%20Her%20Wrong">He Done Her Wrong</a>" (1930). In the 1970s Ward's example inspired cartoonists <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> and <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a> to create their first graphic novels.

The <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a> is a silent narrative made up of prints of 139 engraved <a href="woodcut">woodblocks</a>. Each image moves the story forward by an interval Ward chooses to maintain story flow. Ward wrote in "Storyteller Without Words" (1974) that too great an interval would put too much interpretational burden on the reader, while too little would make the story tedious. Wordless novel historian David A. Beronä likens these concerns with the storytelling methods of <a href="comics">comics</a>.

The artwork is executed in black and white; the images vary in size and dimension, up to , the size of the opening and closing images of each chapter. Ward uses symbolic contrast of dark and light to emphasize the corruption of the city, where even in daylight the buildings darken the skies; in the countryside, the scenes are bathed in natural light. Ward exaggerates facial expression to convey emotion without resorting to words. Composition also conveys emotion: in the midst of his fame, an image has the artist framed by raised wineglasses; the faces of those holding the glasses are not depicted, highlighting the isolation the artist feels. The story parallels the <a href="Faust">Faust</a> theme, and the artwork and execution show the influence of film, in particular those of German studio <a href="Universum%20Film%20AG">Ufa</a>.

The <a href="Apostrophe%20in%20English%23Basic%20rule%20%28plural%20nouns%29">placement of the apostrophe</a> in the title implies a <a href="Polytheism">plurality of gods</a>, rather than <a href="Judeo-Christian">Judeo-Christian</a>ity's <a href="Monotheism">monotheistic</a> God. It alludes to a line from the play "<a href="Bacchides%20%28play%29">Bacchides</a>" by ancient Roman playwright <a href="Plautus">Plautus</a>: "He whom the gods favor, dies young."

A poor artist signs a contract with a masked stranger, who gives him a magic brush, with which the artist rapidly rises in the art world. He is disillusioned when he discovers the world is corrupted by money, personified by his mistress. He wanders around the city, seeing his auctioneer and mistress in everyone he sees. Enraged by the hallucinations, he attacks one of them, who turns out to be a police officer. The artist is jailed for it, but he escapes, and a mob chases him from the city. He is injured when he jumps into a ravine to avoid recapture. A woman who lives in the woods discovers him and brings him back to health. They have a child, and live a simple, happy life together, until the mysterious stranger returns and beckons the artist to the edge of a cliff. The artist prepares to paint a portrait of the stranger but fatally falls from the cliff with fright when the stranger reveals a skull-like head behind the mask.

Chicago-born <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a> (1905–1985) was a son of <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> minister <a href="Harry%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Ward">Harry F. Ward</a> (1873–1966), a social activist and the first chairman of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. Throughout his career, Ward displayed in his work the influence of his father's interest in social injustice. He was early drawn to art, and decided to become an artist when his first-grade teacher told him that "Ward" spelled backward was "draw". He excelled as a student, and contributed art and text to high school and college newspapers.

In 1926, after graduating from <a href="Teachers%20College%2C%20Columbia%20University">Teachers College, Columbia University</a>, Ward married writer <a href="May%20McNeer">May McNeer</a> and the couple left for an extended honeymoon in Europe. After four months in eastern Europe, the couple settled in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> in Germany, where, as a special one-year student at the , Ward studied <a href="wood%20engraving">wood engraving</a>. There he encountered <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionist</a> art, and read the wordless novel "The Sun" (1919),a modernized version of the story of <a href="Icarus">Icarus</a>, told in sixty-three wordless woodcut prints, by Flemish woodcut artist <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a> (1889–1972).

Ward returned to the United States in 1927, and freelanced his illustrations. In 1929, he came across German artist <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a>'s wordless novel "Destiny" (1926) in New York City. Nückel's only work in the genre, "Destiny" told of the life and death of a prostitute in a style inspired by Masereel's, but with a greater cinematic flow. The work inspired Ward to create a wordless novel of his own, whose story sprang from his "youthful brooding" on the short, tragic lives of artists such as <a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Van Gogh</a>, <a href="Henri%20de%20Toulouse-Lautrec">Toulouse-Lautrec</a>, <a href="John%20Keats">Keats</a>, and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a>; Ward's argument in the work was "that creative talent is the result of a bargain in which the chance to create is exchanged for the blind promise of an early grave".

In March 1929 Ward showed the first thirty blocks to Harrison Smith (1888–1971) of the publisher Cape & Smith. Smith offered him a contract and told him the work would be the lead title in the company's first catalog if Ward could finish it by the summer's end. The first printing appeared that October; it had <a href="Paperback%23Trade%20paperback">trade</a> and deluxe editions. The trade edition was printed from <a href="Electrotyping">electrotype</a> plates made from molds of the original <a href="Buxus">boxwood</a> woodblocks; the deluxe edition was printed from the original woodblocks themselves, and was a signed edition limited to 409 copies, printed on <a href="acid-free%20paper">acid-free paper</a>, bound in black cloth, and sheathed in a <a href="slipcase">slipcase</a>. The pages were printed on the <a href="Recto%20and%20verso">recto</a> face of the page; the verso was left blank. It was dedicated to three of Ward's teachers: his wood engraving teacher in Leipzig, Hans Alexander "Theodore" Mueller (1888–1962), and Teachers College, Columbia University art instructors John P. Heins (1896–1969) and Albert C. Heckman (1893–1971).

The book has been reprinted and anthologized in a variety of editions. In 1974, it appeared in "Storyteller Without Words", a collected edition with "<a href="Madman%27s%20Drum">Madman's Drum</a>" (1930) and "<a href="Wild%20Pilgrimage">Wild Pilgrimage</a>" (1932) prefaced with essays by Ward. The stories appeared in a compact fashion, sometimes four images to a page. In 2010, it was collected with Ward's other five wordless novels in a two-volume <a href="Library%20of%20America">Library of America</a> edition edited by cartoonist <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>.

The book's original woodblocks are kept in the Lynd Ward Collection in the Joseph Mark Lauinger Memorial Library at <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> in Washington, D.C., bequeathed by Ward's daughters Nanda and Robin.

 was the first American wordless novel, and no such European work had yet been published in the US. proved to be the best selling. Though it was released the week before the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a> and the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> that ensued, it went through three printings by January 1930, and sold more than 20,000 copies in six printings over its first four years. During the same period, the young Ward saw his career as an in-demand book illustrator bloom, and found acceptance as an authority on children's book illustration.

The success of led to the American publication of Nückel's "Destiny" in 1930. In 1930 cartoonist <a href="Milt%20Gross">Milt Gross</a> parodied and silent melodrama films in a wordless novel of his own, "<a href="He%20Done%20Her%20Wrong">He Done Her Wrong</a>", subtitled "The Great American Novel, and not a word in it—no music too". The protagonist is a lumberjack, a commentary on Ward as a woodcut artist.

The Ballet Theatre of New York considered an adaptation of "Gods' Man", and a board member approached Felix R. Labunski to compose it. Financial difficulties moved Labunski to abandon it and his other creative work. Despite several proposals made through the 1960s, no film adaptation has been made of "Gods' Man".

Left-leaning artists and writers admired the book, and Ward frequently received poetry based on it. <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a> used imagery from in his poem "<a href="Howl">Howl</a>" (1956), and referred to the images of the city and jail in Ward's book in the poem's annotations. <a href="Abstract%20expressionism">Abstract expressionist</a> painter <a href="Paul%20Jenkins%20%28painter%29">Paul Jenkins</a> wrote Ward in 1981 of the influence the book's "energy and unprecedented originality" had on his own art. In 1973 Art Spiegelman created the four-page comic strip "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" about his mother's suicide, executed in an Expressionist woodcut style inspired by Ward's work. Spiegelman later incorporated the strip into his graphic novel "<a href="Maus">Maus</a>". <a href="My%20Morning%20Jacket">My Morning Jacket</a> frontman <a href="Jim%20James">Jim James</a> released a solo album "<a href="Regions%20of%20Light%20and%20Sound%20of%20God">Regions of Light and Sound of God</a>" in 2013 inspired by "Gods' Man", which he had at first conceived as a soundtrack to a film adaptation of the book.

"Gods' Man" remains Ward's best known and most widely read wordless novel. Spiegelman considered this due less to the qualities of the book "per se" in relation to Ward's other wordless novels as to the book's novelty as the first wordless novel published in the US. Irwin Haas praised the artwork but found the storytelling uneven, and thought that only with his third wordless novel "Wild Pilgrimage" did Ward come to master the medium.

The artwork has drawn some unintended mirth: American writer <a href="Susan%20Sontag">Susan Sontag</a> included it on her "canon of <a href="Camp%20%28style%29">Camp</a>" in her 1964 essay "<a href="Notes%20on%20%26quot%3BCamp%26quot%3B">Notes on 'Camp'</a>", and Spiegelman admitted that the scenes of "the depiction of Our Hero idyllically skipping through the glen with the Wife and their child makes snicker".

Psychiatrist <a href="M.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BScott%20Peck">M. Scott Peck</a> objected strongly to the content of the book: he believed it had a destructive effect on children, and called it "the darkest, ugliest book had ever seen". To Peck, the mysterious stranger represented <a href="Satan">Satan</a> and the spirit of death.

Southern Cross (wordless novel)

Southern Cross is the sole <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a> by Canadian artist <a href="Laurence%20Hyde%20%28artist%29">Laurence Hyde</a> (1914–1987). Published in <a href="1951%20in%20literature">1951</a>, its 118 <a href="wood%20engraving">wood-engraved</a> images narrate the impact of <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20testing">atomic testing</a> on Pacific islanders. Hyde made the book to express his anger at the US military's <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll</a>.

The wordless novel genre had flourished primarily during the 1920s and 1930s, but by the 1940s even the most prolific practitioners had abandoned it. Hyde was familiar with some such works by <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a>, <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a>, and the form's pioneer <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a>. The high-contrast artwork of "Southern Cross" features dynamic curving lines uncommon in wood engraving and combines abstract imagery with realistic detail. It has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the <a href="Canadian%20comics">Canadian graphic novel</a>, though it had no direct influence.

The story tells of the American military evacuating villagers from a Pacific island before testing nuclear weapons. A drunken soldier attempts to rape a fisherman's wife during the evacuation, and the fisherman kills him. To avoid capture, the couple run to the forests with their child and hide. The child witnesses the death of the parents and destruction of their environment from the ensuing atomic tests.

Born in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston upon Thames</a> in England in 1914, Laurence Hyde moved with his family to Canada in 1926. They settled in Toronto in 1928, where Hyde studied art at <a href="Central%20Technical%20School">Central Technical School</a>. His strongest artistic influences included the painter <a href="Paul%20Nash%20%28artist%29">Paul Nash</a> and the printmakers <a href="Eric%20Gill">Eric Gill</a>, <a href="Rockwell%20Kent">Rockwell Kent</a>, and <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a>; he corresponded with Kent and Ward.

From the 1930s Hyde did commercial pen-and-ink and <a href="scratchboard">scratchboard</a> illustrations, ran a business providing advertising illustrations, and made <a href="wood%20engraving">wood engraving</a>s and <a href="linocut">linocut</a>s for books. He attempted but gave up on two series of prints, titled "Discovery" and "Macbeth". Hyde worked in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> for the <a href="National%20Film%20Board%20of%20Canada">National Film Board of Canada</a> from 1942 until his 1972 retirement.

The <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a> had been popular in the 1920s and 1930s, but had become rare by the 1940s. Such books tended to be melodramatic works about social injustice. Hyde was familiar with some of Ward's books and the German <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a>'s "<a href="Destiny%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Destiny</a>" (1926). The only work he knew of the Flemish artist <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a>, the form's first and most prolific practitioner, was "<a href="Passionate%20Journey">Passionate Journey</a>" (1919), which he had read in a 1949 American edition. Like his forebears in the genre, Hyde had a <a href="left-wing%20politics">left-wing</a> agenda that he expressed in his art. When "Southern Cross" appeared, the genre had been out of the public eye for so long that Hyde included a historical essay to orient the reader. Hyde had asked Ward to proofread this history, but the book was published without Ward's corrections—errors remained, such as Masereel's forename given as "Hans", and a listing of only four of Ward's six wordless novels.

Hyde made "Southern Cross" to express his anger at American <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll</a> in 1946 following the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombings in Japan</a>. He worked on it from 1948 to 1951. Each image is , centred at the top third of the page and with broad margins. The one exception is of the bomb detonating, a full-page image that <a href="bleed%20%28printing%29">bleeds</a> off the page. Hyde carved dynamic curving lines uncommon in wood engraving. Blacks overwhelms the figures they surround, and abstract images contrast with realistic detail in the flora and fauna.

"Southern Cross" was published in a limited edition by <a href="Ward%20Ritchie%20Press">Ward Ritchie Press</a> in 1951 on <a href="Washi">Japanese paper</a> with the images on the <a href="recto%20and%20verso">recto</a> and the verso left blank. Rockwell Kent provided the introduction. Hyde dedicated the book to the <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross Societies</a> and the <a href="Quakers">Society of Friends</a>. He was not present at the book's pressing and thus was not able to correct some blocks that he had not carved deeply enough to produce satisfactory prints.

The book was republished twice in 2007: <a href="Drawn%20and%20Quarterly">Drawn and Quarterly</a> released a deluxe facsimile edition with additional essays by Hyde and an introduction by wordless novel historian David Beronä, and <a href="George%20Walker%20%28printmaker%29">George Walker</a> included "Southern Cross" in his anthology of wordless novels "Graphic Witness".

In a talk with the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">CBC</a> in 1952, literary critic <a href="Northrop%20Frye">Northrop Frye</a> praised Hyde's visual skills, but said, "There's no point in getting the book for your library unless you like the engravings themselves as separate works of art." He found the book a quick read in contrast to the time it took to make it, and called its "continuity" a weak point. He considered the visualization of the bomb's destruction of living things the strongest justification for the work.

Comics critic Sean Rogers praised the work, particularly the pacing and action sequences, but felt it had less impact than such earlier works as Masereel's "<a href="Passionate%20Journey">Passionate Journey</a>" (1919) or Ward's "<a href="Vertigo%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Vertigo</a>" (1937). Rogers found the anti-nuclear message less effective than that of later comics such as <a href="Keiji%20Nakazawa">Keiji Nakazawa</a>'s "<a href="Barefoot%20Gen">Barefoot Gen</a>" or <a href="Gary%20Panter">Gary Panter</a>'s "<a href="Jimbo%20%28comics%29">Jimbo</a>". Comics scholar <a href="Roger%20Sabin">Roger Sabin</a> found the book unconvincing, "a well-meaning but facile piece of <a href="agitprop">agit-prop</a>". Reviewer Erik Hinton praised the artwork while calling the story "the progeny of historical lip-service and the hot-button anxiety of the destructivity of modern warfare", and considered Ward and others of Hyde's predecessors more proficient at the medium.

"Southern Cross" has gained appreciation in comics circles as a precursor to the <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> in Canada, though it had no direct influence on <a href="Canadian%20comics">Canadian comics</a>—it was marketed to book connoisseurs, a world far removed from that of consumers of cheap entertainment that comics served in the 1950s. Copies of "Southern Cross" joined the collections of the <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Canada">National Gallery of Canada</a> in 1952 and the <a href="Burnaby%20Art%20Gallery">Burnaby Art Gallery</a> in 1987. The book received an mention for Best Book at the 2008 <a href="Doug%20Wright%20Award">Doug Wright Awards for Canadian Cartooning</a>, accepted by Hyde's son, Anthony.

Hasan al-Kharrat

Abu Muhammad Hasan al-Kharrat ( 
"Ḥassan al-Kharrāṭ"; 1861–25 December 1925) was one of the principal <a href="Syrian%20people">Syria</a>n rebel commanders of the <a href="Great%20Syrian%20Revolt">Great Syrian Revolt</a> against the <a href="French%20Mandate%20of%20Syria">French Mandate</a>. His main area of operations was in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> and its <a href="Ghouta">Ghouta</a> countryside. He was killed in the struggle and is considered a hero by Syrians.

As the "qabaday" (local youths boss) of the <a href="al-Shaghour">al-Shaghour</a> quarter of Damascus, al-Kharrat was connected with <a href="Nasib%20al-Bakri">Nasib al-Bakri</a>, a nationalist from the quarter's most influential family. At al-Bakri's invitation, al-Kharrat joined the revolt in August 1925 and formed a group of fighters from al-Shaghour and other neighborhoods in the vicinity. He led the rebel assault against Damascus, briefly capturing the residence of French High-Commissioner <a href="Maurice%20Sarrail">Maurice Sarrail</a> before withdrawing amid heavy French bombardment.

Towards the end of 1925, relations grew tense between al-Kharrat and other rebel leaders, particularly <a href="Sa%27id%20al-%27As">Sa'id al-'As</a> and <a href="Ramadan%20al-Shallash">Ramadan al-Shallash</a>, as they traded accusations of plundering villages or extorting local inhabitants. Al-Kharrat continued to lead operations in the Ghouta, where he was ultimately killed in a French ambush. The revolt dissipated by 1927, but he gained a lasting reputation as a martyr of the Syrian resistance to French rule.

Al-Kharrat was born to a <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Muslim</a> family in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> in 1861, during <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> <a href="Ottoman%20Syria">rule in Syria</a>. He served as the night watchman of the city's <a href="al-Shaghour">al-Shaghour</a> quarter and as a guard for the neighborhood's orchards. Damascus was captured by <a href="Arab%20Revolt">Arab rebels</a> during <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in October 1918. Afterward, the Arab Club, an <a href="Arab%20nationalism">Arab nationalist</a> organization, emerged in the city to raise support for the rebels. The club assisted the rebels' leader, Emir <a href="Faisal%20I%20of%20Iraq">Faisal</a>, who formed a rudimentary government. Al-Kharrat became an affiliate of the Arab Club and raised support for Faisal in al-Shaghour. In July 1920, Faisal's government collapsed after its motley forces were defeated by the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Maysalun">Battle of Maysalun</a>. Afterward, the French ruled Syria under the aegis of their <a href="French%20Mandate%20of%20Syria">League of Nations mandate</a>.

In the early years of French rule, al-Kharrat was al-Shaghour's "qabaday" (pl. "qabadayat"), the traditional leader of a neighborhood's local toughs. The "qabaday" was informally charged with redressing grievances and defending a neighborhood's honor against local criminals or the encroachments of "qabadayat" from other neighborhoods. He was popularly characterized as an honorable man, noted for his personal strength, and protection of minorities and the poor. The "qabaday" was considered an "upholder of Arab traditions and customs, the guardian of popular culture", according to historian <a href="Philip%20S.%20Khoury">Philip S. Khoury</a>. Khoury asserts that al-Kharrat was "probably the most respected and esteemed "qabaday" of his day". "Qabadayat" normally shunned formal education, and historian Michael Provence maintains that al-Kharrat was likely illiterate. "Qabadayat" were normally linked with particular city notables and could secure them political support in their neighborhoods. Al-Kharrat was allied with <a href="Nasib%20al-Bakri">Nasib al-Bakri</a>, a Damascene politician and landowner. The al-Bakri family was the most influential in al-Shaghour, and al-Kharrat served as the family's principal connection and enforcer in the quarter.

A <a href="Great%20Syrian%20Revolt">revolt against French rule</a> was launched in mid-1925 by the <a href="Druze">Druze</a> <a href="sheikh">sheikh</a> (chieftain), <a href="Sultan%20Pasha%20al-Atrash">Sultan Pasha al-Atrash</a>, in the southern mountains of <a href="Jabal%20al-Druze">Jabal al-Druze</a>. As al-Atrash's men scored decisive victories against the French <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Levant">Army of the Levant</a>, <a href="Syrian%20nationalism">Syrian nationalist</a>s were inspired and the revolt spread northward to the countryside of Damascus and beyond. Al-Bakri was the chief liaison between al-Atrash and the emerging rebel movement in Damascus and the <a href="Ghouta">Ghouta</a>. The Ghouta is the fertile plain surrounding Damascus, and its orchard groves and extensive waterways provided cover for the rebels and a base from which they could raid Damascus. In August, al-Bakri convinced al-Kharrat to join the uprising. According to Provence, al-Kharrat was "ideal" for the job, possessing "a local following of young men, notoriety outside the quarter, good connections and a reputation for toughness". The group of fighters he commanded was known as "′isabat al-Shawaghirah" (the band of al-Shaghour). Though named after al-Kharrat's quarter, the band included twenty "qabadayat" and their armed retinues from other Damascus neighborhoods and nearby villages. His main areas of operation were in the vicinity of al-Shaghour and the al-Zur forest in the eastern Ghouta. Through his alliance with a <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> religious leader, al-Kharrat brought an <a href="Jihad%23Contemporary%20fundamentalist%20usage">Islamic holy war</a> dimension to the largely secular revolt, something that was not welcomed by some involved.

Al-Kharrat commenced guerrilla operations in September, targeting French forces posted in the eastern and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose as he led nighttime raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, <a href="Sarouja">Souk Saruja</a> and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In the first week of October, sixty French <a href="Gendarmerie">gendarme</a>s were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of <a href="al-Malihah">al-Malihah</a>'s "<a href="mukhtar">mukhtar</a>" (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.

On 12 October, French troops backed by tanks, artillery and aerial support launched an operation to surround and eliminate al-Kharrat's rebels in the al-Zur forest. Al-Kharrat's men were forewarned of the French deployment by the peasants of al-Malihah. Positioned among the trees, the rebels used sniper fire against the French troops. The latter were unable to lure the rebels out and retreated.

As the French withdrew toward al-Malihah, they looted the village and set it on fire. French intelligence officials justified the collective punishment of al-Malihah as retaliation for the rebels' capture and humiliation of the gendarmes during the previous week; the French claimed a young boy from al-Malihah had notified al-Kharrat's men of the French presence in the village. Though they were unable to engage al-Kharrat and his forces directly, French troops executed around 100 civilians from Ghouta villages. Their corpses were brought to Damascus, and the bodies of sixteen men described by the French as "<a href="brigandage">brigand</a>s" were put on display.

Spurred by French army actions in the Ghouta, al-Bakri planned to capture the <a href="Citadel%20of%20Damascus">Citadel of Damascus</a>, where French forces were concentrated, and the <a href="Azm%20Palace">Azm Palace</a>, where General <a href="Maurice%20Sarrail">Maurice Sarrail</a>, the French <a href="High%20Commissioner%20of%20the%20Levant">high commissioner of Syria</a>, would be residing on 17–18 October (Sarrail was typically headquartered in <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>). The high commissioner functioned as the overall administrator of Syria on behalf of France and exercised practically absolute power. The rebel units active in Damascus at the time were al-Kharrat's "′isabat" and a mixed force of Druze fighters and rebels from the <a href="al-Midan">al-Midan</a> quarter and the Ghouta. To compensate for the lack of rebel strength, al-Bakri sent a letter to Sultan al-Atrash requesting reinforcements. Al-Atrash replied that he was currently occupied with operations in the <a href="Hauran">Hauran</a>, but would dispatch his entire force to back the Damascus rebels as soon as affairs there were settled. Before he received al-Atrash's reply, al-Bakri decided to move ahead with the operation.

On 18 October, al-Kharrat led forty rebels into al-Shaghour from the old cemeteries adjacent to the <a href="Bab%20al-Saghir">southern gate of Damascus</a>, announcing that the Druze had arrived to relieve the city from French occupation. Crowds of residents enthusiastically welcomed the rebels, and many took up arms alongside them. Al-Kharrat's men captured the quarter's police station, disarming its garrison. They were joined by <a href="Ramadan%20al-Shallash">Ramadan al-Shallash</a>, a rebel commander from <a href="Deir%20ez-Zor">Deir ez-Zor</a>, and twenty of his <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> fighters. The joint forces proceeded to the <a href="Al-Hamidiyah%20Souq">Hamidiyya Market</a> and captured the Azm Palace, but Sarrail was not present, having already left to attend a meeting in the Hauran town of <a href="Daraa">Daraa</a>. The rebels plundered the palace and set it on fire. Provence asserts that capturing the palace without Sarrail "held no tactical importance" but was a highly symbolic achievement for the rebels because of the Azm Palace's "importance as the historical seat of economic and political power in Damascus, now usurped by the French and totally undefended".

While al-Kharrat captured the Azm Palace, al-Bakri and 200 rebels under his command rode through the city and were joined by civilians in increasing numbers. After sealing the Old City to prevent the entry of enemy reinforcements, al-Kharrat issued an order to kill anyone linked to the French army. About 180 French soldiers were killed. Sarrail ordered the shelling and <a href="Aerial%20bombardment%20of%20cities">aerial bombardment</a> of the city, which lasted two days and killed about 1,500 people. Chaos and scattered fighting ensued as whole neighborhoods, mosques and churches were leveled, French forces moved in, and hundreds of leading figures in the Syrian national movement were arrested, including al-Kharrat's son Fakhri. The latter was captured on 22 October during a botched nighttime raid by the rebels against the French, who had by then retaken Damascus. Al-Kharrat was offered the release of his son in exchange for his own surrender, but refused.

The rebels withdrew from Damascus as a meeting was held between French army commander <a href="Maurice%20Gamelin">Maurice Gamelin</a> and a delegation of Damascene notables. As a result of the meeting, the French agreed to end their bombardment in return for a payment of 100,000 Turkish gold liras by 24 October. The fine was not paid by the French deadline, but the bombardment was not renewed, likely as a result of orders from the French government in Paris. International condemnation of Sarrail's bombardment of Damascus and growing criticism in France of his mishandling of the revolt led to his dismissal on 30 October. He was replaced by politician <a href="Henry%20de%20Jouvenel">Henry de Jouvenel</a>, who arrived in Syria in December. On 22 November, al-Kharrat commanded 700 rebels in a battle with about 500 French soldiers outside of Damascus. Al-Kharrat's men inflicted "trifling" losses on the French, but experienced heavy casualties themselves, with thirty dead and forty wounded according to "<a href="Reuters">Reuters</a>". On 5 December, al-Kharrat was one of the commanders of a 2,000-strong force uniting rebels from disparate backgrounds, which assaulted the French Army barracks in <a href="Qadam">al-Qadam</a>, south of Damascus. The French claimed to have inflicted significant casualties, but rebel activity continued.

Centralized order and oversight among the revolt's armed participants was difficult to establish because of the diversity and independence of the rebel factions. A meeting of rebel leaders was held in the Ghouta village of <a href="Saqba">Saqba</a> on 26 November. <a href="Sa%27id%20al-%27As">Sa'id al-'As</a> accused al-Kharrat and others of plundering in the Ghouta, while al-Kharrat alleged that al-Shallash extorted the residents of al-Midan and the Ghouta town of <a href="Douma%2C%20Syria">Douma</a>. The meeting concluded with an agreement to elect a government to replace the French authorities, increase recruitment of the Ghouta's inhabitants, coordinate military operations under a central command, and establish a revolutionary court to execute spies. The meeting also designated the area between the village of <a href="Zabdin">Zabdin</a> and north of the Douma-Damascus road as being part of al-Kharrat's zone of operations. Despite his leading role in the rebels' military efforts, al-Kharrat was not included in the newly formed rebel leadership council, nor were any of al-Bakri's allies. Instead, al-'As served as the rebels' overall head.

Sharp divisions among rebel factions became apparent during a second meeting in Saqba on 5 December. According to Syrian journalist <a href="Munir%20al-Rayyes">Munir al-Rayyes</a>, hostility between al-Kharrat and al-Shallash was well-known among the rebels. Because al-Shallash had levied war taxes on the major landlords and city elites of the Ghouta, al-Kharrat's benefactor al-Bakri viewed him as a threat to the traditional landowning class to which al-Bakri belonged. Al-Rayyis claimed the meeting was called for by al-Kharrat, who ordered his fighters to capture and bring al-Shallash to Saqba. However, according to al-'As, the summit was called by al-Shallash, and once the latter arrived in the village, al-Kharrat personally detained him and confiscated his horse, weapons and money.

After his detention, al-Shallash was given a brief trial during which al-Kharrat accused him of making "impositions and ransoms and financial collections in the name of the revolt", while al-Bakri condemned him specifically for extorting the residents of Douma for 1,000 "<a href="Turkish%20lira%23History">giney</a>" (Ottoman pounds), and imposing large fines on the inhabitants of <a href="Harran%20al-Awamid">Harran al-Awamid</a>, <a href="al-Qisa">al-Qisa</a> and <a href="Maydaa">Maydaa</a> for his own personal enrichment. Al-Kharrat and al-Bakri decided al-Shallash's verdict, and dismissed him from the revolt. While many rebels with officer backgrounds similar to al-Shallash disapproved of the judgement, they did not intervene. In his account of the meeting, al-Rayyis condemned the rebel commanders for complacency in the "ridiculous trial" and accused al-Kharrat of being motivated solely by personal animosity. Al-Shallash was able to escape—or was released by al-'As—when French planes bombed the meeting. Al-Shallash would later surrender to Jouvenel and collaborate with French authorities.

Al-Kharrat was killed in an ambush by French troops in the Ghouta on 25 December 1925. He was succeeded as "qabaday" of al-Shaghour and commander of the "′isabat al-Shawaghirah" by Mahmud Khaddam al-Srija. Al-Kharrat's men continued to fight the French until the revolt ended in 1927, though historian Thomas Philipp states that al-Kharrat's group dissipated after his death. In January 1926, al-Kharrat's son Fakhri was sentenced to death and publicly executed with two other rebels in <a href="Marjeh%20Square">Marjeh Square</a>, Damascus. The French had previously implored Fakhri to persuade his father to surrender in return for his release, but Fakhri refused.

<a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20Shahbandar">Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar</a>, a prominent Syrian nationalist leader, described al-Kharrat as having played "the preeminent role" in the battle against the French in the Ghouta and Damascus. Historian Daniel Neep wrote that al-Kharrat was the "best-known" of all of the Damascus-based rebel leaders, although other leaders of the rebel movement attributed the publicity and praise of al-Kharrat to the efforts of the <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>-based <a href="Syrian-Palestinian%20Congress">Syrian-Palestinian Committee</a>, with which al-Bakri was closely affiliated. Al-Kharrat and his son Fakhri are today considered "martyred heroes" by Syrians for their nationalist efforts and their deaths in the Syrian struggle for independence from France.

Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded

Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded is the <a href="reissue">reissue</a> of <a href="Barbados">Barbadian</a> singer <a href="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>'s third <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> "<a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad">Good Girl Gone Bad</a>" (2007). It was first released <a href="music%20download">digitally</a> in selected countries on June 2, 2008, by <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> and SRP Records. Launched to mark the first anniversary of the original album, "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" features three newly recorded songs and a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> showing exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of Rihanna's worldwide tour, the <a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20Tour">Good Girl Gone Bad Tour</a> (2007–2009).

"Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" received generally positive reviews from <a href="Music%20journalism">music critics</a>, who praised the sound and production of the newly added material. However, other critics felt that the album was not worthy of re-release with only three new songs.

Following its release, the reissue helped "Good Girl Gone Bad" re-enter several national charts. "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" sold 63,000 copies in its first week and helped the original album peak at number seven on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart.

"Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" was promoted with four singles, including the US number-one hits "<a href="Take%20a%20Bow%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Take a Bow</a>" and "Disturbia", and "If I Never See Your Face Again", which featured Maroon 5. To further promote the album, Rihanna performed songs from the reissue on several television programs and award ceremonies including "<a href="FNMTV">FNMTV</a>" and the <a href="2008%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2008 MTV Video Music Awards</a>.

Rihanna began working on her third studio album "<a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad">Good Girl Gone Bad</a>" (2007) in late 2006 and by late February 2007, the album was almost complete. Most of its songs were recorded in <a href="Westlake%20Recording%20Studios">Westlake Recording Studios</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, parallel to the recording sessions for her second studio album, "<a href="A%20Girl%20like%20Me%20%28Rihanna%20album%29">A Girl like Me</a>" (2006). For the album's production, she worked with some of the producers who were involved on her previous albums, including <a href="Evan%20Rogers">Evan Rogers</a> and <a href="Carl%20Sturken">Carl Sturken</a>, <a href="Ne-Yo">Ne-Yo</a>, <a href="J.R.%20Rotem">J.R. Rotem</a>, <a href="Sean%20Garrett">Sean Garrett</a>, and Norwegian duo <a href="Stargate%20%28production%20team%29">StarGate</a>. Rihanna also collaborated with <a href="Timbaland">Timbaland</a> and <a href="will.i.am">will.i.am</a> for the first time. Following its release, "Good Girl Gone Bad" became a worldwide commercial success and reached number one on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and number two on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. It also received generally positive reviews from critics. The album's <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> "<a href="Umbrella%20%28song%29">Umbrella</a>" became a commercial success and reached number one on over fifteen national singles charts, including the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, which it topped for seven consecutive weeks, and the UK Singles Chart, which it topped for ten consecutive weeks.

In early 2008, Rihanna unveiled a new song titled "<a href="Take%20a%20Bow%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Take a Bow</a>", which premiered on February 14, 2008 on the <a href="KIIS-FM">KIIS-FM</a> radio show "<a href="On%20Air%20with%20Ryan%20Seacrest%20%28radio%29">On Air with Ryan Seacrest</a>". <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a> reported that the track would serve as the lead single from "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded", a reissue of the original album to mark its first anniversary. Rihanna further announced that apart from "Take a Bow", the expanded album would contain two more songs, one of which was a duet with American pop rock band <a href="Maroon%205">Maroon 5</a>, to supplement the original track listing. "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" was first released digitally on June 2, 2008 in certain countries, including Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The album was released physically on June 13 in Germany. On June 17, it was released in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A DVD containing behind-the-scenes footage of Rihanna's <a href="Good%20Girl%20Gone%20Bad%20Tour">Good Girl Gone Bad Tour</a> (2007–09) was included in a special version launched in the US for a limited time. Rihanna subsequently hosted a promotion party for "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" in New York City, which featured several celebrity guests, including <a href="LeToya%20Luckett">LeToya Luckett</a>, <a href="Teyana%20Taylor">Teyana Taylor</a>, and <a href="Wynter%20Gordon">Wynter Gordon</a>.
Four new songs were recorded for "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded": "<a href="Disturbia%20%28song%29">Disturbia</a>", "Hatin' on the Club", "<a href="If%20I%20Never%20See%20Your%20Face%20Again">If I Never See Your Face Again</a>" (with Maroon 5) and "Take a Bow". All were initially confirmed for inclusion on the album, though "Hatin' on the Club" was removed for unspecified reasons. The song was leaked online in January 2009 on "Big Mike & DJ Neptune's R&B Kings Part Two" mixtape.

"Disturbia" is an uptempo <a href="electropop">electropop</a> song. According to <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>'s Fraser McAlpine, it is reminiscent of Rihanna's 2007 single "<a href="Don%27t%20Stop%20the%20Music%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Don't Stop the Music</a>". McAlpine also noted that the song has a "frosty-rave" <a href="Refrain">chorus</a> accompanied with Rihanna's "icy" vocals. It was written by <a href="Brian%20Kennedy%20%28producer%29">Brian Kennedy Seals</a>, <a href="Chris%20Brown%20%28American%20singer%29">Chris Brown</a>, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, "<a href="Exclusive%20%28album%29">Exclusive</a>" (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, "<a href="Forever%20%28Chris%20Brown%20song%29">Forever</a>", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that "Disturbia" would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced "Disturbia", while <a href="Makeba%20Riddick">Makeba Riddick</a> produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a>. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in <a href="Atlanta%2C%20Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", Brown described his feelings about giving "Disturbia" to Rihanna: "It's fun being creative and even if you have a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have".

"If I Never See Your Face Again" is an <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> song that incorporates a "jagged" use of synthesizers and "buzzing" guitars in its production. It was written by <a href="Adam%20Levine">Adam Levine</a> and <a href="James%20Valentine%20%28musician%29">James Valentine</a>, two of the five band members from Maroon 5. It was produced by <a href="Mark%20Endert">Mark Endert</a>, <a href="Mike%20Elizondo">Mike Elizondo</a>, <a href="Mark%20%27Spike%27%20Stent">Mark "Spike" Stent</a>, <a href="Tricky%20Stewart">C. "Tricky" Stewart</a> and Maroon 5. "If I Never See Your Face Again" was recorded by Stent at Conway Studios in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, Glenwood Place Studios in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a> and Phantom Studios in <a href="Westlake%20Village%2C%20California">Westlake Village</a>. The song was mixed by Endert at Scream Studios in <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, with assistance from Doug Johnson. "If I Never See Your Face Again" was originally included on the standard version of "<a href="It%20Won%27t%20Be%20Soon%20Before%20Long">It Won't Be Soon Before Long</a>" without the inclusion of Rihanna, however, Levine stated in an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News while on set of the music video that he wanted to try something different for the album's re-release. He also said that he asked Rihanna to do some "bits and pieces" in the recording studio and that it came together very quickly. Levine stated that if there is "magic" between two artists, then "you don't even have to think about it." In an interview with MTV's "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>", Rihanna said that she was very excited about the collaboration with the band because she always "loved them" and their work.

"Take a Bow" is an R&B song that tells of how the female protagonist expresses disinterest in rekindling her relationship with a dishonorable and unfaithful ex-boyfriend. The song was written by Ne-Yo, <a href="Mikkel%20S.%20Eriksen">Mikkel S. Eriksen</a> and <a href="Tor%20Erik%20Hermansen">Tor Erik Hermansen</a>. Hermansen and Eriksen produced and provided instruments for "Take a Bow" under their production name, StarGate, while Smith co-produced the song. Rihanna's vocals were recorded by Eriksen at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City, Westlake Studios in Los Angeles and Parr Street Studios in Liverpool. The song was mixed by Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, with assistance from Houghkirk.

"Take a Bow" was released as the lead single from "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" and fifth single overall from the two releases. The song was made available to purchase in media outlets, via <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a>' website since March 14, 2008, and was later made available to download via iTunes Store on May 6, 2008. It peaked at number one on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and became Rihanna's third song to reach the plateau. It has been certified four-times platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) and sold over three million digital copies. The single also reached number one in Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. The accompanying <a href="music%20video">music video</a> was directed by <a href="Anthony%20Mandler">Anthony Mandler</a>.

The <a href="Spanglish">Spanglish</a> version of "<a href="Hate%20That%20I%20Love%20You">Hate That I Love You</a>" featuring <a href="David%20Bisbal">David Bisbal</a>, was released as the second single from the album on April 28, 2008, in certain countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Spain. The song peaked at number 37 on the <a href="Spanish%20Singles%20Chart">Spanish Singles Chart</a> and stayed on the chart for a total of two weeks. "If I Never See Your Face Again", the collaboration with Maroon 5, was released as the second single from "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded". It was sent to <a href="contemporary%20hit%20radio">contemporary hit radio</a> in the US on May 15, 2008. It reached <a href="If%20I%20Never%20See%20Your%20Face%20Again%23Charts">the top twenty on over five national charts worldwide</a>. The music video for the song was directed by Anthony Mandler and shot on an indoor soundstage in <a href="Castaic%2C%20California">Castaic, California</a>. According to Dorian Lynskey of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", the concept for the video was "high-end erotica".

When the album was reissued, Rihanna approached <a href="L.A.%20Reid">L.A. Reid</a>, the head of Def Jam Recordings and suggested that she wanted to release "Disturbia" as the next single. Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she wants to say. She's at that place where she can do that." It was solicited to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was released as a <a href="CD%20single">CD single</a> in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. "Disturbia" earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 <a href="NRJ%20Music%20Awards">NRJ Music Awards</a>. It peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in <a href="Disturbia%20%28song%29%23Weekly%20charts">over twenty countries worldwide</a>. The single topped the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number one single from "Good Girl Gone Bad" and fourth overall on the Hot 100 chart. The music video for "Disturbia" was directed by Anthony Mandler and portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber.

To further promote "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded", Rihanna performed on several <a href="television%20programs">television programs</a> and award ceremonies. She performed "Take a Bow" for the first time at the <a href="2008%20MuchMusic%20Video%20Awards">2008 MuchMusic Video Awards</a> held in Toronto, Canada in the <a href="MuchMusic">MuchMusic</a>'s headquarters on June 15, 2008. On June 20, Rihanna appeared on the "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Today</a>" Concert Series held at the <a href="Rockefeller%20Plaza">Rockefeller Plaza</a>, New York City. She performed "Take a Bow" together with her 2007 singles "Umbrella" and "Don't Stop the Music". On June 27, she appeared on "<a href="FNMTV">FNMTV</a>" together with Maroon 5. She sang "Take a Bow" before performing together on their collaboration "If I Never See Your Face Again". In July 2008, Rihanna performed the Spanglish version of "Hate That I Love You" with Bisbal, at the <a href="Operaci%C3%B3n%20Triunfo%20%28series%206%29">sixth series</a> of the Spanish talent show, "<a href="Operaci%C3%B3n%20Triunfo%20%28Spain%29">Operación Triunfo</a>".

Rihanna performed "Disturbia" for the first time at the <a href="2008%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2008 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, held on September 7, 2008. She performed it while revealing a leather "<a href="Goth%20subculture">goth</a> inspired" outfit. Together with the dance troops, she performed a "<a href="Thriller%20%28music%20video%29">Thriller</a>"-inspired dance in which glow sticks and leather props were used. On September 19, 2008, Rihanna visited France and performed "Disturbia" at "<a href="Star%20Academy%20%28France%29">Star Academy France</a>". Rihanna sang "Disturbia" at the 2009 Super Bowl which was held at the <a href="Pepsi%20Center">Pepsi Center</a> in Denver, Colorado. The performance of the song featured a sample from the White Stripes song "<a href="Seven%20Nation%20Army">Seven Nation Army</a>" (2003) and was accompanied by flames that shot up across the front of the stage.

A reviewer from "<a href="The%20National%20%28Abu%20Dhabi%29">The National</a>" praised the material on the original album, particularly the "ubiquity" of "Umbrella", and also complimented "Don't Stop the Music", "Hate That I Love You", and "<a href="Shut%20Up%20and%20Drive%20%28Rihanna%20song%29">Shut Up and Drive</a>". He further stated that the release of "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" was made to mark the first anniversary of the album and that "the new tracks are everything you want pop to be, and are a testament to the power of the original record and to the new Rihanna." Spence D. of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> reviewed the new material and wrote that "Disturbia" is built on an infective "bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum..." hook "that sucks you into the detached electronic bounce of the track". He said that "Take a Bow" is perfectly fitted for a "post-break-up days of gloom" and further praised Rihanna's vocals on the song. According to D., "If I Never See Your Face Again" is inspired by the works of American musician <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a> and wrote that the "Rihanna's presence [on the song] definitely gives it a nice boost".

J. Edward Keyes of <a href="eMusic">eMusic</a> gave the album four out of five stars and wrote that the "uber-futurist" production of the release accompanied with Rihanna's "Robo Dominatrix vocal approach—is a big reason the record works so well. "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" is all blue-light electronics and primal throb, 25th-century pop music in the here and now." Digital Spy's Nick Levine also gave "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" four out of five stars, but was skeptical about the choice to re-release the album, writing that "it isn't worth forking out for "Good Girl Gone Bad" twice just to hear the new songs". Despite that, he praised the newly added songs especially "If I Never See Your Face Again"; he called the song "superior". Levine further wrote, "if "Reloaded" encourages a few hesitant pop fans to invest in this album, the closest thing to a "<a href="Thriller%20%28Michael%20Jackson%20album%29">Thriller</a>" that 2007/8 is likely to produce, this rather cynical reissue should be let off the hook... just." Among other achieved awards and nominations, "Disturbia" and "If I Never See Your Face Again" received nominations for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance%20Recording">Best Dance Recording</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Collaboration%20with%20Vocals">Pop Collaboration with Vocals</a> respectively at the <a href="2009%20Grammy%20Awards">2009 Grammy Awards</a>.

After the release of "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded", it was predicted that the reissue would sell between 45,000 and 50,000 copies in its first week in the US. For the week ending June 22, 2008, it sold 63,000 copies and helped the original version of the album to jump from number 124 to number seven on the US "Billboard" 200 in its 55th week. It also peaked at number five on the <a href="Top%20R%26amp%3BB/Hip-Hop%20Albums">Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums</a>. With this, "Good Girl Gone Bad" got back in the top 10 for the first time since its debut in June 2007. Additionally, five songs from the reissue were listed on the <a href="Hot%20Digital%20Songs">Hot Digital Songs</a>, topped by "Disturbia", which debuted at number six. The next week, "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" fell to number nine and sold 40,000 more copies. In its third week, it charted at number ten on sales of 41,000 copies. By November 2012, both "Good Girl Gone Bad" and the reissue had sold 2,800,000 copies in the US alone. "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" helped the original album re-enter and peak at number six on the <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a>.

"Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" debuted at number seven on the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Albums%20Chart">New Zealand Albums Chart</a> in the week of June 30, 2008. It reached its peak position on the chart at number four the following week. It was certified platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20New%20Zealand">Recording Industry Association of New Zealand</a> (RIANZ) for shipping over 15,000 copies. Following the reissue, the original album re-entered the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> at number 12 in the week of June 16. The next week, the album fell to number 16. By June 2012, both the original album and its reissue had sold 1,850,000 combined copies in the UK. Following its release, the original album re-entered the <a href="IFPI%20Denmark">Danish Albums Chart</a> at number 15. In its second week, it reached number nine, and in its third week, the album reached a peak of number four. After the release of "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded", "Good Girl Gone Bad" re-entered the <a href="Swiss%20Albums%20Chart">Swiss Albums Chart</a> at number 32, and the <a href="Austrian%20Albums%20Chart">Austrian Albums Chart</a> at number 36.

When "Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded" was released, the original album received a sales increase of 930%—more than any other non-debuting album in the history of the "Billboard" 200 chart. By July 2010, it had become the third album in the US whose songs have sold the most copies combined. Its songs have sold over 17,081,000 digital copies, only behind from "<a href="The%20Fame%20Monster">The Fame Monster</a>" (2009) by <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a> and "<a href="The%20E.N.D">The E.N.D</a>" (2009) by <a href="The%20Black%20Eyed%20Peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>.

"Disturbia" and "Take a Bow" were two of the album's most downloaded songs. Before reaching number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100, "Take a Bow" jumped from number 53 to the top of the chart, following digital sales of 267,000 copies. At the time, it was the second highest leap to number one in the Hot 100's history, followed only by Maroon 5's "<a href="Makes%20Me%20Wonder">Makes Me Wonder</a>" (2007). The song also helped Rihanna achieve two of the top-three digital sales opening weeks; the first one being <a href="Mariah%20Carey">Mariah Carey</a>'s "<a href="Touch%20My%20Body%20%28Mariah%20Carey%20song%29">Touch My Body</a>" (2008) which opened with 286,000 copies sold and the second the singer's own "Umbrella" which sold 277,000 copies for the week dated June 9, 2007. "Disturbia" became Rihanna's fourth number-one single on the Hot 100, which tied her at the time with <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9%20Knowles">Beyoncé Knowles</a> and Mariah Carey for the most number-one hits, among women, in the decade of 2000–2010.

Lockheed C-130 Hercules in Australian service

The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) has operated forty-eight <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130 Hercules</a> transport aircraft. The type entered Australian service in December 1958, when <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 36 Squadron</a> accepted the first of twelve C-130As, replacing its venerable <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>. The acquisition made Australia the first operator of the Hercules after the United States. In 1966 the C-130As were joined by twelve C-130Es, which equipped <a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 37 Squadron</a>. The C-130As were replaced by twelve C-130Hs in 1978, and the C-130Es by twelve <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20C-130J%20Super%20Hercules">C-130J Super Hercules</a> in 1999. No. 37 Squadron became the RAAF's sole Hercules operator in 2006, when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to converting to <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Boeing C-17 Globemaster III</a> heavy transports. The C-130Hs were retired in November 2012, leaving the C-130J as the only model in Australian service.

The RAAF's first <a href="Airlift%23Strategic%20airlift">strategic airlifter</a>, the Hercules has frequently been used to deliver <a href="emergency%20management">disaster relief</a> in Australia and the Pacific region, as well as to support military deployments overseas. The aircraft saw extensive service during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, transporting troops and cargo to Southeast Asia and undertaking <a href="aeromedical%20evacuation">aeromedical evacuation</a>. Nineteen of the RAAF's fleet of twenty-four C-130s took part in relief efforts in 1974–75 after <a href="Cyclone%20Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> struck <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. Since then, the Hercules have been involved in humanitarian missions to New Guinea, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Cambodia, Bali, Sumatra, and New Zealand. They have also seen service during the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a> in 1979, the <a href="1987%20Fijian%20coups%20d%27%C3%A9tat">Fijian coups</a> in 1987, <a href="Operation%20Solace">operations in Somalia</a> in 1993, <a href="International%20Force%20for%20East%20Timor">INTERFET</a> operations in East Timor in 1999–2000, and the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20War%20in%20Afghanistan">wars in Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Iraq</a> beginning in 2001. In over fifty years of Australian service, the Hercules have accumulated more than 800,000 flying hours.

At the end of World War II, the RAAF's prime transport aircraft was the twin-engined <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakota</a>. In 1946, C-47 operations were concentrated under <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 Wing</a> and its three flying squadrons, <a href="No.%2036%20Squadron%20RAAF">Nos. 36</a>, <a href="No.%2037%20Squadron%20RAAF">37</a>, and <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">38</a>, based initially at <a href="RAAF%20Station%20Schofields">RAAF Station Schofields</a>, New South Wales. Despite the robustness and versatility of the Dakota, by the early 1950s the Air Force was looking for a replacement with greater cargo capacity and longer range, to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces. In 1954, the RAAF embarked on a major re-equipment drive, following a shift in defence funding that favoured the Air Force. The Air Officer Commanding <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Home Command</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>, led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter, bomber, transport and training aircraft.
Four British transports were considered: the <a href="Blackburn%20Beverley">Blackburn Beverley</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Freighter">Bristol 179B</a>, <a href="Bristol%20Britannia">Bristol 195</a> and <a href="Short%20Brothers">Short</a> PD 16/1. The mission also assessed the American <a href="Fairchild%20C-119%20Flying%20Boxcar">Fairchild C-119G Flying Boxcar</a>, <a href="Fairchild%20C-123%20Provider">Fairchild C-123 Provider</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Lockheed C-130A Hercules</a>. Of these types, the mission assessed that the Beverley, C-123 and C-130 could potentially meet the RAAF's requirements. Following further consideration of the options after their return to Australia, in early 1955 the members of the mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured, as the other two types did not meet some of the most important elements of the requirement. At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF, and a decision to acquire twelve C-130s was not made until mid-1957. A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year. The Australian C-130As were to be similar to those in service with the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF), the main difference being the use of TF56-A-11 engines in the place of the usual TF56-A-1 and TF56-A-9s; these engines provided almost the same power, but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements. The total cost for the aircraft, initial crew training and support equipment was $US36 million (equivalent to about 16 million <a href="Australian%20pound">Australian pound</a>s).

The Hercules represented a huge improvement over the C-47 in payload, range, speed and manoeuvrability, as well as offering cabin pressurisation, short-takeoff-and-landing capability, and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door. The Government expressed concern over the price, at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft, but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted. Described by the official history of the post-war RAAF as second only to the <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-111C">General Dynamics F-111C</a> as the "most significant" acquisition by the Air Force, the Hercules gave the Australian military its first <a href="Airlift%23Strategic%20airlift">strategic airlift</a> capability, which in years to come would provide a "lifeline" for deployments to Malaya, Vietnam, and other parts of Southeast Asia. Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules. The RAAF's C-130As were also the last of this variant to be built.

RAAF crews began training on the Hercules in the middle of 1958 at <a href="Sewart%20Air%20Force%20Base">Sewart Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>, Tennessee. Much of the training took place on a simulator, augmented by approximately fifty hours flying time in the aircraft. To cope with the Hercules' complexities, the aircrew category of <a href="flight%20engineer">flight engineer</a>, absent from the RAAF since World War II, was reinstated. A new category, that of <a href="loadmaster">loadmaster</a>, was also instituted; airmen performing similar duties on Dakotas had done so on an ad hoc rather than a permanent basis, without a distinct category having been formalised. A specialist crew member was needed to make weight-and-balance calculations and oversee loading and despatch for the Hercules' 20-tonne freight capacity (compared to three-and-a-half tonnes in a Dakota) and for its various cargo-delivery systems. A large hangar previously used to service seaplanes at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Rathmines">RAAF Base Rathmines</a> was disassembled and re-erected at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Base Richmond</a>, New South Wales, where the C-130s would be based.

A decision to purchase another twelve C-130s was announced in November 1964. At this time the C-130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long-ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force's domestic requirements in Australia. As a result, the Government decided to order twelve C-130E Hercules as part of a package of acquisitions for the RAAF and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN) that also included ten <a href="Lockheed%20P-3%20Orion">Lockheed P-3 Orion</a> and fourteen <a href="Grumman%20S-2%20Tracker">Grumman S-2 Tracker</a> maritime patrol aircraft, as well as twelve <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20HS%20748">Hawker Siddeley HS 748</a> transports. The 14.7-million-pound contract for the new C-130s was signed on 9 February 1965. In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C-130As, this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement, due in no small part to the benefits for the armed services, particularly the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>, demonstrated by the first twelve aircraft. The long-serving C-130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s; twelve C-130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $A86 million, and deliveries took place between July and October 1978.
The RAAF's early model Hercules received several repairs and modifications during their service lives. During the early 1960s all of the C-130As were flown to the United States to receive new wing fuel tanks after the original tanks were affected by <a href="bacterial%20anaerobic%20corrosion">corrosion</a> caused by tropical fungi and bacteria. Later that decade these aircraft received new panels on the upper surface of their wings after the original ones were found to be faulty. The C-130Es were also fitted with strengthened wing centre boxes in the early 1970s after equivalent USAF aircraft were found to be suffering from greater-than-expected wing stress during operations in Vietnam. During 1964 the C-130As received new <a href="Doppler%20radar">doppler navigation</a> systems, and the C-130Es and Hs were fitted with <a href="ring%20laser%20gyroscope">ring laser gyroscope</a> inertial navigation systems from 1989. In 1994, four of No. 36 Squadron's C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and counter measures such as <a href="Chaff%20%28countermeasure%29">chaff</a> and flares. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with extensive <a href="signals%20intelligence">signals intelligence</a> equipment under the classified "<a href="Project%20Peacemate">Project Peacemate</a>"; this aircraft was crewed by RAAF and <a href="Defence%20Signals%20Directorate">Defence Signals Directorate</a> personnel and its existence was never publicly confirmed by the Government. The modified C-130H was reported to still be active in the signals intelligence role in 2008. The C-130Hs were also among the first Australian military aircraft to be modified to allow aircrew to operate them while wearing <a href="Night%20vision%20device">night vision goggles</a>.

The Australian Government ordered twelve <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20C-130J%20Super%20Hercules">C-130J Super Hercules</a> in December 1995 and deliveries began during 1999. As part of the deal negotiated with <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>, seven of the RAAF's C-130Es were transferred to the company in return for a reduced price on the new aircraft. At the time the order for the twelve C-130Js was placed, the Government also took out options for a further twenty-seven Super Hercules, but these were not taken up; the options included seven <a href="airborne%20early%20warning%20and%20control">airborne early warning and control</a> and eight <a href="aerial%20refueling">aerial refuelling</a> variants, as well as up to eight transports for the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a>. The RAAF was the first operator of this C-130 variant, which was larger than earlier models and had a crew of only three (two pilots and a loadmaster) eliminating the navigator and flight engineer roles employed in earlier models. The aircraft initially suffered from serious mechanical and software problems as well as a shortage of spare parts, and were assessed as "experiencing significant operational shortfalls" in a 2002 <a href="Australian%20National%20Audit%20Office">Australian National Audit Office</a> report. The <a href="Defence%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Organisation">Defence Science and Technology Organisation</a> undertook considerable research into the C-130J design and developed improvements to the aircraft that addressed problems with excessive vibration. The 2009 Defence white paper "" called for the acquisition of two more C-130Js to partially replace the H variants. This purchase did not go ahead, as the government instead ordered a fifth <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Boeing C-17 Globemaster III</a>.

The C-130Js have been updated since entering service. All of the aircraft were fitted with <a href="radar%20warning%20receiver">radar warning receiver</a>s by the end of 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with <a href="Common%20Infrared%20Countermeasures%20program">Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures</a> systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the <a href="Link%2016">Link 16</a> data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be fitted with new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were fitted with advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were fitted with an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks. In 2019 the RAAF was reported to be considering fitting <a href="Litening">Litening</a> targeting pods to Hercules to improve crew situational awareness and allow aircraft to collect imagery as part of transport flights. 

In March 2015 "<a href="Australian%20Aviation%20%28magazine%29">Australian Aviation</a>" reported that, as part of the process of developing a new Defence White Paper, the Australian Government was considering purchasing two LC-130J Hercules fitted with landing skis and other equipment needed to allow the aircraft to operate in Antarctica. If acquired, these aircraft would be used to support the <a href="Australian%20Antarctic%20Division">Australian Antarctic Division</a>'s operations following the closure of the <a href="Wilkins%20Runway">Wilkins Runway</a> near <a href="Casey%20Station">Casey Station</a>.

The RAAF's twelve C-130As were picked up by their newly trained Australian pilots from the <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a> factory at <a href="Dobbins%20Air%20Reserve%20Base">Dobbins Air Force Base</a>, Georgia, and ferried to Australia in three groups between December 1958 and March 1959. No. 36 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Richmond, became the first unit to operate the new aircraft. Almost immediately they established regular courier services within Australia and to <a href="RMAF%20Base%20Butterworth">RAAF Base Butterworth</a> in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a>. These flights primarily involved transporting cargo, as Chief of the Air Staff <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a> directed in 1959 that the RAAF would continue to rely on chartered civil airliners to move military personnel on the grounds that these aircraft were better suited to the task and in wartime all the C-130s would be needed to supply troops near the front lines. In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF's first <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a> missiles from the United States to Butterworth to equip the <a href="CAC%20Sabre">CAC Sabre</a> fighters based there. Crew training was rigorous, and from mid-1960 involved the use of a simulator. Only seasoned transport pilots flew the Hercules in its early years of service, generally having undertaken a tour of duty with No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas. The official history of the post-war Air Force described the Hercules as "probably the biggest step-up in aircraft capabilities" the RAAF had ever received, considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota, taking into account the improvements in payload, range, and speed. When <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 (Fighter) Wing</a> and its two squadrons of CAC Sabres deployed to Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959, seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> from Australia to Malaya, compared to two Hercules for <a href="No.%2077%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 77 Squadron</a>. The Hercules were the first <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> aircraft operated by the RAAF. They were serviced by <a href="No.%20486%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 486 Maintenance Squadron</a>, with deeper maintenance and upgrades carried out by <a href="No.%202%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 2 Aircraft Depot</a> (No. 2 AD), both units being based at Richmond. The availability of spare parts from the US caused problems early on, grounding one C-130A for almost a year.
No. 36 Squadron commenced parachute trials with the Hercules in September 1960. Beginning in May 1962, <a href="No.%2079%20Squadron%20RAAF">RAAF forces</a> based at <a href="Ubon">Ubon</a>, Thailand, under <a href="SEATO">SEATO</a> arrangements were supplied by a regular Hercules service. In December that year, the Hercules made their first troop-carrying flights into a combat zone, when one of No. 36 Squadron's C-130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the commencement of the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">"Konfrontasi"</a> between Indonesia and Malaysia; similar missions would be undertaken for a further five years. In 1964, the first two <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII">Dassault Mirage III</a> fighters to be assembled in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the <a href="Government%20Aircraft%20Factories">Government Aircraft Factories</a> at <a href="Avalon%2C%20Victoria">Avalon</a>, Victoria, by RAAF Hercules. The same year, following the entry into Australian service of the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou</a> with No. 38 Squadron, No. 486 Squadron was disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons. The RAAF's force of twelve C-130A Hercules was augmented by twelve C-130Es commencing in August 1966. No. 37 Squadron, disbanded in 1948, was re-formed at Richmond to operate the new models. No. 486 Squadron was also re-formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons. No. 36 Squadron's tasking was mainly domestic and tactical in nature, while No. 37 Squadron's was overseas and strategic, owing to the longer range of its C-130Es. In May 1967, three Hercules of No. 37 Squadron supported Operation Fast Caravan, the deployment of 23 Mirages of <a href="No.%2075%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 75 Squadron</a> to Butterworth.

During the late 1960s, forty-two per cent of Hercules flying hours were devoted to Australian Army operations. The C-130s undertook long-range missions to support Australian forces fighting in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the deployment of the <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a> to South Vietnam in early 1965, the RAAF began fortnightly C-130 flights into the country from June that year. These flights were initially conducted by C-130As, and carried high-priority cargo and passengers from Richmond to <a href="Vung%20Tau">Vung Tau</a> in South Vietnam via either Butterworth or Singapore. The scale of the supply flights into South Vietnam expanded in 1967 when <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B2%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron RAAF</a>, which was equipped with <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> bombers, was deployed to <a href="Phan%20Rang%E2%80%93Th%C3%A1p%20Ch%C3%A0m">Phan Rang</a>. A large airlift codenamed Winter Grip was also conducted in mid-1967 to replace two Australian Army battalions, which had completed their year-long tour of duty, with a pair of fresh battalions. The Hercules were called upon to support the withdrawal of the <a href="1st%20Australian%20Task%20Force">1st Australian Task Force</a> (1 ATF) from South Vietnam, and Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons undertook many sorties to fly equipment and personnel out of the country during 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were used to withdraw the last remaining Australian force in South Vietnam, the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Training%20Team%20Vietnam">Australian Army Training Team Vietnam</a>; the final elements of this force departed aboard two Hercules on 20 December 1972.
As well as transport operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam to transfer wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These flights were initially conducted as part of the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation flights began on 1 July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more flights were made during periods in which 1 ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in "<a href="The%20Medical%20Journal%20of%20Australia">The Medical Journal of Australia</a>". The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164 patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.

Many of the RAAF's C-130s were redeployed to South Vietnam shortly before the end of the war in 1975. The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the <a href="1975%20Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> displaced hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians, and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States. This force, which was designated Detachment S, had an average strength of seven C-130s and about one hundred air and ground crew, and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines. After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians, Prime Minister <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo. As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon, Detachment S was moved to Bangkok in Thailand, but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day. Overall, Detachment S had carried 1,100 refugees and 900 tonnes of supplies by the end of the war. On 4 and 17 April, aircraft of the detachment flew 271 orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US-led <a href="Operation%20Babylift">Operation Babylift</a>. In late April, two of No. 37 Squadron's C-130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout Southeast Asia; this force was designated Detachment N. The C-130Es began operations on 3 May, and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos. The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand, Butterworth, Hong Kong and Singapore; by the time this mission ended in early June, the two Hercules had conducted 91 sorties for the UN. Aircraft of Detachment S evacuated Australian embassy personnel from <a href="Cambodian%20Civil%20War%23Fall%20of%20Phnom%20Penh">Phnom Penh</a> in Cambodia, as well as <a href="Fall%20of%20Saigon">Saigon</a>, shortly before they fell to <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975, after which the force returned to Australia. Detachment N also evacuated the Australian embassy in <a href="Vientiane">Vientiane</a>, Laos, during early June 1975.

In the years after the end of the Vietnam War, the Hercules continued to take part in military exercises and support overseas peacekeeping commitments. They also became well known in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following natural disasters, including tsunami in <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, cyclones in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a> and <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>, and fires and floods in Australia. The Hercules played a significant part in the evacuation of civilians following <a href="Cyclone%20Tracy">Cyclone Tracy</a> in 1974–75; a No. 37 Squadron C-130E was the first aircraft to touch down in <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a> following the disaster. Eight of No. 36 Squadron's aircraft were involved in the relief effort, flying over 550 hours, and carrying 2,864 passengers and almost 800,000 lbs of cargo, while No. 37 Squadron contributed 11 aircraft, flying 700 hours, and carrying 4,400 passengers and 1,300,000 lbs of cargo. On 19 January 1978 a C-130E returning to Australia from Butterworth was used to intercept a drug-smuggling aircraft near Darwin; the smuggler eventually landed at <a href="Katherine%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Katherine</a>, and was arrested. After clocking up 147,000 accident-free flying hours over the course of 20 years, No. 36 Squadron's C-130As were replaced in 1978 by C-130H models. The C-130Hs were primarily used as tactical air lifters throughout their service with the RAAF, and worked closely with the Army's special forces units.
The disposal of the C-130As took almost a decade, with the process being subject to a police investigation. Attempts to sell the Hercules by <a href="procurement">tender</a> during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful, and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981. One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the <a href="Chadian%20Air%20Force">Chadian Air Force</a>. Another two Hercules were sold to the Colombian charter company Aviaco in 1983, but the US <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> vetoed the deal shortly before it was to have been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States. A C-130A was transferred to the newly established company <a href="International%20Air%20Aid">International Air Aid</a> and leased to the <a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross">International Red Cross</a> to fly <a href="1983%E2%80%931985%20famine%20in%20Ethiopia">humanitarian supplies</a> into Ethiopia during 1986, but this contract was cancelled after the C-130's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area. The <a href="Australian%20Federal%20Police">Australian Federal Police</a> eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C-130As. Eventually, four of the C-130As were sold to <a href="2GO%20%28Air%29">Aboitiz Air Transport Corporation</a> in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the <a href="Fowler%20Aeronautical%20Corporation">Fowler Aeronautical Corporation</a> the next year. Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes, and the final C-130A was scrapped.

In November 1978, a C-130H became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica, at <a href="McMurdo%20Sound">McMurdo Sound</a>. In January–February 1979, two No. 37 Squadron C-130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a>. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with <a href="aerial%20firefighting">aerial firefighting</a> equipment acquired from the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No. 37 Squadron transported the <a href="Popemobile">Popemobile</a>s during <a href="John%20Paul%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">John Paul II</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20pastoral%20visits%20of%20Pope%20John%20Paul%20II%20outside%20Italy%231980s">tour of Australia</a>; its other unusual cargoes have included a <a href="Murray%20Grey">Murray Grey</a> stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.

In February 1987, Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined <a href="No.%2033%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 33 Squadron</a> (flying <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> <a href="aerial%20refueling">tanker-transports</a>) as part of a re-formed No. 86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group (renamed <a href="Air%20Mobility%20Group%20RAAF">Air Mobility Group</a> in April 2014). In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a> to <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a> during <a href="Operation%20Morris%20Dance">Operation Morris Dance</a>, the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a>'s response to the first of the <a href="1987%20Fijian%20coups%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1987 Fijian coups</a>; the soldiers subsequently embarked onto RAN warships by helicopter. In 1988, No. 37 Squadron's Hercules achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours. No. 36 Squadron achieved 100,000 accident-free flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Members of the travelling public experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government employed the C-130s and 707s for transport during the <a href="1989%20Australian%20pilots%27%20dispute">pilots' dispute</a> that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; the resulting spike in operational hours necessitated No. 486 Squadron sending detachments to several locations throughout the country to cope with increased maintenance demands. By the late 1980s, some C-130 maintenance tasks had been outsourced to commercial firms, and <a href="Air%20New%20Zealand">Air New Zealand</a> won a four-year depot maintenance contract in 1990.

Following the Iraqi <a href="invasion%20of%20Kuwait">invasion of Kuwait</a> in August 1990, No. 86 Wing prepared to deploy five C-130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3,000 Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia in the event that Iraq also attacked that country. An operation to fly about 95 Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned, but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved. These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia, and the Australians in Iraq departed by road. A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of Australia's <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%201991%20Gulf%20War">contribution</a> to the ensuing <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of <a href="Bougainville%20Island">Bougainville</a> worsened and required an evacuation operation. After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991, two C-130s were dispatched to the <a href="Cocos%20%28Keeling%29%20Islands">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a> in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February. Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to <a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman">Muscat, Oman</a>, from January 1991, and also transported a naval <a href="Clearance%20Diving%20Team%20%28RAN%29">Clearance Diving Team</a> to Muscat late in the month. In 1992, the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500,000 accident-free flying hours; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone.

A detachment of Hercules from Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons supported <a href="International%20Force%20for%20East%20Timor">INTERFET</a> operations in <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a> between September 1999 and February 2000. When violence broke out following the <a href="East%20Timor%20Special%20Autonomy%20Referendum">East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum</a> on 30 August 1999, C-130H sorties were flown into the then-Indonesian province from 6 to 14 September to evacuate United Nations personnel as well as other foreign citizens and East Timorese refugees. Four C-130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other humanitarian supplies to refugees on 17 and 18 September. On 19 September a C-130 dropped a <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment">Special Air Service Regiment</a> (SAS) team near the East Timorese capital of <a href="Dili">Dili</a> ahead of the arrival of the main INTERFET force the next day. From 20 September, thirteen RAAF Hercules (designated No. 86 Wing Detachment B) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor. These aircraft also dropped humanitarian supplies to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions. The poor condition of most East Timorese airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro-Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation.

The support arrangements for the RAAF's Hercules were reformed during 1999 and 2000. On 24 August 1999, the training sections of Nos. 33, 36 and 37 Squadrons and No. 503 Wing were combined to form <a href="No.%20285%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 285 Squadron</a>. This new squadron was assigned responsibility for training aircrew to operate C-130s and Boeing 707s using <a href="flight%20simulator">flight simulator</a>s, as well as aircraft temporarily assigned to the unit from the operational squadrons. Retired Hercules have also been used to train loadmasters. In May 2000, <a href="Aircraft%20maintenance%20checks%23D%20Check">heavy maintenance</a> of the C-130s, previously carried out by No. 2 AD (reformed as No. 503 Wing in July 1992) was contracted out to <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a>. Since the retirement of the Boeing 707 from RAAF service in June 2008, No. 285 Squadron has been dedicated to C-130 training.

From late 2001, Hercules began flying into Afghanistan to support the SAS squadron deployed as part of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20War%20in%20Afghanistan">Operation Slipper</a>, Australia's contribution to the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>. Five Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the <a href="2002%20Bali%20Bombings">Bali Bombings</a> in October 2002. In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No. 36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East as part of the <a href="Australian%20contribution%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq</a>. These aircraft arrived on 10 February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19 March. During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at <a href="Al%20Asad%20Airbase">Al Asad Airbase</a> after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12 April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces. As the first phase of the war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baghdad%20%282003%29">city was captured</a>. A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000 operational flying hours by March 2010. An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was killed on 27 June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad.
RAAF C-130s continued to support operations in and around Australia during the early 2000s. During April 2003 a C-130 formed part of the force that tracked the North Korean freighter "Pong Su" before <a href="Pong%20Su%20incident">it was boarded</a> by special forces personnel off the coast of New South Wales. No. 36 Squadron Hercules took part in <a href="Operation%20Sumatra%20Assist">Operation Sumatra Assist</a> in the wake of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Boxing Day tsunami</a>; the aircraft were initially used to fly supplies into the badly damaged city of <a href="Banda%20Aceh">Banda Aceh</a>. Hercules flew Australian forces <a href="Operation%20Astute">into East Timor</a> during May 2006 after the government of that country requested assistance to quell a military mutiny and widespread violence. In July that year one of the C-130s deployed to the Middle East was sent to Cyprus, where it picked up Australians who had been evacuated from Lebanon following <a href="2006%20Lebanon%20War">Israeli air raids</a> and flew them to Turkey.

RAAF C-130 operations were concentrated in No. 37 Squadron in November 2006, when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C-130Hs prior to <a href="Boeing%20C-17%20Globemaster%20III%20in%20Australian%20service">re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemaster</a> heavy transports and relocating to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Base Amberley</a>, Queensland. The RAAF's contribution to <a href="Operation%20Papua%20New%20Guinea%20Assist">Operation Papua New Guinea Assist</a> following <a href="Cyclone%20Guba">Cyclone Guba</a> in November 2007 included two Hercules, three Caribous, and a Globemaster. In November 2008, the RAAF commemorated fifty years of Hercules operation. From that year only C-130Js were deployed to the Middle East. Four of the C-130Hs were placed in reserve at Richmond from 2009. Together with Globemasters, Hercules transported medical staff and equipment to aid victims of the <a href="2011%20Christchurch%20earthquake">Christchurch earthquake</a> in February 2011. In May 2012 the government announced as part of the 2012–13 Budget that the remaining eight C-130Hs would be withdrawn from service a year earlier than previously scheduled. The aircraft were retired on 30 November that year. Two of the C-130Hs were retained by the Air Force for display at <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a> and for ground training purposes at Richmond; four were donated to the <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">Indonesian Air Force</a>, and the RAAF was reported to be considering options for the disposal of the other six. By the time the C-130H fleet was retired, the twelve aircraft had flown almost 250,000 hours. In April 2013 the Australian government offered to sell five of the C-130Hs as well as spare parts and simulators to Indonesia at below their market value. The Indonesian government accepted this deal, and it was finalised on 26 July 2013. The RAAF celebrated 800,000 Hercules flying hours in September 2014. The C-130Js had by this time accumulated over 100,000 hours; they are expected to remain in service until 2030.

Confusion (album)

Confusion is a 1975 <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by Nigerian <a href="Afrobeat">Afrobeat</a> musician <a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti</a> and his Africa 70 band. It was arranged, composed, and produced by Kuti, who recorded the album after choosing to emphasize his African heritage and <a href="African%20nationalism">nationalism</a> in his music. "Confusion" is a commentary on the confused state of <a href="Nigeria%23Military%20juntas%20%281970%E2%80%931999%29">post-colonial</a> <a href="Lagos">Lagos</a> and its lack of <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> and proper leadership at the time. Kuti's <a href="West%20African%20Pidgin%20English">pidgin English</a> lyrics depict difficult conditions in the city, including a frenetic, multilingual <a href="street%20market">trading market</a> and inextricable traffic jams in Lagos' major intersections.

"Confusion" is a one-song Afrobeat album that begins with an entirely <a href="instrumental">instrumental</a> first half, which features <a href="free%20form%20jazz">free form</a> interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer <a href="Tony%20Allen%20%28musician%29">Tony Allen</a>. It leads to an extended mid-tempo section with Allen's <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>s and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers <a href="call%20and%20response">call-and-response</a> vocal passages. In reviews since the record's release by <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a>, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, "Confusion" was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d and bundled with Kuti's 1973 "<a href="Gentleman%20%28Fela%20Kuti%20album%29">Gentleman</a>" album.

After becoming dissatisfied with studying European composers at the <a href="Trinity%20Laban%20Conservatoire%20of%20Music%20and%20Dance">Trinity College of Music</a>, Fela Kuti formed his first band Koola Lobitos in 1961 and quickly became a popular act in the <a href="London">London</a> <a href="Culture%20of%20London%23Popular%20music">club scene</a>. He returned to his native <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> in 1963 and formed another band that played a rhythmic fusion of traditional <a href="highlife">highlife</a> music and <a href="jazz">jazz</a>. Kuti dubbed his hybrid style "<a href="Afrobeat">Afrobeat</a>", which served in part as his critique of African performers who he felt had forsaken their <a href="Sub-Saharan%20African%20music%20traditions">native musical roots</a> for American popular music trends. In 1969, he toured with his band in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and was introduced by a friend to the writings of <a href="Black%20nationalism">black nationalist</a> and <a href="Afrocentrism">Afrocentrist</a> figures such as <a href="Malcolm%20X">Malcolm X</a> and <a href="Eldridge%20Cleaver">Eldridge Cleaver</a>. Inspired by what he had read, Kuti decided to write more political and critical music, and changed the name of his band to the Nigeria 70 and later the Africa 70.

During the 1970s, Kuti began to emphasize his identification with Africa and its culture in his music and opposed the <a href="Postcolonialism">colonial mentality</a> of identification with <a href="Western%20culture">Western powers</a> such as the United States and the United Kingdom. His albums during this period expressed aspects of his ideology such as his African heritage and nationalism. On his 1973 song "Eko lie", Kuti declared that <a href="Lagos">Lagos</a> was his home rather than London or <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, where he had performed earlier in his career. Lagos and its landmark events became common themes in his songs. He revisited the theme on "Confusion" in 1974 to acknowledge that he identifies with the city despite its problems.

"Confusion" is a one-song album with a duration of 25 minutes and 36 seconds. The album's first side is entirely instrumental. It begins with a free-form introduction, which musically depicts the disorienting impact of Lagos' problems, according to music scholar Frank Thurmond Fairfax. Although Kuti occasionally used <a href="Instrument%20amplifier">amplified</a> instruments, he rarely employed elaborate electronic effects and instead relied on more natural sounds. Kuti, who plays <a href="electric%20piano">electric piano</a>, and drummer <a href="Tony%20Allen%20%28musician%29">Tony Allen</a> start the introduction out of tempo and exhibit abstract musical techniques, including dramatic <a href="free%20jazz">free jazz</a> interplay between their instruments. Although he was known for his critical background in <a href="classical%20music">classical</a> study, Kuti allowed Allen to <a href="musical%20improvisation">improvise</a> in the 's rhythm section and viewed him as a drummer with the mind of a composer, or "one who composes on the spot".

The introduction's keyboard <a href="fantasia%20%28music%29">fantasia</a> gradually opens the band's languid, expansive interplay. The song's <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> is established with the introduction of a bass guitar <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a> at 4:50. <a href="Rhythm%20guitar">Rhythm</a> and <a href="tenor%20guitar">tenor guitar</a>s and a horn section are played in the next two minutes. During the <a href="bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a>, Allen's drumming intensifies within the song's seven-minute mark, which leads to a fully developed Afrobeat section; Afrobeat is a type of loose <a href="funk">funk</a> music embellished with African <a href="syncopation">syncopation</a>, <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a>-styled horn instrumentation, and improvisatory <a href="solo%20%28music%29">solos</a>. "Confusion"s extended mid-tempo section has complex <a href="arrangement">arrangement</a>s of danceable grooves, multiple solos, and Allen's <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>s. In this section, Kuti plays <a href="tenor%20saxophone">tenor saxophone</a>, which he had learned after the 's original tenor player, <a href="Igo%20Chico">Igo Chico</a>, left in 1973. The music is complemented by his outspoken <a href="call%20and%20response">call-and-response</a> vocal passages. The song's final 10 minutes comprise raucous trumpet, tenor saxophone solos, and Kuti's lead vocals. Its closing section revisits the abstract interplay of the introduction.

"Confusion" is a commentary on the confused state of post-colonial, urban Nigeria, particularly Lagos, and its lack of <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> and proper leadership during a period of <a href="Supreme%20Military%20Council%20of%20Nigeria%20%281966%E2%80%931979%29">military dictatorship</a>. Kuti's lyrics depict the complicated, frenetic, and multilingual market of the <a href="Ojuelegba%2C%20Lagos">Ojuelegba</a> crossroad, and in doing so addresses what Nigerian historian <a href="Toyin%20Falola">Toyin Falola</a> described as the "infrastructural nightmare of Lagos and the continued <a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> of the West in all aspects of African life". According to "<a href="Rough%20Guides">The Rough Guide to World Music</a>" (2006), the album uses a "hectic crossroads in Lagos ... as a metaphor to explore the problems of an entire corrupt nation". 

In the opening lines, Kuti comments on his <a href="social%20reality">social reality</a>: "When we talk say confusion / Everything out of control". His lyrics decry what he viewed as the colonial mindset of some Africans and employ <a href="West%20African%20Pidgin%20English">pidgin English</a>, which was the <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a> of most people in English-speaking <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>; he sings the phrase "pafuka", which means "all over" or "finished", and the interjection "o" to add emphasis. Kuti makes reference to three <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s and currencies that make trading in urban Nigeria difficult. "<a href="African%20Arts%20%28journal%29">African Arts</a>" journalist E.J. Collins interpreted one of the verses as a reference to the protracted nature of <a href="Financial%20transaction">transactions</a> in Lagos. In this verse, Kuti sings:

Kuti uses ironic humor to express pride in Nigerians' ability to drive and work within difficult conditions: "Before-before Lagos traffic na special, eh / Number one special all over the world / You go get <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> for driving for Lagos, eh / You go get <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">M.A.</a> for driving for Lagos, eh / You go get <a href="Master%20of%20Science">M.Sc.</a> for driving for Lagos, oh / For me for me I like am like that, eh / Ah-ha-ha-ha, na my country – why not? / For me for me I like am like that, eh." He subsequently describes major <a href="Lagos%23Highways">Lagosian intersections</a>, including Ojuelegba, <a href="Surulere">Surulere</a>, and Ogogoro Centre, which lack the supervision of a <a href="traffic%20officer">traffic officer</a>. They are characterized by aggressive, temperamental drivers, who force their vehicles into inextricable <a href="traffic%20jam">traffic jam</a>s: "For Ojuelegba, moto dey come from south / Moto dey come from north / Moto dey come from east / Moto dey come from west / And policeman no dey for centre / Na confusion be that-i o / He go say he pafuka o."

"Confusion" was first released in Nigeria in 1975 by <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI Records</a>. It was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d by EMI in 1984. In a retrospective review for <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, Sam Samuelson gave the record five stars and called it "a highly recommended 25-minute Afro-beat epic". He said that it shows Kuti and his band at the peak of their instrumental skills and vague jeers, which he felt became more explicit and intense on 1977's "<a href="Zombie%20%28album%29">Zombie</a>". Samuelson found "Confusion" to be exemplary of Kuti's "genius" formula, in which he startles musically enraptured listeners with his commentary. Music journalist <a href="Peter%20Shapiro%20%28journalist%29">Peter Shapiro</a> called it a lyrical masterpiece and said that the bridge following the song's "cosmic" introduction is "pretty much the pinnacle of <a href="Afro-futurism">Afro-futurism</a>". <a href="Nic%20Harcourt">Nic Harcourt</a> recommended "Confusion" as a starting point for new listeners of Kuti's music.

In 2000, <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> re-released and bundled "Confusion" with Kuti's 1973 album "<a href="Gentleman%20%28Fela%20Kuti%20album%29">Gentleman</a>". It was the last installment in a 10-CD, 20-album reissue project for Kuti. Rob Brunner of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the album's reissue an "A" and viewed it as one of Kuti's best works, while Derrick A. Smith from "<a href="All%20About%20Jazz">All About Jazz</a>" cited "Confusion" as one of his "best statements on any instrument". In a four-star review, "<a href="Down%20Beat">Down Beat</a>" praised the musician's combination of "raw energy and sophistication", while saying that the record sounded just as remarkable as when it was first released. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> gave the two-album reissue an "A–" in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", calling "Confusion" "one Fela song/track/album it would be a waste to edit ... the proof of 's presumptive funk." For the annual <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics poll, he ranked the re-release number 80 on his list of 2000's best albums.

In 2005, "Confusion" was ranked 91st on "<a href="New%20Nation">New Nation</a>"s list of "Top 100 Best Albums by Black Artists". In his 2008 book "<a href="1%2C000%20Recordings%20to%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die</a>", music journalist <a href="Tom%20Moon">Tom Moon</a> wrote that it is both one of Kuti's best albums and "a demonstration of just how rousing Afro-Beat's deftly interlocked rhythms can be." In 2010, the album was bundled again with "Gentleman" by <a href="Knitting%20Factory%20Records">Knitting Factory Records</a> as a part of the label's extensive reissue of Kuti's 45-album discography. Michaelangelo Matos of "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" magazine gave it a score of "9.3/10" and cited it as the essential release in both the reissue and Kuti's catalog: "an oasis in a sandpaper-like catalog."

All songs were arranged, composed, and produced by <a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Ransome-Kuti</a>.

No. 90 Wing RAAF

No. 90 (Composite) Wing was a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a> that operated during the early years of the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. Its purpose was to serve as an umbrella organisation for the RAAF units deployed in the conflict, <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a>s, and <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 38 (Transport) Squadron</a>, flying <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakotas</a>. The wing was established in July 1950 and headquartered at <a href="Changi%20Air%20Base">Changi</a>, on the east coast of Singapore. No. 1 Squadron operated from <a href="Tengah%20Air%20Base">Tengah</a>, in Singapore's west. No. 38 Squadron was based at Changi and, from April 1951 to February 1952, at <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> in central Malaya. The Lincolns generally conducted <a href="Area%20bombardment">area bombing</a> missions, as well as precision strikes, to harass communist insurgents. The Dakotas were tasked with airlifting cargo, <a href="Very%20important%20person">VIP</a>s, troops and casualties, as well as courier flights and supply drops. Following No. 38 Squadron's departure in December 1952, No. 90 Wing was disbanded, leaving No. 1 Squadron to carry on as the sole RAAF unit in the Malayan air campaign until its withdrawal to Australia in July 1958.

In April 1950, the British government requested Australia's assistance to combat communist insurgents during the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. In response, the Australian Defence Committee determined that it was possible to commit a <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a> of eight <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Douglas C-47 Dakota</a> transports and a <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flight</a> of four to six <a href="Avro%20Lincoln">Avro Lincoln</a> heavy bombers. The Federal government formally announced the decision to send the Dakotas soon afterwards; in late June, it confirmed the allocation of six Lincolns. <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron</a>, operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of <a href="No.%2082%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 82 Wing</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Amberley">RAAF Station Amberley</a>, Queensland, and be based at <a href="Tengah%20Air%20Base">Tengah airfield</a> in the west of Singapore. <a href="No.%2038%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 38 (Transport) Squadron</a>, operating Dakotas, would be detached from <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 Wing</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, and be based at <a href="Changi%20Air%20Base">Changi</a>, in Singapore's east. The transport commitment was rendered possible by the recent return of ten Australian Dakota crews from service during the <a href="Berlin%20Airlift">Berlin Airlift</a>.

It was agreed that RAAF operations during the Emergency would be directed by the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) through <a href="Far%20East%20Air%20Force%20%28Royal%20Air%20Force%29">Air Headquarters Malaya</a> (later <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B224%20Group%20RAF">No. 224 Group RAF</a>). The British also wanted the Australian squadrons attached to an RAF <a href="Wing%20%28military%20aviation%20unit%29">wing</a>. However, the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, was mindful of repeating the experience of World War II, when RAAF units and personnel based in Britain had been absorbed by the RAF, rather than operating as a national group led by high-ranking Australian officers. He therefore decided that Nos. 1 and 38 Squadrons should be formed into a "composite" organisation (one made up of disparate elements such as bomber, fighter, or reconnaissance units) and administered by an overarching RAAF headquarters, and put this requirement to the British <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a>. The Air Ministry agreed, and No. 90 (Composite) Wing was duly established at Richmond on 10 July 1950, under the command of <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> Paddy Heffernan.

No. 38 Squadron's Dakotas began arriving at Changi on 19 June 1950, and No. 1 Squadron's Lincolns at Tengah on 16 July. No. 90 Wing staff departed Richmond by air and established the headquarters at Changi on 22 July. The Dakotas had flown their first mission the previous day; the Lincolns undertook their initial operations on 26 July. Nos. 1 and 38 Squadrons were responsible for their own routine maintenance; aircraft rotated back to Australia for major work. The RAF provided base support facilities, including messing and accommodation.

The Lincolns generally conducted <a href="area%20bombing">area bombing</a> missions, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. They operated singly and in formations, sometimes in concert with RAF bombers. Not having to contend with <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft fire</a>, the Lincolns flew mainly by day. After completing a bomb run, they would make another pass over the target to strafe with machine guns and <a href="20%20mm%20caliber">20 mm cannon</a>. The Lincolns were considered well suited to the campaign, owing to their range and ability to fly at low speeds to search for targets, as well as their firepower and heavy bomb load. No. 1 Squadron also flew night missions—the only Commonwealth air force unit authorised to do so—of up to six hours duration, dropping one bomb every half hour or so. To reduce the risk of <a href="collateral%20damage">collateral damage</a>, all air strikes had to be approved by the Joint Operation Centre, located at <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a> in central Malaya and staffed by military, police and civilian personnel. Although the original purpose of the bombing campaign was to kill as many insurgents as possible, the impracticality of achieving this in operations over dense jungle resulted in a shift towards harassing and demoralising the communists, driving them out of their bases and into areas held by Commonwealth ground troops.
The Dakotas were tasked with airlifting cargo, <a href="Very%20Important%20Person">VIPs</a>, troops and casualties, as well as courier flights, supply drops to friendly forces and aerial despatch of propaganda leaflets. On other missions they acted as <a href="Pathfinder%20%28RAF%29">pathfinders</a> for No. 1 Squadron, dropping smoke canisters on suspected communist hideouts that the Lincolns flying above and behind would attempt to bomb. Airlifting and supplying troops was a key part of the strategy to defeat the insurgency, by ensuring that security forces could maintain a semi-permanent presence in the jungle. No. 38 Squadron's operations ranged throughout Malaya and into Borneo, the Philippines, Japan and Korea. Transport requirements in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> led to a reduction in No. 90 Wing's strength when four of the Dakotas were transferred to <a href="Iwakuni%2C%20Yamaguchi">Iwakuni</a>, Japan, headquarters of <a href="No.%2091%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 91 (Composite) Wing</a>, in November 1950. The same month, Group Captain <a href="Frank%20Headlam">Frank Headlam</a> was appointed to take over command of No. 90 Wing from Heffernan. Headlam co-piloted a Dakota on a supply drop on 20 December; he was slightly injured and the aircraft badly damaged following a crash-landing at Kampong Aur in <a href="Pahang">Pahang</a> as a result of engine failure.

No. 1 Squadron's complement was increased from six to eight aircraft after the British Air Ministry requested in February 1951 that Australia augment its bomber force to partly offset the imminent withdrawal of the RAF's Lincolns to <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> in Europe. In April, No. 38 Squadron's four Dakotas relocated to Kuala Lumpur, where they undertook supply drops in cooperation with <a href="No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B41%20Squadron%20RNZAF">No. 41 Squadron RNZAF</a>. One of No. 1 Squadron's Lincolns was <a href="Hull%20loss">written off</a> after overshooting the runway at Tengah on 30 November. <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> (later Group Captain) Redmond Green was appointed the new commanding officer of No. 90 Wing the following month, replacing Headlam. On 4 April 1952, Green participated in a Lincoln <a href="sortie">sortie</a> in place of an injured pilot. The first aircraft he took off in had to turn back owing to engine failure. The second completed the mission but was found to have lost brake power as it was returning to Tengah, and there was a danger of the aircraft overrunning the landing strip and sustaining heavy damage; the crew was able to slow the Lincoln on the runway by trailing a parachute from the rear turret upon touching down.

No. 38 Squadron relocated from Kuala Lumpur to its former base at Changi in February 1952. As the year progressed, RAAF transport priorities altered owing to the increasing demands of the Korean War, and the Malayan commitment was no longer considered sustainable. Having airlifted more than 17,000 passengers and almost 1,900 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s of cargo, dropped some 750 tonnes of supplies and evacuated over 300 injured troops, No. 38 Squadron departed for Australia on 8 December and rejoined No. 86 Wing at Richmond three days later. Following this withdrawal, No. 90 Wing was disbanded at Changi, and No. 1 Squadron became the only Australian flying unit in Malaya. It continued the bombing campaign against the communists until it was withdrawn to Australia in July 1958, having flown almost 4,000 sorties in its eight years of operation and dropped over 14,000 tonnes of bombs—85 per cent of the total delivered by Commonwealth forces during the Emergency. No. 1 Squadron was relieved by <a href="No.%202%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 2 Squadron</a>, operating <a href="English%20Electric%20Canberra">English Electric Canberra</a> jet bombers out of <a href="RMAF%20Butterworth">Butterworth</a> in north-west Malaya.

No. 90 Wing was commanded by the following officers:

Military service of Ian Smith

The future <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>n <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Rhodesia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a> served in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, interrupting his studies at <a href="Rhodes%20University">Rhodes University</a> in South Africa to join up in 1941. Following a year's pilot instruction in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> under the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>, he was posted to <a href="No.%20237%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron</a>, then stationed in the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a>, in late 1942. Smith received six weeks' operational training in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, then entered active service as a <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in <a href="Persia%20and%20Iraq%20Command">Iran and Iraq</a>. No. 237 Squadron, which had operated in the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert</a> from 1941 to early 1942, returned to that front in March 1943. Smith flew in the Western Desert until October that year, when a crash during a night takeoff resulted in serious injuries, including facial disfigurements and a broken jaw. Following <a href="reconstructive%20surgery">reconstructive plastic surgery</a> to his face, other operations and five months' convalescence, Smith rejoined No. 237 Squadron in <a href="Corsica%23Modern%20Corsica">Corsica</a> in May 1944. While there, he attained his highest rank, <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>.

In late June 1944, during a <a href="strafing">strafing</a> attack on a railway yard in the <a href="Po%20Valley">Po Valley</a> in <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29%23Allied%20advance%20into%20Northern%20Italy">northern Italy</a>, Smith was shot down by <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft</a> fire. Parachuting from his aircraft, he landed without serious injury in the <a href="Ligurian%20Alps">Ligurian Alps</a>, in an area that was behind German lines, but largely under the control of anti-German <a href="Italian%20resistance%20movement">Italian partisans</a>. Smith spent three months working with the local resistance movement before trekking westwards, across the <a href="Maritime%20Alps">Maritime Alps</a>, with three other Allied personnel, hoping to join up with the Allied forces that had just <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">invaded</a> southern France. After 23 days' hiking, he and his companions were recovered by American troops and repatriated.

Smith was briefly stationed in Britain before he was posted to <a href="No.%20130%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron</a> in western Germany in April 1945. He flew combat missions there until <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">Germany surrendered</a> in May. He remained with No. 130 Squadron for the rest of his service, and returned home at the end of 1945. After completing his studies at Rhodes, he was elected to the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> for his birthplace, <a href="Shurugwi">Selukwe</a>, in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201948">1948</a>. He became Prime Minister in 1964, during his country's dispute with Britain regarding the terms for independence; Smith was influenced as a politician by his wartime experiences, and <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20in%20World%20War%20II">Rhodesia's military record</a> on behalf of Britain became central to his sense of betrayal by post-war British governments. This partly motivated his administration's <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> in 1965. His status as a Second World War RAF veteran helped him win support, both domestically and internationally.

<a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a> was born in 1919, the son of British settlers in <a href="Shurugwi">Selukwe</a>, <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>. He attended Chaplin School in <a href="Gweru">Gwelo</a>, where he was head <a href="Prefect%23Academic">prefect</a>, recipient of the <a href="Victor%20Ludorum">Victor Ludorum</a> in athletics, <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> of the school teams in <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> and <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, and successful academically. After graduating in 1937, he attended <a href="Rhodes%20University">Rhodes University College</a> in <a href="Grahamstown">Grahamstown</a>, South Africa, which was often attended by Rhodesian students, partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own. Enrolling at the start of 1938, Smith read for a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Commerce">Bachelor of Commerce</a> degree. He was about halfway through his course when the Second World War broke out in September 1939.

Smith was fascinated by the idea of being a fighter pilot, and particularly excited by the prospect of flying a <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfire</a>. He wanted to leave Rhodes immediately to join the <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Southern Rhodesian Air Force</a>, but did not because military recruiters in the colony had been told not to accept university students until after they graduated. As in the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20in%20World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, <a href="White%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white Rhodesians</a> in general were very keen to enlist; because it was feared that the absence of these men might adversely affect the strategically important mines, manpower controls were introduced to keep certain whites out of the military and in their civilian occupations. One of Southern Rhodesia's main <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20in%20World%20War%20II">contributions</a> to the Allied war effort proved to be its participation, from 1940, in the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Air%20Training%20Plan">Empire Air Training Scheme</a>. The Southern Rhodesian Air Force was absorbed into the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in April 1940, becoming <a href="No.%20237%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF</a>. Two more RAF squadrons, <a href="No.%2044%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 44</a> and <a href="No.%20266%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 266</a>, were subsequently also designated "Rhodesian" formations.

Remaining at Rhodes during the 1940 academic year, Smith secretly made plans to leave for military service in spite of his instructions to finish studying. In June 1940, during the mid-year break from studies, he quietly travelled to the Southern Rhodesian capital, <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, to tell the colony's director of manpower, William Addison, that he wanted to join the air force; to avoid being barred from enlistment, Smith did not mention his university attendance, and gave his Selukwe address. During his Christmas vacation at the end of 1940, Smith went to Salisbury again, and was successful in a second interview with an air force official and a physical examination. Early in 1941, having received his pilot course call-up papers, Smith underwent a final interview, during which it emerged that he was a university student; the interviewer briefly demurred, but accepted Smith when he insisted that he wanted to sign up.
In September 1941 Smith formally enlisted in the Royal Air Force and received service number 80463. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a>, and after six weeks transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers, since at Guinea Fowl he learned to pilot <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">Tiger Moths</a>, then <a href="North%20American%20T-6%20Texan">Harvards</a>. He was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an <a href="officer%20cadet">officer cadet</a>, which meant he was transferred to <a href="Gweru-Thornhill%20Air%20Base">Thornhill</a>, another Gwelo airbase. He passed out in September 1942 with the rank of <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a>; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.

Smith hoped to be posted to Britain at the end of his training, and was initially told that this was going to happen, but he was instead sent to the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a>. He was despatched to <a href="Idku">Idku</a>, a small RAF base near <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, in late 1942, from where he was posted to an operational training unit based at <a href="Baalbek">Baalbek</a> in Lebanon. He spent six weeks there, flying over much of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> in a <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a> fighter, before being posted to No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron to begin active service, again piloting Hurricanes. The squadron was stationed near the Iranian capital of <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a> when Smith joined it, but it almost immediately transferred to <a href="Kirkuk">Kirkuk</a> in Iraq, to help guard the oil wells and pipelines there. In March 1943, it was again committed to the <a href="Western%20Desert%20Campaign">Western Desert Campaign</a> in North Africa, having previously served there during 1941–1942, and Smith served on this front as a Hurricane pilot. He was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 25 March 1943.

On 4 October 1943, Smith took off from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a shipping convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall at the end of the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, and his face was smashed against the Hurricane's <a href="gyro%20gunsight">gyrosight</a>. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.

A team of doctors and surgeons at the Fifteenth Scottish Hospital in Cairo worked extensively on Smith, putting his jaw back together with a complicated assembly of bandage, plaster, nuts, bolts and wire, and rebuilt his face through <a href="skin%20grafting">skin grafts</a> and other <a href="reconstructive%20surgery">reconstructive surgery</a>. In March 1944, after about five months' convalescence, he was passed fit for flying. He turned down the offer of a posting home to Southern Rhodesia as an instructor and, after a refresher course in Egypt, travelled to <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> to rejoin No. 237 Squadron, which was by now flying Spitfire Mk IXs.

Smith joined No. 237 Squadron in Corsica on 10 May 1944, and resumed operational flying two days later. He was <a href="battlefield%20promotion">promoted in the field</a> to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>. The unit was attached to an American bomber group, and assigned to cover it during <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">attacks on northern Italian cities</a>. The fighters also embarked on <a href="strafing">strafing</a> raids in the <a href="Po%20Valley">Po Valley</a> against railway traffic and heavy vehicles. Smith flew 10 sorties and on the last of these, on 22 June, led a strafing raid against a large railway yard when his aircraft was hit by flak on a second pass. He warned other pilots not to attempt a second pass on the railway yard, and turned towards the coast, hoping to ditch in the sea. Smith's wingman, Alan Douglas, told him by radio that black smoke was coming from the aircraft, then that the engine was ablaze. Smith bailed out. He had never parachuted before. He turned his Spitfire upside down, thrust the stick forward, released the cockpit's canopy, fell out of the plane and landed without serious injuries on the side of a mountain.

According to his own account, he initially hid in a large bush, but decided this was too obvious, and so moved to a smaller one. A German patrol arrived, examined the original bush, and attacked it with bursts of automatic gunfire before leaving. "Somebody was keeping an eye on me when I thought I'd better get out of that bush ..." he later told Phillippa Berlyn. The area in which he had landed was predominantly anti-German, and largely under the control of pro-Allied <a href="Italian%20resistance%20movement">Italian partisans</a>; one of these saw Smith's descent and retrieved his parachute to stop the Germans from finding it. Smith hid for a while longer before emerging to greet a boy of about 12. The boy, Leo, knew no English; using sign language, he told Smith to sit and wait, and shortly returned with his elder brother, Lorenzo. Lorenzo proposed that Smith come to their home to eat, and Smith accepted. The boys' parents, peasant farmers named Zunino, took him in, but decided it was too risky to keep him at the house so soon after the crash, and hid him in a cave on the mountain. The next day, the Germans came to the Zuninos' house, looking for Smith. After about a week, the danger had subsided, and the Zuninos gave Smith a room in the house.

Smith worked on the Zuninos' farm and began studying the Italian language, which he realised he had to learn if he was to travel through enemy territory to the Allied lines. After a month, the local partisan commander, Antonio Bozzano (nicknamed "Barbetta" because of his beard), came to meet Smith, and asked him to join his ranks. Smith accompanied Barbetta to his headquarters, about away in a village called Piancastagna. When Barbetta asked his rank, Smith said he was a <a href="captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a>. "Oh well," Barbetta replied, tapping him on the shoulder; "you are now a major. I make you a major." Smith realised that Barbetta had given him this "promotion" in the hope of elevating his own reputation in the resistance movement—"none of the other regiments in the area could boast an "Inglesi pilote" and a "majore" to boot", he explained in his memoirs. Smith got on well with Barbetta, and took part in sabotage operations for about three months during late 1944. Meanwhile, he became proficient in Italian. After the Germans pulled out of their local garrison at <a href="Sassello">Sassello</a> in October 1944, Smith told Barbetta that he was going to attempt to return to the Allied lines. The partisans tried to talk him out of it, telling him it was too risky, but when Smith insisted, they gave him letters to take with him, endorsing him to other Italian partisan groups he might encounter on his way. A <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> corporal known to Smith as "Bill", who had been hiding in a nearby village, asked if he could come as well, and Smith agreed.
Smith headed west, across the <a href="Ligurian%20Alps">Ligurian Alps</a>, towards southern France, which he knew had just been <a href="Operation%20Dragoon">invaded</a> by Allied troops, principally Americans, <a href="Free%20French%20Forces">Free French</a> and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean Batiste Chambrin, who gave them instructions on how to pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.

Chambrin did not speak English, but summoned his English-speaking brother. Smith produced his RAF rank insignia as proof of his identity. Smith and Bill made their way to the border crossing, guided by Chambrin, who told them that his brother would meet them on the other side of the border. The only crossing was a bridge, manned by German sentries. Smith observed the checkpoint for a while, and saw that pedestrians crossing alone or in pairs were rarely challenged, while larger groups often were. He thought it might be possible simply to walk across, and told Bill to "just look straight ahead and walk quietly on". They were not challenged, and met Chambrin's brother a few miles away. The Austrian and Frenchman joined them the next day; the Polish soldier, who had appeared to Smith to be underage, had lost his nerve on seeing the Germans and had gone back.

Having crossed into France, they sought friendly troops. They decided to bypass the German positions by crossing the <a href="Maritime%20Alps">Maritime Alps</a>, with a local guide, over the course of two days. They lacked equipment and clothing for mountaineering. During the night, Smith took off his shoes, and found in the morning that they had frozen and that he could not put them on. He continued in his socks, which wore through, forcing him to finish the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. Twenty-three days after Smith and Bill set off from Piancastagna, they met American troops who took them to a local base camp, from where they were returned to their respective forces. The Americans took Smith to <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, from where he was flown to the RAF transit camp at <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. On arriving in late November 1944, Smith sent a brief telegram home to Selukwe: "Alive and well. Love to you all—Ian."

It was well known to British servicemen that spending three months or more missing behind enemy lines resulted in an automatic posting back home, which Smith did not want; he was therefore wary as he entered his interview at the Naples transit base. When passage back to Rhodesia via Egypt was offered, Smith successfully requested permission to go to Britain instead, saying that he had many relatives there and considered it a second home. In England he was posted to a six-week refresher course in <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, flying Spitfires. Smith performed very strongly in the exercises and, at his own request, was posted back to active service after only three weeks in the course. He was attached to <a href="No.%20130%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron</a>, part of No. 125 Wing, which was commanded by <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> (later <a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a>) <a href="Johnnie%20Johnson%20%28RAF%20officer%29">Johnnie Johnson</a>, one of the most successful RAF <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>s of the war. Reporting for duty with No. 130 Squadron at <a href="Celle">Celle</a>, in western Germany, on 23 April 1945, he flew combat missions there, "[having] a little bit of fun shooting up odd things", he recalled, until the <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">European war ended</a> on 7 May with <a href="German%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Germany's surrender</a>.

Smith remained with No. 130 Squadron for the rest of his service, flying with it to <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, and then, via Britain, to Norway. He spent around five months in Norway as part of the post-war occupation forces, but did not learn Norwegian, later telling Berlyn that it seemed much harder to him than Italian, "and they all spoke English, you see". After No. 130 Squadron returned to Britain in November 1945, Smith was demobilised and sent home. He was met at RAF Kumalo in Bulawayo by his family, with whom he drove back to Selukwe.

The plastic surgery used to reconstruct Smith's face following his crash in the Western Desert in 1943 left his face somewhat lopsided, with partial paralysis. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn writes that the grafted skin on his face "almost hides the injuries even today, though it has left him with a slightly blank expression". This was often commented on by observers, and when Smith died in 2007, it was prominent in many of his obituaries. "It was Ian Smith's war-damaged left eye that drew people's attention first," began the report printed in the London "<a href="The%20Times">Times</a>": "wide open, heavy-lidded and impassive from experimental plastic surgery, it hinted at a dull, characterless nature. The other was narrow, slanting and slightly hooded. Being watched by it was an uncomfortable experience. Each eye could have belonged to a different person." "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" took a similar line, reporting that the operation to reconstruct Smith's face had "left him with a somewhat menacing stare".

Smith's injuries also made him permanently unable to sit for long periods without pain, so when he attended conferences as a politician, he would briefly rise from his seat from time to time. During his talks with British Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> aboard <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a> in 1966, Smith regularly got up and looked out of a <a href="porthole">porthole</a>; the British incorrectly interpreted this as Smith feeling intimidated by Wilson, or seasick.

Smith completed his studies at Rhodes during 1946, and entered politics in <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201948">1948</a> when he successfully contested the Selukwe seat on behalf of the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal Party</a>, becoming his home town's representative in the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> at the age of 29. He rose through the political ranks with the <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Federal Party</a> during the 1950s, and in 1962 helped to form the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a>, a right-wing party whose avowed goal was full independence from Britain without an immediate transfer to black majority rule. He became Deputy Prime Minister in December that year when the new party, led by <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a>, surprised most observers by winning that month's <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">election</a>. After the Cabinet forced Field to resign in April 1964, following his failure to gain independence from Britain, they chose Smith as the new Prime Minister.

Smith, Southern Rhodesia's first native-born head of government, was strongly influenced as premier by his wartime experiences. Southern Rhodesia's military contributions during the two World Wars, the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20military%20involvement%20in%20the%20Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a> and other conflicts, combined with memories of his own travails for Britain with the Royal Air Force—"undoubtedly the central experience of his life", <a href="R.%20W.%20Johnson">R. W. Johnson</a> wrote, caused Smith to feel profoundly betrayed when the British government proved one of his main adversaries as Prime Minister. After talks repeatedly broke down, Smith's government <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">unilaterally declared independence</a> on 11 November 1965. In 1970, following the results of a <a href="Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201969">referendum</a>, he declared Rhodesia a republic. He argued that Britain was to blame for all of this—"Rhodesia did not want to seize independence from Britain. It was forced upon us," he said.

For many in Britain during this time, attitudes towards the breakaway colony were complicated by the fact that "Plucky Little Rhodesia", often described as "more British than the British", had given so much for the mother country in its fight against Nazi Germany. Smith's own military service and reputation for bravery gave rise to similar sentiments regarding him personally. White Rhodesians widely hailed him a war hero, as did many overseas commentators. In 1966, Smith's supporters in Britain sent him a painting depicting two Spitfires taking off for a dawn raid, "on behalf of many British people who remained true despite the misguidance of government". Smith retained his affection for the Spitfire; in his memoirs he described it as "the most beautiful aircraft ever made." He also retained some proficiency in the Italian language, though according to one Italian visitor his accent was "atrocious".

Smith's years as an RAF pilot were often alluded to in political rhetoric and popular culture. In the phrase of Martin Francis, "no white Rhodesian kitchen in the 1960s and 1970s was complete without an illustrated dishcloth featuring 'Good Old Smithy' and his trusty Spitfire". The Rhodesian Front's election strategy of emphasising Smith's reputation as a war hero was criticised by the journalist <a href="Peter%20Niesewand">Peter Niesewand</a>, who was deported from Rhodesia in 1973; according to Niesewand, Smith's contribution to the Allied war effort had been "to crash two perfectly good Hurricane planes ["<a href="sic">sic</a>"] for the loss of no Germans". Smith won decisive election victories in <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201970">1970</a>, <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201974">1974</a> and <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201977">1977</a>, and remained in office until the country was reconstituted under majority rule as <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in 1979. He continued to wear his RAF Spitfire pilot's tie well into old age, including on the final day before Zimbabwe Rhodesia's formal establishment on 1 June 1979—"a final gesture of defiance", Bill Schwarz writes, "symbolising an entire lost world."

Chris Gragg

Chris Gragg (born June 30, 1990) is an <a href="American%20football">American football</a> <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a> who is currently a free agent. He played <a href="college%20football">college football</a> at <a href="Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football">Arkansas</a> and was drafted by the <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> in the seventh round of the <a href="2013%20NFL%20Draft">2013 NFL Draft</a>.

After he graduated from <a href="Warren%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29">Warren High School</a> in Arkansas, where he played football as a <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a>, Gragg committed to the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the <a href="Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football">Arkansas Razorbacks football squad</a>, the coaching staff converted Gragg into a tight end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> games and defeated the <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football">Kansas State Wildcats</a> in the <a href="2012%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic">2012 Cotton Bowl Classic</a>, which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record. Invited to participate in the <a href="NFL%20Scouting%20Combine">NFL Scouting Combine</a>, an evaluative competition among prospective NFL players, Gragg ran the fastest <a href="40-yard%20dash">40-yard dash</a> time and had the second-highest <a href="vertical%20jump">vertical jump</a> among tight ends in attendance; in the <a href="draft%20%28sports%29">draft</a>, the Bills chose Gragg with the 222nd overall selection, a pick Buffalo acquired from a trade with the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>. One of five tight ends in spring training, he made Buffalo's regular-season roster and played in nine regular-season games during the <a href="2013%20NFL%20season">2013 NFL season</a>. He then played in 10 games in 2014 and 13 games in 2015 before missing the entire 2016 season due to injury.

Chris Gragg was born on June 30, 1990, in <a href="Pine%20Bluff%2C%20Arkansas">Pine Bluff, Arkansas</a>, to Kelvin and Tenita Gragg, both of whom worked as educators. Kelvin coached the <a href="Warren%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29">Warren High School</a> football team, and Chris served as the team's <a href="water%20boy">water boy</a> until he was in junior high school. For the Warren squad, Gragg played football as a <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a> alongside future NFL players <a href="Jarius%20Wright">Jarius Wright</a> and <a href="Greg%20Childs%20%28American%20football%29">Greg Childs</a>. During his senior year, Gragg accumulated 420 receiving yards and caught 8 <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s. Recruiting website <a href="Rivals.com">Rivals.com</a> evaluated him as a 2-star prospect on a 1–5 star scale and ranked Gragg as the 15th best player in Arkansas at his position, while <a href="Scout.com">Scout.com</a> ranked him as the 148th best receiver in the nation. In July 2007, Gragg committed to the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a>, as did three other players from Warren.

In his freshman season, Gragg played in all 12 of the <a href="2008%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football%20team">Arkansas Razorbacks</a>' games as the team finished with a 5–7 <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%23win%E2%80%93loss%28%E2%80%93tie%29">win–loss record</a>. During the second game of the season, against the <a href="Louisiana%E2%80%93Monroe%20Warhawks%20football">Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks</a>, Gragg caught a 25-yard pass from <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> <a href="Casey%20Dick">Casey Dick</a> on fourth <a href="Down%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%29">down</a> and one to continue a drive that ended with the game-winning touchdown. The catch was Gragg's only reception in 2008. After he dislocated his ankle in a preseason practice, he was given a medical <a href="Redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirt</a> and did not play for the 2009 season.

In 2010, Gragg was converted into a <a href="tight%20end">tight end</a>, which made three slots at the position on the Razorbacks' <a href="depth%20chart">depth chart</a>. <a href="Garrick%20McGee">Garrick McGee</a>, the <a href="offensive%20coordinator">offensive coordinator</a> for the team, observed that "he's a really big receiver in a tight end body", and expected opponents to have "matchup problem[s]" against Gragg. When Arkansas faced the <a href="Georgia%20Bulldogs%20football">Georgia Bulldogs</a> on September 18, Gragg caught a touchdown from a 57-yard pass for his first reception of the year. The <a href="2010%20Arkansas%20Razorbacks%20football%20team">2010 Arkansas Razorbacks</a> ended the year with a 10–3 record, and were invited to play in the <a href="2011%20Sugar%20Bowl">Sugar Bowl</a> against the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football">Ohio State Buckeyes</a>, a game that Arkansas lost 31–26 after Ohio State <a href="defensive%20end">defensive end</a> Solomon Thomas intercepted a pass from quarterback <a href="Ryan%20Mallett">Ryan Mallett</a> in the final minute of the game. Gragg made one catch in the contest for 16 yards; he finished the year with 8 receptions for 171 yards and two touchdowns.

Prior to the 2011 season, a writer for "Arkansas Business" predicted that Gragg "will figure prominently into the offense if he improves his blocking": Gragg replaced <a href="D.%20J.%20Williams%20%28tight%20end%29">D. J. Williams</a>, the first-string tight end who graduated in 2010. In the Razorbacks' eleventh game of the season, Gragg caught 8 passes for 119 yards, both single-game career highs, as the team defeated the <a href="Mississippi%20State%20Bulldogs%20football">Mississippi State Bulldogs</a> and moved to a 10–1 record. The <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series%232004%E2%80%93present">Bowl Championship Series</a> (BCS) system subsequently ranked Arkansas as the third-best team in the nation, behind the <a href="LSU%20Tigers%20football">Louisiana State University Tigers</a> and the <a href="Alabama%20Crimson%20Tide%20football">Alabama Crimson Tide</a>, with the former scheduled as the Razorbacks' next opponent. Brett Martel of <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> stated that the November 25 matchup, a part of the <a href="Arkansas%E2%80%93LSU%20football%20rivalry">Arkansas–LSU football rivalry</a>, "could be even more important than the so-called '<a href="2011%20LSU%20vs.%20Alabama%20football%20game">Game of the Century</a>'" between the Tigers and the Crimson Tide earlier in the year, as both teams in the rivalry competed for a position in the <a href="BCS%20National%20Championship%20Game">BCS National Championship Game</a>. Though Arkansas opened with a 14–0 lead, the Tigers regained the lead by halftime and won, 41–17. Out of contention for the National Championship Game, the team finished the year ranked sixth in the BCS standings and were invited to play in the <a href="2012%20Cotton%20Bowl%20Classic">2012 Cotton Bowl Classic</a>, where they defeated the <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football">Kansas State Wildcats</a> 29–16: with the victory, Arkansas tied a team record for most wins in a season. Over the season, Gragg caught 41 receptions, third most on the team, for 518 yards and two touchdowns.

In July 2012, Gragg was listed as a preseason nominee for the <a href="John%20Mackey%20Award">John Mackey Award</a>, a recognition presented annually by the <a href="Nassau%20County%20Sports%20Commission">Nassau County Sports Commission</a> to the best tight end in college football. Though voted to the second-team of the Coaches Preseason All-<a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> (SEC) squad, an honorific roster composed of the second-best players in the SEC, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> writers Edward Aschoff and Chris Low ranked Gragg as the best tight end in the conference. In Arkansas' season opener against the <a href="Jacksonville%20State%20Gamecocks%20football">Jacksonville State Gamecocks</a>, Gragg accumulated 110 yards and two touchdowns over 7 catches, a performance for which he earned the John Mackey Tight End of the Week award. On September 9, Gragg suffered a bone bruise in his knee against the <a href="Rutgers%20Scarlet%20Knights%20football">Rutgers Scarlet Knights</a> which caused him to miss the next three games; upon return, Gragg reaggravated the injury and missed the rest of the season's matches. He finished his final season at Arkansas with 22 receptions for 289 yards and three touchdowns, while the team ended with a 4–8 record; academically, he graduated with a degree in <a href="sports%20management">sports management</a>. After his senior year, Gragg participated in the <a href="NFL%20Scouting%20Combine">NFL Scouting Combine</a>, where he ran the fastest <a href="40-yard%20dash">40-yard dash</a> time, the third-fastest <a href="3%20cone%20drill">3 cone drill</a>, had the third-longest <a href="Long%20jump">broad jump</a>, and the second-highest <a href="vertical%20jump">vertical jump</a> of all tight ends in attendance. In an overview of his Combine performance, a writer for the NFL praised his speed and "receiver-like hands", but criticized him for a lack of agility and occasional dropped passes. The writer compared Gragg to tight end <a href="Daniel%20Fells">Daniel Fells</a>.

The <a href="Buffalo%20Bills">Buffalo Bills</a> selected Gragg in the seventh round with the 222nd overall selection in the <a href="2013%20NFL%20Draft">2013 NFL Draft</a>, a slot they obtained from a trade with the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Rams">St. Louis Rams</a>. When he was drafted, Gragg became the second tight end Buffalo had ever selected out of Arkansas, and the first Arkansas player to be selected by the Bills since 1973. Gragg was the first rookie out of the 2013 Bills' draft class to sign a contract. In preseason practice, Gragg was one of five tight ends on the Buffalo team as he tried to earn one of the 53 positions available on the active <a href="Schedule%20%28workplace%29">roster</a>. While the team trained at <a href="St.%20John%20Fisher%20College">St. John Fisher College</a>, Buffalo head coach <a href="Doug%20Marrone">Doug Marrone</a> praised Gragg for his knowledge of the Bills' playbook and his vertical running speed. In four <a href="National%20Football%20League%20preseason">preseason games</a>, he totaled 5 receptions for 38 yards. When the Bills cut their roster to 53 players, Gragg made the team; on an "A–F" scale, ESPN columnist Mike Rodak gave the Bills a "C" grade in tight end depth and stated that Gragg "would be in the bottom 10 percent of NFL starters at [the position]". Gragg made his regular season NFL debut on October 13 against the <a href="Cincinnati%20Bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a>, and caught his first career reception and touchdown against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> four games later. When Buffalo faced the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Buccaneers">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> on December 8, Gragg started in a game for the first time during the regular season. By the end of 2013, Gragg caught 5 receptions for 53 yards and a touchdown in nine career games played. Collectively, the Bills finished last in the <a href="AFC%20East">AFC East</a> with a 6–10 record.

Prior to the Bills' 2014 training camp, Rodak gave Gragg a "45%" chance to make Buffalo's <a href="Glossary%20of%20American%20football%2353-man%20roster">53-man roster</a>: Rodak described him as "the most athletic tight end" with the Bills, but also wrote that "there might not be a spot for Gragg" with tight ends <a href="Tony%20Moeaki">Tony Moeaki</a>, <a href="Scott%20Chandler%20%28American%20football%29">Scott Chandler</a>, and <a href="Lee%20Smith%20%28American%20football%29">Lee Smith</a> on the team as well. During the preseason, Gragg was hospitalized with <a href="heat%20cramps">heat cramps</a>, but returned to practice on July 30. The Bills faced the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> in their first preseason game, a <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Game">Pro Football Hall of Fame Game</a>, and according to Jay Skurski of "<a href="The%20Buffalo%20News">The Buffalo News</a>", Gragg "[had] a chance to impress" with Moeaki and Chandler injured and unable to play: in the game, Gragg had 4 catches for 24 yards and a <a href="fumble">fumble</a>. He finished the preseason with 10 receptions for 66 yards, and made the regular season roster. In the fourth quarter of the Bills' October 5 matchup against the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a>, Gragg caught a touchdown pass that, with an added <a href="two-point%20conversion">two-point conversion</a>, tied the game; Buffalo won the contest, 17–14, and moved to a 3–2 record. When he attempted to catch a low-thrown pass in the second half of a game against the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> on November 24, Gragg injured his right knee, which caused him to miss the remainder of the Bills' season. During 2014, over the ten games in which he played, Gragg accumulated 7 receptions for 53 yards and a touchdown as Buffalo finished with a 9–7 record, second in the <a href="AFC%20East">AFC East</a> behind the <a href="New%20England%20Patriots">New England Patriots</a>.

Gragg played in 13 games, starting 4, in 2015, catching 12 passes for 150 yards and no touchdowns. On August 26, 2016, Gragg suffered a torn ACL in a preseason game against the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a> that ended up sidelining him for the entire 2016 season. He became a free agent in March 2017.

On July 28, 2017, Gragg signed with the <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a>. He was placed on injured reserve on September 1, 2017, after suffering an ankle injury.

Chris's brother, Will, also plays football as a tight end: Will said that Chris taught him how to catch, and that when Chris learned something new in Buffalo or at Arkansas, Chris taught it to him. Will transferred to <a href="Dumas%20High%20School">Dumas High School</a> when Kelvin accepted a position as the superintendent of <a href="Dumas%20Public%20Schools">the school district</a>. Will, who received offers from forty-five collegiate schools, committed to the University of Arkansas in September 2014 and signed with the institution in December. After redshirting his first year at Arkansas, Will remained buried on the depth chart at tight end, unable to break through. In April 2018, Will announced his intention to transfer to another school, and left the Razorback football program. In June 2018, the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a> announced that Gragg had been added to their roster as a graduate transfer with two years of eligibility remaining, and would be available to play immediately.

Si Ronda

Si Ronda is a 1930 <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> which was directed by <a href="Lie%20Tek%20Swie">Lie Tek Swie</a> and starred <a href="Bachtiar%20Effendi">Bachtiar Effendi</a>. Based on contemporary <a href="Betawi%20people">Betawi</a> oral tradition, it follows the exploits of a bandit, skilled in "<a href="silat">silat</a>" (traditional Malay martial arts), known as Si Ronda. In the "<a href="lenong">lenong</a>" stories from which the film was derived, Ronda was often depicted as a <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> type of figure. The production, now thought <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>, was one of a series of martial arts films released between 1929 and 1931. "Si Ronda" received little coverage in the media upon its release. A second adaptation of the tale, "Si Ronda Macan Betawi", was made in 1978.

"Si Ronda" was adapted from a "<a href="lenong">lenong</a>" (a <a href="Betawi%20people">Betawi</a> oral tradition similar to a stage play) popular with <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> and <a href="Native%20Indonesians">native</a> audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at "<a href="silat">silat</a>" (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich to give to the poor. The Indonesian film scholar <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.

Similar stories to Si Ronda's include those of Si Jampang and <a href="Si%20Pitung">Si Pitung</a>; these stage plays centred on extraordinary men (referred to as "jago") who, though living outside the law, generally fought for the common populace. Adaptations of the genre, manifested as bandit films, became popular in domestic cinema following the release of "<a href="Si%20Tjonat">Si Tjonat</a>" by Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. This release was followed by the <a href="Wong%20brothers">Wong brothers</a>' "Rampok Preanger" (also 1929), and an <a href="Si%20Pitoeng%20%281931%20film%29">adaptation</a> of the Si Pitung stories in 1931. Not all films in this genre, which consisted of a quarter of all <a href="List%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestic releases for 1929–1931</a>, maintained the heroic qualities of the central character: the Wongs' adaptation of "Si Pitung", for instance, portrayed him as a simple bandit and not the <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> figure of stage.

"Si Ronda" was directed by <a href="Lie%20Tek%20Swie">Lie Tek Swie</a> and produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a>. The two had previously worked together on the company's highly profitable "<a href="Njai%20Dasima%20%281929%20film%29">Njai Dasima</a>" in 1929. <a href="Cinematography">Cinematography</a> was handled by A. Loepias. Shot in black-and-white, this <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> starred <a href="Bachtiar%20Effendi">Bachtiar Effendi</a>, a set decorator with Tan's, in his on-screen debut playing the title role. It also featured Momo, an actor who had appeared in the film "Njai Dasima".

"Si Ronda" was released in 1930; Effendi stated that it was released before Tan's "<a href="Nancy%20Bikin%20Pembalesan">Nancy Bikin Pembalesan</a>" ("Nancy Takes Revenge"), a sequel to "Njai Dasima", began screening in May 1930. Dutch newspapers indicate that it had screened in <a href="Medan">Medan</a>, <a href="North%20Sumatra">North Sumatra</a>, by 1932. Biran writes that the film received little coverage; he notes that <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a> has no news clippings related to "Si Ronda".

After "Si Ronda", Lie and Tan collaborated on three further films. Lie left Tan's in 1932, reportedly as his approach no longer matched Tan's low-class target audience and caused the works to go over budget. Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine "Doenia Film". Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later with Standard Film. The film is likely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. The American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives.

Another film based on the Ronda stories, titled "Si Ronda Macan Betawi" ("Ronda the Betawi Tiger"), was released in 1978. Directed by Fritz G. Schadt, it starred <a href="Dicky%20Zulkarnaen">Dicky Zulkarnaen</a> in the title role and Lenny Marlina as his lover. In this adaptation Ronda uses his "silat" skills to fight corrupt land owners and colonial government workers.

Little Nemo (1911 film)

Little Nemo, also known as Winsor McCay: The Famous Cartoonist of the N.Y. Herald and His Moving Comics, is a 1911 <a href="silent%20film">silent</a> <a href="animation">animated</a> <a href="short%20film">short film</a> by American cartoonist <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>. One of the earliest animated films, it was McCay's first, and featured characters from McCay's comic strip "<a href="Little%20Nemo%20in%20Slumberland">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>". Its expressive <a href="character%20animation">character animation</a> distinguished the film from the experiments of <a href="History%20of%20animation">earlier animators</a>.

Inspired by <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>s his son brought home, McCay came to see the potential of the animated film medium. He claimed to be the first to make such films, though <a href="James%20Stuart%20Blackton">James Stuart Blackton</a> and <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a> were among those who preceded him. The short's four thousand drawings on <a href="rice%20paper">rice paper</a> were shot at <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a> under Blackton's supervision. Most of the film's running time is made up of a live-action sequence in which McCay bets his colleagues that he can make drawings that move. He wins the bet with four minutes of animation in which the "Little Nemo" characters perform, interact, and metamorphose to McCay's whim.

"Little Nemo" debuted in movie theaters on April 8, 1911, and four days later McCay began using it as part of his <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act. Its good reception motivated him to <a href="Hand-colouring%20of%20photographs">hand-color</a> each of the animated frames of the originally black-and-white film. The film's success led McCay to devote more time to animation. He followed up "Little Nemo" with "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>" in 1912 and his best-known film, "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>", in 1914.

<a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a> ( – 1934) had worked prolifically as a commercial artist and cartoonist by the time he started making newspaper comic strips such as "<a href="Dream%20of%20the%20Rarebit%20Fiend">Dream of the Rarebit Fiend</a>" (1904–11) and his signature strip "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>" (1905–14). In 1906, McCay began performing on the vaudeville circuit, doing <a href="chalk%20talk">chalk talk</a> performances in which he drew before live audiences.

Inspired by <a href="flip%20book">flip book</a>s his son <a href="Bob%20McCay">Robert</a> brought home, McCay said he "came to see the possibility of making moving pictures" of his cartoons. McCay, then in his early forties, asserted he was "the first man in the world to make animated films", but he was likely familiar with the earlier work of American <a href="James%20Stuart%20Blackton">James Stuart Blackton</a> and the French <a href="%C3%89mile%20Cohl">Émile Cohl</a>. In 1900, Blackton produced "<a href="The%20Enchanted%20Drawing">The Enchanted Drawing</a>", a <a href="trick%20film">trick film</a> in which an artist interacts with a drawing on an easel. Blackton used chalk drawings in 1906 to animate the film "<a href="Humorous%20Phases%20of%20Funny%20Faces">Humorous Phases of Funny Faces</a>", and used <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> techniques to animate a scene in the 1907 film "The Haunted Hotel". Cohl's films, such as 1908's "<a href="Fantasmagorie%20%281908%20film%29">Fantasmagorie</a>", were dreamlike nonnarrative pieces in which characters and scenes continually changed shape. Cohl's films were first distributed in the United States in 1909, the year McCay said he first became interested in animation. According to McCay biographer <a href="John%20Canemaker">John Canemaker</a>, McCay combined the interactive qualities of Blackton's films with the abstract, shapeshifting qualities of Cohl's into his own films. In the films of all three, the artist interacts with the animation.

Considered McCay's masterpiece, "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>" debuted in October 1905 as a full-page <a href="Sunday%20comics">Sunday strip</a> in the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>". Its child protagonist, whose appearance was based on McCay's son Robert, had fabulous dreams that would be interrupted with his awakening in the last panel. McCay experimented with timing and pacing, the form of the comics page, the size and shape of panels, perspective, and architectural and other details.

The strip has seen a number of other adaptations. An extravagant $100,000 "Little Nemo" stage show with score by <a href="Victor%20Herbert">Victor Herbert</a> and lyrics by <a href="Harry%20B.%20Smith">Harry B. Smith</a> played to sold-out audiences in 1907. A joint American-Japanese feature-length film "" appeared in 1989, with contributions by <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>, <a href="Chris%20Columbus%20%28filmmaker%29">Chris Columbus</a>, and <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Moebius</a>. "" was a 1990 <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="Platform%20game">platform</a> video game adaptation of the 1989 film.

Following credits proclaiming McCay as "The Famous Cartoonist of the "New York Herald"" and "the first artist to attempt drawing pictures that will move", McCay sits in a restaurant with a group of colleagues, cartoonist <a href="George%20McManus">George McManus</a>, actor <a href="John%20Bunny">John Bunny</a> and publisher <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Magazine">Eugene V. Brewster</a> among them. McCay bets the group that in one month he can make 4000 drawings move. The group laughs and gestures that he is drunk or crazy. McCay sets to work in a studio where he directs workers to move around bundles of paper and barrels of ink. A month later, McCay gathers his colleagues in front of a film projector. McCay rapidly sketches characters from the cast of his "Little Nemo" comic strip.

McCay places a drawing of the character Flip in a wooden slot in front of the camera. The words "Watch me move" appear above Flip's head, and he begins to make gestures while smoking his cigar. Blocks fall from the sky and assemble themselves into the character Impie, and the pair's figures distort, disappear, and reappear, before a fantastically-dressed Little Nemo magically materializes. Nemo prevents the two others from fighting and takes control of their forms—he stretches and squashes them with the raising and lowering of his arms. Nemo then draws the Princess and brings her to animated life. He gives her a rose which has suddenly grown nearby, just as a gigantic dragon appears. The pair seat themselves on a throne in the dragon's mouth and wave to the audience as the dragon carries them away.

Flip and Impie attempt to follow the dragon in a <a href="Decrepit%20car">jalopy</a>, but the car explodes and sends them into the air. Doctor Pill arrives to help, but cannot find anyone until Flip and Impie land on him. The pair try to help the doctor to his feet when the animation freezes. The camera zooms out to reveal the serial number "No. 4000", and a thumb holding the drawing.

By late 1910, McCay had made the 4000 <a href="Rice%20paper">rice-paper</a> drawings for the animated portion of the film. Each was assigned a serial number, and marks were made in the top corners for <a href="Printing%20registration">registration</a>. They were mounted on sheets of cardboard to make them easier to handle and photograph. Before he had them photographed, he tested them on a hand-cranked <a href="Mutoscope">Mutoscope</a>-like machine to ensure the animation was fluid. Photography was done at the <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph Studios</a> under the supervision of Blackton. The animated portion took up about four minutes of the film's total length. In only one sequence did McCay use an <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Animation%20loops">animation loop</a> for a repeated action: he re-used a series of seven drawings six times (three forward, three back) to have Flip move his cigar up and down in his mouth three times. McCay made more extensive use of this technique in his later films.

McCay's drawings are in the heavily outlined <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style familiar to the readers of his comics. Its expressive <a href="character%20animation">character animation</a> differentiated "Little Nemo" from the films of Blackton and Cohl. There are no backgrounds; McCay's first film with backgrounds was 1914's "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>". McCay demonstrated his mastery of <a href="Perspective%20%28graphical%29">linear perspective</a> in scenes such as when the dragon disappears smoothly into the distance.

The film's positive reception motivated McCay to hand-color each of the 35mm frames of the originally black-and-white film. The dragon chariot that carries off Nemo and the Princess originally appeared in three episodes of "Little Nemo in Slumberland" in mid-1906.

Academic Mark Winokur noted racial hierarchies in the "Little Nemo" strip and film. The Anglo-Saxon Nemo is depicted as "most human", while the Irish Flip is drawn as a minstrel caricature, and the mute African Impie is most grotesquely caricatured. Nemo, at the top of this hierarchy, exerts his authority over the other characters, as when he distorts them with magic.

Distributed by Vitagraph, the film debuted in theaters on April 8, 1911. McCay included the film as part of his <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act beginning April 12. "Little Nemo" was popular with audiences and earned positive reviews. Film magazine "<a href="The%20Moving%20Picture%20World">The Moving Picture World</a>" called "Nemo" "an admirable piece of work ... one of those films which have a natural advertising heritage in the great and wide popularity of its subject—Little Nemo is known everywhere." "<a href="The%20Morning%20Telegraph">The Morning Telegraph</a>" called McCay's new film-enhanced act "even a greater go than his previous one", and put McCay on its "Blue List" of vaudeville "Actors and Acts of the Highest Ratings". In 1938 architect <a href="Claude%20Fayette%20Bragdon">Claude Bragdon</a> reminisced of the excitement he felt when he saw "Little Nemo", saying he "had witnessed the birth of a new art". "Nemo" appeared on stage and in theaters within the same week, but McCay postponed the theatrical releases of his next two films, "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>" (1912) and "Gertie the Dinosaur" (1914), for some time after he used them in his stage show.

Animation historian Giannalberto Bendazzi saw the transforming series of images in the plotless "Nemo" serving as little more than a demonstration of the animation medium's capabilities. Bendazzi wrote that McCay overcame this overt experimentalism in "How a Mosquito Operates".

McCay's working method was laborious, and animators developed a number of methods to reduce the workload and speed production to meet the demand for animated films. Within a few years of "Nemo"s release, Canadian <a href="Raoul%20Barr%C3%A9">Raoul Barré</a>'s registration pegs combined with American <a href="Earl%20Hurd">Earl Hurd</a>'s <a href="cel">cel</a> technology became near-universal methods in animation studios. In 1916, McCay himself adopted the cel method, beginning with his fourth film "<a href="The%20Sinking%20of%20the%20Lusitania">The Sinking of the Lusitania</a>" (1918).

In 2009, "Little Nemo" was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

2015 Formula One World Championship

The 2015 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 69th season of <a href="FIA">FIA</a> <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor racing. It featured the 2015 <a href="Formula%20One%20World%20Championship">Formula One World Championship</a>, a <a href="motor%20racing">motor racing</a> championship for <a href="Formula%20One%20cars">Formula One cars</a>, recognised by the sport's governing body, the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA), as the highest class of <a href="Formula%20racing">competition for open-wheel racing cars</a>. Twenty-two drivers representing ten teams contested nineteen <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20Grands%20Prix">Grands Prix</a>, starting in <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australia</a> on 15 March and ending in <a href="Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix">Abu Dhabi</a> on 29 November as they competed for the <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Drivers'</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Constructors%27%20Champions">World Constructors'</a> championships.

<a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> was the defending Drivers' Champion after securing his second title at the <a href="2014%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a>. His team, <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20in%20Formula%20One">Mercedes</a>, began the season as the defending Constructors' Champion, having clinched its first championship title at the <a href="2014%20Russian%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Russian Grand Prix</a>.

The calendar featured two significant changes from the season. The first was the return of the <a href="Mexican%20Grand%20Prix">Mexican Grand Prix</a>, held for the first time since . The other change was the cancellation of the <a href="German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> after a venue could not be agreed upon, leaving the nation without a World Championship event for the first time in fifty-five years.

Hamilton secured his third Drivers' Championship with three races left in the season. The runner-up was his teammate <a href="Nico%20Rosberg">Nico Rosberg</a>, 59 points behind, with <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a>'s <a href="Sebastian%20Vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> third, another 44 points adrift. Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team clinched the 2015 Constructors' Championship at the <a href="2015%20Russian%20Grand%20Prix">Russian Grand Prix</a>, ahead of Ferrari and <a href="Williams%20Grand%20Prix%20Engineering">Williams</a>, and ended the season with a record 703 points. Hamilton also won the <a href="FIA%20Pole%20Trophy">FIA Pole Trophy</a> with a total of 11 pole positions in the season and the <a href="DHL%20Fastest%20Lap%20Award">DHL Fastest Lap Award</a>. Ferrari won the inaugural <a href="DHL%20Fastest%20Pit%20Stop%20Award">DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award</a>.

The following teams and drivers took part in the 2015 Formula One World Championship. Teams competed with tyres supplied by <a href="Pirelli">Pirelli</a>.

Several team changes took place before the season began. Both <a href="McLaren">McLaren</a> and <a href="Lotus%20F1">Lotus</a> changed engine suppliers for the 2015 season. McLaren ended their 20-year partnership with <a href="Mercedes%20AMG%20High%20Performance%20Powertrains">Mercedes-Benz</a>, in favour of a return to <a href="Honda%20in%20Formula%20One">Honda</a>, who had previously supplied them from until 1992. Honda had been absent for seven years: they had provided <a href="British%20American%20Racing">British American Racing</a> and <a href="Jordan%20Grand%20Prix">Jordan Grand Prix</a> with engines until they purchased the former in and then had competed as a constructor until .

Lotus ended its association with <a href="Renault%20in%20Formula%20One">Renault</a> in favour of a deal with Mercedes. This ended a 20-year involvement of Renault with the <a href="Enstone">Enstone</a>-based team, (which operated as <a href="Benetton%20Formula">Benetton</a> from 1992 until 2001, as <a href="Renault%20in%20Formula%20One%23Renault%20F1%20Team%20%282002%E2%80%932010%29">Renault</a> from 2002 until 2011 and as <a href="Lotus%20F1">Lotus</a> from 2012 until 2015) after being an engine supplier to Benetton since , and being the owner of the team from to .

Both <a href="Caterham%20F1">Caterham F1</a> and <a href="Marussia%20F1">Marussia</a> went into <a href="administration%20%28law%29">administration</a> towards the end of the 2014 season. The latter was saved narrowly from liquidation in February 2015, re-entering as Manor Marussia, when new investment was secured and the team left administration after an agreement with creditors was reached. Caterham ultimately folded and its assets were auctioned off by company administrators after the start of the season.

The driver line-ups saw a couple of changes prior to the 2015 season and one more prior to the Singapore Grand Prix. <a href="Fernando%20Alonso">Fernando Alonso</a> replaced <a href="Kevin%20Magnussen">Kevin Magnussen</a> at McLaren, returning to the team after he last raced for them in . Following an accident during pre-season testing, Alonso withdrew from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, and Magnussen returned as his temporary replacement. Sebastian Vettel left <a href="Red%20Bull%20Racing">Red Bull Racing</a> at the end of the 2014 season after five years with the team and nine years with its wider <a href="Red%20Bull%20Junior%20Team">junior development programme</a> to join Ferrari in place of Alonso. <a href="Daniil%20Kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a> was promoted to Red Bull from <a href="Scuderia%20Toro%20Rosso">Toro Rosso</a> to fill the vacated seat.

Toro Rosso changed their entire line-up: along with Kvyat joining Red Bull, the team chose not to renew <a href="Jean-%C3%89ric%20Vergne">Jean-Éric Vergne</a>'s contract. Vergne went on to compete in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Formula%20E%20season">Formula E Championship</a> while also becoming a Ferrari development driver. They were replaced by the <a href="2014%20Formula%20Renault%203.5%20Series">2014 Formula Renault 3.5 Series</a> champion <a href="Carlos%20Sainz%20Jr.">Carlos Sainz Jr.</a> and the <a href="2014%20FIA%20Formula%203%20European%20Championship">2014 FIA Formula 3 European Championship</a> third-place finisher <a href="Max%20Verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>. The latter became the youngest driver to make a Formula One début, at the age of 17 years, 164 days when he started the season.

<a href="Esteban%20Guti%C3%A9rrez">Esteban Gutiérrez</a> and <a href="Adrian%20Sutil">Adrian Sutil</a> were released from <a href="Sauber">Sauber</a>, where they were replaced by the former Caterham driver <a href="Marcus%20Ericsson">Marcus Ericsson</a> and the <a href="GP2%20Series">GP2</a> driver <a href="Felipe%20Nasr">Felipe Nasr</a>. Gutiérrez and Sutil went on to join Ferrari and Williams respectively as reserve drivers.

Manor Marussia also had two new drivers: They employed the former Caterham driver <a href="Will%20Stevens">Will Stevens</a> to drive for his first full season in the sport, while another former Caterham test driver, <a href="Roberto%20Merhi">Roberto Merhi</a>, was signed to a short-term deal while he also drove in the <a href="2015%20Formula%20Renault%203.5%20Series">Formula Renault 3.5 Series</a>. <a href="Max%20Chilton">Max Chilton</a> relinquished his seat, joining the <a href="2015%20Indy%20Lights%20season">Indy Lights</a> championship, while <a href="Jules%20Bianchi">Jules Bianchi</a> was in a coma at the start of the season and ultimately <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20fatalities">died from injuries</a> sustained at the <a href="2014%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Japanese Grand Prix</a>. <a href="Alexander%20Rossi">Alexander Rossi</a> was later drafted in by Manor Marussia to make his Formula One début at the <a href="2015%20Singapore%20Grand%20Prix">Singapore Grand Prix</a>, replacing Merhi. The Spaniard returned to the team for the <a href="2015%20Russian%20Grand%20Prix">Russian</a> and <a href="2015%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix">Abu Dhabi</a> Grands Prix, sharing the car with Rossi for the remainder of the season.

<a href="Kamui%20Kobayashi">Kamui Kobayashi</a> went on to race in the <a href="2015%20Super%20Formula%20season">Super Formula</a> series in Japan after the folding of Caterham left him without a drive in Formula One.

The following nineteen Grands Prix took place in 2015:

There were a few revisions to the calendar from the previous season. The Mexican Grand Prix returned to the Formula One calendar for the first time since 1992. The race was held at the <a href="Aut%C3%B3dromo%20Hermanos%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez</a> circuit located in the centre of <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, which was the location of all Mexican Grands Prix in previous decades. The circuit was substantially reconfigured to accommodate the sport's return.

The <a href="Grand%20Prix%20of%20America">Grand Prix of America</a> and the <a href="Indian%20Grand%20Prix">Indian Grand Prix</a> were both contracted but did not feature on the calendar. The former originally aimed for a debut in at the <a href="Port%20Imperial%20Street%20Circuit">Port Imperial Street Circuit</a> in New Jersey after a 15-year contract was signed, but was delayed for a third straight year, while the latter was cancelled for the second consecutive year due to an unresolved tax case in the Bombay High Court.

The German and <a href="Korean%20Grand%20Prix">Korean</a> Grands Prix were both included on the provisional calendar. The former was set to return to the <a href="N%C3%BCrburgring">Nürburgring</a>, in accordance with the event-sharing agreement established between the Nürburgring and the <a href="Hockenheimring">Hockenheimring</a> in 2008. The Nürburgring had previously hosted the race in 2013 and so was scheduled to host it again in 2015, but the venue was left off the provisional calendar, leaving the event-sharing agreement at a stalemate. With both venues unwilling to host the event, the race was ultimately cancelled, leaving the country off the Grand Prix calendar for the first time since . The <a href="Korean%20Grand%20Prix">Korean Grand Prix</a> was scheduled to return to the Formula One calendar after being removed in 2014, but the plan was ultimately abandoned.

The number of power units that a driver could use in a season was reduced from five in 2014 to four in 2015. This was tweaked after the 2015 British Grand Prix, with new power unit manufacturers being allowed one other power unit in their first season of competition; the only manufacturer affected in the 2015 season was Honda, who were allowed to take advantage of the rule even though it had been introduced after the season had begun. The rules regarding engine development that were introduced for the previous season were changed as well, with the manufacturers allowed to perform half the development permitted in 2014.

Following the backlash over "ugly" nose designs in 2014, the FIA moved to amend the rules surrounding nose designs for the 2015 season. Noses were lower than in 2014, retaining a minimum cross section, but they had to taper to a point at a fixed linear rate, effectively outlawing the dramatic finger shapes seen in 2014 in favour of a more gradual shape. Furthermore, the design of the nose had to be symmetrical and consistent with the centreline of the car, thereby banning the more exotic designs, such as the "twin-tusk" approach used by Lotus on the <a href="Lotus%20E22">E22</a> chassis.

The minimum weight of the cars at all times during an event was increased to , a difference of from 2014, addressing concerns raised the year before that the lighter weight limit forced taller drivers to become unhealthily slim. The ban on front-and-rear interconnected suspension systems (FRIC) that had been implemented in the middle of the 2014 season was formalised, with the regulations stating that the front and rear suspension had to be designed in such a way that any change in performance had to be a direct result of a change in load applied solely to them. The anti-intrusion panels on both sides of the survival cell were extended upwards to the rim of the cockpit and alongside the driver's head in order to improve the drivers' safety in event of a side impact. Titanium skid blocks on the underside of the car were made mandatory for the 2015 season, which led to a return of sparks being created by the cars as the underbody touched the track.

Several rules regarding penalties were changed for the 2015 season. The replacement of a complete power unit, exceeding the maximum number allowed per season, no longer resulted in a penalty in itself. Penalties continued to be applied cumulatively for the replacement of individual components of the power unit, and if such a <a href="Glossary%20of%20motorsport%20terms%23G">grid</a> place penalty was imposed and the driver's starting position was such that it could not be applied in full, the remainder of the penalty was no longer carried over to the next race, but was instead applied in the form of a time penalty during the race corresponding to the number of grid spaces remaining in the penalty. This was tweaked after the 2015 British Grand Prix with immediate effect, to make demotion to the back of the grid the maximum penalty for engine changes. Additional time penalties to be served during the race were abandoned.

As well as the existing five-second penalty that could be served during a driver's scheduled pit stop, a new ten-second penalty was introduced, to be served in the same manner. If a car was deemed to have been released from a pit stop in an unsafe manner, the driver would receive a ten-second stop-and-go penalty. Further penalties could be applied if the stewards believed that the driver was aware of this and attempted to drive the car regardless. If any team personnel or team equipment remained on the grid after the fifteen-second signal had been shown before the start of the <a href="Parade%20lap">formation lap,</a> the driver of the car concerned would have had to start the race from the pit <a href="Pit%20stop">lane</a>. If the driver concerned failed to obey this, they would have received a ten-second stop-and-go penalty.

The rules regarding qualifying and the start times of some races were tweaked. The qualifying procedure was further clarified to cater to different sizes of starting grids: if twenty-four cars were entered for the race, seven would have been eliminated after each of the first two qualifying segments; if twenty-two were entered, six would have been eliminated after each qualifying segment and so on if fewer cars were eligible. In light of a regulation introduced in 2014 dictating that a race could not run for more than four hours and following recommendations from the report into Jules Bianchi's accident the previous season, the start times of five Grands Prix were moved forward by an hour, so that races did not start with less than four hours until dusk. Thus, the Australian, <a href="Malaysian%20Grand%20Prix">Malaysia</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Grand%20Prix">Chinese</a>, <a href="Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japanese</a> and <a href="Russian%20Grand%20Prix">Russian Grands Prix</a> started an hour earlier than in 2014.

There were other changes introduced in a bid to further increase the safety of the sport. In the aftermath of Bianchi's accident, a new procedure called the <a href="Safety%20car%23Virtual%20Safety%20Car%20.28VSC.29">Virtual Safety Car</a> (VSC) was introduced following trials during the last three Grands Prix of 2014. The procedure could be initiated when double waved yellow flags were needed on any section of a circuit where competitors and officials were in danger, but the circumstances did not warrant deployment of the actual <a href="Safety%20car%23Formula%20One">safety car</a>. It obliged drivers to reduce their speed to match one indicated on the displays on their steering wheels. The safety car procedure was amended as well: once the last lapped car had passed the leader, the safety car returned to the pit lane at the end of the following lap. This was a change of the previous practice which required the unlapped cars to have caught up with the back of the pack before the safety car could return to the pit lane.

If a race were suspended (red-flagged), the cars would no longer have lined up on the grid but instead would have slowly proceeded to the pit lane. The pit exit would have been closed and the first car to arrive in the pit lane would have proceeded to the exit with the others lining up behind in the order in which they arrived, regardless of race standing or garage location. Severe circumstances could still have required cars to stop immediately on track.

Beginning with the Belgian Grand Prix, radio communication from engineers to drivers pertaining to race starts, such as recommended torque map settings for optimal acceleration, was no longer allowed. This restriction added to the partial radio ban implemented at the end of the previous season. Drivers were also no longer permitted to change the design of their helmet in-season.

<a href="Lewis%20Hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> was the defending Drivers' Champion after securing his second title at the <a href="2014%20Abu%20Dhabi%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a>. His team, <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20in%20Formula%20One">Mercedes</a>, began the season as the defending Constructors' Champion, having clinched its first championship title at the <a href="2014%20Russian%20Grand%20Prix">2014 Russian Grand Prix</a>.

Before the start of the season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1 for 2015, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead race with his career number 44. It was the first season since , when <a href="Alain%20Prost">Alain Prost</a> retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in , that the field did not contain a number 1 car.

Following the financial struggles faced by Marussia and Caterham in 2014, the FIA approved the use of 2014-specification chassis in 2015 provided that teams showed cause and received an individual dispensation to compete with their old chassis. A request by Manor Marussia to use their <a href="Marussia%20MR03">2014 car</a> was rejected by the other teams. Subsequent regulation changes allowed the team to use a modified 2014 chassis which met updated safety and dimensional limits. <a href="Marussia%20MR03%23MR03B">The car</a> was powered by a 2014 specification Ferrari power unit, with a new chassis to be introduced later in the season. However, following the twelfth round, Manor Marussia elected to abandon those plans in favour of developing the car for the following season.

McLaren's Fernando Alonso was involved in a pre-season testing accident that saw the two-time World Drivers' Champion hospitalised. McLaren claimed the crash was caused by a sudden gust of wind disrupting the car's downforce, while Alonso insisted the crash was caused by his steering wheel locking up. On physicians' advice, Alonso elected to sit out the opening round in Australia, prompting the team to replace him with Kevin Magnussen for the race. Alonso was cleared to race by the second round in <a href="2015%20Malaysian%20Grand%20Prix">Malaysia</a>.

Mercedes began the season with a one–two finish in Australia, resulting in a twenty-eight-point lead after just one round. They finished over thirty seconds clear of Sebastian Vettel, who finished third and secured a podium finish in his first race with Ferrari. Red Bull's <a href="Daniel%20Ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> finished a lap down in sixth, prompting the team to continue to voice their frustrations with Renault, as they were forced to use its second of four allotted power units for Ricciardo on the very first day of the season. The team also voiced its displeasure over the progress Renault had made in terms of power, with the team principal, <a href="Christian%20Horner">Christian Horner</a>, stating that the Energy F1-2015 was still down on Mercedes's PU106B Hybrid. After the race, the Red Bull team advisor <a href="Helmut%20Marko">Helmut Marko</a> suggested that Red Bull might exit Formula One entirely if changes to the regulations were not made to level the field or cut development costs. Renault countered with their own threat to pull out of Formula One as an engine supplier if its reputation continued to be damaged or if its participation was otherwise not profitable to the company. Mercedes followed up by finishing second and third in Malaysia, while Red Bull continued to struggle, rounding out the top ten a lap down. After four rounds, Mercedes led the field, having earned 159 points (with Lewis Hamilton acquiring 93 out of 100 possible points), while Red Bull's struggles continued. The team acquired twenty-six points, enough for a distant fourth, and Ricciardo entered the European stages of the season on his fourth and final permissible power unit with fifteen events remaining on the calendar.

With McLaren's longest continuous testing session lasting twelve laps in <a href="Circuit%20de%20Barcelona-Catalunya">Barcelona</a> – a total of , a sixth of a total Grand Prix distance – before running into engine trouble, Honda elected to detune the power units for the opening Grands Prix in an effort to improve reliability and longevity while the manufacturer worked to improve these areas before <a href="Homologation%20%28motorsport%29">homologation</a>. After both cars qualified on the back row, Kevin Magnussen failed to reach the grid after suffering an abrupt engine failure while on his way from the pit lane to the grid. <a href="Jenson%20Button">Jenson Button</a> managed to finish the race, albeit in the last classified position, two laps behind the leaders. Magnussen relinquished his seat back to Alonso in Malaysia; both cars qualified ahead of only the Manor Marussia cars and eventually retired. The team showed signs of improvement in terms of performance and was able to compete with the midfield cars in <a href="2015%20Chinese%20Grand%20Prix">China</a> and <a href="2015%20Bahrain%20Grand%20Prix">Bahrain</a>, although reliability continued to prove troublesome as Button's car was unable to compete in the latter Grand Prix.

Following a tumultuous pre-season in which they went through a period of administration and were saved by late investment, Manor Marussia arrived in Melbourne with a car that had passed its mandatory crash tests but had completed no testing. After the team's arrival in Australia, while assembling the cars, it was discovered that their computers had been wiped completely clean of all data in preparation for auction, and they ultimately could not compete in the Grand Prix. The team managed to get their cars running and on the racetrack by the second round in Malaysia, and were able to set times within <a href="107%25%20rule">107%</a> of the leading times in practice, giving stewards reasonable grounds to allow the team to race when they failed to do so in qualifying. Merhi was able to finish the race three laps down in fifteenth, while Stevens did not start. Manor Marussia continued to show signs of consistency, with both cars qualifying within 107%, starting, and finishing both Grands Prix in China and Bahrain. They were one of two teams, the other being McLaren, to return to Europe without a championship point.

Ferrari came into the season seemingly much more competitive than the previous season, finishing on the podium in the opening race. <a href="Kimi%20R%C3%A4ikk%C3%B6nen">Kimi Räikkönen</a> stated that the <a href="Ferrari%20SF15-T">SF15-T</a> was "much better" to drive than 2014's <a href="Ferrari%20F14%20T">F14 T</a>. In Malaysia, Vettel won comfortably and Räikkönen finished in fourth, despite suffering a tyre failure. The team then finished third and fourth in China and Räikkönen secured his first podium appearance since rejoining Ferrari the previous season with a second-place finish in Bahrain. With 107 points, the team returned to Europe 52 points behind Mercedes, and 46 points ahead of Williams, who were third. Sauber left the opening rounds with their first points since .

Mercedes arrived at <a href="2015%20Spanish%20Grand%20Prix">Spain</a> already with a comfortable lead. Lewis Hamilton had scored ninety-three points out of a possible one hundred, giving him a twenty-seven-point lead over his teammate Nico Rosberg entering the eight-race European portion of the season.

Rosberg quickly cut into Hamilton's championship lead by securing victories in Spain (reducing his deficit to twenty points) and <a href="2015%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco</a>. The latter win was aided by the result of a costly miscalculation by the Mercedes team to pit Hamilton with a 19-second lead during a safety car period (that briefly saw the use of the "Virtual Safety Car" for the first time in F1's history) with 14 laps remaining. Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel did not make pit stops, allowing both to narrowly pass Hamilton by the pit lane exit. Racing resumed on lap seventy-one and Rosberg quickly pulled away, remaining in the lead till the chequered flag. Vettel held off Hamilton for second and third, respectively. As a result, Hamilton's lead over Rosberg in the Drivers' Championship was cut in half, to just ten points. Meanwhile, Button secured McLaren's first points of the season by finishing eighth. This left the Marussia drivers of Stevens and Merhi, along with the other McLaren driver, Fernando Alonso, as the only full-time drivers not to score a point after seven rounds.

At the following Grands Prix in <a href="2015%20Canadian%20Grand%20Prix">Canada</a>, <a href="2015%20Austrian%20Grand%20Prix">Austria</a>, and <a href="2015%20British%20Grand%20Prix">Britain</a>, Mercedes put to rest the criticism following the result in Monaco through finishing first and second in the next three races, extending their championship lead to 160 points over Ferrari. Williams collected their first two podiums of the season in the form of third-place results by <a href="Valtteri%20Bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> in Canada and <a href="Felipe%20Massa">Felipe Massa</a> in Austria, while Ferrari lost ground to Mercedes following a retirement in Austria and an eighth-place finish in Britain by Räikkönen. Other power unit manufacturers continued to struggle, with a Renault-powered car finishing in the top five only once, in Monaco, indicating their continued lack of power. Honda continued to have reliability issues and, up to the British Grand Prix, suffered nine retirements and two failures to start due to power unit problems, translating to only seven overall finishes out of 18 possible results.

The Drivers' Championship remained closely contested between leader Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, with the gap between them never larger than twenty-eight points after Hamilton's victory in round eleven in <a href="2015%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgium</a>. The two would trade victories between rounds six and nine, closing the gap to as little as ten points. Sebastian Vettel, who at one time was within three points of the lead, after his victory in Malaysia, and who was the only non-Mercedes winner after eleven rounds, could not overcome team errors in Canada and Austria, and fell fifty-nine points off the pace of Hamilton after round nine. He rebounded in <a href="2015%20Hungarian%20Grand%20Prix">Hungary</a> by winning his second race of the season, reducing the gap to Hamilton to forty-two points in the process, but fell out of a point-scoring position in Belgium after a tyre failure on the penultimate lap, dropping him to sixty-seven points behind the leader.

Hamilton closed out the European portion of the season with his seventh victory of the season in <a href="2015%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italy</a>. With Rosberg's retirement at the event, Hamilton entered the closing rounds of the season with a lead of fifty-three points over his teammate in the Drivers' Championship standings, the largest gap of the season at that point, while Vettel sat a further twenty-one points behind. Hamilton's tenth pole position in Belgium assured him of victory in the FIA Pole Trophy, the award for the driver who achieves the most pole positions during the season. Mercedes had built up a 181-point lead over Ferrari in the Constructors' Championship, with Williams in third, 263 points behind the leaders. After twelve rounds, half of the teams had been represented on the podium, while nine out of ten had scored points.

Shortly before the <a href="2015%20Singapore%20Grand%20Prix">thirteenth round in Singapore</a>, Manor Marussia announced that the American GP2 driver Alexander Rossi would race for the team, replacing Merhi in five of the final seven rounds, while Merhi was retained for the remaining two. Vettel won his third victory of the season in Singapore, closing his gap to Nico Rosberg in second place to just eight points.

Rosberg could not close the gap to Hamilton in <a href="2015%20Japanese%20Grand%20Prix">Japan</a> or Russia; despite winning pole position in both races, his leads were short-lived. He was passed by Hamilton on the opening corner in Japan and retired on lap seven in Russia. Vettel capitalised on the results with third and second-place finishes respectively, to take second place in the Drivers' Championship from Rosberg with four rounds remaining, while Hamilton extended his lead to sixty-six points, the highest lead he had held in the season. A victory in <a href="2015%20United%20States%20Grand%20Prix">the United States</a>, with Rosberg and Vettel finishing second and third respectively, secured the third Drivers' Championship for Hamilton with three races left to run. Rosberg won the final three races in <a href="2015%20Mexican%20Grand%20Prix">Mexico</a>, <a href="2015%20Brazilian%20Grand%20Prix">Brazil</a>, and Abu Dhabi to reclaim second in the Drivers' Championship from Vettel, while Hamilton secured the Fastest Lap Award in Brazil.

Lewis Hamilton ended the season winning not only the championship, but also the FIA Pole Trophy for most pole positions of the season and the DHL Fastest Lap Award. Ferrari won the inaugural DHL Pit Stop Award, posting the fastest pit stop time at seven of the first eighteen races of the season. Both Hamilton and Mercedes collected their championship trophies at a gala held in Paris on 4 December 2015. Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen collected three post-season awards for Rookie of the Year, Personality of the Year and Action of the Year (for his overtake on Felipe Nasr through <a href="Circuit%20de%20Spa-Francorchamps%23Blanchimont">Blanchimont corner</a> at the Belgian Grand Prix).

Sauber's early season preparations were disrupted by a series of legal challenges from the former Caterham driver <a href="Giedo%20van%20der%20Garde">Giedo van der Garde</a>, who claimed that the team had reneged on a contract to race that was signed in June 2014. Van der Garde filed a motion with the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Victoria">Supreme Court of Victoria</a> in Australia in an effort to force the team to replace one of their drivers with him at the opening round in Melbourne, with the court finding in his favour. Van der Garde later agreed not to participate in the event, with the driver and team settling the dispute for an undisclosed sum and terminating the contract following the first round.

Lotus suffered financially throughout the season, culminating in <a href="Pirelli">Pirelli</a> withholding their tyres for the Friday practice sessions in Hungary. Before the Belgian Grand Prix, amid negotiations with Renault for a potential takeover, the former Lotus reserve driver <a href="Charles%20Pic">Charles Pic</a> initiated legal action against Lotus alleging lack of seat time in 2014, resulting in breach of contract. Belgian authorities later moved to impound the assets of Lotus for four days following Grosjean's podium finish. After talks between the FIA and Lotus, the team was allowed to leave Spa with their equipment and cars, and was able to start the following race in Italy.

Points were awarded to the top ten classified finishers in every race, using the following structure:

In the event of a tie, a count-back system was used as a tie-breaker, with a driver's best result used to decide the standings.

Notes:

Constructors' Championship points were awarded as per the Drivers' Championship with the results of both cars taken into account. In the event of a tie, a count-back system was used as a tie-breaker, with a constructor's best result used to decide the standings.

Planar transmission line

Planar transmission lines are <a href="transmission%20line">transmission line</a>s with <a href="electrical%20conductor">conductors</a>, or in some cases <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a> (insulating) strips, that are flat, ribbon-shaped lines. They are used to interconnect components on <a href="printed%20circuit">printed circuit</a>s and <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>s working at <a href="microwave">microwave</a> frequencies because the planar type fits in well with the manufacturing methods for these components. Transmission lines are more than simply <a href="electrical%20cable">interconnections</a>. With simple interconnections, the propagation of the <a href="electromagnetic%20wave">electromagnetic wave</a> along the wire is fast enough to be considered instantaneous, and the <a href="voltage">voltage</a>s at each end of the wire can be considered identical. If the wire is longer than a large fraction of a <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> (one tenth is often used as a rule of thumb), these assumptions are no longer true and <a href="Telegrapher%27s%20equations">transmission line theory</a> must be used instead. With transmission lines, the geometry of the line is precisely controlled (in most cases, the cross-section is kept constant along the length) so that its electrical behaviour is highly predictable. At lower frequencies, these considerations are only necessary for the cables connecting different pieces of equipment, but at microwave frequencies the distance at which transmission line theory becomes necessary is measured in millimetres. Hence, transmission lines are needed "within" circuits.

The earliest type of planar transmission line was conceived during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> by Robert M. Barrett. It is known as <a href="stripline">stripline</a>, and is one of the four main types in modern use, along with <a href="microstrip">microstrip</a>, <a href="suspended%20stripline">suspended stripline</a>, and <a href="coplanar%20waveguide">coplanar waveguide</a>. All four of these types consist of a pair of conductors (although in three of them, one of these conductors is the <a href="ground%20plane">ground plane</a>). Consequently, they have a dominant mode of transmission (the <a href="normal%20mode">mode</a> is the <a href="field%20pattern">field pattern</a> of the electromagnetic wave) that is identical, or near-identical, to the mode found in a pair of wires. Other planar types of transmission line, such as <a href="slotline">slotline</a>, <a href="finline">finline</a>, and <a href="imageline">imageline</a>, transmit along a strip of dielectric, and <a href="substrate%20integrated%20waveguide">substrate integrated waveguide</a> forms a dielectric waveguide within the <a href="Substrate%20%28electronics%29">substrate</a> with rows of posts. These types cannot support the same mode as a pair of wires, and consequently they have different transmission properties. Many of these types have a narrower <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> and in general produce more signal distortion than pairs of conductors. Their advantages depend on the exact types being compared, but can include low <a href="insertion%20loss">loss</a> and a better range of <a href="characteristic%20impedance">characteristic impedance</a>.

Planar transmission lines can be used for constructing components as well as interconnecting them. At microwave frequencies it is often the case that individual components in a circuit are themselves larger than a significant fraction of a wavelength. This means they can no longer be treated as <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped components</a>, that is, treated as if they existed at a single point. Lumped <a href="passive%20component">passive component</a>s are often impractical at microwave frequencies, either for this reason, or because the values required are impractically small to manufacture. A pattern of transmission lines can be used for the same function as these components. Whole circuits, called <a href="distributed%20element%20circuit">distributed element circuit</a>s, can be built this way. The method is often used for <a href="distributed%20element%20filter">filters</a>. This method is particularly appealing for use with printed and integrated circuits because these structures can be manufactured with the same processes as the rest of the assembly simply by applying patterns to the existing substrate. This gives the planar technologies a big economic advantage over other types, such as <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial line</a>.

Some authors make a distinction between "transmission line", a line that uses a pair of conductors, and "waveguide", a line that either does not use conductors at all, or just uses one conductor to constrain the wave in the dielectric. Others use the terms synonymously. This article includes both kinds, so long as they are in a planar form. Names used are the common ones and do not necessarily indicate the number of conductors. The term "waveguide" when used unadorned, means the hollow, or dielectric filled, metal kind of <a href="Waveguide%20%28electromagnetism%29">waveguide</a>, which is not a planar form.

Planar <a href="transmission%20line">transmission line</a>s are those transmission lines in which the conductors are essentially flat. The conductors consist of flat strips, and there are usually one or more <a href="ground%20plane">ground plane</a>s parallel to the flat surface of the conductors. The conductors are separated from the ground planes, sometimes with air between them but more often with a solid <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a> material. Transmission lines can also be constructed in non-planar formats such as wires or <a href="coaxial%20cable">coaxial line</a>. As well as interconnections, there are a wide range of circuits that can be implemented in transmission lines. These include <a href="distributed%20element%20filter">filters</a>, <a href="power%20dividers%20and%20directional%20couplers">power dividers, directional couplers</a>, <a href="impedance%20matching">impedance matching</a> networks, and <a href="Choke%20%28electronics%29">choke</a> circuits to deliver <a href="biasing">biasing</a> to active components. The principal advantage of the planar types is that they can be manufactured using the same processes used to make <a href="printed%20circuit">printed circuit</a>s and <a href="integrated%20circuit">integrated circuit</a>s, particularly through the <a href="photolithography">photolithography</a> process. The planar technologies are thus particularly well suited to mass production of such components.

Making circuit elements out of transmission lines is most useful at <a href="microwave">microwave</a> frequencies. At lower frequencies the longer <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> makes these components too bulky. At the higher microwave frequencies planar transmission line types are generally too <a href="Insertion%20loss">lossy</a> and <a href="waveguide">waveguide</a> is used instead. Waveguide, however, is bulkier and more expensive to manufacture. At still higher frequencies <a href="dielectric%20waveguide">dielectric waveguide</a> (such as <a href="optical%20fibre">optical fibre</a>) becomes the technology of choice, but there are planar types of dielectric waveguide available. The most widely used planar transmission lines (of any kind) are <a href="stripline">stripline</a>, <a href="microstrip">microstrip</a>, <a href="suspended%20stripline">suspended stripline</a>, and <a href="coplanar%20waveguide">coplanar waveguide</a>.

An important parameter for transmission lines is the <a href="normal%20mode">mode</a> of transmission employed. The mode describes the electromagnetic <a href="field%20pattern">field pattern</a>s caused by the geometry of the transmission structure. It is possible for more than one mode to exist simultaneously on the same line. Usually, steps are taken to suppress all modes except the desired one. But some devices, such as the <a href="dual-mode%20filter">dual-mode filter</a>, rely on the transmission of more than one mode.

The mode found on ordinary conductive wires and cables is the transverse electromagnetic mode (<a href="TEM%20mode">TEM mode</a>). This is also the dominant mode on some planar transmission lines. In the TEM mode, the <a href="field%20strength">field strength</a> vectors for the <a href="electric%20field">electric</a> and <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> are both transverse to the direction of travel of the wave and <a href="orthogonal">orthogonal</a> to each other. An important property of the TEM mode is that it can be used at low frequencies, all the way down to zero (i.e. <a href="direct%20current">DC</a>).

Another feature of the TEM mode is that on an ideal transmission line (one that meets the <a href="Heaviside%20condition">Heaviside condition</a>) there is no change of line transmission parameters (<a href="characteristic%20impedance">characteristic impedance</a> and signal <a href="group%20velocity">group velocity</a>) with the frequency of transmission. Because of this, ideal TEM transmission lines do not suffer from <a href="Dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a>, a form of distortion in which different frequency components travel at different velocities. Dispersion "smears out" the wave shape (which may represent the transmitted information) in the direction of the line length. All other modes suffer from dispersion, which puts a limit on the <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> achievable.

Some planar types, notably microstrip, do not have a homogeneous dielectric; it is different above and below the line. Such geometries cannot support a true TEM mode; there is some component of the <a href="electromagnetic%20field">electromagnetic field</a> parallel to the direction of the line, although the transmission can be "nearly" TEM. Such a mode is referred to as quasi-TEM. In a TEM line, discontinuities such as gaps and posts (used to construct filters and other devices) have an <a href="electrical%20impedance">impedance</a> that is purely <a href="electrical%20reactance">reactive</a>: they can store energy, but do not dissipate it. In most quasi-TEM lines, these structures additionally have a <a href="electrical%20resistance">resistive</a> component to the impedance. This resistance is a result of <a href="Electromagnetic%20radiation">radiation</a> from the structure and causes the circuit to be lossy. The same problem occurs at bends and corners of the line. These problems can be mitigated by using a high <a href="permittivity">permittivity</a> material as the <a href="Substrate%20%28electronics%29">substrate</a>, which causes a higher proportion of the wave to be contained in the dielectric, making for a more homogeneous transmission medium and a mode closer to TEM.

In hollow metal waveguides and <a href="optical%20waveguide">optical waveguide</a>s there are an unlimited number of other <a href="transverse%20mode">transverse mode</a>s that can occur. However, the TEM mode cannot be supported since it requires two or more separate <a href="electrical%20conductor">conductors</a> to propagate. The transverse modes are classified as either "transverse electric" (TE, or H modes) or "transverse magnetic" (TM, or E modes) according to whether, respectively, all of the electric field, or all of the magnetic field is transverse. There is always a longitudinal component of one field or the other. The exact mode is identified by a pair of indices counting the number of wavelengths or half-wavelengths along specified transverse dimensions. These indices are usually written without a separator: for instance, TE. The exact definition depends on whether the waveguide is rectangular, circular, or elliptical. For <a href="microwave%20cavity">waveguide resonators</a> a third index is introduced to the mode for half-wavelengths in the longitudinal direction.

A feature of TE and TM modes is that there is a definite <a href="cutoff%20frequency">cutoff frequency</a> below which transmission will not take place. The cutoff frequency depends on mode and the mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is called the "dominant mode". Multi-mode propagation is generally undesirable. Because of this, circuits are often designed to operate in the dominant mode at frequencies below the cutoff of the next highest mode. Only one mode, the dominant mode, can exist in this band.

Some planar types that are designed to operate as TEM devices can also support TE and TM modes unless steps are taken to suppress them. The ground planes or shielding enclosures can behave as hollow waveguides and propagate these modes. Suppression can take the form of shorting screws between the ground planes or designing the enclosure to be too small to support frequencies as low as the operational frequencies of the circuit. Similarly, coaxial cable can support circular TE and TM modes that do not require the centre conductor to propagate, and these modes can be suppressed by reducing the diameter of the cable.

Some transmission line structures are unable to support a pure TE or TM mode, but can support modes that are a <a href="superposition%20principle">linear superposition</a> of TE and TM modes. In other words, they have a longitudinal component of both electric and magnetic field. Such modes are called hybrid electromagnetic (HEM) modes. A subset of the HEM modes is the longitudinal-section modes. These come in two varieties; longitudinal-section electric (LSE) modes and longitudinal-section magnetic (LSM) modes. LSE modes have an electric field that is zero in one transverse direction, and LSM modes have a magnetic field that is zero in one transverse direction. LSE and LSM modes can occur in planar transmission line types with non-homogeneous transmission media. Structures that are unable to support a pure TE or TM mode, if they are able to support transmissions at all, must necessarily do so with a hybrid mode.

The <a href="characteristic%20impedance">characteristic impedance</a> of a line is the impedance encountered by a wave travelling along the line; it depends only on the line geometry and materials and is not changed by the line termination. It is necessary to match the characteristic impedance of the planar line to the impedance of the systems to which it is connected. Many filter designs require lines with a number of different characteristic impedances, so it is an advantage for a technology to have a good range of achievable impedances. Narrow lines have a higher impedance than broad lines. The highest impedance achievable is limited by the resolution of the manufacturing process which imposes a limit on how narrow the lines can be made. The lower limit is determined by the width of line at which unwanted transverse resonance modes might arise.

<a href="Q%20factor">"Q" factor</a> (or just "Q") is the ratio of energy stored to energy dissipated per cycle. It is the main parameter characterising the quality of <a href="resonator">resonator</a>s. In transmission line circuits, resonators are frequently constructed of transmission line sections to build filters and other devices. Their "Q" factor limits the steepness of the filter <a href="skirt%20%28filtering%29">skirts</a> and its <a href="selectivity%20%28electronic%29">selectivity</a>. The main factors determining "Q" of a planar type are the permittivity of the dielectric (high permittivity increases "Q") and the <a href="dielectric%20loss">dielectric loss</a>es, which decrease "Q". Other factors that lower "Q" are the <a href="electrical%20resistance">resistance</a> of the conductor and radiation losses.

There are a wide range of substrates that are used with planar technologies. For printed circuits, glass-reinforced epoxy (<a href="FR-4">FR-4</a> grade) is commonly used. High permittivity <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>-<a href="PTFE">PTFE</a> laminates (e.g. <a href="Rogers%20Corporation">Rogers Corporation</a> 6010 board) are expressly intended for microwave applications. At the higher microwave frequencies, a ceramic material such as <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a> (alumina) might be used for hybrid <a href="microwave%20integrated%20circuit">microwave integrated circuit</a>s (MICs). At the very highest microwave frequencies, in the <a href="millimetre%20band">millimetre band</a>, a crystalline substrate might be used such as <a href="sapphire">sapphire</a> or <a href="quartz">quartz</a>. <a href="Monolithic%20microwave%20integrated%20circuit">Monolithic microwave integrated circuit</a>s (MMICs) will have substrates composed of the <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a> material of which the chip is built such as <a href="silicon">silicon</a> or <a href="gallium%20arsenide">gallium arsenide</a>, or an oxide deposited on the chip such as <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a>.

The electrical properties of the substrate of most interest are the <a href="relative%20permittivity">relative permittivity</a> (ε) and the <a href="loss%20tangent">loss tangent</a> (). The relative permittivity determines the characteristic impedance of a given line width and the group velocity of signals travelling on it. High permittivity results in smaller printed components, aiding miniaturisation. In quasi-TEM types, permittivity determines how much of the field will be contained within the substrate and how much is in the air above it. The loss tangent is a measure of the dielectric losses. It is desirable to have this as small as possible, especially in circuits which require high "Q".

Mechanical properties of interest include the thickness and mechanical strength required of the substrate. In some types, such as suspended stripline and finline, it is advantageous to make the substrate as thin as possible. Delicate semiconductor components mounted on a flexing substrate can become damaged. A hard, rigid material such as quartz might be chosen as the substrate to avoid this problem, rather than an easier-to-machine board. In other types, such as homogeneous stripline, it can be much thicker. For <a href="printed%20antenna">printed antenna</a>e, that are <a href="conformal%20antenna">conformal to the device shape</a>, flexible, hence very thin, substrates are required. The thickness required for electrical performance depends on the permittivity of the material. Surface finish is an issue; some roughness may be required to ensure adhesion of the metallisation, but too much causes conductor losses (as the consequent <a href="surface%20roughness">roughness</a> of the metallization becomes significant compared with the <a href="skin%20depth">skin depth</a>). Thermal properties can be important. Thermal expansion changes the electrical properties of lines and can break <a href="plated%20through%20hole">plated through hole</a>s.

Stripline is a strip conductor embedded in a dielectric between two ground planes. It is usually constructed as two sheets of dielectric clamped together with the stripline pattern on one side of one sheet. The main advantage of stripline over its principal rival, microstrip, is that transmission is purely in the TEM mode and is free of dispersion, at least over the distances encountered in stripline applications. Stripline is capable of supporting TE and TM modes but these are not generally used. The main disadvantage is that it is not as easy as microstrip to incorporate <a href="discrete%20component">discrete component</a>s. For any that are incorporated, cutouts have to be provided in the dielectric and they are not accessible once assembled.

Suspended stripline is a type of <a href="air%20stripline">air stripline</a> in which the substrate is suspended between the ground planes with an air gap above and below. The idea is to minimise dielectric losses by having the wave travel through air. The purpose of the dielectric is only for mechanical support of the conductor strip. Since the wave is travelling through the mixed media of air and dielectric, the transmission mode is not truly TEM, but a thin dielectric renders this effect negligible. Suspended stripline is used in the mid microwave frequencies where it is superior to microstrip with respect to losses, but not as bulky or expensive as waveguide.

The idea of two conductor stripline is to compensate for air gaps between the two substrates. Small air gaps are inevitable because of manufacturing tolerances and the thickness of the conductor. These gaps can promote radiation away from the line between the ground planes. Printing identical conductors on both boards ensures the fields are equal in both substrates and the electric field in the gaps due to the two lines cancels out. Usually, one line is made slightly undersize to prevent small misalignments effectively widening the line, and consequently reducing the characteristic impedance.

The bilateral suspended stripline has more of the field in the air and almost none in the substrate leading to higher "Q", compared to standard suspended stripline. The disadvantage of doing this is that the two lines have to be bonded together at intervals less than a quarter wavelength apart. The bilateral structure can also be used to couple two independent lines across their broad side. This gives much stronger <a href="coupling%20%28electronics%29">coupling</a> than side-by-side coupling and allows coupled-line filter and directional coupler circuits to be realised that are not possible in standard stripline.

Microstrip consists of a strip conductor on the top surface of a dielectric layer and a ground plane on the bottom surface of the dielectric. The <a href="electromagnetic%20wave">electromagnetic wave</a> travels partly in the dielectric and partly in the air above the conductor resulting in quasi-TEM transmission. Despite the drawbacks of the quasi-TEM mode, microstrip is often favoured for its easy compatibility with printed circuits. In any case, these effects are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit.

Another drawback of microstrip is that it is more limited than other types in the range of characteristic impedances that it can achieve. Some circuit designs require characteristic impedances of or more. Microstrip is not usually capable of going that high so either those circuits are not available to the designer or a transition to another type has to be provided for the component requiring the high impedance.

The tendency of microstrip to radiate is generally a disadvantage of the type, but when it comes to creating <a href="antenna%20%28radio%29">antennae</a> it is a positive advantage. It is very easy to make a <a href="patch%20antenna">patch antenna</a> in microstrip, and a variant of the patch, the <a href="planar%20inverted-F%20antenna">planar inverted-F antenna</a>, is the most widely used antenna in mobile devices.

Suspended microstrip has the same aim as suspended stripline; to put the field into air rather than the dielectric to reduce losses and dispersion. The reduced permittivity results in larger printed components, which limits miniaturisation, but makes the components easier to manufacture. Suspending the substrate increases the maximum frequency at which the type can be used.

Inverted microstrip has similar properties to suspended microstrip with the additional benefit that most of the field is contained in the air between the conductor and the groundplane. There is very little stray field above the substrate available to link to other components. Trapped inverted microstrip shields the line on three sides preventing some higher order modes that are possible with the more open structures. Placing the line in a shielded box completely avoids any stray coupling but the substrate must now be cut to fit the box. Fabricating a complete device on one large substrate is not possible using this structure.

Coplanar waveguide (CPW) has the return conductors on top of the substrate in the same plane as the main line, unlike stripline and microstrip where the return conductors are ground planes above or below the substrate. The return conductors are placed either side of the main line and made wide enough that they can be considered to extend to infinity. Like microstrip, CPW has quasi-TEM propagation.

CPW is simpler to manufacture; there is only one plane of metallization and components can be <a href="Surface-mount%20technology">surface mounted</a> whether they are connected in series (spanning a break in the line) or shunt (between the line and the ground). Shunt components in stripline and microstrip require a connection through to the bottom of the substrate. CPW is also easier to miniaturise; its characteristic impedance depends on the ratio of the line width to the distance between return conductors rather than the absolute value of line width.

Despite its advantages, CPW has not proved popular. A disadvantage is that return conductors take up a large amount of board area that cannot be used for mounting components, though it is possible in some designs to achieve a greater density of components than microstrip. More seriously, there is a second mode in CPW that has zero frequency cutoff called the slotline mode. Since this mode cannot be avoided by operating below it, and multiple modes are undesirable, it needs to be suppressed. It is an odd mode, meaning that the <a href="electric%20potential">electric potential</a>s on the two return conductors are equal and opposite. Thus, it can be suppressed by bonding the two return conductors together. This can be achieved with a bottom ground plane (conductor-backed coplanar waveguide, CBCPW) and periodic plated through holes, or periodic <a href="wikt%3Aairbridge">air bridges</a> on the top of the board. Both these solutions detract from the basic simplicity of CPW.

Coplanar strips (also "coplanar stripline" or "differential line") are usually used only for <a href="Radio%20frequency">RF</a> applications below the microwave band. The lack of a ground plane leads to a poorly defined field pattern and the losses from stray fields are too great at microwave frequencies. On the other hand, the lack of ground planes means that the type is amenable to embedding in multi-layer structures.

A slotline is a slot cut in the metallisation on top of the substrate. It is the dual of microstrip, a dielectric line surrounded by conductor instead of a conducting line surrounded by dielectric. The dominant propagation mode is hybrid, quasi-TE with a small longitudinal component of electric field.

Slotline is essentially a <a href="balanced%20line">balanced line</a>, unlike stripline and microstrip, which are <a href="unbalanced%20line">unbalanced line</a>s. This type makes it particularly easy to connect components to the line in shunt; surface mount components can be mounted bridging across the line. Another advantage of slotline is that high impedance lines are easier to achieve. Characteristic impedance increases with line width (compare microstrip where it decreases with width) so there is no issue with printing resolution for high impedance lines.

A disadvantage of slotline is that both characteristic impedance and group velocity vary strongly with frequency, resulting in slotline being more dispersive than microstrip. Slotline also has a relatively low "Q".

Antipodal slotline is used where very low characteristic impedances are required. With dielectric lines, low impedance means narrow lines (the opposite of the case with conducting lines) and there is a limit to the thinness of line that can be achieved because of the printing resolution. With the antipodal structure, the conductors can even overlap without any danger of short-circuiting. Bilateral slotline has advantages similar to those of bilateral air stripline.

Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW), also called "laminated waveguide" or "post-wall waveguide", is a waveguide formed in the substrate dielectric by constraining the wave between two rows of posts or plated through holes and ground planes above and below the substrate. The dominant mode is a quasi-TE mode. SIW is intended as a cheaper alternative to hollow metal waveguide while retaining many of its benefits. The greatest benefit is that, as an effectively enclosed waveguide, it has considerably less radiation loss than microstrip. There is no unwanted coupling of stray fields to other circuit components. SIW also has high "Q" and high power handling, and, as a planar technology, is easier to integrate with other components.

SIW can be implemented on printed circuit boards or as <a href="low%20temperature%20co-fired%20ceramic">low temperature co-fired ceramic</a> (LTCC). The latter is particularly suited to implementing SIW. Active circuits are not directly implemented in SIW: the usual technique is to implement the active part in stripline through a stripline-to-SIW transition. Antennae can be created directly in SIW by cutting slots in the ground planes. A <a href="horn%20antenna">horn antenna</a> can be made by flaring the rows of posts at the end of a waveguide.

There is an SIW version of <a href="ridge%20waveguide">ridge waveguide</a>. Ridge waveguide is a rectangular hollow metal waveguide with an internal longitudinal wall part-way across the E-plane. The principal advantage of ridge waveguide is that it has a very wide bandwidth. Ridge SIW is not very easy to implement in printed circuit boards because the equivalent of the ridge is a row of posts that only go part-way through the board. But the structure can be created more easily in LTCC.

Finline consists of a sheet of metallised dielectric inserted into the <a href="E-plane">E-plane</a> of a rectangular metal waveguide. This mixed format is sometimes called "quasi-planar". The design is not intended to generate waveguide modes in the rectangular waveguide as such: instead, a line is cut in the metallisation exposing the dielectric and it is this that acts as a transmission line. Finline is thus a type of dielectric waveguide and can be viewed as a shielded slotline.

Finline is similar to ridge waveguide in that the metallisation of the substrate represents the ridge (the "fin") and the finline represents the gap. Filters can be constructed in ridge waveguide by varying the height of the ridge in a pattern. A common way of manufacturing these is to take a thin sheet of metal with pieces cut out (typically, a series of rectangular holes) and insert this in the waveguide in much the same way as finline. A <a href="finline%20filter">finline filter</a> is able to implement patterns of arbitrary complexity whereas the metal insert filter is limited by the need for mechanical support and integrity.

Finline has been used at frequencies up to and experimentally tested to at least . At these frequencies it has a considerable advantage over microstrip for its low loss and it can be manufactured with similar low-cost printed circuit techniques. It is also free of radiation since it is completely enclosed in the rectangular waveguide. A metal insert device has an even lower loss because it is air dielectric, but has very limited circuit complexity. A full waveguide solution for a complex design retains the low loss of air dielectric, but it would be much bulkier than finline and significantly more expensive to manufacture. A further advantage of finline is that it can achieve a particularly wide range of characteristic impedances. Biasing of <a href="transistor">transistor</a>s and <a href="diode">diode</a>s cannot be achieved in finline by feeding bias current down the main transmission line, as is done in stripline and microstrip, since the finline is not a conductor. Separate arrangements have to be made for biasing in finline.

Unilateral finline is the simplest design and easiest to manufacture but bilateral finline has lower loss, as with bilateral suspended stripline, and for similar reasons. The high "Q" of bilateral finline often makes it the choice for filter applications. Antipodal finline is used where very low characteristic impedance is required. The stronger the coupling between the two planes, the lower the impedance. Insulated finline is used in circuits that contain active components needing bias lines. The "Q" of insulated finline is lower than other finline types so it is otherwise not usually used.

Imageline, also "image line" or "image guide", is a planar form of <a href="dielectric%20slab%20waveguide">dielectric slab waveguide</a>. It consists of a strip of dielectric, often alumina, on a metal sheet. In this type, there is no dielectric substrate extending in all horizontal directions, only the dielectric line. It is so called because the ground plane acts as a mirror resulting in a line that is equivalent to a dielectric slab without the ground plane of twice the height. It shows promise for use at the higher microwave frequencies, around , but it is still largely experimental. For instance "Q" factors in the thousands are theoretically possible but radiation from bends and losses in the dielectric-metal adhesive significantly reduce this figure. A disadvantage of imageline is that the characteristic impedance is fixed at a single value of about .

Imageline supports TE and TM modes. The dominant TE and TM modes have a cutoff frequency of zero, unlike hollow metal waveguides whose TE and TM modes all have a finite frequency below which propagation cannot occur. As the frequency approaches zero, the longitudinal component of field diminishes and the mode asymptotically approaches the TEM mode. Imageline thus shares the property of being able to propagate waves at arbitrarily low frequencies with the TEM type lines, although it cannot actually support a TEM wave. Despite this, imageline is not a suitable technology at lower frequencies. A drawback of imageline is that it must be precisely machined as surface roughness increases radiation losses.

In insular imageline a thin layer of low permittivity insulator is deposited over the metal ground plane and the higher permittivity imageline is set on top of this. The insulating layer has the effect of reducing conductor losses. This type also has lower radiation losses on straight sections, but like the standard imageline, radiation losses are high at bends and corners. Trapped imageline overcomes this drawback, but is more complex to manufacture since it detracts from the simplicity of the planar structure.

Ribline is a dielectric line machined from the substrate as a single piece. It has similar properties to insular imageline. Like imageline, it must be precisely machined. Strip dielectric guide is a low permittivity strip (usually plastic) placed on a high permittivity substrate such as alumina. The field is largely contained in the substrate between the strip and the ground plane. Because of this, this type does not have the precise machining requirements of standard imageline and ribline. Inverted strip dielectric guide has lower conductor losses because the field in the substrate has been moved away from the conductor, but it has higher radiation losses.

Multilayer circuits can be constructed in printed circuits or monolithic integrated circuits, but LTCC is the most amenable technology for implementing planar transmission lines as multilayers. In a multilayer circuit at least some of the lines will be buried, completely enclosed by dielectric. The losses will not, therefore, be as low as with a more open technology, but very compact circuits can be achieved with multilayer LTCC.

Different parts of a system may be best implemented in different types. Transitions between the various types are therefore required. Transitions between types using unbalanced conductive lines are straightforward: this is mostly a matter of providing continuity of the conductor through the transition and ensuring a good impedance match. The same can be said for transitions to non-planar types such as coaxial. A transition between stripline and microstrip needs to ensure that both ground planes of the stripline are adequately electrically bonded to the microstrip ground plane. One of these groundplanes can be continuous through the transition, but the other ends at the transition. There is a similar issue with the microstrip to CPW transition shown at C in the diagram. There is only one ground plane in each type but it changes from one side of the substrate to the other at the transition. This can be avoided by printing the microstrip and CPW lines on opposite sides of the substrate. In this case, the ground plane is continuous on one side of the substrate but a <a href="Via%20%28electronics%29">via</a> is required on the line at the transition.

Transitions between conductive lines and dielectric lines or waveguides are more complex. In these cases, a change of mode is required. Transitions of this sort consist of forming some kind of antenna in one type that acts as a launcher into the new type. Examples of this are coplanar waveguide (CPW) or microstrip converted to slotline or substrate integrated waveguide (SIW). For wireless devices, transitions to the external antennae are also required.

Transitions to and from finline can be treated in a similar way to slotline. However, it is more natural for finline transitions to go to waveguide; the waveguide is already there. A simple transition into waveguide consists of a smooth exponential taper (<a href="Vivaldi%20antenna">Vivaldi antenna</a>) of the finline from a narrow line to the full height of the waveguide. The earliest application of finline was to launch into circular waveguide.

A transition from a balanced to an unbalanced line requires a <a href="balun">balun</a> circuit. An example of this is CPW to slotline. Example D in the diagram shows this kind of transition and features a balun consisting of a dielectric <a href="radial%20stub">radial stub</a>. The component shown thus in this circuit is an air bridge bonding the two CPW ground planes together. All transitions have some <a href="insertion%20loss">insertion loss</a> and add to the complexity of the design. It is sometimes advantageous to design with a single integrated type for the whole device to minimise the number of transitions even when the compromise type is not optimal for each of the component circuits.

The development of planar technologies was driven at first by the needs of the US military, but today they can be found in mass-produced household items such as <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>s and <a href="satellite%20TV">satellite TV</a> receivers. According to <a href="Thomas%20H.%20Lee%20%28engineering%20professor%29">Thomas H. Lee</a>, <a href="Harold%20A.%20Wheeler">Harold A. Wheeler</a> may have experimented with coplanar lines as early as the 1930s, but the first documented planar transmission line was stripline, invented by Robert M. Barrett of the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cambridge%20Research%20Center">Air Force Cambridge Research Center</a>, and published by Barrett and Barnes in 1951. Although publication did not occur until the 1950s, stripline had actually been used during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. According to Barrett, the first stripline power divider was built by V. H. Rumsey and H. W. Jamieson during this period. As well as issuing contracts, Barrett encouraged research in other organisations, including the Airborne Instruments Laboratory Inc. (AIL). Microstrip followed soon after in 1952 and is due to Grieg and Engelmann. The quality of common dielectric materials was at first not good enough for microwave circuits, and consequently, their use did not become widespread until the 1960s. Stripline and microstrip were commercial rivals. "Stripline" was the brand name of AIL who made air stripline. Microstrip was made by <a href="ITT%20Corporation">ITT</a>. Later, dielectric-filled stripline under the brand name "triplate" was manufactured by <a href="Sanders%20Associates">Sanders Associates</a>. "Stripline" became a generic term for dielectric filled stripline and "air stripline" or "suspended stripline" is now used to distinguish the original type.

Stripline was initially preferred to its rival because of the dispersion issue. In the 1960s, the need to incorporate miniature solid-state components in MICs swung the balance to microstrip. Miniaturisation also leads to favouring microstrip because its disadvantages are not so severe in a miniaturised circuit. Stripline is still chosen where operation over a wide band is required. The first planar slab dielectric line, imageline, is due to King in 1952. King initially used semicircular imageline, making it equivalent to the already well-studied circular rod dielectric. Slotline, the first printed planar dielectric line type, is due to Cohn in 1968. Coplanar waveguide is due to Wen in 1969. Finline, as a printed technology, is due to Meier in 1972, although Robertson created finline-like structures much earlier (1955–56) with metal inserts. Robertson fabricated circuits for <a href="diplexer">diplexer</a>s and couplers and coined the term "finline". SIW was first described by Hirokawa and Ando in 1998.

At first, components made in planar types were made as discrete parts connected together, usually with coaxial lines and connectors. It was quickly realised that the size of circuits could be hugely reduced by directly connecting components together with planar lines within the same housing. This led to the concept of <a href="Hybrid%20integrated%20circuit">hybrid</a> MICs: "hybrid" because <a href="lumped%20element%20model">lumped</a> components were included in the designs connected together with planar lines. Since the 1970s, there has been a great proliferation in new variations of the basic planar types to aid miniaturisation and mass production. Further miniaturisation became possible with the introduction of <a href="Monolithic%20microwave%20integrated%20circuit">MMICs</a>. In this technology, the planar transmission lines are directly incorporated in the semiconductor slab in which the integrated circuit components have been manufactured. The first MMIC, an <a href="X%20band">X band</a> amplifier, is due to Pengelly and Turner of <a href="Plessey">Plessey</a> in 1976.

A small selection of the many circuits that can be constructed with planar transmission lines are shown in the figure. Such circuits are a class of <a href="distributed%20element%20circuit">distributed element circuit</a>s. Microstrip and slotline types of directional couplers are shown at A and B respectively. Generally, a circuit form in conducting lines like stripline or microstrip has a <a href="dual%20impedance">dual form</a> in dielectric line such as slotline or finline with the roles of the conductor and insulator reversed. The line widths of the two types are <a href="multiplicative%20inverse">inversely related</a>; narrow conducting lines result in high impedance, but in dielectric lines, the result is low impedance. Another example of dual circuits is the <a href="bandpass%20filter">bandpass filter</a> consisting of coupled lines shown at C in conductor form and at D in dielectric form.

Each section of line acts as a resonator in the coupled lines filters. Another kind of resonator is shown in the SIW bandpass filter at E. Here posts placed in the centre of the waveguide act as resonators. Item F is a slotline <a href="rat-race%20coupler">hybrid ring</a> featuring a mixture of both CPW and slotline feeds into its <a href="port%20%28circuit%20theory%29">ports</a>. The microstrip version of this circuit requires one section of the ring to be three-quarters wavelength long. In the slotline/CPW version all sections are one-quarter wavelength because there is a 180° <a href="phase%20inversion">phase inversion</a> at the slotline junction.

McNicoll was made <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> of in September 1945. Advanced to <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> in 1949, he successively commanded and before being transferred to the Navy Office in July 1950. In 1952, McNicoll chaired the planning committee for the <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">British nuclear tests</a> on the <a href="Montebello%20Islands">Montebello Islands</a>, and was appointed commanding officer of . He commanded the ship for two years before it was sold off for scrap, at which point he returned to London to attend the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in 1955. He occupied staff positions in London and <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> before being posted to the <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Naval%20Board">Naval Board</a> as Chief of Personnel in 1960.

McNicoll retired from the RAN in 1968 and was appointed as the inaugural Australian Ambassador to Turkey. He served in the diplomatic post for five years, then retired to Canberra. McNicoll died in 1987 at the age of 79.

Alan McNicoll was born in the Melbourne suburb of <a href="Hawthorn%2C%20Victoria">Hawthorn</a>, Victoria, on 3 April 1908. He was the second of five sons of <a href="Walter%20McNicoll">Walter McNicoll</a>, a school teacher and <a href="Citizens%20Military%20Force">Militia</a> officer, and Hildur (née Wedel Jarlsberg).

Described as "urbane and studious", he performed well both academically and in sport, ultimately placing first in seamanship, history and English. On graduation in 1926, McNicoll was posted to Britain for service and further training with the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>.

Advanced to acting <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a> in September 1928, McNicoll's appointment to the United Kingdom concluded the following year, at which point he returned to Australia and was initially posted to the land base <a href="HMAS%20Cerberus%2C%20Victoria">HMAS "Cerberus"</a>. He was attached to soon after, before being assigned for duties with . In his Lieutenants' Examinations in 1929, McNicoll achieved 1st Class Certificates in all of his subjects and was awarded a prize of <a href="Australian%20pound">₤</a>10 as a result. He was promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in July 1930, with seniority from 1 April that year. Completing a twelve-month posting aboard between 1932 and 1933, McNicoll decided to specialise as a torpedo officer and returned to the United Kingdom in order to undertake the long course at the <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Royal Naval College</a> in <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Devon">Dartmouth</a>. While in the UK, McNicoll wrote and published "Sea Voices", a book of poems centred on naval life.

McNicoll's detachment to the Royal Navy was terminated in 1935 on his graduation from Dartmouth, and he returned to Australia. Over the next three years, he saw service in HMAS "Canberra", and "Cerberus", advancing to <a href="lieutenant%20commander">lieutenant commander</a> on 1 April 1938. On 18 May 1937, McNicoll wed Ruth Timmins at St Stephen's Church of England at <a href="Brighton%2C%20Victoria">Brighton</a>. From March 1939, McNicoll was once again seconded to the Royal Navy, receiving a posting to the torpedo school <a href="HMS%20Vernon%20%28shore%20establishment%29">HMS "Vernon"</a>; he was serving in "Vernon" on the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. While residing at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>, McNicoll and his wife had their first child, a son named Ian, in June that year. Ian died when one week old. The couple later had two more sons, Guy and Anthony, and a daughter, Deborah.

On 14 September 1939, eleven days after the outbreak of the Second World War, McNicoll was posted to <a href="HMS%20Victory">HMS "Victory"</a>, the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of Admiral <a href="William%20Milbourne%20James">Sir William James</a>, the <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Portsmouth">Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth</a>. In April 1940, McNicoll was transferred to the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> as a member of the ship's commissioning crew. During McNicoll's time aboard the ship, it was severely damaged by a torpedo in operations on 1 September and barely made it back to harbour. McNicoll ultimately served on "Fiji" for six months before being attached to , a <a href="Submarine%20tender">submarine depot ship</a> stationed at <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, Egypt, in October 1940. In this post he was made torpedo officer of the 1st Submarine Flotilla operating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mediterranean">Mediterranean theatre</a>. In addition to his standard duties, McNicoll was regularly involved in rendering safe captured enemy ordnance. On one such occasion, he was tasked with disarming the captured Italian submarine <a href="HMS%20X2">"Galileo Galilei"</a>, which entailed removing the inertia pistols from eight torpedoes that had badly corroded. As a consequence of his "gallant and undaunted devotion to duty" in this action, McNicoll was awarded the <a href="George%20Medal">George Medal</a> and presented a Commander-in-Chief's Commendation. His decoration was promulgated in a supplement to the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 8 July 1941.

In April 1942, McNicoll transferred to the battleship and served as Squadron Torpedo Officer. As part of the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>, "King George V" provided support to several <a href="Arctic%20convoys%20of%20World%20War%20II">Arctic convoys</a> throughout the conflict. From April to May 1942, "King George V" formed up as a support component to <a href="Convoy%20PQ%2015">Convoy PQ 15</a>, the first for McNicoll. While sailing in thick fog on 1 May, "King George V" collided with the destroyer after the latter crossed under the bow of the battleship. "Punjabi" was sliced in two during the collision, and sank with heavy loss of life. Several <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s were also ignited on the damaged stern of "King George V" during the accident. "King George V" was patched up at Seidisfjord, before sailing to <a href="Gladstone%20Dock">Gladstone Dock</a>, Liverpool, to receive repairs.

In December 1942, HMS "King George V" deployed in support of Convoy JW 51A, the first Russian convoy to sail direct from the United Kingdom without stopping at Iceland. The journey was completed without incident. On receiving word of the German naval attack on Convoy JW 51B in what became known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Barents%20Sea">Battle of the Barents Sea</a>, "King George V" was dispatched along with nine other ships from <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> on 31 December to provide cover for the returning Convoy RA 51 and to attempt to catch the German ships engaged in the previous assault. The German ships were ultimately not encountered, and RA 51 was returned safely. "King George V" later provided a covering force for two further convoys during early 1943, before being transferred to the Mediterranean during May in preparation for Operation Husky, the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>. Promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a> on 30 June 1943, McNicoll took part in the Sicilian invasion the following month, with "King George V" serving as part of the covering force. Prior to the invasion, "King George V", along with , had executed a bombardment of <a href="Trapani">Trapani</a> and the islands of <a href="Favignana">Favignana</a> and <a href="Levanzo">Levanzo</a> on the night of 11/12 July, as part of a deception suggesting landings on the west coast of Sicily.

McNicoll was briefly reposted to HMS "Victory" on 1 September 1943, before being transferred for staff duties with the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> in London the following month. He completed a year-long attachment with the Admiralty, and was involved in the planning for the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>. On 15 February 1944, he attended an investiture ceremony at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, where he was formally presented his George Medal by <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a>. McNicoll returned to Australia and was attached to the staff of HMAS "Cerberus" in October 1944; he spent the remainder of the war in this post. Up to this period, McNicoll had completed all but five of his years of military service attached to the Royal Navy. McNicoll's three brothers also served in the Second World War: <a href="Ronald%20McNicoll">Ronald Ramsay</a>, who ultimately retired with the rank of <a href="major%20general">major general</a> and served in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, as a <a href="colonel">colonel</a> with the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Engineers">Royal Australian Engineers</a>; Frederick Oscar Ramsay as a lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN); and David Ramsay—who would become an accomplished journalist—as a lieutenant in the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> up to 1944, before spending the remainder of the conflict as a war correspondent for <a href="Consolidated%20Press%20Holdings">Consolidated Press</a>, in which capacity he covered the Normandy landings.

McNicoll was appointed <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> of the light cruiser on 16 September 1945, a fortnight after the cessation of hostilities in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific theatre</a>. From November 1945 until July 1947, "Hobart" spent nine months operating in Japanese waters over three distinct periods as part of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth%20Occupation%20Force">British Commonwealth Occupation Force</a>. The ship was placed in reserve from December 1947, and McNicoll briefly transferred to HMAS "Penguin" before assuming the post of Director of Plans and Operations at the Navy Office in Melbourne on 6 January 1948. Advanced to <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> in June 1949, he was posted two months later to , a <a href="River-class%20frigate">River-class frigate</a>, as the ship's commanding officer, and was simultaneously placed in charge of the 1st Frigate Squadron. He was appointed an honorary <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> in December for a period of three years. In January 1950, McNicoll transferred to command the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> and was subsequently made <a href="Captain%20%28D%29">Captain (D)</a> in control of the 10th Destroyer Squadron.

During McNicoll's tenure as commanding officer of "Warramunga", the ship operated in Australian waters as part of the <a href="Australia%20Station">Australia Station</a>, sailing to New Zealand for a visit during March 1950. On the outbreak of the Korean War in June that year, "Warramunga" was selected as part of the Australian contribution to the conflict. Moreover, the ship was to be attached to a force of five Royal Navy destroyers led by a captain, making it expedient to have the Australian ship commanded by an officer of lower rank; McNicoll was consequently replaced by Commander <a href="Otto%20Becher">Otto Becher</a> on 28 July. McNicoll was then posted to the Navy Office to assist in the introduction and co-ordination of <a href="National%20Service">National Service</a> in the Australian military in response to the <a href="National%20Service%20Act%201951">National Service Act 1951</a>. He moved to the land base <a href="HMAS%20Lonsdale%20%28naval%20base%29">HMAS "Lonsdale"</a> in October 1951, on being made <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of Naval Staff</a>.

In 1952, McNicoll was appointed chairman of the planning committee for the <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">British nuclear tests</a> on the <a href="Montebello%20Islands">Montebello Islands</a>, off the coast of Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of "Australia", McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet</a>. HMAS "Australia" was near the end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the 1954 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in a ceremony at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Melbourne">Government House, Melbourne</a>.

The year of 1954 was to be HMAS "Australia"'s last in service, with the ship conducting Royal and Vice Regal tasks as some of its final duties. In February and March, HMAS "Australia" served as part of the escort for the <a href="SS%20Gothic%20%281947%29">Royal Yacht "Gothic"</a> during the Australian leg of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation tour. The cruiser was presented with the <a href="Gloucester%20Cup">Gloucester Cup</a> on 25 March as the ship "considered to be foremost in general efficiency, cleanliness, seamanship and technical training" during the year of 1953. As one of the ship's final duties with the Navy, "Australia" was tasked with transporting Field Marshal <a href="William%20Slim%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Slim">Sir William Slim</a>, the Governor-General of Australia, along with his wife and their staff on a cruise around the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>, the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> and the <a href="Whitsunday%20Islands">Whitsunday Passage</a>. The voyage embarked on 4 May, and two days later "Australia" fired its 8-inch guns for the final time. While in the Coral Sea, a Dutch naval ship was discovered to be incapacitated off the coast of <a href="Jayapura">Hollandia</a>, <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Netherlands New Guinea</a>, and was consequently towed by "Australia" to <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a>. McNicoll was later appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20Orange-Nassau">Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau</a> by the Dutch government for his rescue of the ship.

McNicoll relinquished command of HMAS "Australia" in July 1954 before the cruiser was paid off and marked for disposal the following month, and he briefly returned to duties at the Navy Office. In November, he embarked for London to attend the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> as part of the 1955 course intake, which signified that he had been marked for senior command. McNicoll and his wife, Ruth, had separated in 1950 and their divorce, which cited adultery as the cause, was finalised in October 1956, while the former was still in London. On 17 May the following year, McNicoll wed Frances Mary Chadwick, a journalist, in the <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a> register office. Made acting <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> in January 1957, McNicoll was appointed as Head of the Australian Joint Service Staff in London. He returned to Australia in February 1958 and was selected to serve as Deputy Secretary (Military) at the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>; McNicoll's rank was made substantive in July that year.

On 8 January 1960, McNicoll was posted to the <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Naval%20Board">Naval Board</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel. As noted by historian Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position at a time in which recruitment and retention in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets. McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period. Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard , the flagship of the RAN. The Australian government had designated the role of the RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise. McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare. As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS "Melbourne". The <a href="Australian%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a>. In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN was in the process of a complete overhaul of its <a href="order%20of%20battle">order of battle</a> and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six <a href="Ton-class%20minesweeper">Ton-class minesweeper</a>s acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of <a href="Westland%20Wessex">Westland Wessex</a> helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities. Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the <a href="Far%20East%20Strategic%20Reserve">Far East Strategic Reserve</a> were met.

McNicoll's two-year term as Fleet Commander concluded on 6 January 1964, at which point he returned to the Naval Board as Fourth Naval Member and Chief of Supply. However, this post proved short-lived with his appointment as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, headquartered at the land base <a href="HMAS%20Kuttabul%20%28naval%20base%29">HMAS "Kuttabul"</a> in Sydney, from June that year. In the <a href="1965%20New%20Year%20Honours">1965 New Year Honours</a>, McNicoll was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>.

On 24 February 1965, McNicoll was promoted <a href="Vice%20admiral%20%28Australia%29">vice admiral</a> and made <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Chief of Naval Staff</a> (CNS) in succession to Vice Admiral <a href="Hastings%20Harrington">Sir Hastings Harrington</a>. By virtue of this position, McNicoll was head of the Naval Board and the functional commander of the RAN. McNicoll's term as CNS was characterised by a period of heightened activity for the RAN in light of the Australian commitments to the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia "Konfrontasi"</a> and the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He furthermore had to oversee an extensive modernisation of the fleet, with the introduction into service of the <a href="Perth-class%20destroyer">"Perth"-class destroyers</a>, <a href="Attack-class%20patrol%20boat">"Attack"-class patrol boats</a>, and the initial batch of <a href="Oberon-class%20submarine">"Oberon"-class submarines</a>. The <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm%20%28RAN%29">Fleet Air Arm</a> was also re-equipped with American fixed wing aircraft. Despite these acquisitions, the RAN possessed a rather thin and limited fleet during this period, which McNicoll blamed on past naval planning. He criticised the lack of foresight in earlier decisions that had led to "inconsistencies and inadequate estimating" in the future needs of the RAN, which had consequently left the fleet outdated and minimal. In addition to the RAN's materiel issues, McNicoll faced significant problems with morale and recruitment. A series of mishaps and accidents over the previous decade led to what naval historian <a href="Tom%20Frame%20%28bishop%29">Tom Frame</a> termed as "an appreciable erosion of public confidence in the navy's professional standards". The situation intensified following the February 1964 <a href="Melbourne%E2%80%93Voyager%20collision">collision between HMAS "Melbourne" and "Voyager"</a>. The two subsequent <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>s into the incident subjected the RAN to unprecedented scrutiny and damaged the public perception of its senior leadership. McNicoll had to cope with the turmoil occasioned by these events and concerned himself with the restoration of morale in the Navy.

The tenure of Air Chief Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Sir Frederick Scherger</a> as <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> was set to expire in May 1966, and a replacement had to be selected from the service chiefs. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">Sir John Wilton</a>, had among defence and military circles been assumed to be the natural successor. However, mounting speculation arose from late 1965 over who was to be selected for the position as it became known Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Sir Robert Menzies</a> preferred McNicoll for the post, as did Secretary of the Department of Defence <a href="Ted%20Hicks">Sir Ted Hicks</a>, who thought McNicoll more intelligent and objective than his army counterpart. McNicoll lobbied ardently for the position, and was supported by his wife, Frances, who actively campaigned on her husband's behalf. By December 1965, Scherger's replacement had still not been decided upon and Menzies chose to delay the decision until the new year. However, Menzies retired in January 1966 and was succeeded by his deputy, <a href="Harold%20Holt">Harold Holt</a>. Holt and the newly appointed <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence</a>, <a href="Allen%20Fairhall">Allen Fairhall</a>, preferred Wilton and ultimately selected him to succeed Scherger. In any event, McNicoll was created a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="1966%20New%20Year%20Honours">1966 New Year Honours</a> for his service as CNS.

McNicoll was eager for a RAN contribution to the Vietnam War and, in July 1966, proposed that the four Australian minesweepers operating out of Singapore be deployed to Vietnamese waters since "Konfrontasi" was at an end and the vessels were no longer necessary in that area. The notion was rejected by Fairhall, however, who was conscious of an upcoming election and was adamant that nothing be decided until afterward. The possibility of a naval contribution to Vietnam was raised again in December, and it was decided that the guided missile destroyer and a clearance diving team of six personnel be deployed as the Royal Australian Navy Force Vietnam. Per an agreement between McNicoll and Admiral <a href="Roy%20L.%20Johnson">Roy L. Johnson</a>, Commander of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>, HMAS "Hobart" was to be attached to the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a> and conduct shore bombardment operations. The deployment of an Australian destroyer to Vietnam became permanent, with the ships operating on a six-month rotation. To McNicoll's satisfaction, the RAN contribution to the theatre was further bolstered in 1967 with the formation of the RAN Helicopter Flight Vietnam and the dispatch of naval aviators to serve in an Army support role with <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 9 Squadron RAAF</a>.

The visible legacy of McNicoll's service as CNS is the <a href="Australian%20White%20Ensign">Australian White Ensign</a>. The British <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a> had been flown by Australian vessels since the formation of the RAN in 1911, but the Australian contribution to Vietnam—a conflict in which the United Kingdom was not involved—served to complicate the situation. Federal politician <a href="Sam%20Benson">Sam Benson</a> questioned the Australian use of the British ensign before parliament in October 1965, and McNicoll later raised the issue with the Naval Board. The Naval Board ultimately decided to recommend to the government that the RAN create its own unique white ensign. A design accompanied the recommendation, which described the ensign as a "white flag with the Union Flag in the upper canton at the hoist with six blue stars positioned as in the Australian flag". The government approved the proposal, and the Australian White Ensign was formally introduced throughout the RAN on 1 March 1967.

After 46 years of service, McNicoll retired from the RAN on 2 April 1968 and was succeeded as CNS by Vice Admiral <a href="Victor%20Smith">Victor Smith</a>. In the lead-up to his retirement, McNicoll completed a farewell tour by visiting several ships and naval establishments throughout Australia. The trip culminated with a two-week visit to Vietnam, and McNicoll was present in <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City">Saigon</a> when the city was attacked by <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> forces as part of the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tet Offensive</a>. As a man who "liked action", McNicoll later stated that he received a "great thrill" during the assault as he awaited transportation back to Australia.

On his retirement from the Navy, McNicoll was appointed by the Australian government as its inaugural ambassador to Turkey. He was able to form amiable relations between the governments of Australia and Turkey, despite the physical and logistic issues associated with the establishment of a new embassy and the lack of knowledge both nations had of one another. McNicoll held his diplomatic post in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> for five years, before he returned to Australia in 1973 and retired to Canberra. A man of "culture and refined literary tastes", McNicoll engaged his passion for the arts during retirement and in 1979 published his translation of "<a href="Odes%20%28Horace%29">The Odes of Horace</a>". He was also a music lover and a keen fly-fisherman.

Sir Alan McNicoll died on 11 October 1987 at the age of 79. Remembered as a "well-informed, hard working and skilled administrator", he was cremated with full naval honours. McNicoll was survived by his wife, and by the children from his first marriage.

Bazy Tankersley

Ruth Elizabeth "Bazy" Tankersley (March 7, 1921 – February 5, 2013) was an American <a href="horse%20breeding">breeder</a> of <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s and a newspaper publisher. She was a daughter of Senator <a href="Joseph%20Medill%20McCormick">Joseph Medill McCormick</a>. Her mother was <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> <a href="Republican%20party%20in%20the%20United%20States">Republican</a> Congresswoman <a href="Ruth%20Hanna%20McCormick">Ruth Hanna McCormick</a>, making Tankersley a granddaughter of the Senator <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a> of Ohio. Although Tankersley was involved with conservative Republican causes as a young woman, including a friendship with Senator <a href="Joseph%20R.%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, her progressive roots reemerged in later years; by the 21st century, she had become a strong supporter of <a href="environmentalism">environmental</a> causes and backed <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> for president in 2008.

Tankersley's father died when she was a child. When her mother remarried, the family moved to the southwestern United States where Tankersley spent considerable time riding horses. She became particularly enamored of the Arabian breed after she was given a <a href="part-Arabian">part-Arabian</a> to ride. At 18 she began working as a reporter for a newspaper published by her mother. She later ran a newspaper in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> with her first husband, Peter Miller, and then in 1949 she became the publisher of the conservative "<a href="Washington%20Times-Herald">Washington Times-Herald</a>". That paper was owned by her uncle, the childless <a href="Robert%20R.%20McCormick">Robert McCormick</a>, who viewed Tankersley as his heir until the two had a falling out over editorial control of the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley, who became her second husband. After "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" absorbed the "Times-Herald", she shifted to full-time horse breeding.

Tankersley purchased her first <a href="purebred">purebred</a> Arabian when she was 19, and began her horse breeding operation, Al-Marah Arabians, in <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>, in 1941. As she moved across the US for her newspaper career, her horses and farm name went with her. She purchased her program's <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation sire</a>, <a href="Indraff">Indraff</a>, in 1947, while living in Illinois. Upon her move to Washington, DC, her Al-Marah operation relocated to <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County, Maryland</a>, where by 1957 it was the largest Arabian farm in the United States. Tankersley returned to Tucson in the 1970s, where in addition to horse breeding, she created an apprenticeship program at Al-Marah to train young people for jobs in the horse industry. She set up a second horse operation, the Hat Ranch, near <a href="Flagstaff%2C%20Arizona">Flagstaff, Arizona</a>. Over her career she bred over 2,800 registered Arabians and was one of the largest importers of horses from the <a href="Crabbet%20Arabian%20Stud">Crabbet Arabian Stud</a> in England.

Tankersley was a patron of many charities. Upon her death from <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a> in 2013 she bequeathed her Tucson ranch to the <a href="University%20of%20Arizona">University of Arizona</a> and placed the Hat Ranch in a <a href="Land%20trust%23Conservation%20land%20trusts">conservation trust</a>. In her final years, she downsized her breeding operation to about 150 horses, and most remaining stock went to her son, Mark Miller, who moved the Al-Marah Arabian farm name and horse operation to his home base near <a href="Clermont%2C%20Florida">Clermont, Florida</a>.

Tankersley was described as having "inherited a love of politics and horses, not necessarily in that order." She was born in Chicago, Illinois, on March 7, 1921. Her nickname "Bazy" came from how she pronounced the word "baby" when she was a toddler. Her father was Joseph Medill McCormick, part-owner of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" and a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> from Illinois. Her mother, Ruth Hanna McCormick, was a daughter of Senator <a href="Mark%20Hanna">Mark Hanna</a> of Ohio, and Ruth was a member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> from Illinois, serving in the <a href="71st%20Congress">71st Congress</a> from 1929 to 1931 as a progressive <a href="Republican%20party%20in%20the%20United%20States">Republican</a>. Bazy was the youngest of three children; her siblings were Katherine ("Katrina"), (1913–2011) and John (1916–1938).

When Tankersley was four, her father died by suicide, believed to be partly attributed to his defeat for renomination in 1924. Her mother remarried in 1932 to <a href="Albert%20G.%20Simms">Albert Gallatin Simms</a>, a congressman from New Mexico, lawyer, and banker. Tankersley spent part of her childhood on her mother's Rock River dairy farm in <a href="Byron%2C%20Illinois">Byron, Illinois</a>, and later moved to the Southwest with her mother and stepfather, living at a ranch owned by Simms in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, at first, and then moving in 1937 to the Trinchera Ranch, a property in Colorado that her mother had purchased. Tankersley attended a boarding school in Virginia and spent summers in the West. Her love of horses in general and the Arabian horse in particular came from those years: "Right away, my stepfather bought me a cow pony, and I wore it out ... So my mother got me a Arabian that I couldn't wear out." She also <a href="horse%20show">showed horses</a> on the East Coast in the 1930s. Her interest in Arabian horses led her to meet several major breeders of the time, including Jimmie Dean of Traveler's Rest, Roger Selby, <a href="William%20Robinson%20Brown">W. R. Brown</a> and <a href="Carl%20Raswan">Carl Raswan</a>.

Tankersley did not complete high school, and later said, "I virtually had no education." Nonetheless, she studied genetics at Vermont's <a href="Bennington%20College">Bennington College</a> between 1939 and 1941 without completing a degree. While there, she gained some notoriety for genetic studies she conducted by raising <a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">fruit flies</a> in her dorm room. In 2004, she was awarded an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters from the University of Arizona.

Tankersley married Maxwell Peter Miller, Jr. in 1941. She and Miller lived in Tucson for two years, where she developed a deep love for Arizona. They then moved to Chicago for a time, and subsequently to her mother's Trinchera Ranch, which Bazy ran. Ruth McCormick died of pancreatitis on December 31, 1944, two months after a serious riding accident. 

The couple moved back to Illinois prior to relocating to Washington, DC. Tankersley divorced Miller in 1951 to marry Garvin E. "Tank" Tankersley, an editor at the "<a href="Washington%20Times-Herald">Washington Times-Herald</a>" ten years older than she was. Garvin Tankersley had started his news career as a photographer. He was the managing editor when he left the paper in 1952. The couple met while Bazy was running the "Times-Herald", but Robert McCormick, Bazy's uncle and owner of the newspaper, considered Garvin Tankersley to be of unsuitable social status for Bazy because "Tank" was from a poor <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg, Virginia</a>, family. McCormick also disapproved of her divorce. Bazy saw the latter stance as hypocritical, given McCormick's own complicated personal life. McCormick's attempts to end the relationship ultimately prompted the couple to elope, and the Tankersleys were married for 45 years until Garvin's death in 1997.

Tankersley also dabbled in campaign politics. In 1948 she organized "Twenties for Taft" clubs to support the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201948">1948 Presidential campaign</a> of <a href="Robert%20A.%20Taft">Robert A. Taft</a>. She followed in the footsteps of her mother Ruth, who was the first woman to manage a presidential campaign, the 1940 and 1944 efforts of <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a>. Tankersley later described herself as a friend of Senator <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a>, and in 1952 she advocated for the removal of <a href="Guy%20Gabrielson">Guy Gabrielson</a> as chair of the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a>. Tankersley's politics shifted dramatically during her life. Noting her earlier strong affiliation with the Republican party and conservative politics, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reported that in 2008 she voted for <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. She also supported Democratic Arizona Representative <a href="Gabrielle%20Giffords">Gabrielle Giffords</a>.

From her two marriages, Tankersley had three biological children: a son, Mark Miller, born in 1947, and two daughters, Kristie Miller (born 1944) and Tiffany Tankersley (1970–2012). She also had two stepchildren, Anne Tankersley Sturm and Garvin Tankersley, Jr. At the time of her death, she had six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

At 18, Tankersley (then Bazy McCormick) began working as a reporter for the "<a href="Rockford%20Morning%20Star%20Building">Rockford Star</a>," published by her mother. She gained experience running a newspaper in 1946 when she and Peter Miller purchased the "LaSalle Post-Tribune" in <a href="LaSalle%2C%20Illinois">LaSalle, Illinois</a>, and the "Peru News-Herald", in <a href="Peru%2C%20Illinois">Peru, Illinois</a>, merging the papers to create the "Daily News-Tribune." In 1949, her uncle, "Colonel" Robert R. McCormick, appointed her as the publisher of the family-owned "Washington Times-Herald", an "isolationist and archconservative" paper known for sensationalism. McCormick had purchased it following the 1948 death of <a href="Cissy%20Patterson">Eleanor Medill "Cissy" Patterson</a>, his first cousin, and wanted Bazy to use the paper to create "an outpost of American principles". Robert McCormick had no children of his own, "doted" on Bazy, and considered her the heir to his newspaper company. Tankersley was 28 at the time and was given the title of Vice-President.

During Tankersley's tenure as publisher of the "Times-Herald", the paper was embroiled in two controversies related to McCarthy, one involving attacks intended to help unseat <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> Senator <a href="Millard%20E.%20Tydings">Millard E. Tydings</a> in 1950, and the other a lawsuit brought by <a href="Drew%20Pearson%20%28journalist%29">Drew Pearson</a> in 1951 over what Pearson viewed as a "conspiracy to smear his reputation". In the Tydings case, a composite photograph created by Garvin Tankersley made Tydings appear to be meeting with a <a href="communist%20party">communist party</a> leader and was a factor in Tydings losing his race. It also brought Bazy and her paper to the attention of the United States Senate, where the paper's treatment of Tydings was viewed by a bipartisan Senate panel as a violation of "simple decency and honesty" and "a shocking abuse of the spirit and intent of the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment of the Constitution</a>". The lawsuit was a $5.1 million cause filed by Pearson against multiple <a href="defendant">defendant</a>s, including McCarthy and the "Times-Herald", <a href="Westbrook%20Pegler">Westbrook Pegler</a> and <a href="Fulton%20Lewis">Fulton Lewis</a>, alleging they had "contrived ... to hold <a href="plaintiff">plaintiff</a> up to public scorn and ridicule". Pearson frequently criticized McCarthy, McCarthy criticized Pearson in a speech on the floor of the Senate, and the two men had even been in a physical altercation in December 1950. The "Times-Herald" ran articles critical of Pearson and in one case described Pearson as a "New Deal communist", though it was asserted to have been a typographical error that should have read "columnist".

Bazy (then Miller) was publisher of the newspaper for only 19 months. By April 1951, McCormick and his niece developed differences of opinions over both the newspaper and her relationship with Garvin Tankersley. She later said, "I understood when I went to the "Times-Herald" I was to have full control. That control was not given me ... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [McCormick] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people." McCormick also told her to decide between Garvin Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she resigned from the "Times-Herald". McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the "Times-Herald" to "The Washington Post" in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Bazy Tankersley be given a chance to purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. Upon the purchase of the "Times-Herald", the "Post" consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. Though estranged for many years, Bazy and McCormick reconciled prior to his death.

After the sale, she continued to write a newspaper column for the "Post", but also began to raise Arabian horses as a full-time occupation.

In her 70-year career as a horse breeder, Tankersley emphasized athleticism and disposition in her Arabians. She is recorded as the breeder of over 2,800 registered Arabian <a href="foal">foal</a>s in her lifetime, making her possibly the largest Arabian horse breeder in the world. At 19, she purchased her first Arabian horse, a <a href="mare">mare</a> named Curfa, using money from the sale of another horse she had ridden while at boarding school in Virginia. She founded the Al-Marah Arabian Horse Farm in 1941 on a property when she first lived in Tucson. Mark Miller stated that the name Al-Marah was selected by Carl Raswan, who said it was Arabic for "a verdant garden oasis".

Throughout her newspaper career, she moved the Al-Marah farm name with her, to Illinois from 1944 to 1949, and outside of Washington, DC, in Maryland, where she lived from 1949 to 1975. Thereafter, she returned to Tucson permanently. She consistently used bloodlines from the <a href="Crabbet%20Arabian%20Stud">Crabbet Arabian Stud</a>, both via horses descended from early American importations as well as her own purchases from the estate of <a href="Lady%20Wentworth">Lady Wentworth</a> in the late 1950s. This unbroken line gives rise to Miller's assertion that the Al-Marah herd is the "oldest continuously-bred, privately-owned band of Arabians in the world".

While she lived in Illinois, in 1947 Tankersley purchased a <a href="stallion">stallion</a> named <a href="Indraff">Indraff</a> for $10,000. Indraff was bred by <a href="Roger%20Selby">Roger Selby</a> of Ohio, and was a son of the <a href="Crabbet%20Arabian%20Stud">Crabbet</a>-bred stallion <a href="Raffles%20%28horse%29">*Raffles</a>. Indraff became her <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation</a> herd sire, and sired 254 purebred Arabians over his lifetime. Tankersley's first foundation mare, Selfra, was also of Crabbet bloodlines. By the time she left Illinois in 1949, Tankersley owned 45 Arabians.

Upon arrival in the Washington, DC, area, Tankersley recreated Al-Marah Arabians in <a href="Montgomery%20County%2C%20Maryland">Montgomery County</a>, near Washington. The Al-Marah property in <a href="Potomac%2C%20Maryland">Potomac, Maryland</a>, consisted of , and for a time the Tankersleys also raised cattle there. The farm later moved to <a href="Barnesville%2C%20Maryland">Barnesville, Maryland</a>. Al-Marah was not only a horse breeding facility; the Tankersleys also hosted a number of political and social events. By 1957, Al-Marah was the largest Arabian horse farm in the United States. In that year, Lady Wentworth, owner of the Crabbet Arabian Stud, died and a number of horses were made available for sale. Tankersley bought 32 horses, the largest importation of Crabbet bloodstock to the United States in history. <a href="Annie%20Henrietta%20Yule">Lady Gladys Yule</a> of the <a href="Hanstead%20Stud">Hanstead Stud</a> died within a few weeks of Lady Wentworth, and more top-quality Arabians bred in the UK were put on the market. Tankersley purchased 14 Hanstead horses, the largest group from that estate sold to a single buyer. The arrival of the English horses was, in Tankersley's view, an opportunity to preserve the core bloodlines tracing back to the horses originally gathered by <a href="Abbas%20I%20of%20Egypt">Abbas Pasha</a>.

Following these importations, Tankersley began to build her breeding program around two Crabbet sire lines, which she called the Double R cross. The first "R" stallion bloodline was that of *Raffles via his son Indraff, and the other "R" bloodline was that of Rissalix, a Crabbet-bred stallion owned by Hanstead, and sire of three Crabbet mares Tankersley imported. The two stallion lines shared a common female line to Rissla; she was the maternal granddam of Raffles and dam of Rissalix. In 1958, Tankersley added to her Double R program when she leased and imported the Rissalix son *Count Dorsaz, a Hanstead-bred horse. She owned him outright by 1959. She later added another Rissalix son from Hanstead, *Ranix. In 1962, she imported another Crabbet-bred stallion, *Silver Vanity. She used her knowledge of genetics to institute a program of selectively <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a> horses of bloodlines she considered of excellent quality. In her early years, she also looked for "golden crosses", such as breeding offspring of Indraff to progeny of the <a href="William%20Robinson%20Brown">Maynesboro</a>-bred stallion Gulastra.

While living in the east, Tankersley missed Arizona and wanted to return. "I would read "<a href="Arizona%20Highways">Arizona Highways</a>" and cry," she said. The Tankersleys moved back to Tucson and settled there permanently in 1975. She designed many of the buildings on her Tucson property herself. She added new stallions to her herd starting with Dreamazon in the 1980s, followed by a *Silver Vanity descendant, SDA Silver Legend, in 2001. In the 2000s, continuing her pattern of seeking "golden crosses", she imported the stallion *Bremervale Andronicus from Australia, an <a href="outcross">outcross</a> for her intensely Crabbet-based bloodlines. He became the 2006 National Champion Arabian Sport Horse, with the reserve champion AM Power Raid, a stallion from within her program.

Ultimately Tankersley operated two facilities in Arizona, her Al-Marah Arabian Farm, a facility, and the Hat Ranch in <a href="Williams%2C%20Arizona">Williams</a>, near Flagstaff. The Hat Ranch property she purchased was the former Quarter Circle Double X Ranch and had been owned by <a href="Isabella%20Greenway">Isabella Greenway</a>, who had hosted <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor</a> and <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> there. Tankersley, though identified as a Republican, displayed a photo of FDR at the ranch. The Hat Ranch was home to her young stock, allowing them to live free in an <a href="open%20range">open range</a> setting for two years before beginning <a href="horse%20training">training</a>. It also served as the location for an annual think tank meeting for leaders of the <a href="Arabian%20Horse%20Association">Arabian Horse Association</a>. The ranch also hosted the Straw Bale Forums where politicians, conservation leaders and academics could meet and discuss major issues. In 2003, Tankersley was given the Arabian Breeder's Association Lifetime Breeder's Award.

In 1973, Tankersley created an apprenticeship program to train people both for work as employees at her ranch and for positions elsewhere in the horse industry. It grew into an intensive two-year course that covered all aspects of the horse industry, provided participants college credit through <a href="Pima%20Community%20College">Pima Community College</a>, and was licensed by the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Labor">US Department of Labor</a>. She also donated horses to an Arabian breeding program at <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a>. Tankersley was noted throughout her career for her support of youth involvement with Arabian horses.

Tankersley died on February 5, 2013. She had Parkinson's disease. As she aged, Tankersley downsized her horse breeding operation from 350 horses to under 150 just prior to her death. Her son, Mark Miller, inherited many of her remaining horses and moved the Al-Marah Arabian farm name and the horse operation to his home base near <a href="Clermont%2C%20Florida">Clermont, Florida</a>. Miller had run an entertainment venue called "Arabian Nights", in <a href="Kissimmee%2C%20Florida">Kissimmee, Florida</a>, near <a href="Disney%20World">Disney World</a>, from 1988 until 2013. He used Al-Marah-bred horses to present a 90-minute dinner show performance every night of the year that featured 50 Arabian horses. He closed the program in December 2013 to focus on the transplanted Al-Marah herd on his Florida property.

The Tucson Al-Marah Ranch, consisting of with an estimated worth of $30 million, was donated to the University of Arizona's College of Agriculture as a working ranch. The Hat Ranch had a <a href="conservation%20easement">conservation easement</a> with rights to more than given to the <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20Trust">Grand Canyon Trust</a> to prevent further development. Tankersley's longtime employee, Jerry Hamilton, continued to manage the Hat Ranch for Miller as a home for young horses bred by Al-Marah.

Tankersley once stated, "I come from that old-fashioned background of <a href="noblesse%20oblige">noblesse oblige</a>: If you're born with money, you have an obligation to do good works for others." She was also noted for a strong personality, as her friend, Hermann Bleibtreu of the University of Arizona explained: "If she was in any position of leadership or power, she was dominant." She became a strong <a href="environmentalist">environmentalist</a>, donating to conservation, environmental, and <a href="aquaculture">aquaculture</a> research. She supported <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>, <a href="smart%20growth">smart growth</a>, and water conservation, and promoted reform of state land management. She also helped <a href="Defenders%20of%20Wildlife">Defenders of Wildlife</a> preserve the <a href="Aravaipa%20Canyon">Aravaipa Canyon</a>. Carl Hodges, of the University of Arizona's Environmental Research Lab, stated, "she was as fine and intellectually competent an environmentalist as anybody I'd ever known."

Her financial support also went to charities for disabled children and assorted cultural activities. While in Maryland, she was involved in the creation of two private schools, the Primary Day School in Bethesda and the <a href="Barnesville%2C%20Maryland%23Education">Barnesville School</a>. In Tucson in 1980 she founded the St. Gregory College Preparatory School, now called <a href="The%20Gregory%20School">The Gregory School</a>.

Tankersley was a consistent advocate of the Arabian breed as a performance horse. In addition to the <a href="horse%20show">show ring</a> and <a href="endurance%20riding">endurance riding</a>, where she sometimes rode her own horses, she also tested her horses on <a href="horse%20racing">the race track</a>. In endurance, a horse she bred, Al Marah Xanthium, won the <a href="Tevis%20Cup">Tevis Cup</a>. Many others earned national championships in the show ring over the course of her career. She was a major promoter of the Arabian Horse Association <a href="Sport%20horse">Sport Horse</a> Nationals, and her horses acquired many championships at that competition. Further supporting Tankersley's interest in sport horse disciplines, two of her horses, Al Marah Xanthium and Al-Marah Quebec, were the first Arabians accepted into the American <a href="Trakehner">Trakehner</a> Registry.

Tankersley founded the Arabian Horse Owners Foundation (AHOF) in 1963 as a charity to fund the needs of the Arabian horse community. At the time of her death in 2013, the foundation had helped create the Arabian section of the <a href="International%20Museum%20of%20the%20Horse">International Museum of the Horse</a> at the <a href="Kentucky%20Horse%20Park">Kentucky Horse Park</a> in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>: the Al-Marah Arabian Horse Galleries. Housed there are the collections of the AHOF and the Arabian Horse Trust. During the <a href="2010%20World%20Equestrian%20Games">2010 World Equestrian Games</a>, which were held at the Kentucky Horse Park, the foundation sponsored and funded the exhibit "Gift of the Desert: The Art, History and Culture of the Arabian Horse", bringing publicity to the Arabian breed during a major international equestrian competition.

Sunbeam Tiger

The Sunbeam Tiger is a high-performance <a href="V8%20engine">V8</a> version of the British <a href="Rootes%20Group">Rootes Group</a>'s <a href="Sunbeam%20Alpine">Sunbeam Alpine</a> <a href="Roadster%20%28automobile%29">roadster</a>, designed in part by American car designer and racing driver <a href="Carroll%20Shelby">Carroll Shelby</a> and produced from 1964 until 1967. Shelby had carried out a similar V8 conversion on the <a href="AC%20Cobra">AC Cobra</a>, and hoped to be offered the contract to produce the Tiger at his facility in America. Rootes decided instead to contract the assembly work to <a href="Jensen%20Motors">Jensen</a> at <a href="West%20Bromwich">West Bromwich</a> in England, and pay Shelby a <a href="Royalties">royalty</a> on every car produced.

Two major versions of the Tiger were built: the Mark I (1964–1967) was fitted with the <a href="Ford%20Windsor%20engine%23260">Ford V8</a>; the Mark II, of which only 633 were built in the final year of Tiger production, was fitted with the larger Ford engine. Two <a href="prototype">prototype</a> and extensively modified versions of the Mark I competed in the <a href="1964%2024%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">1964 24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, but neither completed the race. Rootes also entered the Tiger in European <a href="Rallying">rallies</a> with some success, and for two years it was the <a href="American%20Hot%20Rod%20Association">American Hot Rod Association</a>'s national record holder over a quarter-mile <a href="dragstrip">drag strip</a>.

Production ended in 1967 soon after the Rootes Group was taken over by <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a>, which did not have a suitable engine to replace the Ford V8. Owing to the ease and affordability of modifying the Tiger, there are few remaining cars in standard form.

The Sunbeam Tiger was a development of the <a href="Sunbeam%20Alpine%23Alpine%20Series%20I%20to%20V">Sunbeam Alpine series I</a>, introduced by the British manufacturer <a href="Rootes%20Group">Rootes</a> in 1959. Rootes realised that the Alpine needed more power if it was to compete successfully in world markets, but lacked a suitable engine and the resources to develop one. The company approached <a href="Ferrari">Ferrari</a> to redesign the standard <a href="inline-four%20engine">inline-four engine</a>, recognising the cachet that "powered by Ferrari" would likely bring. Negotiations initially went well, but ultimately failed.

In 1962 racing driver and <a href="Formula%20One">Formula 1</a> champion <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Jack Brabham</a> proposed to Rootes competition manager Norman Garrad the idea of fitting the Alpine with a Ford V8 engine, which Garrad relayed to his son <a href="Ian%20Garrad">Ian</a>, then the West Coast Sales Manager of Rootes American Motors Inc. Ian Garrad lived near <a href="Carroll%20Shelby">Carroll Shelby</a>'s Shelby American operation, which had done a similar V8 conversion for the British <a href="AC%20Cobra">AC Cobra</a>.

According to journalist William Carroll, after measuring the Alpine's engine bay with "a 'precision' instrument of questionable antecedents" – a wooden <a href="yardstick">yardstick</a> – Ian Garrad despatched his service manager Walter McKenzie to visit the local new car dealerships, looking for a V8 engine that might fit. McKenzie returned with the news that the Ford <a href="Ford%20Windsor%20engine%23260">260 V8 engine</a> appeared to be suitable, which apart from its size advantage was relatively light at . Ian Garrad asked Shelby for an idea of the timescale and cost to build a prototype, which Shelby estimated to be eight weeks and $10,000. He then approached Brian Rootes, head of sales for the Rootes Group, for funding and authorisation to build a prototype, to which Brian Rootes agreed.
Ian Garrad, impatient to establish whether the conversion was feasible, commissioned racing driver and fabricator <a href="Ken%20Miles">Ken Miles</a> to build another prototype as quickly as he could. Miles was provided with a budget of $800, a Series II Alpine, a Ford V8 engine and a 2-speed <a href="automatic%20transmission">automatic transmission</a>, and in about a week he had a running V8 conversion, thus proving the concept.

Shelby began work on his prototype, the white car as it came to be known, in April 1963, and by the end of the month it was ready for trial runs around <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Ian Garrad and John Panks, director of Rootes Motors Inc. of North America, tested an early version of the car and were so impressed that Panks wrote a glowing report to Brian Rootes: "we have a tremendously exciting sports car which handles extremely well and has a performance equivalent to an XX-K Jaguar ... it is quite apparent that we have a most successful experiment that can now be developed into a production car."

Provisionally known as the Thunderbolt, the Shelby prototype was more polished than the Miles version, and used a Ford 4-speed <a href="manual%20transmission">manual transmission</a>. The Ford V8 was only 3.5 inches longer than the Alpine's 4-cylinder engine it replaced, so the primary concern was the engine's width. Like Miles, Shelby found that the Ford V8 would only just fit into the Alpine engine bay: "I think that if the figure of speech about the shoehorn ever applied to anything, it surely did to the tight squeak in getting that 260 Ford mill into the Sunbeam engine compartment. There was a place for everything and a space for everything, but positively not an inch to spare."

All Rootes products had to be approved by <a href="William%20Rootes%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rootes">Lord Rootes</a>, who was reportedly "very grumpy" when he learned of the work that had gone into the Tiger project without his knowledge. He agreed to have the Shelby prototype shipped from America in July 1963 for him and his team to assess. He insisted on driving the car himself, and was so impressed that shortly after returning from his test drive he contacted <a href="Henry%20Ford%20II">Henry Ford II</a> directly to negotiate a deal for the supply of Ford V8 engines. Rootes placed an initial order for 3000, the number of Tigers it expected to sell in the first year, the largest single order Ford had ever received for its engines from an automobile manufacturer. Not only did Lord Rootes agree that the car would go into production, but he decided that it should be launched at the 1964 <a href="New%20York%20International%20Auto%20Show">New York Motor Show</a>, only eight months away, despite the company's normal development cycle from "good idea" to delivery of the final product being three to four years.

Installing such a large engine in a relatively small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained essentially the same as the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman <a href="recirculating%20ball">recirculating ball</a> steering mechanism to a more modern <a href="rack%20and%20pinion">rack and pinion</a> system.

Although twice as powerful as the Alpine, the Tiger is only about 20% heavier, but the extra weight of the larger engine required some minor suspension modifications. Nevertheless, the Tiger's front-to-back weight ratio is substantially similar to the Alpine's, at 51.7/48.3 front/rear.

Shortly before its public unveiling at the New York Motor Show in April 1964 the car was renamed from Thunderbolt to Tiger, inspired by Sunbeam's <a href="Sunbeam%20Tiger%20%281925%29">1925 land-speed-record holder</a>.

Shelby had hoped to be given the contract to produce the Tiger in America, but Rootes was somewhat uneasy about the closeness of his relationship with Ford, so it was decided to build the car in England. The Rootes factory at <a href="Ryton%20plant">Ryton</a> did not have the capacity to build the Tiger, so the company contracted the job to <a href="Jensen%20Motors">Jensen</a> in West Bromwich. Any disappointment Shelby may have felt was tempered by an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built.

Jensen was able to assume production of the Tiger because its assembly contract for the <a href="Volvo%20P1800">Volvo P1800</a> had recently been cancelled. An additional factor in the decision was that Jensen's chief engineer Kevin Beattie and his assistant Mike Jones had previously worked for Rootes, and understood how the company operated. The first of 14 Jensen-built prototypes were based on the Series IV body shell, which became available at the end of 1963.
The Tiger went into production in June 1964, less than a year after completion of the Shelby prototype. Painted and trimmed bodies were supplied by <a href="Pressed%20Steel%20Company">Pressed Steel</a> in Oxfordshire, and the engines and gearboxes directly from Ford in America. Installing the engine required some unusual manufacturing methods, including using a sledgehammer to bash in part of the already primed and painted bulkhead to allow the engine to be slid into place. Jensen was soon able to assemble up to 300 Tigers a month, which were initially offered for sale only in North America. The first few Tigers assembled had to be fitted with a <a href="Borg-Warner">Borg-Warner</a> 4-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox, until Ford resolved its supply problems and was able to provide an equivalent unit as used in the <a href="Ford%20Mustang">Ford Mustang</a>.

Several performance modifications were available from dealers. The original 260 CID engine was considered only mildly tuned at , and some dealers offered modified versions with up to for an additional $250. These modifications were particularly noticeable to the driver above , although they proved problematic for the standard suspension and tyres, which were perfectly tuned for the stock engine. A 1965 report in the British magazine "<a href="Motor%20Sport%20%28magazine%29">Motor Sport</a>" concluded that "No combination of an American V8 and a British chassis could be happier."

Production reached 7128 cars over three distinct series. The factory only ever designated two, the Mark I and Mark II, but as the official Mark I production spanned the change in body style from the Series IV Alpine panels to the Series V panels, the later Mark I cars are generally designated Mark IA by Sunbeam Tiger enthusiasts. The Mark II Tiger, fitted with the larger Ford , was intended exclusively for export to America and was never marketed in the UK, although six right-hand drive models were sold to the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a> for use in traffic patrols and high-speed pursuits; four more went to the owners of important Rootes dealerships.

All Tigers were fitted with a single Ford two barrel <a href="carburetor">carburetor</a>. The <a href="compression%20ratio">compression ratio</a> of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000 rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an <a href="alternator%20%28automotive%29">alternator</a> instead of a <a href="Electric%20generator%23Vehicle-mounted%20generators">dynamo</a>, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips down the side of the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 <a href="cross-ply%20tyre">cross-ply tyre</a>s. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the firewall, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the oil filter was relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the alternator.

The Ford V8 as fitted to the Tiger produced @ 4400 rpm, sufficient to give the car a 0– time of 8.6 seconds and a top speed of .

The Girling-manufactured <a href="brakes">brakes</a> used discs at the front and drums at the rear. The <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspension</a> was independent at the front, using coil springs, and at the rear had a <a href="live%20axle">live axle</a> and <a href="Leaf%20spring">semi-elliptic springs</a>. Apart from the addition of a <a href="Panhard%20rod">Panhard rod</a> to better locate the rear axle, and stiffer front springs to cope with the weight of the V8 engine, the Tiger's suspension and braking systems are identical to that of the standard Alpine. The fitting points for the Panhard rod interfered with the upright spare wheel in the boot, which was repositioned to lie horizontally beneath a false floor. The battery was moved from beneath the rear seat to the boot at the same time. The <a href="Curb%20weight">kerb weight</a> of the car increased from the of the standard Alpine to .

In 1964, its first year of production, all but 56 of the 1649 Mark I Tigers assembled were shipped to North America, where it was priced at $3499. In an effort to increase its marketability to American buyers the car was fitted with "Powered by Ford 260" badges on each front wing beneath the Tiger logo. The Mark I was unavailable in the UK until March 1965, when it was priced at £1446. It was also sold in South Africa for <a href="South%20African%20rand">R</a>3350, badged as the Sunbeam Alpine 260.

Priced at $3842, the Mark II Tiger was little more than a re-engined Mark IA; by comparison, a contemporary V8 <a href="Ford%20Mustang">Ford Mustang</a> sold for $2898. The larger Ford engine improved the Tiger's 0– time to 7.5 seconds, and increased the top speed to . Officially the Mark II Tiger was only available in the US, where it was called the Tiger II. By the time the Mark II car went into production Chrysler was firmly in charge of Rootes, and the "Powered by Ford" shields were replaced by "Sunbeam V-8" badges.

Rootes had always been insufficiently capitalised, and losses resulting from a damaging thirteen-week strike at one of its subsidiaries, British & Light Steel Pressings, coupled with the expense of launching the <a href="Hillman%20Imp">Hillman Imp</a>, meant that by 1964 the company was in serious financial difficulties. At the same time, Chrysler was looking to boost its presence in Europe, and so a deal was struck in June 1964 in which Chrysler paid £12.3 million ($34.44 million) for a large stake in Rootes, although not a controlling one. As part of the agreement Chrysler committed not to acquire a majority of Rootes voting shares without the approval of the UK government, which was keen not to see any further American ownership of the <a href="Automotive%20industry%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK motor industry</a>. In 1967 Minister of Technology <a href="Anthony%20Wedgewood%20Benn">Anthony Wedgewood Benn</a> approached <a href="British%20Motor%20Holdings">BMH</a> and <a href="Leyland%20Motors">Leyland</a> to see if they would buy out Chrysler and Rootes and keep the company British, but neither had the resources to do so. Later that year Chrysler was allowed to acquire a controlling interest in Rootes for a further investment of £20 million.

Manufacturing a car powered by a competitor's engine was unacceptable to the new owner, but Chrysler's own <a href="Chrysler%20LA%20engine%23273%20V8">273 small-block V-8</a> was too large to fit under the Tiger's <a href="Hood%20%28vehicle%29">bonnet</a> without major modifications. Compounding the problem, the company's small-block V8 engines had the <a href="distributor">distributor</a> positioned at the rear, unlike the front-mounted distributor of the Ford V8. Chrysler's big-block V8 had a front-mounted distributor but was significantly larger. Shortly after the takeover Chrysler ordered that production of the Tiger was to end when Rootes' stock of Ford V8 engines was exhausted; Jensen assembled the last Tiger on 27 June 1967. Chrysler added its pentastar logo to the car's badging, and in its marketing literature de-emphasised the Ford connection, simply describing the Tiger as having "an American V-8 power train".

Rootes' design director <a href="Roy%20Axe">Roy Axe</a> commented later that "The Alpine and Tiger were always oddballs in the [Rootes] range. I think they [Chrysler] didn't understand it, or have the same interest in it as the family cars – I think it was as simple as that."

The Tiger name was resurrected in 1972 when Chrysler introduced the , a limited-edition modified <a href="Hillman%20Avenger">Hillman Avenger</a> intended primarily for rallying.

Three racing Tigers were constructed for the 1964 <a href="24%20Hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, a prototype and two that were entered in the race. Costing $45,000 each, they were highly modified versions of the production cars, fitted with <a href="fastback">fastback</a> <a href="coupe">coupe</a> bodies produced by <a href="Lister%20Cars">Lister</a>. But they were still steel <a href="monocoque">monocoque</a>s, and made the Le Mans Tigers heavier than a road-going Tiger at , almost more than the winning Ferrari. The standard Ford four-speed manual transmission was replaced with a <a href="BorgWarner">BorgWarner</a> T10 close-ratio racing transmission, which allowed for a top speed of .

Both Tigers suffered early mechanical failures, and neither finished the race. The engines had been prepared by Shelby but had not been properly developed, and as a result overheated; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes. All three of the Le Mans Tigers have survived.

Once Rootes had made the decision to put the Tiger into production an Alpine IV minus engine and transmission was shipped to Shelby, who was asked to transform the car into a racing Tiger. Shelby's competition Tiger made an early appearance in the B Production Class of Pacific Coast Division <a href="SCCA">SCCA</a> races, which resulted in some "highly successful" publicity for the new car. But Shelby was becoming increasingly preoccupied with development work for Ford, and so the racing project was transferred to the Hollywood Sports Car dealership, whose driver Jim Adams achieved a third-place finish in the Pacific Coast Division in 1965. A Tiger driven by Peter Boulton and Jim Latta finished twelfth overall and first in the small GT class at the 1965 <a href="24%20hours%20of%20Daytona">Dayton Continental</a>. The Tiger was also raced on quarter-mile <a href="dragstrip">drag strip</a>s, and for two years was the <a href="American%20Hot%20Rod%20Association">American Hot Rod Association</a>'s national record holder in its class, reaching a speed of in 12.95 seconds.

Rootes entered the Tiger in European rallies, taking first, second and third places in the 1964 Geneva Rally. Two Tigers took part in the 1965 <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20Rally">Monte Carlo Rally</a>, one finishing fourth overall, the highest placing by a <a href="Front-engine%2C%20rear-wheel-drive%20layout">front-engined rear-wheel drive</a> car, and the other eleventh. After finally having sorted out the engine overheating problem by fitting a forward-facing <a href="Hood%20scoop">air scoop</a> to the bonnet, Rootes entered three Tigers in the 1965 <a href="Alpine%20Rally">Alpine Rally</a>, one of which crossed the finishing line as outright winner. Scrutineers later disqualified the car however, because it had been fitted with undersized cylinder head valves. By the end of the 1966 <a href="Acropolis%20Rally">Acropolis Rally</a> though, it had become clear that low-slung sports cars such as the Tiger were unsuited to the increasingly rough-terrain rally stages, and the car was withdrawn from competition soon after. In the words of Ian Hall, who drove the Tiger in the Acropolis Rally, "I felt that the Tiger had just had it – it was an out of date leviathan".

The 1965 Tiger Mark I gained some exposure on American television as the car of choice for <a href="Maxwell%20Smart">Maxwell Smart</a> in the spoof spy series "<a href="Get%20Smart">Get Smart</a>". The Tiger was used for the first two seasons in the <a href="opening%20credits">opening credits</a>, in which Smart screeched to a halt outside his headquarters, and was used through the remainder of the series in several episodes. Some of the scenes featured unusual modifications such as a retractable James Bond-style machine gun that could not have fit under the Tiger's bonnet, so rebadged Alpine models were used instead.

<a href="Don%20Adams">Don Adams</a>, who played the protagonist Maxwell Smart, gained possession of the Tiger after the series ended and later gave it to his daughters; it is reportedly on display at the <a href="Playboy%20Mansion">Playboy Mansion</a> in Los Angeles. During its early years Rootes advertised the car extensively in "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine and lent a pink Tiger with matching interior to 1965 <a href="Playboy%20Playmate%23Playmate%20of%20the%20Year">Playmate of the Year</a> <a href="Jo%20Collins">Jo Collins</a> for a year.

The Tiger also featured in the 2008 <a href="Get%20Smart%20%28film%29">film adaptation</a> of the "Get Smart" TV series. A replica Tiger had to be constructed using a stock Sunbeam Alpine and re-created Tiger badging as no available Tiger could be found in Canada, where the film was produced. The production team recorded the sound of an authentic Tiger owned by a collector in Los Angeles and edited it into the film.

Weather Machine

Weather Machine is a <a href="Lumino%20kinetic%20art">lumino kinetic</a> <a href="bronze%20sculpture">bronze sculpture</a> and columnar machine that serves as a <a href="weather%20beacon">weather beacon</a>, displaying a <a href="weather%20prediction">weather prediction</a> each day at noon. Designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc., the approximately sculpture was installed in 1988 in a corner of <a href="Pioneer%20Courthouse%20Square">Pioneer Courthouse Square</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, United States. Two thousand people attended its dedication, which was broadcast live nationally from the square by "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Today</a>" weatherman <a href="Willard%20Scott">Willard Scott</a>. The machine cost $60,000.

During its daily two-minute sequence, which includes a trumpet <a href="fanfare">fanfare</a>, mist, and flashing lights, the machine displays one of three metal symbols as a prediction of the weather for the following 24-hour period: a sun for clear and sunny weather, a <a href="Great%20Blue%20Heron">blue heron</a> for <a href="drizzle">drizzle</a> and transitional weather, or a <a href="dragon">dragon</a> and mist for rainy or stormy weather. The sculpture includes two <a href="bronze">bronze</a> <a href="wind%20scoop">wind scoop</a>s and displays the temperature via colored lights along its stem. The <a href="air%20quality%20index">air quality index</a> is also displayed by a light system below the <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> globe. Weather predictions are made based on information obtained by employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square from the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> and the Department of Environmental Quality. Considered a tourist attraction, "Weather Machine" has been called "bizarre", "playful", "unique", and "wacky", and has been compared to a giant <a href="Sceptre">scepter</a>.

"Weather Machine" is a <a href="Lumino%20kinetic%20art">lumino kinetic</a> <a href="bronze%20sculpture">bronze sculpture</a> that serves as a <a href="weather%20beacon">weather beacon</a>, designed and constructed by Omen Design Group Inc. Contributors included Jere and Ray Grimm, <a href="Dick%20Ponzi">Dick Ponzi</a>, who won a 40-entry international competition to design the machine for <a href="Pioneer%20Courthouse%20Square">Pioneer Courthouse Square</a> (1984), and Roger Patrick Sheppard. The group described their efforts as "collaborative", but Sheppard considered Ponzi the "maestro" of the project. Ponzi did the engineering and hydraulics, and the machine was assembled at his vineyard near <a href="Beaverton%2C%20Oregon">Beaverton</a>. The sculpture was inspired by Portland-born-and-based writer <a href="Terence%20O%27Donnell">Terence O'Donnell</a>, who suffered from <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a> during his childhood, and his "funny Irish jig". "Weather Machine", which took five years to plan and build and cost $60,000, was installed in the square in August 1988. "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Today</a>" weatherman <a href="Willard%20Scott">Willard Scott</a> broadcast live from the square to dedicate the sculpture on its August 24 opening. Two thousand people were present as early as 4 a.m. for the dedication. Financial contributors included Pete and Mary Mark, the <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> Foundation, Alyce R. Cheatham, Alexandra MacColl, E. Kimbark MacColl, <a href="Meier%20%26amp%3B%20Frank">Meier & Frank</a>, the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a>, David Pugh and <a href="Standard%20Insurance%20Company">Standard Insurance Company</a>. Information about the donors was included on a plaque added to the sculpture's stem in the weeks following the dedication.

Each day at noon, the columnar machine performs a two-minute sequence that begins with a trumpet <a href="fanfare">fanfare</a> of the opening bars of <a href="Aaron%20Copland">Aaron Copland</a>'s "<a href="Fanfare%20for%20the%20Common%20Man">Fanfare for the Common Man</a>", and produces <a href="mist">mist</a> and flashing lights. It eventually reveals one of three metal symbols: a stylized golden sun ("helia") for clear and sunny weather, a <a href="Great%20Blue%20Heron">blue heron</a> (Portland's official bird) for <a href="drizzle">drizzle</a> and transitional weather, or mist and a "fierce, open-mouthed" dragon for heavy rain or stormy weather. The fanciful symbols change at the same time every day, representing weather predictions for the following 24-hour period. "Helia", described as "gleaming", was designed by Jere Grimm; her design would later be applied to one of her husband's pots, exhibited in 1989. The trumpets are allowed to play at noon due to a waiver of Portland's noise ordinance for that time period. Ray Grimm constructed the blue heron symbol, and the group collaborated on the dragon symbol based on his drawings. In order for the machine to display an accurate weather prediction, as reported by "The Oregonian" in 1988, employees of Pioneer Courthouse Square contact the <a href="National%20Weather%20Service">National Weather Service</a> each morning at 10:30 a.m. for the forecast, and then enter information into the machine's computer, located behind a nearby door.

The machine, whose height is reported to be between , includes two bronze <a href="wind%20scoop">wind scoop</a>s that turn in opposite directions. It also indicates the temperature (when or above) via vertical colored lights along the sculpture's stem. Measured by an internal gauge, the machine displays blue lights for temperatures below freezing, white lights for above freezing and red lights to mark every ten degrees (°F). Referring to an additional light system (below the <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> globe) that indicates air quality, "The Oregonian" reported in 1988 that a green light indicates good air quality, amber reflects "semismoggy" air and a red light indicates poor air quality. However, in 1998, one writer for "The Oregonian" warned: "you don't want to breathe so much when the white light is on". Pioneer Courthouse Square employees enter air quality information into the machine's computer following routine checks with the Department of Environmental Quality.

In addition to its pre-dawn dedication on national television, "Weather Machine" had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor <a href="Bud%20Clark">Bud Clark</a> and other city officials. On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of . Following the fanfare, known officially as "Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of "<a href="You%20Are%20My%20Sunshine">You Are My Sunshine</a>". Portland had good weather in the days following its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols. The sculpture maintained good operation until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating away from noon and the temperature gauge had difficulties working properly. In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.

In the weeks following "Weather Machine" dedication, an estimated 300 to 400 people gathered at the square daily to witness the noon sequence. Following the dedication, "The Oregonian" wrote: "It takes nothing from its fascination to know that a human on the staff of the square will be making the daily phone calls to the Weather Service and the Department of Environmental Quality, and pushing the necessary buttons to cue the pillar's performance ... They have given Portland an attraction no other city has. We're going to like it."

Ponzi described the machine as "light-hearted ... active, distinctive—and fun". O'Donnell, who inspired the sculpture, called it a "gentle spectacle" and described the work as "a cartoon contraption, an odd little thingamajig. It has bells and whistles and other mechanized wonders that confirm rain sometime after the downpour and proudly announce sunshine in the bright light of day." In 1994, "The Oregonian" reported that O'Donnell regarded "Weather Machine" with a "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" and stated that he "[didn't] think it [was] all that attractive". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well ... And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round."

In 1995, "The Oregonian" Jonathan Nicholas wrote, "To this day, nobody is exactly sure what happens when the thing sounds off each day at noon. It's like having a <a href="John%20Kitzhaber">governor in blue jeans</a>. We can't really explain it: It just happens." Grant Butler of "The Oregonian" gave the machine's trumpet fanfare as one of three examples of ways in which people could be certain it was noon in Portland.

The machine is considered a <a href="tourist%20attraction">tourist attraction</a>, recommended in visitor guides for Portland and included in <a href="walking%20tour">walking tour</a>s. One travel contributor recommended a visit to the sculpture for people with children seeking a "perfect family day". "Weather Machine" has been compared to a giant <a href="Sceptre">scepter</a> and has been called "bizarre", "eccentric", "playful", "unique", "wacky", "whimsical", "zany", and a "piece of wizardry".

Bonshō

, also known as or are large <a href="bell%20%28instrument%29">bells</a> found in <a href="Buddhist%20temples%20in%20Japan">Buddhist temples throughout Japan</a>, used to summon the monks to prayer and to demarcate periods of time. Rather than containing a clapper, "bonshō" are struck from the outside, using either a handheld mallet or a beam suspended on ropes.

The bells are usually made from bronze, using a form of <a href="Casting%20%28metalworking%29%23Expendable%20mold%20casting">expendable mould casting</a>. They are typically augmented and ornamented with a variety of <a href="Boss%20%28architecture%29">bosses</a>, raised bands and inscriptions. The earliest of these bells in Japan date to around 600 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>, although the general design is of much earlier Chinese origin and shares some of the features seen in ancient Chinese bells. The bells' penetrating and pervasive tone carries over considerable distances, which led to their use as signals, timekeepers and alarms. In addition, the sound of the bell is thought to have supernatural properties; it is believed, for example, that it can be heard in <a href="Diyu">the underworld</a>. The spiritual significance of "bonshō" means that they play an important role in Buddhist ceremonies, particularly the <a href="Japanese%20New%20Year">New Year</a> and <a href="Bon%20Festival">Bon</a> festivals. Throughout Japanese history these bells have become associated with stories and legends, both fictional, such as the Benkei Bell of <a href="Mii-dera">Mii-dera</a>, and historical, such as the bell of <a href="H%C5%8Dk%C5%8D-ji%20%28Kyoto%29">Hōkō-ji</a>. In modern times, "bonshō" have become symbols of <a href="world%20peace">world peace</a>.

The "bonshō" is derived from the "<a href="bianzhong">bianzhong</a>" ("" in Japanese), an ancient Chinese court instrument comprising a series of tuned bells. One larger additional bell, which eventually developed into the "bonshō", was used as a tuning device and a summons to listeners to attend a "bianzhong" recital. According to legend, the earliest "bonshō" may have come from China to Japan via the Korean Peninsula. The "<a href="Nihon%20Shoki">Nihon Shoki</a>" records that <a href="%C5%8Ctomo%20no%20Satehiko">Ōtomo no Satehiko</a> brought three bronze bells back to Japan in 562 as spoils of war from <a href="Goguryeo">Goguryeo</a>.

"Bonshō" are cast in a single piece using two moulds, a core and a shell, in a process that is largely unchanged since the <a href="Nara%20period">Nara period</a> (710–794). The core is constructed from a dome of stacked bricks made from hardened sand, whilst the shell is made using a <a href="wikt%3Astrickle">strickle board</a>. This is a large, flat, wooden board shaped like a cross-section of the bell, which is rotated around a vertical axis to shape the clay used for the mould. Inscriptions and decorations are then carved or impressed into the clay. The shell fits over the core to create a narrow gap, into which the molten bronze is poured at a temperature of over . The ratio of the alloy is usually around 17:3 copper to tin; the exact admixture (as well as the speed of the cooling process) can alter the tone of the end product. After the metal has cooled and solidified, the mould is removed by breaking it, therefore a new one has to be created for each bell. The process has a high failure rate; only around 50 per cent of castings are successful on the first attempt, without cracks or imperfections.

The casting is traditionally accompanied by the chanting of Buddhist <a href="sutra">sutra</a>s, which may go on for several hours. Buddhist prayer papers, sprigs of sacred mulberry and other ceremonial offerings are added to the molten bronze during the founding process.

There are several parts to a temple bell:
Some bells retain linear impressions arising from joints in the mould used; they are not removed during <a href="wikt%3Afettle">fettling</a> but are regarded as an aspect of the bell's overall beauty. The bell's appearance and sound are intended to be in keeping with Japan's <a href="wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a> aesthetic.

Japanese temple bells are struck externally with either a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell is made up of three parts. First is the "atari", the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged "oshi", the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the "okuri" or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic <a href="overtone">overtone</a>s heard throughout the tolling of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.

The low tone and deep resonance of the bell allow the sound to carry over great distances; a large "bonshō" can be heard up to away on a clear day. The pitch of the bell is carefully judged by its creators, and a difference of a single <a href="hertz">hertz</a> in the fundamental frequency can require that the bell be recast from scratch.

"Bonshō" are sited in Buddhist temples, usually in a specially designated building or tower called a "<a href="sh%C5%8Dr%C5%8D">shōrō</a>" . They are used to mark the passage of time, and to call the monks to <a href="Zen%23Zen%20chanting%20and%20liturgy">liturgical services</a>. In Buddhism, the bell's sound is considered to be calming and to induce a suitable atmosphere for meditation. Because of their shape (with sloped shoulders and a flat base) the bells are seen as representations of the sitting Buddha, and are accorded similar respect; those striking the bell will first make three bows towards it, just as they would before a statue of Buddha.

The sonorous sound of the bell was also used to warn of impending typhoons and as a general alert. Because the ringing of a temple bell could be heard over considerable distances, it was also sometimes used for other signalling purposes; there are records of temple bells being used for military communication from as far back as the <a href="Genpei%20War">Genpei War</a> (1180–1185 CE). Smaller versions were subsequently cast for battlefield use, as the large temple bells were too heavy and unwieldy to transport. These smaller "bonshō" were used primarily as alarms to warn of enemy attacks; commands were given using <a href="drum">drum</a>s and <a href="Conch%20%28instrument%29">conches</a>.

As part of <a href="Japanese%20New%20Year">Japanese New Year</a> celebrations, people queue to ring the temple bells 108 times in a ceremony known as ; the 108 peals of the bell are intended to purge humanity of the <a href="108%20%28number%29%23Buddhism">108 earthly temptations</a>. During the Buddhist <a href="Bon%20Festival">Bon Festival</a>, a special type of "bonshō" called an is rung. This bell is hung above a well, and it is believed that the sound of the bell resonates down the well into the <a href="Diyu">underworld</a>, to summon the spirits of the dead. At the end of the festival, another "bonshō", called an , is rung to send the spirits back and to represent the end of the summer.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the demand for metal for the war effort resulted in many bells being melted down for scrap. As a result, those that survived are generally regarded as important historic artifacts. More than 70,000 bells (approximately 90 per cent of the "bonshō" then in existence) were destroyed in this way. However, rapid production of bells during the post-war period meant that by 1995 the number of temple bells in Japan had returned to pre-war levels.

In the latter half of the twentieth century, the <a href="World%20Peace%20Bell%20Association">World Peace Bell Association</a> was set up in Japan, with the purpose of funding and casting temple bells to be placed around the world as symbols of peace. "Bonshō" have also been cast in response to natural disasters such as the <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a>; several affected communities commissioned bells to commemorate the event.

"Bonshō" have occasionally been used as musical instruments in modern compositions. The recorded sound of temple bells was used in <a href="Mayuzumi%20Toshiro">Mayuzumi Toshiro</a>'s piece "Olympic Campanology", used to open the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Tokyo Olympic Games</a>. A temple bell is also used in performances of <a href="Jacob%20Druckman">Jacob Druckman</a>'s piece "Lamia", in which it is rung while placed on top of a <a href="Timpani">kettledrum</a>. Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the <a href="Gong%23Chau%20gong%20%28Tam-tam%29">orchestral tam-tam</a>.

The oldest known "bonshō" (indeed, the oldest bell in the world still in use) is the Okikicho bell at <a href="My%C5%8Dshin-ji">Myōshin-ji</a>, which was cast in 698. The largest is the bell at <a href="Chion-in">Chion-in</a>, which was commissioned in 1633 and weighs 74 tons. It requires a twenty-five man team to sound it.

During the seventeenth century the "bonshō "was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; possession of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero <a href="Benkei">Benkei</a> is said to have dragged the three-ton bell of <a href="Mii-dera">Mii-dera</a> temple up <a href="Mount%20Hiei">Mount Hiei</a> during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend to be the result of Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero <a href="My%20Lord%20Bag%20of%20Rice">Tawara Tōda</a>, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity <a href="Ry%C5%ABjin">Ryūjin</a>, after saving the god from a giant centipede.
After the <a href="H%C5%8Dk%C5%8D-ji%20%28Kyoto%29">Hōkō-ji</a> temple burned down at the start of the seventeenth century, <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyori">Toyotomi Hideyori</a> sponsored its reconstruction in 1610, and commissioned a large bell as part of that process. The bell's inscription drew the ire of <a href="Tokugawa%20Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>, who had become "<a href="sh%C5%8Dgun">shōgun</a>" after wresting power from the Toyotomi clan when Hideyori's father <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyoshi">Hideyoshi</a> died. The inscription, ""Kokka ankō"" ("Peace and tranquility for the nation"), broke up the characters for the shogun's name () with the <a href="kanji">kanji</a> character for "peace" (). Tokugawa assumed Toyotomi was implying that peace would require the "dismemberment" of the Tokugawa. He used the subsequent dispute as an excuse to wage war on the Toyotomi clan, resulting in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Osaka">Siege of Osaka</a> and the eventual destruction of the Toyotomi.

A bronze "bonshō" was among the gifts presented to <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Commodore Matthew Perry</a> upon <a href="Perry%20Expedition">his arrival</a> in Japan. Cast by bellmakers from the Suwa family of <a href="Higo%20Province">Higo Province</a>, it is now held in the collection of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>.

The <a href="Noh">Noh</a> play , one of the only Noh plays to feature a <a href="Theatrical%20property">prop</a> of any significant size, is based on a legend concerning the bell of <a href="D%C5%8Dj%C5%8D-ji">Dōjō-ji</a>. In the story a woman named <a href="Kiyohime">Kiyohime</a>, the spurned mistress of a Buddhist priest named Anchin, traps her lover inside the temple's bell and then kills him by turning into a snake, coiling around the bell, and cooking him in it.

The bell of the <a href="Adachi%2C%20Tokyo%23Nishiarai%20Daishi">Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple</a> in Tokyo was removed in 1943, to be melted down as part of the Japanese war effort. The crew of the <a href="USS%20Pasadena%20%28CL-65%29">USS "Pasadena"</a> found it on a scrap heap and took it with them to the US as a war trophy, donating it to the city of <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a>; the city council returned the bell to Tokyo in 1955. A similar story accompanies the bell of <a href="Manpuku-ji">Manpuku-ji</a>, which was taken to the United States on the <a href="USS%20Boston%20%28CA-69%29">USS "Boston"</a> after the war; in this case, however, the <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a> authorities allowed the bell to remain in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> as a symbol of friendship between the two cities. The Boston bell is the last WWII "bonshō" in the United States.

The <a href="Japanese%20Peace%20Bell">Japanese Peace Bell</a> at the <a href="headquarters%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">headquarters of the United Nations</a> in New York was donated by Japan in 1954 as a symbol of world peace. It was created using metal reclaimed from coins and medals provided by donors from around the globe. Similar bells representing a commitment to the cause of world peace can be found in many civic areas, including <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>'s <a href="Hiroshima%20Peace%20Memorial%20Park%23Peace%20Bells">Peace Memorial Park</a>. In 1995, the city of <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, erected a four-ton peace bell – a replica of one of the Hiroshima bells – in the city centre as part of its fiftieth-anniversary celebrations, and to strengthen ties with Japan. The Oak Ridge Friendship Bell is decorated with dates relating to Oak Ridge's connection to Japan (the <a href="Uranium%20235">uranium</a> used in the <a href="Little%20Boy">Hiroshima atomic bomb</a> was produced in Oak Ridge). In 1998, a local citizen sued the city over the bell, claiming that it was a Buddhist symbol and violated local laws and the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">US Constitution</a>. The case was ruled in favour of the City of Oak Ridge.

Hi-Level

The Hi-Level was a type of <a href="Bilevel%20rail%20car">bilevel</a> intercity railroad <a href="passenger%20car%20%28rail%29">passenger car</a> used in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. The <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd Company</a> designed it in the 1950s for the <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a> ("Santa Fe") for use on the "<a href="El%20Capitan%20%28train%29">El Capitan</a>", a coach-only <a href="streamliner">streamliner</a> which ran daily between <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The design was inspired by two recent developments in railroading: the <a href="dome%20car">dome car</a>, employed in intercity routes in the Western United States, and bilevel commuter cars operating in the Chicago area. Budd built 73 Hi-Level cars between 1952 and 1964.

Car types included coaches, <a href="dining%20car">dining car</a>s, and <a href="lounge%20car">lounge car</a>s. Most passenger spaces were on the upper level, which featured a row of windows on both sides. Boarding was on the lower level; passengers climbed up a center stairwell to access the upper level. <a href="Vestibuled%20train">Vestibules</a> on the upper level permitted passengers to walk between cars; some coaches had an additional stairwell at one end to allow access to single-level equipment. Santa Fe and Budd considered but never created a <a href="sleeping%20car">sleeping car</a>.

The first two prototype coaches entered service on the "El Capitan" in 1954 and were immediately successful. Budd built sufficient coaches, dining cars, and lounge cars to fully equip the "El Capitan", with additional coaches seeing use on the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chief">San Francisco Chief</a>". <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> inherited the entire fleet in 1971 and continued to use the equipment on its western routes. <a href="Structure%20gauge">Tunnel clearances</a> restricted their use in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">Eastern United States</a>. In 1979, the first <a href="Superliner%20%28railcar%29">Superliners</a>, based on the Hi-Level concept although built by <a href="Pullman-Standard">Pullman-Standard</a>, entered service. Amtrak gradually retired most of its Hi-Levels in the 1990s as more Superliners became available. Five lounges, dubbed "Pacific Parlour Cars", provided first-class lounge service on the "<a href="Coast%20Starlight">Coast Starlight</a>" until their retirement in 2018.

The <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Santa Fe</a> introduced the "<a href="El%20Capitan%20%28train%29">El Capitan</a>" in 1938. The train ran on the Santa Fe's main line between <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Unusually for <a href="streamliner">streamliner</a>s of the period, the "El Capitan" carried coaches only, and had no <a href="sleeping%20cars">sleeping cars</a>. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the Santa Fe added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to twelve in 1942. By the early 1950s fourteen was common. Only seven or eight of these would be passenger-carrying coaches; other cars included <a href="head-end%20car">head-end car</a>s, a <a href="combine%20car">baggage-dormitory</a> for the crew, two <a href="dining%20car">dining car</a>s, and a <a href="Big%20Dome">Big Dome</a> lounge.

Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase the capacity of the train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Burlington%20and%20Quincy%20Railroad">Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad</a> (CB&Q) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB&Q introduced the <a href="dome%20car">dome car</a>, in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed <a href="bilevel%20rail%20car">bilevel rail car</a>s in <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter service</a> in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.

The <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd Company</a> approached Santa Fe in 1952 with the proposal to build long-distance bilevel cars, building on the gallery commuter car concept. Santa Fe accepted the proposal, and took delivery of two prototype coaches in 1954. The cars went into regular service on the "El Capitan". Following a positive customer response, the Santa Fe ordered 47 more cars: ten 68-seat "step down" coaches, twenty-five 72-seat coaches, six lounges, and six dining cars. These constituted five equipment sets ("<a href="consist">consist</a>s"), sufficient for daily service on the "El Capitan". The project cost $13 million.

A press trip took place between <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> on June 16, 1956, using the route of the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (and presaging the use of <a href="Superliner%20%28railcar%29">Superliners</a> on <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>'s "<a href="Capitol%20Limited%20%28Amtrak%20train%29">Capitol Limited</a>"). Santa Fe exhibited the equipment throughout the United States during June and early July. A formal christening took place in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a> on July 8, with the <a href="Beltr%C3%A1n%20Alfonso%20Osorio%2C%2018th%20duke%20of%20Alburquerque">duke of Alburquerque</a> in attendance. Regular revenue service began on July 15. The new train was far more efficient than its predecessor. As Fred Frailey explained:
"<a href="Trains%20%28magazine%29">Trains</a>" editor David P. Morgan thought the equipment was "comfortable" and that it "[rode] well, even above 90 mph." <a href="S.%20Kip%20Farrington">S. Kip Farrington</a> wrote that he was "definitely sold on the high level in every angle" and that it was "here to stay." A typical train comprised two step-down coaches, five standard coaches, a lounge, and a dining car. The Hi-Level cars continued in service after the Santa Fe combined the "El Capitan" and "<a href="Super%20Chief">Super Chief</a>" in 1958. The Santa Fe also converted six single-level <a href="baggage%20car">baggage car</a>s to baggage-dormitories ( 3477–3482), with a <a href="Spoiler%20%28automotive%29">spoiler</a> at one end to create a visual transition. The cars dated from the 1938 version of the "El Capitan".

Despite their success, the cars did not inspire a wave of imitators. By the late 1950s, private-sector passenger travel was in what turned out to be irreversible decline. Most railroads were cutting service; few ordered new equipment of any kind. An exception was the <a href="Chicago%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">Chicago and North Western Railway</a> (CNW). The CNW, like the Burlington, used bilevel coaches on its Chicago-area commuter routes. In 1958 it ordered thirteen intercity bilevel cars from <a href="Pullman-Standard">Pullman-Standard</a>: ten coaches, a <a href="parlor%20car">parlor car</a>, a coach-parlor, and a coach-lounge. Visually they resembled the CNW's existing commuter equipment; a noticeable difference from the Hi-Levels was the adoption of HEP instead of steam. The cars entered service on the "<a href="Peninsula%20400">Peninsula 400</a>", a Chicago–<a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming, Michigan</a> day train, on October 26, 1958. The CNW would be the only other railroad to introduce bilevel equipment on intercity runs.

By the 1960s, the Santa Fe encountered capacity problems on the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chief">San Francisco Chief</a>", which ran between Chicago and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Unlike the "El Capitan", the "Chief" carried a mix of sleeping cars and coaches. To augment capacity, the Santa Fe ordered an additional 24 coaches in 1963–1964: 12 step-down and 12 standard. This was the final major order for new long-distance passenger equipment before the coming of Amtrak. Each "San Francisco Chief" carried four Hi-Level coaches, displacing six single-level coaches.

Throughout the 1960s passenger ridership declined on American railroads while losses mounted. In 1971 the United States federal government created Amtrak, a subsidized for-profit corporation, to take over intercity services and reverse the decline. The Santa Fe, after some hesitation, participated. Amtrak took over the Santa Fe's remaining trains on May 1, 1971. It acquired the entire Hi-Level fleet and continued to operate them. The primary assignment continued to be the combined "Super Chief"/"El Capitan", known as the "<a href="Southwest%20Chief">Southwest Limited</a>" from 1974–1984 and the "Southwest Chief" thereafter. The Chicago–<a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston</a> "<a href="Texas%20Chief">Texas Chief</a>", another ex-Santa Fe train, also carried Hi-Level coaches.

Amtrak was impressed with the Hi-Levels and used them as the basis for the design of the bilevel Superliner family of railcars. The first of 284 Superliner I cars began arriving from Pullman-Standard in 1978. As the Superliners went into service, Hi-Levels could be found on more of Amtrak's trains throughout the Western United States. Hi-Level coaches appeared on the San Francisco–Chicago "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Zephyr">San Francisco Zephyr</a>", Chicago–<a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>–Los Angeles "<a href="Texas%20Eagle">Eagle</a>", and the Chicago-<a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>/<a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> "<a href="Empire%20Builder">Empire Builder</a>". Dining cars displaced from the "Southwest Limited" filled in on the <a href="Ogden%2C%20Utah">Ogden, Utah</a>–Los Angeles "<a href="Desert%20Wind">Desert Wind</a>". Tunnel clearances around <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and elsewhere prevented their use on the <a href="Northeast%20Corridor">Northeast Corridor</a>.

The Superliner I order did not include any "step down" coaches, so Hi-Level coaches continued to fulfill this function on Superliner-equipped trains. In the 1980s, Amtrak rebuilt many of these coaches as <a href="dormitory-coach">dormitory-coaches</a>, with half of the car given over to crew space. Amtrak retired all six single-level baggage-dormitory cars by 1981 in lieu of converting them to HEP. By 1990 the Amtrak fleet stood at 69 cars: 36 dormitory-coaches, 21 coaches, 6 diner-lounges rebuilt from dining cars, and the 6 lounge cars, which Amtrak marketed as "See-Level Lounges." The arrival of 195 Superliner II cars from <a href="Bombardier%20Transportation">Bombardier Transportation</a> in 1993–1995 permitted the retirement of most of the remaining Hi-Level cars. The Chicago–<a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> "<a href="International%20%28Amtrak%20train%29">International</a>" used a mix of Superliners and Hi-Levels from 1995–2000. Hi-Levels remained in service on the <a href="Oklahoma%20City">Oklahoma City</a>–<a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> "<a href="Heartland%20Flyer">Heartland Flyer</a>" into the 2000s. The majority of the Hi-Level fleet was retired at the beginning of 2003. The private equity fund Corridor Capital owns most of the fleet, and has proposed employing them for various passenger projects within the United States.

The last major Hi-Level assignment on Amtrak was the Los Angeles–Seattle "<a href="Coast%20Starlight">Coast Starlight</a>". In the late 1990s Amtrak refurbished five of the six lounges for use as sleeping car passenger-only lounges, branded as the "Pacific Parlour Car." Amtrak offered separate food and beverage service in the upper level and installed a movie theater in the lower level. The railway writer and historian Karl Zimmermann called them "the greatest treat for sleeping car passengers on Amtrak." By the late 2010s Amtrak was manufacturing new parts for the Hi-Levels at <a href="Beech%20Grove%20Shops">Beech Grove</a>, or in some cases retrofitting the Hi-Levels to use Superliner parts. Amtrak retired the cars after their last run on February 4, 2018, citing safety concerns and rising maintenance costs. They were the last Hi-Levels in regular service, and among the few remaining <a href="Heritage%20Fleet">Heritage Fleet</a> cars.

The Hi-Levels stood high, taller than most conventional equipment. Seating occupied the entire upper level, with restrooms, baggage, and other non-revenue areas on the lower level. In most cars, <a href="Vestibuled%20train">vestibules</a> connected the upper levels only. A central staircase linked the two levels. Hi-Levels featured a row of windows across the upper level; on the prototype coaches, this row slanted inwards. The two-level design offered several advantages over conventional single-level equipment. Budd and the Santa Fe expected the upper level, located above the rails, to provide a smoother, quieter ride for passengers. With the lower level free of passengers, designers could provide larger restrooms and baggage areas. Finally, the lower level contained all the electrical equipment, away from the passengers, and with easy access for maintenance. Budd used <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> in the construction, with fluted sides. The cars cost $275,000 apiece.

Budd built the Hi-Levels with <a href="steam%20generator%20%28railroad%29">steam heating</a>, the standard method for ensuring passenger comfort in the 1950s. For <a href="air%20conditioning">air conditioning</a> and other electrical needs, it chose to employ independent diesel generators in each car. Coaches required a single generator; the massive dining car required two such generators to support the kitchen appliances. In the lounge car a larger generator was employed. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Amtrak adopted <a href="head-end%20power">head-end power</a> (HEP) for new orders. HEP and steam are incompatible, so Amtrak had the Hi-Levels converted to HEP to permit their use with new cars. Santa Fe handled the conversion of the Hi-Levels in its <a href="Topeka%2C%20Kansas">Topeka, Kansas</a>, shops. Of the 73 Hi-Levels, all but three underwent the conversion.

The 61 coaches could carry either 68 or 72 passengers, half again more than the 44 of comparable single-level long-distance coaches. This increased capacity permitted the Santa Fe to run the "El Capitan" with fewer cars, while increasing the total number of passengers carried. The 68-seat coaches featured "step down" stairs at one end to permit access to standard-height equipment; that space was given over to four additional seats on the 72-seat coaches. The prototypes also featured step-down stairs, but carried one fewer passenger.

The passenger windows were high. The <a href="seat%20pitch">seat pitch</a> was . The Dwight Austin-manufactured "Traveleze" seats reclined, and included both <a href="head%20rest">head</a> and leg rests. <a href="Hand%20luggage">Hand luggage</a> could be stored in racks above the coach seats, or in large storage racks on the lower level. In the prototypes the upper level had no restrooms; in response to passenger feedback, Budd added a restroom to the upper level in the production models. The prototypes also included a "step up" from the aisle to the coach seats; in the production cars, the seats rested flush with the aisle. Each coach weighed .

The lounge cars were similar to the full-length Big Dome lounges which had entered service with the Santa Fe in 1954. The most obvious difference was the absence of a forward-looking view on the Hi-Level cars. Each of the six lounges could seat 60 people on the upper level. The seating was a mixture of single seats and two- and four-top tables. Nicknames for these cars included "Top of the Cap" and "Sky Lounges". A glass top across two-thirds of the car distinguished it from the rest of the Hi-Levels. The lower level featured the "<a href="Kachina">Kachina</a> Coffee Shop" and a lounge area with seating for 26. Passengers on the lower level could look out through large, windows. The lounge cars weighed . Under Santa Fe operation there were attendants on both levels, and a <a href="newsstand">newsstand</a> on the upper level.

Six dining cars were built. Each dining car seated 80, all on the upper level, compared to 36 in a single-level diner, enabling each car to do the work of two single-level dining cars. The lower level housed the kitchen, including ovens, hot plates, a <a href="refrigerator">refrigerator</a>, and a <a href="dishwasher">dishwasher</a>. <a href="Dumbwaiter">Dumbwaiter</a>s carried food to the upper level. A diesel generator supplied power to the appliances. The dining cars, the largest single-unit dining cars ever built, weighed and rode on six-wheel <a href="Bogie">trucks</a>. As Superliner dining cars arrived in the 1980s, Amtrak rebuilt these cars as diner-lounges, incorporating booths and lounge seating.

Santa Fe considered equipping the "Super Chief" with Hi-Level sleeping cars, and Budd drafted a design for such a car in 1957. In this design there was an aisle on the lower level only, and set against one side instead of centerline. The lower level also contained six single bedrooms and a toilet. The upper level would have eight two-person "Vista Bedrooms" which spanned the width of the car. Access to these rooms would be from four sets of stairs from the lower level aside. Each Vista Bedroom would contain an individual toilet and two beds: one stacked above the bed in the single bedroom beneath, and one lengthwise over the aisle. Nothing came of this proposal. Pullman-Standard adopted a more traditional design for Amtrak's Superliner I in the 1970s: five bedrooms and ten <a href="roomette">roomette</a>s on the upper level, two bedrooms and four roomettes on the lower level.

Including the two prototypes, Budd built 73 Hi-Level cars:

Oxbow (horse)

Oxbow (foaled March 26, 2010), an American <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a> racehorse, is best known for winning the second jewel in the <a href="United%20States%20Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing">United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing</a>, the <a href="2013%20Preakness%20Stakes">2013 Preakness Stakes</a>. A <a href="Bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a> <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a>, sired by a winner of the <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic">Breeders' Cup Classic</a> and out of a full sister to another Breeders' Cup Classic winner, Oxbow was sold as a <a href="yearling%20%28horse%29">yearling</a> at <a href="Keeneland">Keeneland</a> for $250,000 and is owned by <a href="Brad%20M.%20Kelley">Brad Kelley</a> of <a href="Calumet%20Farm">Calumet Farm</a>. He was trained by <a href="D.%20Wayne%20Lukas">D. Wayne Lukas</a> and was ridden in his Triple Crown races by <a href="Gary%20Stevens%20%28jockey%29">Gary Stevens</a>.

Oxbow had a reputation as a front-runner who was difficult to <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23R">rate</a> during his races. Plagued with frequent turnover in jockeys prior to the Triple Crown series, and often running from poor <a href="starting%20gate">starting gate post positions</a>, he had only two wins prior to his victory in the Preakness. That success was Calumet Farm's first win in a Triple Crown race in 45 years and breeder <a href="Richard%20Santulli">Richard Santulli</a>'s first win in a Triple Crown classic race. It also was Stevens' first Triple Crown win since 2001, following his return to riding in early 2013 after a seven-year retirement, and Lukas' first Triple Crown win since 2000.

Oxbow's second-place finish in the <a href="2013%20Belmont%20Stakes">Belmont Stakes</a> in June made him the third horse that year to reach $1 million in <a href="Purse%20distribution">purse</a> wins. Following the Belmont, he was ranked the top three-year-old racehorse in the United States by the <a href="National%20Thoroughbred%20Racing%20Association">National Thoroughbred Racing Association</a> (NTRA). He was pulled up shortly after finishing fourth in the <a href="Haskell%20Invitational">Haskell Invitational</a>, and was found to have suffered a <a href="soft%20tissue%20injury">soft tissue injury</a>, was taken out of competition for the remainder of his three-year-old season, and retired in October 2013. He <a href="stud%20farm">stands at stud</a> for the 2015 breeding season at Calumet Farms.

Oxbow is a bay horse, <a href="horse%20markings">marked</a> with an irregularly shaped white <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">star</a> on his forehead and white on his lower lip. He is tall. Oxbow was bred by <a href="Richard%20Santulli">Richard Santulli</a>'s New Jersey-based Colts Neck Stables, and <a href="foal">foal</a>ed in Kentucky at Burleson Farms. His sire is 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic winner <a href="Awesome%20Again">Awesome Again</a>, and his dam is Tizamazing, an unraced full sister to the two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner <a href="Tiznow">Tiznow</a>. Oxbow's win in the Preakness Stakes was the first win in a Triple Crown classic race for Santulli's breeding program.

As a yearling, Oxbow was sent to the Keeneland sales, where he was purchased for $250,000 by <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23B">bloodstock agent</a> Eddie Kane, acting on behalf of <a href="Brad%20M.%20Kelley">Brad M. Kelley</a>'s Bluegrass Hall. In 2012, the Calumet Investment Group bought <a href="Calumet%20Farm">Calumet Farm</a> and leased it to Kelley, who moved his Bluegrass Hall racing operation and 200 horses from his Hurricane Hill farm to the historic Calumet property in early 2013. Prior to 2013, Calumet Farm had not had a winning horse in a <a href="United%20States%20Triple%20Crown%20of%20Thoroughbred%20Racing">Triple Crown</a> race since 1968.

Although officially registered with <a href="The%20Jockey%20Club">The Jockey Club</a> as a bay, Oxbow has white hairs scattered throughout his coat, therefore his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, describes him as a <a href="Roan%20%28horse%29">roan</a>. Oxbow was listed as "gray/roan" when he was sold as a yearling at Keeneland.

Oxbow's racing career began on August 3, 2012, at <a href="Saratoga%20Race%20Course">Saratoga Race Course</a> in an $80,000 <a href="maiden%20race">maiden race</a> at under jockey <a href="Junior%20Alvarado">Junior Alvarado</a>. Listed at <a href="Sports%20betting%20odds">odds</a> of 22–1, he was slow out of the gate and in sixth early on. He took an awkward step going into the turn, and as a result, his jockey <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">pulled him up</a> and he was taken off the track in a <a href="horse%20trailer">horse ambulance</a>. In October, Oxbow was given another chance in a $50,000 maiden race at at <a href="Keeneland%20Race%20Course">Keeneland Race Course</a>. At 11–1 under jockey <a href="Jon%20Court">Jon Court</a>, he <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23B">broke</a> sharply and led the field at the quarter-mile post. At the top of the homestretch he was caught by Winning Cause, and ultimately finished fourth with a <a href="Beyer%20Speed%20Figure">speed figure</a> of 73. On October 31, he ran in another $50,000 maiden race at seven furlongs at Lukas' home track, <a href="Churchill%20Downs">Churchill Downs</a>. At 17–1 under jockey <a href="Terry%20J.%20Thompson">Terry Thompson</a>, Oxbow came out of the gate ninth, but as in his previous race, had the lead by the quarter-mile post. He ultimately placed third, with an improved speed figure of 85.

Oxbow's first win was a month later on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23U">undercard</a> of the <a href="Clark%20Handicap">Clark Handicap</a>, in another $50,000 maiden race at Churchill Downs. He went off as the 2–1 favorite in a race of with jockey <a href="Joe%20Rocco">Joe Rocco</a>. He started from the far outside at the tenth post position and broke from the gate in seventh but jumped out to the lead within a few strides and led going into the turn by a half <a href="horse%20length">length</a>. Oxbow increased his lead throughout the race and won by almost five lengths, earning a 90 speed figure.

After Oxbow's maiden win, he was flown to <a href="Hollywood%20Park%20Racetrack">Hollywood Park</a> in California to run in the <a href="Graded%20stakes%20race">Grade I</a> <a href="CashCall%20Futurity">CashCall Futurity</a> at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700 m) on a synthetic surface. He was the longest shot in the field at 61–1, and drew the far outside post at number eleven. Ridden by <a href="Corey%20Nakatani">Corey Nakatani</a>, his fifth jockey in five races, Oxbow broke well coming out the gate. He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first <a href="Road%20to%20the%20Kentucky%20Derby">Road to the Kentucky Derby</a> point, and a speed figure of 87.

Oxbow was moved with the rest of Lukas' horses to winter headquarters at <a href="Oaklawn%20Park">Oaklawn Park</a> in <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the <a href="Fair%20Grounds%20Race%20Course">Fair Grounds Race Course</a> in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III <a href="Lecomte%20Stakes">Lecomte Stakes</a>. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Racing%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame%23Jockeys%20in%20the%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.
Five weeks later, Oxbow was entered in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700 m) <a href="Risen%20Star%20Stakes">Risen Star Stakes</a>. Ridden for the third time by Jon Court, Oxbow was assigned the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth from the gate, moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first turn. In the stretch, Oxbow took the lead but could not hold it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other in a <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23Blanket%20finish">blanket finish</a>. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. Oxbow again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more points toward Derby qualification.

Three weeks later, Lukas entered Oxbow in Oaklawn Park's key preparatory race for the Arkansas Derby, the Grade II <a href="Rebel%20Stakes">Rebel Stakes</a>. For the fourth time in five races, Oxbow started on the far outside at post ten. He went off as the favorite for the second time in his career, at 4–1. Lukas switched Jon Court to ride stablemate <a href="Will%20Take%20Charge">Will Take Charge</a>, and Oxbow was given yet another jockey, <a href="Mike%20E.%20Smith">Mike Smith</a>. Oxbow was third out of the gate. He took the lead down the backstretch and stayed in front until the end of the race where he was narrowly defeated by Will Take Charge. Oxbow lost by half a head, but earned his first triple-digit speed figure at 101, along with 20 Derby qualification points. After the Rebel Stakes, Oxbow was ranked as one of the top ten horses in some Triple Crown pre-race polls, and secured eligibility to run in the Derby with 36 points.

Four weeks after the Rebel, Oxbow entered his last preparatory race before the Triple Crown campaign, the Grade I <a href="Arkansas%20Derby">Arkansas Derby</a>, held on April 13. This race marked the first time Oxbow was ridden by 50-year-old Stevens, who was Oxbow's seventh jockey in nine races. The horse was the favorite at 3–1, but once again drew an unfavorable, far-outside post at ten. Oxbow came out ninth at the break and was almost seven lengths behind the leader at the start. He had developed a reputation for running in front and wearing out his exercise riders, so Stevens unsuccessfully attempted to rate Oxbow and make him run <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23P">off the pace</a>, behind other horses. Oxbow, described by observers as "very rank", and by Stevens as "pissed off ... [and] upset with me that he didn't get the running style he wanted", was tossing his head and fighting Stevens into the clubhouse turn. After running last at one point in the race, Oxbow improved his position and finished fifth, less than a length behind second-place Frac Daddy. Oxbow earned a speed figure of 90, the same as in his maiden win. Stevens viewed his attempt to make Oxbow run off the pace as a mistake. "It just turned out to be a nightmare trip and I take full (responsibility) for that", he said. Lukas agreed, stating, "That will not be in [Stevens'] grandchildren's highlight film".

Oxbow ran in the <a href="2013%20Kentucky%20Derby">Kentucky Derby</a> at Churchill Downs as a 25–1 long shot, ridden by Stevens, who had been on Oxbow in workouts since the Arkansas Derby, and as Lukas said, had "gotten to know the horse a little better throughout the last two weeks". Following the scratch of Black Onyx in post position one, Oxbow had the inside number two post in the field of 19 starters and was closest to the rail. His position was further complicated by being next to Revolutionary with jockey <a href="Calvin%20Borel">Calvin Borel</a> at number three. Between the size of the field and Borel's well-known preference for riding the rail, Oxbow had to use his speed early to get out front and avoid being pushed into the rail or being hemmed in behind traffic. He broke fifth and was soon close to leader <a href="Palace%20Malice">Palace Malice</a>, who ran the second fastest initial quarter- and half-miles in Derby history, a pace described as "suicidal". Oxbow maintained his position near the front, and at the top of the homestretch passed the tired-out speed horses to lead the race for a sixteenth of a mile. He then faded and finished in sixth place, six lengths behind winner <a href="Orb%20%28horse%29">Orb</a>, though his performance was still viewed as "respectable" and "promising". Oxbow earned a speed figure of 101, the same as he had in the Rebel, and observers noted that he was the only horse that ran near the front of the pack in the opening half-mile to also finish in the top six; none of the other horses out front early finished better than twelfth.

Oxbow next went to <a href="Pimlico%20Race%20Course">Pimlico Race Course</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> to run in the 2013 Preakness Stakes. In the week prior to the race, he had another workout with Stevens, who stated that it was the "first time [Oxbow] had listened to me", later amending his comments to say, "maybe it's the first time I've listened to him."

Oxbow drew a favorable spot in the gate at post position six, his first good draw since his win in the Lecomte, and kept the same rider for three straight races for the first time in his career. At the start of the race, Will Take Charge veered in and brushed Oxbow, who broke third but took the lead within a few strides and soon led by one and a half lengths. Once in front, Stevens got Oxbow to relax, and they ran the first quarter-mile in 0:23.94, the half mile in 0:48.60, and three-quarters at 1:13:26. Despite the modest pace, what one sportswriter called "lullaby fractions", described by Stevens as "just walking the dog", the colt was one and a half lengths in front at the three-quarter-mile mark.

The victory was 77-year-old Lukas' sixth career Preakness win and his 14th Triple Crown win, surpassing the record of <a href="James%20E.%20Fitzsimmons">"Sunny Jim" Fitzsimmons</a>. It was Lukas' first win in any Triple Crown race since <a href="Commendable">Commendable</a> won the Belmont Stakes in 2000. Oxbow's success was Stevens' third career Preakness win and his ninth Triple Crown win, but the first since winning the Preakness and Belmont on <a href="Point%20Given">Point Given</a> in 2001.

Fourteen horses started at the 2013 Belmont Stakes. Oxbow drew the number seven post position, with rival Orb at post five. There were concerns about Stevens' fitness as he had missed races after being thrown from a horse the previous week, but medical tests showed no sign of injury. Oxbow was the third favorite at 5–1 on the <a href="Glossary%20of%20North%20American%20horse%20racing%23M">morning line</a>, but by race time his <a href="odds">odds</a> were at 10–1.

In the race Oxbow broke third out of the gate and settled behind pacesetters Frac Daddy and Freedom Child, completing a quarter mile in 23 seconds. As usual, Oxbow wanted to run close to the front, Stevens knew better than to fight with him, and so, as in the Derby, horse and rider once again chased the speed horses at fractions described as "suicidal". At the half-mile pole Oxbow was a neck off the leader, who clocked at 0:46.66, and on the backstretch, Oxbow went to the front, reaching the three-quarter mile mark at 1:10.95, running the second fastest half- and three-quarter mile fractions at that point in the race since <a href="Secretariat%20%28horse%29">Secretariat</a>'s 1973 record-setting performance. Oxbow was still in front by a half length at the mile post. At the top of the homestretch, <a href="Palace%20Malice">Palace Malice</a> and Oxbow were nose and nose but Oxbow tired, and finished second by three lengths to Palace Malice with Kentucky Derby winner Orb third, lengths behind Oxbow. His speed figure for the Belmont was 98, the same as in the Risen Star Stakes.

The second-place finish in the Belmont earned Oxbow $200,000 and pushed him over the $1 million mark in career earnings, making him the third horse in 2013 to reach $1 million in purse wins, behind Orb and a fellow Awesome Again son, the six-year-old <a href="gelding">gelding</a> <a href="Game%20On%20Dude">Game On Dude</a>. Although the $1 million bonus for the horse winning the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20Productions">highest combined Triple Crown points</a> has long been discontinued, Oxbow would have won it over Orb owing to his win in the Preakness and second in the Belmont. Further, his placing in the Belmont put him at number one in the post-Belmont June 10 NTRA poll of top three-year-olds, and in the top ten for race horses of all ages.

Oxbow came out of the Belmont feeling good, or as Lukas put it, "full of himself." He returned to Churchill Downs, and resumed scheduled workouts sooner than usual. Lukas then shipped Oxbow to Saratoga to prepare him to run in the Grade I, $1 million <a href="Haskell%20Invitational">Haskell Invitational</a> on July 28, 2013, with sportswriters hoping to see him meet up again with Orb and Palace Malice in the <a href="Travers%20Stakes">Travers Stakes</a> later in the summer. In an attempt to get Oxbow past what had been described as his "one-dimensional" front-running style, Lukas turned to a training regimen at Saratoga where the horse had no clocked workouts, but instead was conditioned by jogging and galloping clockwise (the "wrong way") on the training track for long one-and-a-half to two-mile trips each time out.

Oxbow drew post position five for the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, and was the second favorite in the race behind <a href="Verrazano%20%28horse%29">Verrazano</a>. Leading for the early part of the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey "kind of held" Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the <a href="saddle">saddle</a> when Oxbow failed to <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">jog</a> sound on the track. The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front <a href="fetlock">ankle</a> revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many [starts], they were really clean." Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: "He's been a warrior and a hell of a nice horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a> of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including <a href="English%20Channel%20%28horse%29">English Channel</a>, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.

After standing as a stallion for one year at <a href="Taylor%20Made%20Farm">Taylor Made Farm</a> in 2014, Oxbow was moved to Calumet Farm, where he currently stands. 

Oxbow was represented by his first winner on July 16, 2017 when filly Delaphene took a mile-long maiden race at <a href="Arlington%20Park">Arlington Park</a> by 3 1/2 lengths. The filly, out of the <a href="Empire%20Maker">Empire Maker</a> mare Boustierre, was making her second start. The filly was bred and owned by Calumet Farm.

Oxbow's best progeny to date include filly Coach Rocks, winner of the 2018 <a href="Gulfstream%20Park%20Oaks">Gulfstream Park Oaks</a> (Oxbow's first graded stakes winner) and filly Foxtrot Sally, stakes-placed in the Rags to Riches and Glitter Woman Stakes.

Oxbow was sired by the Canadian-bred Awesome Again, winner of the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic. At stud, Awesome Again has sired many stakes winners, including <a href="Paynter%20%28horse%29">Paynter</a>, who placed second in the <a href="2012%20Belmont%20Stakes">2012 Belmont Stakes</a> and won the 2012 <a href="Haskell%20Invitational">Haskell Invitational</a>; <a href="Ghostzapper">Ghostzapper</a>, who was <a href="Eclipse%20Award%20for%20Horse%20of%20the%20Year">2004 American Horse of the Year</a> and a 2004 Breeders' Cup winner; and <a href="Game%20On%20Dude">Game On Dude</a>, two-time winner of the <a href="Santa%20Anita%20Handicap">Santa Anita Handicap</a>. Oxbow is almost a full brother to Paynter; the two horses are out of full sisters. Oxbow's older full brother, Awesome Patriot, won the 2011 Alydar Stakes. Oxbow's younger full brother, Expect a Lot, is in race training. Oxbow's dam Tizamazing was bred back to Awesome Again in 2013, and in June 2013 was confirmed to be <a href="foal">in foal</a>.

Tizamazing is a full sister to Tiznow, who was 2000 American Horse of the Year and won the Breeders' Cup Classic twice. Tizamazing sold for $1 million at Keeneland as a yearling, but owing to a training injury she never raced. Tizamazing's dam, Cee's Song, is credited with raising the respect <a href="horse%20breeding">breeders</a> have for her female breeding line, <a href="Thoroughbred%20breeding%20theories%23History%20of%20breeding%20theories">Thoroughbred family 26</a>, as one of the top <a href="Distaff%23Other%20meanings">distaff</a> lines in America. Five full siblings out of Cee's Song were either race winners or the dams of race winners: Tiznow, Tizbud and Tizdubai are all stakes winners, Oxbow's dam Tizamazing and Paynter's dam Tizso both produced stakes winners. Another offspring of Cee's Song, the gelding <a href="Breeders%27%20Cup%20Classic%20top%20three%20finishers">Budroyale</a>, was second in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Oxbow's pedigree is <a href="outcross">outcross</a>ed for four generations, with very little <a href="inbreeding">inbreeding</a>. Oxbow is only inbred 4x5x5 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this horse appears once in the fourth and twice in the fifth generation of Oxbow's pedigree.

Air Mata Iboe

Air Mata Iboe (<a href="EYD">Perfected spelling</a>: Air Mata Ibu; <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> for "A Mother's Tears") is a 1941 film from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) directed and written by Njoo Cheong Seng. Starring <a href="Fifi%20Young">Fifi Young</a>, Rd Ismail, Ali Sarosa, and <a href="Ali%20Joego">Ali Joego</a>, it followed a mother who raises her children lovingly but is ultimately betrayed by her eldest sons when she falls upon hard times. The film, billed as a musical extravaganza, featured a soundtrack by <a href="Koesbini">R. Koesbini</a>, and an eponymous <a href="title%20song">title song</a> written by Njoo.

The last production completed by <a href="Fred%20Young%20%28director%29">Fred Young</a>'s <a href="Majestic%20Film%20Company">Majestic Film Company</a>, "Air Mata Iboe" was released in December 1941, shortly before the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies</a>. This film, now possibly lost, received positive reviews. A remake was produced under the same title in 1957; Young retook her role.

Soegiati (<a href="Fifi%20Young">Fifi Young</a>) is the mother of four children: sons Achmad (Rd Ismail), Idris (<a href="S.%20Poniman">S Poniman</a>) and Soemadi (Ali Sarosa), and a daughter named Soepinah (Soelami). She loves them all, but Soemadi receives the most of her attention because he receives little from his father, the merchant Soebagio (<a href="Ali%20Joego">Ali Joego</a>). As the children grow, they marry and move away, and eventually only Soemadi is left. Although he begins a relationship with a young woman named Noormala (<a href="Soerip">Soerip</a>), he does not marry her as his income is not enough to support them.

On the night of <a href="Eid%20al-Fitr">Eid al-Fitr</a>, the family gathers for the holiday. Unknown to the family, Soebagio is leading a double life as a robber, and that evening the police come to arrest him. To protect his father, Soemadi declares himself the culprit, and he is exiled. Feeling guilty for his sins, Soebagio falls ill and dies soon afterwards. Because of their debts, their home and belongings are repossessed, leaving Soegiati to fend for herself.

Though wealthy, Achmad and Idris refuse to take Soegiati in, fearing their respective wives Moedjenah (Titing) and Mariam (Ning-Nong). Soepinah and her husband Bakar (<a href="Koesbini">Koesbini</a>) are willing to take her in, but they live in poverty. Unwilling to burden them, ultimately Soegiati decides to leave and find her own way, depending on the kindness of strangers. Years pass, and Soemadi returns from exile. Encountering his mother, who now lives in poverty, he decides to take revenge on his brothers.

The <a href="Malang">Malang</a>-based <a href="Majestic%20Film%20Company">Majestic Film Company</a> announced "Air Mata Iboe" in June 1941 together with two other films, "Boedi Terbenam" ("Hidden Wisdom") and "Bachtera Karam" ("Wrecked Ark"). Production began soon afterwards and, by early December 1941, over 55 reels had been shot, as well as 60 sound reels.

"Air Mata Iboe" was written and directed by <a href="Njoo%20Cheong%20Seng">Njoo Cheong Seng</a> under his penname M. d'Amour; he had previously directed "<a href="Djantoeng%20Hati">Djantoeng Hati</a>" ("Heart and Soul"; 1941), which also had a tragic ending, for the company. The film was produced by the company's owner, <a href="Fred%20Young%20%28director%29">Fred Young</a>. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young (no relation to Fred), Rd Ismail, Ali Sarosa, and Ali Joego. Other roles were held by established singers of "<a href="keroncong">keroncong</a>" (traditional music with Portuguese influences), including Soerip, Titing, Soelami, Ning Nong, and Poniman. The film, which used make-up to make Fifi Young age into an old woman over the course of its plot, was the actress' first for Majestic; she had been ill during the production of her husband's debut for the company.

The <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> film featured eleven "keroncong" songs written by <a href="music%20director">music director</a> R. Koesbini, who also had a role in the film. Backing music was provided by Koesbini's troupe, the Krontjong Syncopaters, while songs were performed by the cast. Notes and lyrics for the film's <a href="title%20song">title song</a>, "Air Mata Iboe", were published in the December 1941 edition of "Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film".

"Air Mata Iboe", which was rated for all ages, was distributed by <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> and premiered at Sampoerna Theatre in <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> on 24 December 1941. Also advertised under the Dutch title "Tranen Eener Moeder" (a literal translation from Malay), the film was promoted as a "musical extravaganza"; other advertisements emphasised the size of the cast. An anonymous review in the "<a href="Soerabaijasch%20Handelsblad">Soerabaijasch Handelsblad</a>" noted the extensive use of "keroncong" and praised the acting and singing, suggesting that <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> audiences would flock to see the film.

"Air Mata Iboe" was the last film produced by Majestic Film Company, which closed following the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a>. During the occupation Njoo, Fifi Young, and Fred Young established their own travelling theatrical troupe, Pantjawarna, though all returned to cinema in the 1950s. Joego likewise returned to film after spending the occupation in theater. Poniman, Sarosa, Ismail, and Soerip all returned to cinema, the men in the 1950s and Soerip in 1973. Soelami is not recorded as acting in any further productions.

A <a href="Air%20Mata%20Ibu">remake</a> of "Air Mata Iboe" was produced in 1957, after Indonesia had <a href="Proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">obtained its independence</a>. Directed by Fred Young, the film had Fifi Young retake her role as Sugiati, while Rd Ismail took the role of Subagio. The remake's other cast members had not appeared in the original film. The sons Achmad, Idris, and Soemadi were portrayed by <a href="Sukarno%20M.%20Noor">Sukarno M. Noor</a>, <a href="Boes%20Boestami">Boes Boestami</a>, and Kamsul, respectively. The couple's daughter, renamed Atikah, was played by <a href="Farida%20Arriany">Farida Arriany</a>.

"Air Mata Iboe" may be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. As elsewhere at the time, films in the Dutch East Indies were shot on highly unstable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a>, and after a fire destroyed much of <a href="Produksi%20Film%20Negara">Produksi Film Negara</a>'s warehouse in 1952, earlier films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> wrote that all Indonesian films made before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the <a href="Netherlands%20Government%20Information%20Service">Netherlands Government Information Service</a>.

Panggilan Darah

Panggilan Darah (Indonesian for "Call of Blood") is a 1941 film from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (now <a href="Cinema%20of%20Indonesia%23History">Indonesia</a>) written and directed by <a href="Sutan%20Usman%20Karim">Sutan Usman Karim</a> and produced by <a href="Tjho%20Seng%20Han">Tjho Seng Han</a> for <a href="Oriental%20Film">Oriental Film</a>. The <a href="black%20and%20white">black-and-white</a> film starred <a href="Dhalia">Dhalia</a> and <a href="Soerip">Soerip</a> as orphaned sisters trying to make a living in the colonial capital of <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) before moving to <a href="Kudus%2C%20Kudus">Kudus</a> to work at a <a href="kretek">clove cigarette</a> factory.

Shot on location at an orphanage and two factories in <a href="central%20Java">central Java</a>, "Panggilan Darah" was a modest commercial success in the Indies and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. Its soundtrack, which featured nine "<a href="kroncong">kroncong</a>" songs, received popular acclaim, and the film's acting received critical praise. Despite this success, Oriental was unable to recoup its expenses, and merged into Multi Film soon afterwards. "Panggilan Darah", which was screened as late as 1952, may now be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

Orphaned sisters Dhalia and Soerip (themselves) leave their village in an attempt to make a living in the colonial capital of Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>). After a long period of misery, they are accepted as housemaids at the home of <a href="Hajji">Hajji</a> Iskak (Mochtar Widjaja). Although initially elated, they find that Iskak's wife (Wolly Sutinah) is a cruel mistress who often beats them. Meanwhile, Iskak's would-be son-in-law is constantly flirting with Dhalia, much to his fiancée's dismay.

The sisters decide to run away from Iskak's home. They make their way to <a href="Kudus%2C%20Kudus">Kudus</a> and find work at the Nitisemito <a href="kretek">clove cigarette</a> factory with the help of their friend (<a href="S.%20Poniman">S. Poniman</a>). Not long after their escape, Iskak receives a guest who reveals that the two were his nieces. This revelation spurs Iskak to take out advertisements in newspapers, looking for the young women and asking them to return to Batavia.

Iskak's search has little success until the sisters receive news that he is looking for them, and they quickly return to Batavia. There, the sisters are greeted with open arms. Iskak's wife regrets her earlier treatment of the girls and repents, treating them splendidly and supporting Dhalia's plans to open an orphanage.

"Panggilan Darah" was the <a href="film%20director">directorial</a> debut of <a href="Sutan%20Usman%20Karim">Sutan Usman Karim</a>, commonly known as Suska, a journalist and former member of the touring theatrical group Bolero under <a href="Andjar%20Asmara">Andjar Asmara</a>. With "Panggilan Darah", which he also wrote, Suska became one of several reporters who entered the film industry in the 1940s. He directed the film for the Batavia-based film company <a href="Oriental%20Film">Oriental</a>, run by the <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> producer Tjho Seng Han. The production house had previously released three films, all directed by <a href="Njoo%20Cheong%20Seng">Njoo Cheong Seng</a>, but after Njoo departed for <a href="Fred%20Young%20%28director%29">Fred Young</a>'s Majestic, Oriental had required a new director.

The film was shot in <a href="black%20and%20white">black and white</a> by the <a href="Indo%20people">Indo</a> cameraman J. J. W. Steffens, with editing handled by Soemardjan. Scenes were shot at an orphanage for Muslims owned by S. Z. Gunawan (who played herself in the film), as well as at the Nitisemito cigarette factory in Kudus and at a <a href="batik">batik</a> factory in <a href="Pekalongan">Pekalongan</a> owned by Tan Jauw Lin. Writing in 2009, the Indonesian film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> suggested that the film may have been partly sponsored by Nitisemito—one of the largest cigarette factories in the Indies in the 1940s—based on the factory's prominence in the plot.

Dhalia, Soerip, and S. Poniman, already known for their singing prowess, starred in "Panggilan Darah", which featured nine "<a href="kroncong">kroncong</a>" songs. Additional roles were taken by Wolly Sutinah and Mochtar Widjaja. The film marked Sutinah's debut for the company; the other cast members had previous screen credits with Oriental.

"Panggilan Darah" debuted at the Orion Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941. It was reported as a modest success, making most of its money from lower class audiences. It was screened in <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, East Java, by August, and by September it had been shown in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, then part of <a href="British%20Malaya">British Malaya</a>. A <a href="novelization">novelisation</a> by <a href="Roestam%20Sutan%20Palindih">Roestam Sutan Palindih</a> was published by the <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>-based Kolff-Buning Publishers that year.

Reviews of "Panggilan Darah" were mixed to positive. The journalist Soerono, writing in the entertainment magazine "Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film", was pleased with the film's depiction of the <a href="Islam%20and%20children%23Orphaned%20children">Islamic mandate</a> to take care of orphans. An anonymous review in the Surabaya-based daily "<a href="Soerabaijasch%20Handelsblad">Soerabaijasch Handelsblad</a>" found the film "something special" and praised Soerip's spontaneity in her role. Biran wrote that lower-class audiences enjoyed the film's music, while the <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> scoffed at the idea that a factory supervisor would bring a guitar to work. He found the plot illogical, asking why the sisters would not have worked in their own home village and how the destitute sisters could have made the journey from Batavia to Kudus, over away.

Unable to recoup its expenses, Oriental later merged into the Dutch-owned Multi Film and ceased producing works of fiction. Suska left the company and joined <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>'s Java Industrial Film, for which he directed "<a href="Ratna%20Moetoe%20Manikam">Ratna Moetoe Manikam</a>". Most of the cast remained active in cinema for the remainder of their lives. Both Dhalia and Soerip remained in the film industry for the next fifty years; they acted in their last feature films, "<a href="Pendekar%20Jagad%20Kelana">Pendekar Jagad Kelana</a>" ("Warrior of Jagad Kelana") and "<a href="Sejak%20Cinta%20Diciptakan">Sejak Cinta Diciptakan</a>" ("Since Love was Created") respectively, in 1990. Poniman and Sutinah would remain active in the industry until 1975 and 1986. Only Widjaja is not recorded as performing in any more films.

"Panggilan Darah" was screened as late as August 1952, but may now be <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a>, and after a fire destroyed much of <a href="Produksi%20Film%20Negara">Produksi Film Negara</a>'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. The American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, J. B. Kristanto's "<a href="Katalog%20Film%20Indonesia">Katalog Film Indonesia</a>" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the <a href="Netherlands%20Government%20Information%20Service">Netherlands Government Information Service</a>.

Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom

Mom & Me & Mom (2013) is the seventh and final book in author <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s series of <a href="autobiography">autobiographies</a>. The book was published shortly before <a href="Mother%27s%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Mother's Day</a> and Angelou's 85th birthday. It focuses, for the first time in her books, on Angelou's relationship with her mother, Vivian Baxter. The book explains Baxter's behavior, especially Baxter's abandonment of Angelou and Angelou's older brother when they were young children, and fills in "what are possibly the final blanks in Angelou's eventful life". The book also chronicles Angelou's reunion and reconciliation with Baxter.

"Mom & Me & Mom" is an overview of Angelou's life and revisits many of the same anecdotes she relates in her previous books. The first section, entitled "Mom & Me", centers on Angelou's early years, before the age of 17, and her transition from resentment and distrust of her mother to acceptance, support, and love towards her. After Baxter helps her through the birth of her son, Angelou goes from calling Baxter "Lady" to "Mom". In the book's second section, entitled "Me & Mom", Angelou chronicles the unconditional love, support, and assistance they gave to each other, as Baxter helps her through single motherhood, a failed marriage, and career ups and downs. As she had begun to do in "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>", and continued throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long traditions of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. Angelou was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer". She had also become "a major autobiographical voice of the time".

Like Angelou's previous autobiographies," Mom & Me & Mom" received mostly positive reviews. Most reviewers state that Baxter is presented well in the book. Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother, who comes across "as a street-smart, caring woman who shaped the author's life and legacy by her words and example". The book has been called "a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion, and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond".

Pictures of Angelou, Baxter, and members of their family appear through the book and enhance the text. An audio version, read by Angelou, was released in CD form and as a digital download.

"Mom & Me & Mom" (2013) is the seventh of <a href="Maya%20Angelou">Maya Angelou</a>'s series of <a href="autobiographies">autobiographies</a>. It was completed 11 years after the publication of her previous autobiography, "<a href="A%20Song%20Flung%20Up%20to%20Heaven">A Song Flung Up to Heaven</a>" (2002), and over thirty years after she wrote her first autobiography, "<a href="I%20Know%20Why%20the%20Caged%20Bird%20Sings">I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a>" (1969). "Mom & Me & Mom", in which Angelou relates her relationship with her mother Vivian Baxter, was published shortly before <a href="Mother%27s%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Mother's Day</a> and Angelou's 85th birthday. In the time period between the publication of her sixth and seventh autobiographies, Angelou was the first African-American woman and living poet selected by <a href="Sterling%20Publishing">Sterling Publishing</a>, who placed 25 of her poems in a volume of their "Poetry for Young People" series in 2004. In 2009, Angelou wrote "We Had Him", a poem about <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a>, which was read by <a href="Queen%20Latifah">Queen Latifah</a> at his funeral, and wrote "His Day is Done", a poem honoring <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> after his death in 2013. She published a book of essays, "<a href="Letter%20to%20My%20Daughter">Letter to My Daughter</a>", in 2009, and two cookbooks, "<a href="Hallelujah%21%20The%20Welcome%20Table">Hallelujah! The Welcome Table</a>" in 2004 and "<a href="Great%20Food%2C%20All%20Day%20Long">Great Food, All Day Long</a>" in 2010. During this period, she was awarded the Lincoln Medal in 2008 and the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2011.

Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women and was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, "without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer". She had also become "a major autobiographical voice of the time". Angelou was one of the first African-American female writers to publicly discuss her personal life, and one of the first to use herself as a central character in her books. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called her first autobiography "a work of art that eludes description", stated that Angelou's series set a precedent not only for other Black women writers, but for the genre of autobiography as a whole. Scholar <a href="Hilton%20Als">Hilton Als</a> called Angelou one of the "pioneers of self-exposure", willing to focus honestly on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, "<a href="Gather%20Together%20in%20My%20Name">Gather Together in My Name</a>", she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and to "be honest about it".

For the first time, Angelou focuses on her relationship with her mother in this book, and fills in what reviewer Fiona Sturges calls "possibly the final blanks in Angelou's eventful life". According to Candace Smith, who reviewed the audio version of the book for "Booklist", Angelou and Baxter's relationship was "touched upon but never fully described" in "Caged Bird", but "Mom & Me & Mom" explains Baxter's actions, especially the reasons she sent Angelou and her older brother Bailey to live with their grandmother in <a href="Stamps%2C%20Arkansas">Stamps, Arkansas</a>. The book also chronicles Angelou's initial uncomfortable reunion and eventual reconciliation with Baxter. Pictures of Baxter, Angelou, and their family and close friends appear throughout the book and enhance the text. An audio version of the book, read by Angelou, was released in CD form and as a digital download.

Angelou explains in the book's prologue why she wrote the book, which was to explain how she became, despite being born poor, Black, and female, a renowned author and poet. The book is divided into two sections: the first 13 chapters are grouped into the first section, called "Mom & Me", and the remaining chapters make up the second section, called "Me & Mom". Angelou thanks her mother, "who generously taught me how to be a mother", which allowed her to dedicate the book to her son, Guy Bailey Johnson, whom she calls "one of the most courageous and generous men I know".

Angelou's mother, Vivian Baxter, was born in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, at the turn of the 20th century, the oldest of six children of her <a href="Trinidadian%20Creole">Trinidadian</a> father and her Irish mother. Baxter's family was violent, yet religious and musical. Baxter, "who was to remain a startling beauty", met Angelou's father, Bailey Johnson, a dietitian and cook, in 1924, upon Johnson's return from serving in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. They married and moved to California, where Angelou and her older brother, Bailey, Jr., were born. When she was three and Bailey was five, their parents divorced and sent their children, by train with identification tags and no adult supervision, to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson, in Stamps, Arkansas.

Angelou and her brother lived with their grandmother and her son, Uncle Willie, until Angelou was thirteen. They briefly visited their mother in St. Louis, but at the age of eight Angelou was raped, and in retaliation the rapist was killed by members of her family. She felt so guilty for his death that she chose to stop talking to everyone but Bailey for several years. They were sent back to Stamps, but when Bailey turned 14, they returned to their mother's care in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> for his protection. At first, Angelou was resistant and angry towards her mother for abandoning her and Bailey, choosing to call her "Lady", and it took her several years to warm to her.

One summer, Bailey and Angelou made separate trips to visit their father in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, in what "<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>" called "a seriously ugly meeting". Angelou did not get along with her stepmother. During her visit, her father took Angelou to Mexico; he became so drunk, she had to drive him back across the border, even though she had never driven a car before. When they returned to San Diego, Angelou's stepmother cut Angelou with a pair of scissors during an argument. Angelou chose to live on the streets until her wound was healed. When she returned to San Francisco, she decided she wanted a job as a streetcar conductor; at first, she was not hired because she was Black, but upon her mother's encouragement, she was persistent with the streetcar company until she became the first Black to work on the railway. Baxter provided security by following Angelou with a pistol.

When Angelou was seventeen, she became pregnant after a one-time encounter with a neighbor boy. She told Bailey, who advised her to hide it from their mother and stepfather until she graduated from high school. Three weeks before the birth of her son, she told them. Baxter's reaction was to run a bath; as Angelou said, "In our family, for some unknown reason, we consider it an honor to run a bath, to put in bubbles and good scents for another person". Baxter helped Angelou through the birth; from then on, Angelou began to call her "Mother", and later, "Mom".

The rest of the book consists of a series of anecdotes about the ways that Baxter supported and accepted her daughter and continued to win her love and respect, through unwed motherhood, a failed marriage, and career ups and downs. Angelou relates several stories of Baxter, including her support of Angelou as an independent single mother, her life-saving intervention after a jealous ex-boyfriend beat Angelou, and her initial resistance and then acceptance of Angelou's first marriage to Greek sailor Tosh Angelos. Angelou recounts the beginning of her career as a dancer and entertainer in San Francisco; Baxter cared for her grandson as Angelou traveled Europe as a member of the Gershwin opera "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>". Angelou felt so guilty about leaving her son that she returned and resumed her relationship with her mother and son, eventually moving to New York City and starting a new career as a writer and poet.

Angelou relates, with pride, her mother's social activities, in the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Eastern%20Star">Order of the Eastern Star</a> and black women's charitable organizations in <a href="Stockton%2C%20California">Stockton, California</a>, as well as her career as one of the first black female <a href="merchant%20mariners">merchant mariners</a>. At one point, Baxter drops everything and comes to her daughter's aid while Angelou was working on a movie in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. Baxter supports Angelou's decision to live in Africa for a while and then, after Angelou returned to the U.S., to become a teacher at <a href="Wake%20Forest%20University">Wake Forest University</a> in <a href="Winston-Salem%2C%20North%20Carolina">Winston-Salem, North Carolina</a>. Angelou describes Baxter's marriage, late in her life, to Angelou's fourth stepfather, whom Baxter called her greatest love and who was Angelou's favorite. There is a difficult scene between Angelou and her brother, who despite his seemingly easy reentry into their mother's life when they were teenagers (she calls them "the new lovers"), had descended into struggles with drug abuse.

Angelou closes "Mom & Me & Mom" with a description of Vivian Baxter's death in 1991, and of Angelou's final words to her on her deathbed. In 1995, the city of Stockton honored Baxter for her many years of service by naming a park after her.

Starting with "Caged Bird", Angelou made a deliberate attempt while writing all her autobiographies, including "Mom & Me & Mom", to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Her use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and thematic development has often led reviewers to categorize her books as <a href="autobiographical%20fiction">autobiographical fiction</a>. Valerie Sayers, in her review of "Mom & Me & Mom" in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", calls Angelou's books memoirs because of their limited focus, but praises her for describing what it was like to grow up Black in "<a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow</a> America". Sayers states: "She manages to fully reveal that national sore without picking at it, a neat trick that...requires considerable restraint and her own steely goodwill". Angelou stated in a 1989 interview that she was the only "serious" writer to choose the genre to express herself. As critic Susan Gilbert stated, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar <a href="Selwyn%20R.%20Cudjoe">Selwyn R. Cudjoe</a> agreed, and viewed Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that spoke for an entire group of people. Angelou's editor <a href="Robert%20Loomis">Robert Loomis</a> was able to convince her to write "Caged Bird" by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered "high art", which she continued throughout her series. Although Angelou was successful, she was, as Sayers insisted, smart and gifted enough to write for any audience, but chose not to write for "a highbrow literary audience", but for "readers as open, playful and straightforward as herself".

Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme. In a 1983 interview with African-American literature critic <a href="Claudia%20Tate">Claudia Tate</a>, Angelou called her books autobiographies. When speaking of her unique use of the genre, she acknowledged that she has followed the <a href="slave%20narrative">slave narrative</a> tradition of "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". Angelou recognized that there were fictional aspects to all her books; she tended to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". Her approach paralleled the conventions of many African-American autobiographies written during the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> period in the US, when truth was often censored for purposes of self-protection. Author Lyman B. Hagen has placed Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but insisted that she has created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.

In a 1998 interview with journalist <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a>, Angelou discussed her writing process, and "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs. When asked if she changed the truth to improve her story, she stated, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about." Although Angelou has never admitted to changing the facts in her stories, she has used these facts to make an impact with the reader. As Hagen stated, "One can assume that 'the essence of the data' is present in Angelou's work". Hagen also stated that Angelou "fictionalizes, to enhance interest". Angelou's long-time editor, Robert Loomis, states that she could rewrite any of her books by changing the order of her facts to make a different impact on the reader. Like "Caged Bird", the events in "Mom & Me & Mom" and the rest of her autobiographies are episodic and crafted as a series of short stories, yet do not follow a strict chronology, something that Angelou uses to compel her readers forward. Sayers agrees, saying that Angelou pays little attention to chronological order in the book. Sayers also states, "Time races through this narrative". Major characters, like Angelou's stepfather Daddy Clidell, disappear after their initial mention. Even though Angelou repeats many anecdotes found in her earlier autobiographies, the focus in "Mom & Me & Mom" is on her mother; according to reviewer Stacy Russo, "that focus makes this a distinct addition to Angelou's autobiographical writings". Reviewer Pam Kingsbury, who highly recommended the book for all audiences, stated those familiar with Angelou's previous works "will be rewarded with a more complete picture of her life", while new readers "will discover a well-crafted and insightful introduction to the author".

Critics have judged "Mom & Me & Mom" and Angelou's other autobiographies "in light of the first", and "Caged Bird" generally receives the highest praise. Marjorie Kehe of "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>", considers the book" "a sequel to "Caged Bird."" "Many of the events described in Angelou's previous autobiographies are revisited in this one, some with more detail than others, such as her period of homelessness, which was described in "Caged Bird," and her serious beating by her jealous boyfriend, which was first disclosed in "Letter to My Daughter" (2008), Angelou's third book of essays. According to Fiona Sturges, who reviewed "Mom & Me & Mom" in the British publication "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", "As in her previous books, these tales are told with clear-sightedness and an absence of self-pity, and they are no less grim for their familiarity. Angelou has never been one for florid prose, and here she maintains a precise and economical style which makes these bleak moments more vivid, like a film from which you can't look away". Sayers states that major dramatic events, such as the incident when Angelou was beaten, "are delivered without much amplification or further reference".

Angelou describes her writing process as regimented. Beginning with "Caged Bird", she has used the same "writing ritual" for many years. She gets up at five in the morning and checks into a hotel room, where the staff has been instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She writes on legal pads while lying on the bed, with a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play <a href="solitaire">solitaire</a>, "<a href="Roget%27s%20Thesaurus">Roget's Thesaurus</a>", and the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, and leaves by the early afternoon. She averages 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. Angelou goes through this process to "enchant" herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a>, to "relive the agony, the anguish, the "<a href="Sturm%20und%20Drang">Sturm und Drang</a>"". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in "Caged Bird", to "tell the human truth" about her life. Angelou has stated that she plays cards to reach that place of enchantment, to access her memories more effectively. She has stated, "It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it—ha! It's so delicious!" She does not find the process cathartic; rather, she has found relief in "telling the truth".

"Mom & Me & Mom" debuted at number 8 on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20bestseller%20list">"The New York Times" bestseller list</a> the week of its release, 21 April 2013. The book, like Angelou's previous autobiographies, received mostly positive reviews. Fiona Sturges, who reviews the book in the British publication "The Independent", and reviewer Stacy Russo of "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>" both state that Angelou's readers would recognize many of the passages in "Mom & Me & Mom" from her earlier autobiographies. <a href="Bernardine%20Evaristo">Bernardine Evaristo</a> of the British publication "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", in one of the few negative reviews of "Mom & Me & Mom", calls the book "a slight, anecdotal and badly edited book that rehashes stories from previous memoirs". Evaristo questions the veracity of Angelou's anecdotes, and states that some of them contradict earlier versions. Evaristo also believes that "Mom & Me & Mom" undermines "Caged Bird", which she calls "a ground-breaking triumph".

According to reviewer Heid Erdrich, "Mom & Me & Mom" does not center on Angelou's childhood trauma, as described in "Caged Bird", but "rather constructs a portrait of self via details of her relationship to the mother who abandoned her and with whom she reunited as a teenager". Erdrich states that Angelou's prose is "very simply written", and calls her tone "mostly light, even sweet, filled with affection for her younger self". Erdrich states that even though it could have been written for young women experiencing the same difficulties Angelou faced, the book does not preach, but "presents Angelou’s life path scattered with enormous obstacles endured and conquered through knowledge of self and a singular brand of mother love". "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" agrees, stating, "The lessons and love presented here will speak to those trying to make their way in the world". Erdrich also states that Angelou's narrative of her "hard-won love for her extraordinary mother" is compelling, and that Angelou portrays Baxter "as extraordinarily self-aware, liberated from what others might think, and independent beyond any feminist of her era" and "the stuff of fiction but real and responsible in unexpected ways for the gift of her talented daughter".

Most critics feel that Baxter is presented well in "Mom & Me & Mom". Candace Smith, who reviews the audio version of the book, states that Angelou celebrates the unconditional acceptance and support of her mother, who comes across "as a street-smart, caring woman who shaped the author's life and legacy by her words and example". Vanessa Bush of "<a href="Booklist">Booklist</a>" calls the book a "loving recollection of a complicated relationship" and a "remarkable and deeply revealing chronicle of love and healing". Russo states that the book is "a beautiful tribute to Baxter's independent, vibrant, and courageous spirit". Evaristo disagrees, and states that Baxter comes across as "less rounded, less interesting, more sanctified and less credible" than Angelou describes her elsewhere. Sturges calls the book "a profoundly moving tale of separation and reunion, and an ultimately optimistic portrait of the maternal bond". The most interesting part of the book, according to Sturges, is "Angelou's casual overturning of the idea of the mother who abandons her children as monstrous and inhumane". Sturges also says that Baxter is presented as unapologetic, charismatic, independent, and resilient, traits that "have seemingly been passed on to her daughter". Reviewer Valerie Sayers insists that the scenes that depict Angelou's "halting steps" towards her forgiveness and acceptance of her mother are among the best in the book. Sayers labels "Mom & Me & Mom" "an account of forgiveness", and like Angelou and Baxter, "just revealing enough, and pretty irresistible". Like her mother expected from her, Angelou expects her readers to move past their resentments and "whatever was unbearable". Sayers also calls both Baxter and Angelou "a Large Dramatic Presence", and says that Angelou matches her mother's spirit.

According to Sayers, the book contains Angelou's "trademark good humor and fierce optimism". "Kirkus Reviews" states that true to Angelou's style, her writing "cuts to the chase with compression and simplicity", and that it contains a "<a href="Calypso%20music">calypso</a> smoothness, flurries and showers of musicality between the moments of wickedness". Kirkus also calls the book a "tightly strung, finely tuned memoir". According to Candace Smith in her review of the book's audio version, Angelou performs it "in her characteristic slow and thoughtful tones, and with careful enunciation". Although some of her anecdotes are painful to hear, Angelou is "unquestionably honest". Smith also states, "Although her voice doesn't show much outward emotion, her words are so powerful and the stories so fascinating that we remain riveted".

Most critics agreed that the book would be popular with readers familiar with Angelou's writings and to her new readers. Marjorie Kehe of The Christian Science Monitor, who calls it "a story of redemption" and "a tender read and a lovely tribute", anticipates that Angelou's readers would delight in it. Russo predicts that due to Angelou's popularity and "approachable writing", the book would have wide appeal for many readers.

Hu Zhengyan

Hu Zhengyan (; 15841674) was a Chinese artist, printmaker and publisher. He worked in <a href="Chinese%20calligraphy">calligraphy</a>, <a href="Chinese%20painting">traditional Chinese painting</a>, and <a href="Seal%20%28East%20Asia%29">seal-carving</a>, but was primarily a publisher, producing academic texts as well as records of his own work.

Hu lived in <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a> during the transition from the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a> to the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a>. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the <a href="Hongguang%20Emperor">Hongguang Emperor</a>, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal <a href="Seal%20%28East%20Asia%29">seal</a>, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various <a href="Color%20printing%23China">multi-colour printing</a> and <a href="Paper%20embossing">embossing</a> techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form.

Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled "The Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy", an artist's primer which remained in print for around 200 years. His studio also published seal catalogues, academic and medical texts, books on poetry, and decorative writing papers. Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers.

Hu was born in <a href="Xiuning%20County">Xiuning County</a>, <a href="Anhui%20Province">Anhui Province</a> in 1584 or early 1585. Both his father and elder brother Zhengxin (, <a href="art%20name">art name</a> Wusuo, ) were physicians, and after he turned 30 he travelled with them while they practised medicine in the areas around <a href="Lu%27an">Lu'an</a> and <a href="Huoshan%20County">Huoshan</a>. It is commonly stated that Zhengyan himself was also a doctor, though the earliest sources attesting to this occur only in the second half of the 19th century.

By 1619, Hu had moved to Nanjing where he lived with his wife Wu. Their home on Jilongshan (, now also known as <a href="Beiji%20Ge">Beiji Ge</a>), a hill located just within the northern <a href="City%20Wall%20of%20Nanjing">city wall</a>, served as a meeting-house for like-minded artists. Hu named it the Ten Bamboo Studio ("Shizhuzhai", ), after the ten bamboo plants that grew in front of the property. It functioned as the headquarters for his printing business, where he employed ten artisans including his two brothers Zhengxin and Zhengxing (, art name Zizhu, ) and his sons Qipu () and Qiyi (, courtesy name ).

During Hu's lifetime, the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a>, which had ruled China for over 250 years, was <a href="Qing%20conquest%20of%20the%20Ming">overthrown and replaced</a> by China's last imperial dynasty, the <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing</a>. Following the fall of the capital <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> in 1644, remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a <a href="Southern%20Ming">Ming loyalist regime</a> in <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a> with <a href="Zhu%20Yousong">Zhu Yousong</a> on the throne as the Hongguang Emperor. Hu, who was noted for his seal-carving and facility with <a href="seal%20script">seal script</a>, created a <a href="Seal%20%28East%20Asia%29">seal</a> for the new Emperor. The court offered him the position of Drafter for the Secretariat ("zhongshu sheren", ) as a reward, but he did not accept the role (although he did accord himself the title of "zhongshu sheren" in some of his subsequent personal seals).

According to Wen Ruilin's "Lost History of the South" ("Nanjiang Yishi", ), prior to the <a href="Qing%20conquest%20of%20the%20Ming%23Jiangnan">Qing invasion of Nanjing</a> Hu studied at <a href="Nanjing%20University">the National University</a> there, and whilst a student was employed by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Rites">Ministry of Rites</a> to record official proclamations; he produced the "Imperial Promotion of Minor Learning" ("Qin Ban Xiaoxue", ) and the "Record of Displayed Loyalty" ("Biaozhong Ji", ) as part of this work. As a result, he was promoted to the Ministry of Personnel and gained admittance to the <a href="Hanlin%20Academy">Hanlin Academy</a>, but before he could take up this appointment, Beijing had fallen to the <a href="Manchu">Manchu</a> rebellion. Since contemporaneous biographies (Wen's work was not published until 1830) make no mention of these events, it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu's death.

Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646, after the end of the Ming dynasty. <a href="Xiao%20Yuncong">Xiao Yuncong</a> and <a href="L%C3%BC%20Liuliang">Lü Liuliang</a> recorded visiting him during his later years, in 1667 and 1673 respectively. He died in poverty at the age of 90, sometime around late 1673 or early 1674.

Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries. His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a>, and he followed the <a href="Huizhou%20%28region%29">Huizhou</a> school of carving founded by his contemporary <a href="He%20Zhen%20%28artist%29">He Zhen</a>. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear compositional structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals.

Hu's work was known outside his local area. <a href="Zhou%20Lianggong">Zhou Lianggong</a>, a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur, stated in his "Biography of Seal-Carvers" ("Yinren Zhuan", ) that Hu "creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure", implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing.

In 1644, Hu took it upon himself to create a new <a href="Heirloom%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Imperial seal</a> for the Hongguang Emperor, which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer. He presented his creation with an essay, the "Great Exhortation of the Seal" ("Dabao Zhen", ), in which he bemoaned the loss of the <a href="Chongzhen%20Emperor">Chongzhen Emperor</a>'s seal and begged Heaven's favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally-footed couplets ("pianti", ) used in the <a href="Imperial%20examination">Imperial examination</a>s, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court.

Despite his reputation as an artist and seal-carver, Hu was primarily a publisher. His publishing house, the Ten Bamboo Studio, produced reference works on calligraphy, poetry and art; medical textbooks; books on etymology and phonetics; and copies of as well as commentaries on the <a href="Four%20Books%20and%20Five%20Classics%23Four%20Books">Confucian Classics</a>. Unlike other publishers in the area, the Ten Bamboo Studio did not publish works of narrative fiction such as plays or novels. This bias towards academia was likely a consequence of the studio's location: the mountain on which Hu took up residence was just to the north of the Nanjing <a href="Guozijian">Guozijian</a> (National Academy), which provided a captive market for academic texts. Between 1627 and 1644, the Ten Bamboo Studio produced over twenty printed books of this kind, aimed at a wealthy, literary audience. The studio's earliest publications were medical textbooks, the first of which, "Tested Prescriptions for Myriad Illnesses" ("Wanbing Yanfang", ) was published in 1631 and proved popular enough to be reissued ten years later. Hu's brother Zhengxin was a medical practitioner and appears to have been the author of these books.

During the 1630s the Ten Bamboo Studio also produced political works extolling the rule of the Ming; these included the "Imperial Ming Record of Loyalty" ("Huang Ming Biaozhong Ji", ), a biography of loyal Ming officials, and the "Edicts of the Imperial Ming" ("Huang Ming Zhaozhi", ), a list of Imperial proclamations. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Hu renamed the studio the Hall Rooted in the Past ("Digutang", ) as a sign of his affiliation with the previous dynasty, although the Ten Bamboo imprint continued to be used. Despite Hu's withdrawal from society after 1646, the studio continued to publish well into the Qing dynasty, for the most part focussing on seal impression catalogues showcasing Hu's carving work.

The Ming dynasty had seen considerable advancement in the process of colour printing in China. At his studio, Hu Zhengyan experimented with various forms of <a href="Woodblock%20printing%23Colour">woodblock printing</a>, creating processes for producing <a href="Color%20printing">multi-coloured prints</a> and <a href="Paper%20embossing">embossed</a> printed designs. As a result, he was able to produce some of China's first printed publications in colour, using a block printing technique known as "assorted block printing" ("douban yinshua", ). This system made use of multiple blocks, each carved with a different part of the final image and each bearing a different colour. It was a lengthy, painstaking process, requiring thirty to fifty engraved printing blocks and up to seventy inkings and impressions to create a single image. Hu also employed a related form of multiple-block printing called "set-block printing" ("taoban yinshua", ), which had existed since the <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan period</a> some 200 years earlier but had only recently come into fashion again. He refined these block printing techniques by developing a process for wiping some of the ink off the blocks before printing; this enabled him to achieve gradation and modulation of shades which were not previously possible.

In some images, Hu employed a blind embossing technique (known as "embossed designs" ("gonghua", ) or "embossed blocks" ("gongban", ), using an uninked, imprinted block to stamp designs onto paper. He used this to create white relief effects for clouds and for highlights on water or plants. This was a relatively new process, having been invented by Hu's contemporary <a href="Wu%20Faxiang">Wu Faxiang</a>, who was also a Nanjing-based publisher. Wu had used this technique for the first time in his book "Wisteria Studio Letter Paper" ("Luoxuan Biangu Jianpu", ), published in 1626. Both Hu and Wu used embossing to create decorative writing papers, the sale of which provided a sideline income for the Ten Bamboo Studio.

Hu's most notable work is the "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy" ("Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu", ), an anthology of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, <a href="Bamboo%20painting">bamboo</a>, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well as a collection of artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20bookbinding%23History">"butterfly binding"</a> ("hudie zhuang", ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, we have never been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars."

This volume went on to influence colour printing across China, where it paved the way for the later but better-known "<a href="Manual%20of%20the%20Mustard%20Seed%20Garden">Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden</a>" ("Jieziyuan Huazhuan" ), and also in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in <a href="ukiyo-e">ukiyo-e</a> of the colour woodblock printing process known as "<a href="nishiki-e">nishiki-e</a>" . The popularity of the "Ten Bamboo Studio Manual" was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late <a href="Qing%20dynasty">Qing dynasty</a>.

Hu also produced the work "Ten Bamboo Studio Letter Paper" ("Shizhuzhai Jianpu", ), a collection of paper samples, which made use of the "gonghua" stamped embossing technique to make the illustrations stand out in relief. Whilst primarily a catalogue of decorative writing papers, it also contained paintings of rocks, people, ritual vessels and other subjects. The book was bound in the "wrapped back" ("baobei zhuang", ) style, in which the folio pages are folded, stacked, and sewn along the open edges. Originally published in 1644, it was reissued in four volumes between 1934 and 1941 by <a href="Zheng%20Zhenduo">Zheng Zhenduo</a> and <a href="Lu%20Xun">Lu Xun</a>, and revised and republished again in 1952.

Other works produced by Hu's studio included a reprint of <a href="Zhou%20Boqi">Zhou Boqi</a>'s manual of seal-script calligraphy, "The Six Styles of Calligraphy, Correct and Erroneous" ("Liushu Zheng'e", ) and the related "Necessary Investigations into Calligraphy" ("Shufa Bi Ji", ), which discussed common errors in the formation of characters. With his brother Zhengxin, Hu edited a new introductory edition of the <a href="Chinese%20classics">Confucian classics</a>, entitled "The Standardised Text of the <a href="Four%20Books%20and%20Five%20Classics%23Four%20Books">Four Books</a>, Identified and Corrected" ("Sishu Dingben Bianzheng", ) (1640), giving the correct formation and pronunciation of the text. A similar approach was taken with the "Essentials of the <a href="Thousand%20Character%20Classic">Thousand Character Classic</a> in Six Scripts" ("Qianwen Liushu Tongyao", ) (1663), which Hu compiled with the aid of his calligraphy teacher, Li Deng. It was published after Li's death, partly in homage to him.

The three Hu brothers worked together to collate a student primer on poetry by their contemporary Ye Tingxiu, which was called simply the "Discussion of Poetry" ("Shi Tan", ) (1635). Other works on poetry from the studio included "Helpful Principles to the Subtle Workings of Selected Tang Poems" ("Leixuan Tang Shi Zhudao Weiji", ), which was a compilation of several works on poetry and included <a href="Colophon%20%28publishing%29">colophons</a> by Hu Zhengyan himself.

Among the studio's more obscure publications was a text on <a href="Chinese%20dominoes">Chinese dominoes</a> entitled "Paitong Fuyu" (), written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu Zhengyan.

Shorwell helmet

The Shorwell helmet is an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> helmet from the early to mid-sixth century AD found near <a href="Shorwell">Shorwell</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a> in southern England. It was one of the grave goods of a high-status <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20warfare">Anglo-Saxon warrior</a>, and was found with other objects such as a <a href="pattern-welded">pattern-welded</a> sword and <a href="hanging%20bowl">hanging bowl</a>. One of only six known Anglo-Saxon helmets, alongside those from <a href="Benty%20Grange%20helmet">Benty Grange</a>, <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">Coppergate</a>, <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Wollaston</a>, and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a>, it is the sole example to derive from the continental <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> style rather than the contemporaneous Northern "crested helmets" used in England and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>.

The grave was discovered by members of a <a href="Metal%20detector%23Uses">metal detecting</a> club in May 2004, and <a href="Excavation%20%28archaeology%29">excavated</a> by <a href="Archaeology">archaeologists</a> that November. Ploughing had destroyed much of the surrounding Anglo-Saxon cemetery, leaving this as the only individually identifiable grave. The helmet had fragmented into around 400 pieces, perhaps in part because of <a href="subsoiler">subsoiling</a>, and was originally identified as a "fragmentary iron vessel". Only after it was acquired by the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and reconstructed was it identified as a helmet. It remains in the museum's collection, but as of 2018 is not on display.

Exhibiting hardly any decoration other than a speculative exterior leather covering, the Shorwell helmet was a utilitarian fighting helmet. It was simply and sturdily designed out of eight pieces of riveted iron; its only decorative elements were paired with functional uses. The helmet's plainness belies its significance, for helmets were rare in Anglo-Saxon England, and appear to have been limited to the higher classes. The recovery of only six Anglo-Saxon helmets despite the excavation of thousands of graves suggests that their owners had some status.

The helmet was constructed from eight pieces of iron <a href="rivet">rivet</a>ed together. A brow band, long and wide, encircled the forehead, while a long nose-to-nape band ran from front to back, its surviving back end attached to the inside of the brow band by three rivets. Two long lateral bands extended from above the ears on the brow band to the top of the helmet, attaching to the inside by three rivets on either end. The nose-to-nape and lateral bands were narrowest at the top of the helmet, approximately and wide respectively, flaring outwards near the brow band to and . Four subtriangular infill plates were riveted to the inside of the helmet to cover the remaining gaps. The gaps were almost symmetrical, indicating a particular degree of skill and foresight by its maker. Other than the join of the brow band, probably located at the back, the helmet was symmetrical.

With the possible exception of an exterior leather covering, the Shorwell helmet had very few decorative elements. The nose-to-nape and lateral bands featured thickened edges made by hammering the metal. These ridges may have been decorative, but they may also have been intended to serve as "stop-ribs", preventing edged weapons such as swords from glancing downwards and striking the wearer on the shoulders or face. Three copper alloy rivets are found on the <a href="dexter%20and%20sinister">dexter</a> side of the brow band, surrounded by what may be skin product. These may have functioned to hold an attachment strap, or a cheek guard made of something like <a href="cuir%20bouilli">cuir bouilli</a>. The use of copper alloy rivets, instead of the iron ones used on the rest of the helmet, may reflect a decorative effect reserved for a non-structural element. It is possible that the exterior of the helmet may have been covered in leather or cloth, a decoration possibly indicated on other Frankish helmets, but it is too badly deteriorated for this to be determined. Any such leather could itself have been decorated; the leather or skin coverings of some contemporary <a href="scabbard">scabbard</a>s and sheaths exhibit impressed designs or patterns raised in <a href="relief">relief</a>.

A helmet lining is uncertain, but is possibly indicated by traces of skin product on the interior. The exact nature of the skin product, let alone its purpose, is considered ambiguous, and part of it may have been used in relation to a cheek guard. Leather linings have also been suggested for some <a href="Late%20Roman%20ridge%20helmet">Late Roman</a> and Anglo-Saxon helmets, which could also explain some of the traces in the Shorwell example. If so, this would likely have been used in conjunction with removable padding to increase comfort and protection.

The Shorwell helmet is dated to approximately 500–550 AD, based on comparisons with similar helmets and the associated grave goods. It is one of only <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet%23Anglo-Saxon">six Anglo-Saxon helmets</a> known, but it represents a different tradition; the <a href="Benty%20Grange%20helmet">Benty Grange</a>, <a href="Sutton%20Hoo%20helmet">Sutton Hoo</a>, <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">Coppergate</a>, <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Wollaston</a>, and <a href="Staffordshire%20helmet">Staffordshire</a> helmets are all examples of the "crested helmets" known in Northern Europe from the sixth through the eleventh centuries, whereas the Shorwell helmet is of the continental <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> style. Other sixth-century helmets found in <a href="Trivi%C3%A8res">Trivières</a>, Belgium, and in <a href="Bretzenheim">Bretzenheim</a>, Germany, appear almost identical. Their construction includes a continuous lateral band in addition to the continuous nose-to-nape band, and a two-piece construction underneath rather than an infill plate for each of the four gaps, potentially an indication of regional variation. Like the northern crested helmets, the continental Frankish examples appear to be derivatives of the <a href="Late%20Roman%20ridge%20helmet">Late Roman ridge helmet</a>s used in Europe during the fourth and fifth centuries AD.

The Shorwell helmet is a barely decorated utilitarian piece. Its only decorative elements are paired with serviceable uses—the flared ends and raised edges of the nose-to-nape and lateral bands are aesthetically pleasing while strengthening the helmet with large overlaps and providing protection from glancing blows, while the three copper alloy rivets were used in association with a strap or cheek flap—suggesting a "fighting helmet" above all. It is simple yet well made and effective, and strong; one of the fragments that has survived best is from the crown of the helmet, where seven pieces of metal overlap in what was intended to be the strongest place.

Helmets were rare in Anglo-Saxon England, and though utilitarian, the Shorwell helmet signified the high status of its owner. Such protection certainly seems to have been among the armament of the well heeled. In the contemporary epic "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>", a poem about kings and nobles, they are relatively common, while the helmeted <a href="Vendel">Vendel</a> and <a href="Valsg%C3%A4rde">Valsgärde</a> graves from the same period in Sweden, thought to be the burials of wealthy non-royals, suggest that helmets were not solely for the use of the absolute élite. Yet thousands of furnished Anglo-Saxon graves have been excavated since the start of the 19th century and helmets remain rare; although this could partly reflect poor rates of artefact survival or even recognition, their extreme scarcity indicates that they were never deposited in great numbers.

The helmet was discovered in November 2004 near <a href="Shorwell">Shorwell</a>, a village on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. The Isle of Wight Metal Detecting Club had discovered Anglo-Saxon grave goods that May, and reported the finds as required by law. Plough-related <a href="subsoiler">subsoiling</a> had severely damaged the graves, leaving only one identifiable. The Isle of Wight Archaeology and Historic Environment Service excavated the grave and found evidence of a high-status male warrior from the early- to mid-sixth century. At the head of the grave were strewn some 400 fragments of iron, initially identified as a "fragmentary iron vessel".

Excavations revealed that the warrior had also been inhumed with other items. An iron <a href="pattern-welded">pattern-welded</a> sword lay lengthwise next to a copper alloy buckle possibly from a sword belt; the sword's silver pommel and scabbard mouthpiece, which was made of gilded copper alloy, were found in the topsoil nearby. Also found were a shield boss with extended grip, the socket of a broken spearhead, a fluted glass vessel, two pieces of flint, and <a href="hanging%20bowl">hanging bowl</a> fragments with bird-shaped mounts. Nearby, and close enough to be considered plough scatter, were a square gold mount inlaid with glass and <a href="garnet">garnet</a>, and, found in 2007, a gold <a href="Merovingian%20dynasty">Merovingian</a> or <a href="Burgundians">Burgundian</a> copy of a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Solidus%20%28coin%29">solidus</a> depicting the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors">Eastern Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Anastasius%20I%20Dicorus">Anastasius I</a>. Although Anastasius I ruled from 491 to 518 AD, the coin is a copy minted in <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>, modern day France, probably around 500 to 580.

The Isle of Wight Museum Service initially expressed interest in obtaining the finds before withdrawing, and the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> acquired the objects in 2006. The <a href="Treasure%20Valuation%20Committee">Treasure Valuation Committee</a>, which appraises finds falling under the scope of the <a href="Treasure%20Act%201996">Treasure Act 1996</a>, valued the entire find—believing the helmet to be a broken vessel—at £3,800. Subsequent finds from the area, such as the gold solidus, have also been acquired by the museum.

The "fragmentary iron vessel" was conserved at the British Museum. It had been located close to where the head of the body would have been, and was reconstructed on the chance that it might be a helmet. In this manner it joined the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> helmet from <a href="Burgh%20Castle%20Roman%20Site">Burgh Castle</a>, mislabelled for two decades as "cauldron fragments", the Anglo-Saxon <a href="Pioneer%20Helmet">Pioneer helmet</a>, first labelled a "bucket", and the Anglo-Saxon <a href="Coppergate%20Helmet">Coppergate helmet</a>, thought at first to be a rock. The fragments were extensively corroded as well as distorted, complicating the restoration; layers of metal had also delaminated in places, requiring that the layers be adhered before they could be joined to adjacent fragments along the broken edges. The pieces were only lightly cleaned to preserve traces of organic remains, and X-rays were first used to sort the fragments by density and curvature. Approximately two-thirds of the helmet was then assembled and adhered, proving it for what it was. The unincorporated fragments were insufficient to account for the missing third of the helmet, suggesting that it had been damaged by ploughing.

The Shorwell helmet is in the collection of the British Museum. As of 2018 it is not on display.

During the early- to mid-sixth century, the Shorwell helmet was interred in the burial of a high-status male warrior. In this period, burials were often accompanied by items including joints of meat, pottery and metal vessels, and in certain cases weaponry. Weapon burials from the fifth and sixth centuries typically included a spear, shield, and sword, and more rarely other weapons, such as axes and arrow-heads. By the seventh century, new types of weapons—such as <a href="seax">seax</a>es and shields with sugar-loaf bosses—were increasingly popular items placed in graves. The choice of items placed in a grave could convey information about the status, wealth, sex, age, and tribal affiliation of the deceased. Broad analysis of graves from the Early Anglo-Saxon period indicates that weapons were overwhelmingly associated with male burials and served as symbols of masculinity; it is extremely rare to find female burials from this time given weapons.

The Isle of Wight is located on the northern side of the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, approximately off the coast of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>. To the southwest of the island is Shorwell, a small village that has seen evidence of human activity since the <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a>, including settlement during the Roman occupation of Britain. The sixth-century helmet found nearby fits within the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>, a period of time once known as the <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">Dark Ages</a> for the paucity of its <a href="Recorded%20history">written record</a>. Two works, supplemented by the finds of archaeologists, are responsible for illuminating the second half of the first millennium in Britain at all, and for suggesting the genesis of the Anglo-Saxon occupation of the Isle of Wight: the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", a collection of <a href="annals">annals</a> recording the history of the Anglo-Saxons, and the "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>", written by the English monk <a href="Bede">Bede</a>.

Decades of <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> invasions preceded the Roman withdrawal from Britain in 410 AD, and decades of invasions followed. Near the middle of the fifth century the invasions begot a degree of <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20settlement%20of%20Britain">permanent Germanic control</a>, when according to a legend that is perhaps grounded in rudimentary fact, the mercenary brothers <a href="Hengist%20and%20Horsa">Hengist and Horsa</a>, recruited from the Germanic tribes by <a href="Vortigern">a British king</a>, turned against him, plundered the island, and established rule in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. At some time, according to an assertion made by Bede and backed up by similarities in the grave goods, the Kentish population seems to have also formed a settlement on the Isle of Wight and another across the <a href="Solent">Solent</a>, near <a href="Southampton%20Water">Southampton Water</a>. A story in the "Chronicle" traces the conquest of the island to <a href="Cerdic">Cerdic</a>, said to be the <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex">king</a> of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> from 519 to 534 AD and to whom the <a href="British%20royal%20family">British royal family</a> still traces its lineage, in 530 AD. Yet Cerdic's putative conquest is even more dubious than his already-questioned existence, and may be a seventh-century tale sprung from political rivalries. What is known is that Kent at the time was the technological hub of Britain and the <a href="bridgehead">bridgehead</a> through which trade from the continent flowed, and that its sixth-century connection with the Isle of Wight supplied the latter with goods and visitors from across the Channel. This state of affairs may account for the goods found in the Shorwell grave, or even the person who was buried with them.

William Hely

<a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal%20%28Australia%29">Air Vice Marshal</a> William Lloyd (Bill) Hely, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">CB</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">AFC</a> (24 August 1909 – 20 May 1970) was a senior commander in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF). He graduated from the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1930 before transferring to the RAAF as a cadet pilot. Hely came to public attention in 1936–37, first when he crashed on a survey flight in the Northern Territory, and later when he undertook two successful missions to locate missing aircraft in the same vicinity. His rescue efforts earned him the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a>. After occupying staff positions during the early years of <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Hely was appointed Officer Commanding <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a> in <a href="Netherlands%20New%20Guinea">Dutch New Guinea</a> in May 1944. Later that year he formed <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 (Army Cooperation) Wing</a>, commanding it during the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a> until the end of the Pacific War.

Hely spent the immediate post-war period on the staff of RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. From 1951 to 1953 he served as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area Command</a> in <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, after which he was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a>. He was <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a> from 1953 to 1956, AOC <a href="Air%20Force%20Training%20Group%20RAAF">Training Command</a> from 1956 to 1957, and Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in Washington, D.C. from 1957 to 1960. He then served as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) for six years, his tenure coinciding with a significant increase in manpower to meet commitments in South East Asia and the demands of a major re-equipment program. Having been promoted acting <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a> in 1953 (<a href="Military%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive</a> in 1956), he was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1964 for his service as AMP. He retired from the Air Force in 1966 and made his home in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, where he died in 1970 at the age of sixty.

The third child of Prosper Frederick Hely, a storekeeper, and his wife Alice (née Lloyd), William Lloyd (Bill) Hely was born on 24 August 1909 at <a href="Wellington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wellington</a>, New South Wales. He was educated to <a href="Intermediate%20Certificate%20%28Australia%29">Intermediate Certificate</a> level at <a href="Mudgee">Mudgee</a>, <a href="Wollongong">Wollongong</a> and <a href="Rozelle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rozelle</a> Public Schools, and at <a href="Fort%20Street%20High%20School">Fort Street High School</a>, Petersham. Leaving school in 1926, he worked as a <a href="clerk">clerk</a> and studied accountancy in his spare time. On 16 February 1927, Hely entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, as one of four cadets sponsored that year by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF), which did not yet have its own officer training college. He graduated as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> on 9 December 1930, and the following day enlisted in the RAAF.

As well as the four graduates the Air Force had enrolled in 1927, budgetary constraints imposed during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> necessitated the transfer from Duntroon to Point Cook of eight other RAAF-sponsored cadets midway through their four-year course, including <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>, <a href="Bill%20Garing">Bill Garing</a> and <a href="Douglas%20Candy">Douglas Candy</a>. Initially ranked <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a>, Hely commenced his flying training course at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20William%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>, Victoria, on 15 January 1931, graduating on 10 December. His early postings as a pilot in 1932 and 1933 were to <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, and <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20William%20Laverton%20Base">RAAF Station Laverton</a>, Victoria. Qualifying in aerial photography, he served at Point Cook from 1933 to 1936. He was then transferred to <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> at Richmond, receiving promotion to <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>.
In April 1936, Hely took command of No. 3 Squadron's North Australia Survey Flight, one of two such <a href="Flight%20%28military%20unit%29">flights</a> formed by the Air Force that month to carry out photographic surveys. Flying a twin-engined <a href="de%20Havilland%20Dragon%20Rapide">de Havilland Dragon Rapide</a> (serial number A3-2), Hely departed Richmond on 11 April for <a href="Port%20Hedland%2C%20Western%20Australia">Port Hedland</a>, which was to be the flight's base for its initial survey work in Western Australia. Over the Northern Territory, between <a href="Newcastle%20Waters%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Newcastle Waters</a> and <a href="Kalkarindji%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Wave Hill</a>, he became lost, ran out of fuel, and had to crash land. He and his crew of two were found by RAAF search aircraft ten days later, on 22 April. <a href="The%20Argus%20%28Australia%29">"The Argus"</a> had reported that "grave fears" were held for their safety, but they were largely uninjured, Hely having suffered cuts and abrasions to his head and leg. The aircraft was badly damaged and had to be transported back to Richmond in pieces. In February 1937, Hely took part in the search for a missing <a href="Stinson%20Model%20A">Stinson</a> airliner that was eventually found in the <a href="McPherson%20Range">McPherson Range</a>, Queensland, five of its seven passengers and crew dead.

For its 1937 aerial survey program, the RAAF formed the Communications and Survey Flight under <a href="No.%201%20Aircraft%20Depot%20RAAF">No. 1 Aircraft Depot</a>'s Recruit Training Squadron at Laverton on 3 May. The flight was divided into Western and Eastern Air Detachments, the former under Hely. Flying a <a href="Tugan%20Gannet">Tugan Gannet</a>, Hely's first task became searching for survey director Sir Herbert Gepp, whose Rapide (A3-2, the same one Hely crash landed the previous year) had gone missing on an inspection flight in the Northern Territory between <a href="Tennant%20Creek">Tennant Creek</a> and <a href="Tanami%20Desert">Tanimi</a>. Hely located the downed Rapide on 23 May, guiding in a ground party that was able to clear a makeshift runway and allow Gepp and his team to take off and resume their journey. On 25 September, Hely was again diverted from survey work to search for a lost plane, this time the <a href="de%20Havilland%20DH.60%20Moth">de Havilland Gipsy Moth</a> of <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Doctor%20Service%20of%20Australia">flying doctor</a> <a href="Clyde%20Fenton">Clyde Fenton</a>, who had gone missing north-east of Newcastle Waters. Hely, once more piloting Rapide A3-2, found the Moth three days later and landed to rescue the lost doctor. Fenton was subsequently quoted as saying "I have only the highest praise for the efficient manner in which Hely conducted a difficult search and the skilful way in which he located me and picked me up". The rescue efforts made Hely one of the RAAF's best-known public figures. Completing his posting to the survey flight, he served as <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> at Laverton in 1938. He was awarded the <a href="Air%20Force%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Air Force Cross</a> on 9 June for "zeal and initiative in searching for Sir Herbert Gepp's party and later for Dr. Fenton when lost in Central Australia". On 29 November 1938, he married secretary Jean McDonald at St Aidan's Anglican Church in <a href="Launceston%2C%20Tasmania">Launceston</a>, Tasmania; the couple would have two daughters. Hely spent the following year in Britain, attending the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover</a>, and was promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> in September.

At the outbreak of World War II, Hely was attached to the operations room at <a href="RAF%20Coastal%20Command">RAF Coastal Command</a>. On his return to Australia in January 1940, he was appointed Staff Officer Plans at RAAF Headquarters, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. In October, he joined the <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, as a delegate to a defence conference in Singapore. The Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese and recommended significant increases in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Hely was promoted to temporary <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> the following January, and was the ranking Air Force delegate at a series of staff talks in <a href="Jakarta">Batavia</a> and Singapore regarding the defence of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. He became Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters in August. His promotion to acting <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a> was announced on 17 February 1942. Two days later, the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Darwin">Japanese bombed</a> <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>, Northern Territory; Hely circulated a memo early the next month to all commands on the lessons learnt from the raid. He was posted to Darwin in May to join <a href="North-Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Western Area</a> headquarters as senior air staff officer, and was granted the temporary rank of group captain in January 1943. Hely returned to RAAF Headquarters in March to become Director of Air Staff Plans.

In May 1944, Hely assumed command of <a href="No.%2072%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 72 Wing</a> at <a href="Merauke">Merauke</a>, Dutch New Guinea, succeeding Group Captain <a href="Allan%20Walters">Allan Walters</a>. Comprising fighter and dive-bomber squadrons, the wing had been established to undertake air defence and patrol tasks in and around <a href="Western%20New%20Guinea%20campaign">western New Guinea</a>. Hely departed Merauke in September 1944 to establish an army cooperation formation, <a href="No.%2084%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 84 Wing</a>, in <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a>, Queensland. It was one of two such wings formed by the RAAF in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific Theatre</a> late in World War II. They were, as described by the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">official history of the RAAF in the Pacific</a>, "essentially non-offensive in character", responsible for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, supply drops to ground forces, spraying <a href="DDT">DDT</a> to combat <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and guiding <a href="Close%20air%20support">close support</a> aircraft to their objectives. The wing could also carry out its own strikes on "<a href="Target%20of%20opportunity">targets of opportunity</a>". No. 84 Wing comprised <a href="No.%205%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 5 (Tactical Reconnaissance) Squadron</a>, <a href="No.%2017%20Air%20Observation%20Post%20Flight%20RAAF">No. 17 Air Observation Post Flight</a>, No. 10 Communication Unit (subsequently renamed <a href="No.%2010%20Local%20Air%20Supply%20Unit%20RAAF">No. 10 Local Air Supply Unit</a>), and No. 39 Operational Base Unit. It deployed to <a href="Torokina">Torokina</a> in October to support Australian troops during the <a href="Bougainville%20Campaign">Bougainville Campaign</a>. No. 5 Squadron, equipped with <a href="CAC%20Boomerang">CAC Boomerang</a>s and <a href="CAC%20Wirraway">Wirraways</a>, was assigned to mark targets for <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">F4U Corsairs</a> of the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Air%20Force">Royal New Zealand Air Force</a>. Between December 1944 and January 1945, the wing lost one Auster, one Wirraway, and one Boomerang on operations. Despite shortages of pilots and equipment, Hely's formation was generally able to keep pace with the army's requirements. By the end of June 1945, it had flown over 4,000 <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s.

Hely relinquished command of No. 84 Wing on 12 August 1945 and returned to RAAF Headquarters in October. He was by this time among a coterie of officers at group captain level, including <a href="Valston%20Hancock">Val Hancock</a>, Alister Murdoch and Bill Garing, earmarked by the <a href="Air%20Board%20%28Australia%29">Australian Air Board</a> for leadership roles in the post-war RAAF, which was to shrink rapidly with demobilisation. At RAAF Headquarters, Hely was appointed Deputy Director of Operations, in which capacity he served on a committee to investigate proposals for an officer training college, later established as <a href="RAAF%20College">RAAF College</a>, Point Cook. Along with Hely, all officers associated with the proposal's examination were former Duntroon students, including the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Bladin">Frank Bladin</a>, the Director of Postings, Group Captain Murdoch, and the Director of Training, Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Another Duntroon graduate, Air Commodore Hancock, became the college's first commandant. Hely was appointed Director of Organisation and Staff Duties in 1946. That November, he became Director of Postings. The following year, he took up the position of Director of Personal Services, before departing for Britain in December 1948 to study at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College, London</a>.

Returning to Melbourne, Hely served as deputy to the Air Member for Personnel from January 1950. He became an <a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a> to <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> in June 1951. In September, he was appointed <a href="Officer%20Commanding">Officer Commanding</a> <a href="Western%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">Western Area</a>, <a href="Perth">Perth</a>, taking up his new post in mid-October. He was promoted to acting <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> in July 1952, becoming <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) Western Area. His rank was made permanent in September, and the same month he was appointed aide-de-camp to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Among Hely's duties as AOC Western Area was coordinating air support for the <a href="Operation%20Hurricane">British atomic test</a> on <a href="Montebello%20Islands">Montebello</a> in October 1952, including supply and observation flights by <a href="Douglas%20C-47%20Skytrain">Dakotas</a> of <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 (Transport) Wing</a>. He was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen's Coronation Honours</a> promulgated on 1 June 1953, for his war service and his work during the Montebello test. In August, he was named Deputy Chief of the Air Staff (DCAS), with the acting rank of <a href="air%20vice%20marshal">air vice marshal</a>, effective from October; he replaced Air Vice Marshal Hancock.

Between October 1953 and February 1954, the RAAF underwent major organisational change, as it transitioned from a <a href="RAAF%20area%20commands">geographically based command-and-control system</a> to one based on function, resulting in the establishment of <a href="RAAF%20Air%20Command">Home</a> (operational), <a href="RAAF%20Training%20Command">Training</a>, and <a href="RAAF%20Maintenance%20Command">Maintenance Commands</a>. At the same time, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne was absorbed by the <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Department of Air</a> in Canberra. Hely was acting Air Member for Personnel from 3 January to 7 March 1955, between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Val Hancock and <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Fred Scherger</a>. On 24 January 1956, he became AOC Training Command, taking over from Air Vice Marshal Murdoch. He was succeeded as DCAS by Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy. Hely's rank of air vice marshal became <a href="Military%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive</a> on 5 September. In January 1957, Point Cook retired its last <a href="de%20Havilland%20Tiger%20Moth">de Havilland Tiger Moth</a> trainers, signalling the end of the biplane era in the RAAF. That May, Hely was seconded to the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a> and posted to Washington, D.C., to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff. He was succeeded as AOC Training Command by Air Vice Marshal <a href="Ian%20Dougald%20McLachlan">Ian McLachlan</a>.
Hely became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 28 March 1960, taking over from the acting AMP, Air Commodore <a href="Frank%20Headlam">Frank Headlam</a>. Responsible for the Personnel Branch of the RAAF, the position of AMP occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a> (CAS). The Air Force expanded greatly during Hely's term as AMP, owing to Australia's increasing commitment to the security of South East Asia, and the most significant rearmament program the RAAF had undertaken outside of World War II. Its permanent establishment increased from a steady 15,000 or so in the 1950s to over 18,000 by 1966. Hely himself initiated a scheme to attract staff from the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, which was suffering cutbacks, by opening a recruitment office in London and taking advantage of the Australian government's <a href="Ten%20Pound%20Poms">assisted passage scheme</a> to import trained personnel and their families. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1964 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> for his "tactful and careful handling of personnel matters", and for having "done much to improve the manning level of the Air Force". As AMP, Hely put forward proposals to increase the number of <a href="diploma">diploma</a>-qualified engineering and equipment officers in the Air Force. He was also closely involved in deliberations concerning the balance of academic and military studies at the RAAF Academy (previously RAAF College), the outcome of which is considered to have left the course biased towards pure science, rather than its applications to air power.

Hely retired on 24 August 1966, after almost forty years in the military. He was succeeded the following day as AMP by Air Vice Marshal Candy. In retirement, Hely was active in the Canberra branch of the Air Force Association. He died of cancer in Canberra on 20 May 1970. Survived by his wife and children, he was accorded an Air Force funeral at <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Reid">St John the Baptist Church</a> and cremated at Norwood Park Crematorium, <a href="Gungahlin">Gungahlin</a>. The official mourning party included <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee</a> (CCOSC) General <a href="John%20Wilton%20%28general%29">Sir John Wilton</a>, former CCOSC Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Scherger, <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29%23Diarchy">Secretary of Defence</a> <a href="Arthur%20Tange">Sir Arthur Tange</a>, CAS Air Marshal <a href="Colin%20Hannah">Colin Hannah</a>, former CAS Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch, Vice Admiral <a href="Victor%20Smith">Sir Victor Smith</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="Brian%20Eaton">Brian Eaton</a>, and Group Captain <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Waddy">John Waddy</a>. The guns at Duntroon were fired in salute as the cortege left the church.

Pangemanann</a>, the <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a> followed an <a href="Native%20Indonesian">indigenous</a> man who, having killed his fellow villager, flees to Batavia (today <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) and becomes a bandit. After kidnapping an <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> woman, he is defeated and brought to justice.

A commercially oriented work aimed at ethnic Chinese audiences, "Si Tjonat" received mixed reviews; box office proceeds are unclear. Although intended as a <a href="serial%20film">serial</a>, no sequel was ever made; the production house, Batavia Motion Picture, closed soon afterwards. However, several works in the same genre as this one were released soon afterwards, including "<a href="Si%20Pitoeng%20%281931%20film%29">Si Pitoeng</a>", which used the same director and star.

Tjonat, a <a href="Sundanese%20people">Sundanese</a> youth, kills his friend and escapes to Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>), the capital of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, where he finds work with a Dutch man. Tjonat soon robs the man of his wealth and seduces his mistress ("<a href="njai">njai</a>"), then leaves the household to live the life of a bandit. When he asks Lie Gouw Nio (Ku Fung May), the daughter of a <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">"peranakan" Chinese</a> farmer named Lie A Tjip, to be his lover, she refuses. Enraged, Tjonat kidnaps her, but Lie is rescued by her fiancé, Thio Sing Sang (Herman Sim), who is well-trained in martial arts.

"Si Tjonat" was directed by <a href="Wong%20brothers">Nelson Wong</a>, who produced the film in conjunction with his business partner Jo Eng Sek. The two had established Batavia Motion Picture in 1929. Wong had previously directed a single <a href="fiction%20film">fiction film</a>, the commercial flop "<a href="Lily%20van%20Java">Lily van Java</a>" (1928), with funding from a high-ranking <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> employee in Batavia named David Wong. Jo Eng Sek, a shop owner, had never produced a film.

The story for "Si Tjonat" was based on the novel "<a href="Tjerita%20Si%20Tjonat">Tjerita Si Tjonat</a>", written by reporter <a href="F.D.J.%20Pangemanann">F.D.J. Pangemanann</a> and first published in 1900. The story had proved popular with ethnic Chinese readers. It was often adapted to the stage by <a href="Betawi%20people">Betawi</a> stage troupes as a "<a href="lenong">lenong</a>" stage performance. The story was selected by Jo Eng Sek. Several changes were introduced to the story. For instance, in the novel Lie A Tjip was a poor farmer, whereas in the film he was wealthy. Lie Gouw Nio, meanwhile, was not depicted as a poor Chinese woman, but the "a modern girl, dressed in a skirt, shoes, socks, and <a href="bob%20cut">bobbed</a> hair".

The silent film was shot in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> and starred Ku Fung May and Herman Sim. Sim, of "peranakan" Chinese descent, had previously acted in <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, while Ku Fung May had no film experience. The martial arts sequences used in the film were inspired by Hollywood <a href="Westerns">Westerns</a>, then popular in the Indies.

"Si Tjonat" was released in 1929. Although a work of fiction, it was advertised as based on a true story; this had been common in works of Malay literature at the turn of the 20th century, including "Tjerita Si Tjonat". The film was one in a line of <a href="List%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestic productions</a> targeted primarily at ethnic Chinese audiences, following "<a href="Lily%20van%20Java">Lily van Java</a>" and "<a href="Setangan%20Berloemoer%20Darah">Setangan Berloemoer Darah</a>" (both 1928); film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> writes that this was evident from the predominantly Chinese production team and cast. Native audiences also enjoyed the film, particularly its action sequences. Indonesian film critic Salim Said writes that it was of distinctly commercial orientation, meant only to turn a profit.

Sales figures are unclear. Said writes that it was a commercial success, while Biran – noting that Batavia Motion Picture was dissolved not long after "Si Tjonat" release – suggests that returns were poor. Reviews were mixed. In general the press criticised the emphasis on murder and crime, while in "Panorama" magazine, <a href="Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">Kwee Tek Hoay</a> wrote that the film had been "fairly well produced", emphasising Sim's acting – particularly his martial arts skills. Kwee concluded that what few mistakes were found in the film were, ultimately, insignificant.

Although "Si Tjonat" was initially intended to be a <a href="serial%20film">serial</a>, production of the second instalment halted after the closure of Batavia Motion Picture. Jo Eng Sek left the industry completely, only returning in 1935 to produce "Poei Sie Giok Pa Loei Tay". Wong, meanwhile, remained active in the cinema together with his brothers Joshua and Othniel. Using the banner Halimoen Film they later cast Sim in their 1931 film "<a href="Si%20Pitoeng%20%281931%20film%29">Si Pitoeng</a>". Ku Fung May did not act in another film. Several films centred on bandits, including <a href="Lie%20Tek%20Swie">Lie Tek Swie</a>'s "<a href="Si%20Ronda">Si Ronda</a>" (1930) and the Wongs' "Rampok Preanger" (1929) and "Si Pitoeng" (1931), followed soon after "Si Tjonat".

"Si Tjonat" is likely a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>. The American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, J.B. Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue") records several as having survived at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the <a href="Netherlands%20Government%20Information%20Service">Netherlands Government Information Service</a>.

Sorga Ka Toedjoe

Sorga Ka Toedjoe (; <a href="Bazaar%20Malay">vernacular Malay</a> for "Seventh Heaven"; also advertised under the Dutch title In Den Zevenden Hemel) is a 1940 film from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> (present-day Indonesia) directed by <a href="Wong%20brothers">Joshua and Othniel Wong</a> for <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a>. It follows an older couple (<a href="Kartolo">Kartolo</a> and <a href="Annie%20Landouw">Annie Landouw</a>) who are reunited after years of separation by another, younger couple (<a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a> and <a href="Djoemala">Djoemala</a>). The <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> film, the first production by Tan's Film after the departure of <a href="Rd%20Mochtar">Rd Mochtar</a>, featured "<a href="kroncong">kroncong</a>" music and was targeted at lower-class <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> audiences. It was a commercial and critical success. Roekiah and Djoemala took leading roles in three more films before Tan's closed in 1942. "Sorga Ka Toedjoe" is now thought <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>.

Rasminah (<a href="Roekiah">Roekiah</a>) is living with her blind aunt Hadidjah (<a href="Annie%20Landouw">Annie Landouw</a>) in <a href="Puncak">Puncak</a>, a village south-east of <a href="Bogor">Buitenzorg</a> (now Bogor). Hadidjah has been separated from her husband, Kasimin, for several years, ever since she accused him of <a href="adultery">adultery</a>. Although she regretted the incident almost immediately, it was too late; a corpse resembling Kasimin was found floating in a river, and in her hurry to see the body Hadidjah was struck by a car, blinding her. Now she sings the "<a href="kroncong">kroncong</a>" song "Sorga Ka Toedjoe", which Kasimin declared to be a symbol of his love, at 5 p.m. every day. Unknown to Hadidjah, Kasimin (<a href="Kartolo">Kartolo</a>) is alive and well; he also sings "Sorga Ka Toedjoe" every day at the same time.

Following an encounter with the rich and detestable Parta, who intends to take her as his <a href="polygamy">second wife</a>, Rasminah goes to the nearby city of Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) to find a job. Several days later, having found work, she returns to Puncak to pick up Hadidjah and take her to Batavia. However, Parta and his cohort Doel are waiting in ambush. When Rasminah's carriage is stuck in a rut, the two begin to chase after her. Rasminah runs into the woods and, after several close calls, finds shelter in a small house. There she rests the night, without seeing the owner.

The following morning, Rasminah is awakened by the sound of a guitar, played by the house's owner, Hoesin (<a href="Djoemala">Djoemala</a>). Afraid that he is collaborating with her pursuer, she sneaks outside, only to be confronted by Parta and Doel. Retreating, she is chased by the pair. Hoesin intervenes and, after a fierce fight, defeats the two and chases them away. He then reassures Rasminah and escorts her home.

Over the following days Hoesin repeatedly visits Rasminah, and slowly the two begin to fall in love. When Rasminah takes her aunt to Batavia to live, Hoesin follows. They begin discussing their future together, but Rasminah insists that she will only marry when her aunt is reunited with Kasimin. After a lengthy search, in which he almost gives up hope, Hoesin finds Kasimin at a small plantation in the hills outside of the city – Hadidjah's long-lost husband previously operated his own orchard, but had been evicted by a conniving and greedy landlord only days before. Kasimin and Hadidjah are reunited, allowing Hoesin and Rasminah to begin their own preparations.

"Sorga Ka Toedjoe" was directed by brothers <a href="Wong%20brothers">Joshua and Othniel Wong</a> for <a href="Tan%27s%20Film">Tan's Film</a>, a company owned by the <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> brothers Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian. The Tan brothers, who owned a pair of cinemas, had been active in the industry since "<a href="Njai%20Dasima%20%281929%20film%29">Njai Dasima</a>" in 1929. The Wongs had worked for Tan's since 1938, when they directed the hit film "<a href="Fatima%20%281938%20film%29">Fatima</a>", helping to reestablish the company after it had been dissolved in 1932. "Sorga Ka Toedjoe" was shot in <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a>, with some scenes filmed at Telaga Warna, near Buitenzorg.

The film starred Roekiah, Rd Djoemala, Kartolo, and Annie Landouw and featured Titing, Ismail, and Ramli. Roekiah had regularly been paired on-screen with <a href="Rd.%20Mochtar">Rd. Mochtar</a> – despite being married to Kartolo – beginning with "Terang Boelan". In 1938 the three had come to Tan's, where they acted together in three films beginning with "Fatima". However, after a wage dispute following "<a href="Siti%20Akbari">Siti Akbari</a>" (1940), Mochtar left the company. To replace him, Tan's hired the tailor Djoemala as Roekiah's romantic foil. "Sorga Ka Toedjoe" was their first film together.

Kartolo handled the film's music, and many of the cast had experience singing "kroncong" (traditional music with <a href="Portuguese%20colonialism%20in%20Indonesia">Portuguese</a> influences). Before making their feature film debut in <a href="Albert%20Balink">Albert Balink</a>'s "<a href="Terang%20Boelan">Terang Boelan</a>" ("Full Moon"; 1937), Roekiah and Kartolo had found popularity with the stage musical troupe Palestina. Landouw had been a "kroncong" singer with Hugo Dumas' <a href="Lief%20Java">Lief Java</a> orchestra, and Titing was likewise an established singer.

"Sorga Ka Toedjoe" had its <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a> premiere on 30 October 1940, one of fourteen <a href="list%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestic productions</a> released that year. By March 1941 it had reached <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, then part of the <a href="Straits%20Settlements">Straits Settlements</a>. As with all of Tan's productions, the film was targeted at lower-class <a href="native%20Indonesians">native</a> audiences of all ages. It was advertised, sometimes under the Dutch title "In Den Zevenden Hemel", as a "simple yet compelling film" which featured "good music, catchy songs, and beautiful scenery". A novelisation of the film was released by the <a href="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>-based publisher Kolff-Buning and included several <a href="film%20still">production still</a>s.

The film was a commercial success. Reviews were likewise positive. The "<a href="Soerabaijasch%20Handelsblad">Soerabaijasch Handelsblad</a>" gave the film high praise, stating that it had good dialogue and music as well as a "well chosen, romantic and not exaggerated" theme. According to the reviewer, "Sorga Ka Toedjoe" seemed to have been inspired by American films but still showed its Indies character. The reviewer also opined that Djoemala was as good as, if not better, than Mochtar. "<a href="De%20Indische%20Courant">De Indische Courant</a>" praised the scenery and noted that the film criticised rich landlords who abused their power, while the "<a href="Singapore%20Free%20Press">Singapore Free Press</a>" praised Roekiah's acting.

After "Sorga Ka Toedjoe", Tan's Film produced a further four films, a much lower number than its competitors such as <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>'s Java Industrial Film and its subsidiaries. Three of these productions starred Roekiah and Djoemala in the leading roles, and featured Kartolo. Landouw, according to JB Kristanto's "Katalog Film Indonesia" ("Indonesian Film Catalogue"), did not make another film. Tan's was ultimately shut down in 1942, following the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation of the Indies</a>.

The film is likely <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable <a href="nitrate%20film">nitrate film</a>, and after a fire destroyed much of <a href="Produksi%20Film%20Negara">Produksi Film Negara</a>'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. As such, the American visual anthropologist <a href="Karl%20G.%20Heider">Karl G. Heider</a> writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, Kristanto records several as having survived at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>'s archives, and film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the <a href="Netherlands%20Government%20Information%20Service">Netherlands Government Information Service</a>.

Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties

Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties is a nonfiction book by law professor <a href="Christopher%20M.%20Fairman">Christopher M. Fairman</a> about <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>, <a href="censorship">censorship</a>, and use of the word "<a href="fuck">fuck</a>" in society. The book was first published in 2009 by <a href="Sourcebooks">Sphinx</a> as a follow-up on the author's article "Fuck", published in 2007 in the "<a href="Benjamin%20N.%20Cardozo%20School%20of%20Law">Cardozo Law Review</a>". It cites studies from academics in <a href="social%20science">social science</a>, <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, and <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>. Fairman establishes that most current usages of the word have connotations distinct from its meaning of sexual intercourse. The book discusses the efforts of <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservatives in the United States</a> to censor the word from common parlance. The author says that legal precedent regarding its use is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. Fairman argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict the use of specific words, this will lead to an encroachment upon <a href="freedom%20of%20thought">freedom of thought</a>.

The book received a mostly favorable reception from news sources and library trade publications. "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>" described the book as a sincere analysis of the word and its history of censorship, "" called it stimulating, and the "San Diego Law Review" said it was thought-provoking. One reviewer said that the book, like the article, was a format for the author to repeatedly use "fuck", rather than actually analyze it from a rigorous perspective. After the book's release, Fairman was consulted by media sources including <a href="CNN">CNN</a> and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", as well as the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, on issues surrounding <a href="word%20taboo">word taboo</a> in society.

<a href="Christopher%20M.%20Fairman">Christopher M. Fairman</a> graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>. He taught high-school level history for nine years before returning to his alma mater where he ultimately received his <a href="Juris%20Doctor">Juris Doctor</a> degree. He worked as a clerk on the <a href="Texas%20Courts%20of%20Appeals">Texas Court of Appeals for the Third District</a> for Justice J. Woodfin Jones. Subsequently, he was a clerk on the <a href="U.S.%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Fifth%20Circuit">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit</a> for Judge <a href="Fortunato%20P.%20Benavides">Fortunato P. Benavides</a>, and worked for the law firm <a href="Weil%20Gotshal">Weil Gotshal</a> in their office in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>. Fairman became a professor at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>'s <a href="Moritz%20College%20of%20Law">Moritz College of Law</a> in 2000. He specialized in areas of freedom of speech and word taboo, and earned a reputation as an expert on the subject of <a href="legal%20ethics">legal ethics</a>.

Fairman was motivated to conduct research on "fuck" after learning of a <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, man who was arrested for using the word in an email to a judge in 2004. Fairman delayed writing the article until he received <a href="tenure%20%28academic%29">tenure</a> because he was concerned its publication would adversely affect his professional reputation. Nevertheless, his supervisors did not try to convince him to cease research into the topic. Government funding helped finance Fairman's scholarship.

His original 2006 article "Fuck" is an analysis of forbidden speech from linguistic and legal perspectives. It covers use of the word in case studies about sexual harassment and education. The article is 74 pages long, and the word "fuck" appears over 560 times. According to author <a href="Jesse%20Sheidlower">Jesse Sheidlower</a> in his book "<a href="The%20F-Word%20%28book%29">The F-Word</a>", Fairman's work is the first academic article with the title of simply "Fuck".

Fairman made his article available as a working paper on the <a href="Social%20Science%20Research%20Network">Social Science Research Network</a> website on April 17, 2006. Initially the author unsuccessfully tried to have the article published by providing copies to multiple U.S. <a href="law%20review">law review</a>s. The "<a href="Kansas%20Law%20Review">Kansas Law Review</a>" rejected his article 25 minutes after receipt. It was published by the "<a href="Benjamin%20N.%20Cardozo%20School%20of%20Law">Cardozo Law Review</a>" in 2007. The author wrote a follow-up piece in April 2007 titled "Fuck and Law Faculty Rankings". Fairman died on July 22, 2015. At the time of his death, Fairman's 2007 "Cardozo Law Review" article, "Fuck" was still classed with the 20 top downloaded works on the Social Science Research Network.

"Fuck" cites studies from academics in <a href="social%20science">social science</a>, <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, and <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>. Of the sixteen chapters in the book, eight use the word "fuck" in their titles. He discusses uses of the word from the 15th century onwards. Fairman establishes that most current usages have connotations distinct from its denotation of sexual intercourse, and asserts that rather than having sexual meaning, the word's use is most commonly associated with power.

Fairman discusses the efforts of <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservatives in the United States</a> to censor the word from common parlance in the country, and says these acts are opposed to the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. Fairman warns against a tendency toward <a href="self-censorship">self-censorship</a>. He explains that those who choose to silence themselves tacitly encourage a process by which speech is forbidden through the legal process. He argues that this passivity has an impact of increasing the taboo nature of the word.

Fairman writes that legal precedent regarding use of the word is unclear because of contradictory court decisions. He presents case studies of these contradictory applications of the law, and uses them to analyze public perceptions surrounding freedom of speech. He provides examples of exceptions to the First Amendment, such as speech intended to cause violent acts, and discusses the manner in which federal and state governments sanction these exceptions. Fairman draws parallels between protection of comedians' usage of taboo language to the ability of individuals in society to express ideas freely. He argues that once citizens allow the government to restrict specific words that can be used in speech, this will lead to an encroachment upon <a href="freedom%20of%20thought">freedom of thought</a>.

"Fuck: Word Taboo and Protecting Our First Amendment Liberties" was first published in 2009 in paperback by Sphinx Publishing, and in an electronic format for the <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a> the same year. The "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" called Fairman's paper compelling and amusing. "<a href="The%20Horn%20Book%20Magazine">The Horn Book Magazine</a>" described the paper as a contemplative scholarly work which was simultaneously an engaging read. In a 2011 article for the "Federal Communications Law Journal", W. Wat Hopkins was critical of Fairman's article and subsequent book, writing that both appeared to be formats for the author to repeatedly use the word "fuck", rather than actually analyze the subject from a rigorous perspective.

A review of the book in "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" called it a vibrant extension of his article, and described it as educational and assertive in its promotion of freedom of speech, particularly in the face of the controversial language discussed. "" reviewed "Fuck" and called it a stimulating book. The review concluded, "[h]ighly recommended. All readership levels."

"<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>" described the book as a sincere analysis of "fuck" and its history of censorship. The review characterized the book as of a higher quality than "The Compleat Motherfucker: A History of the Mother of all Dirty Words" (2009) by <a href="Jim%20Dawson">Jim Dawson</a>. Ian Crouch of "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" praised the cover design for the book. Crouch observed that the word "Fuck" was shown partially obscured by <a href="correction%20fluid">correction fluid</a> but was still clearly evident in full. He concluded this was an appropriate image for a book on free speech and word taboo.

After the book's publication, Fairman was consulted by media sources, including <a href="CNN">CNN</a>, on issues involving word taboo. The <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> of Ohio invited Fairman to host its forum "Word Taboos" in 2010; his presentation was titled "Putting the 'F' in Free Speech". In a 2012 article on the word "fuck", "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" characterized Fairman as the foremost legal scholar in the United States on the word "fuck".

Falcon's Fury

Falcon's Fury is a free-standing Sky Jump <a href="drop%20tower">drop tower</a> attraction at the <a href="Busch%20Gardens%20Tampa">Busch Gardens Tampa</a> amusement park in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, United States. Manufactured by Intaride (a subsidiary of <a href="Intamin">Intamin</a>), the ride reaches a maximum height of making it North America's tallest free-standing drop tower. Riders experience about five seconds of <a href="free%20fall">free fall</a>, reaching a speed of . The ride's name was chosen to invoke a <a href="falcon">falcon</a>'s ability to dive steeply at high speed to capture prey.

The project was originally planned to begin in 2012 with the ride opening in 2013, but it was delayed by one year. Construction began in 2013 with a scheduled opening date of May 1, 2014; however, the opening was delayed due to mechanical and technical issues. Following a preview opening to park employees in early August and a <a href="soft%20launch">soft opening</a> on August 16, 2014, Falcon's Fury officially opened to the public on September 2, 2014. Public response to the ride has been positive, praising the height of the tower and the drop experience.

Planning for Falcon's Fury began around the time the park completed its <a href="Cheetah%20Hunt">Cheetah Hunt</a> ride in 2011. Ground tests in the Timbuktu area (now known as <a href="Pantopia">Pantopia</a>) revealed "interesting soil conditions", with steel beams and concrete required to reinforce the site.

Rumors that Busch Gardens Tampa might replace its Sandstorm ride with a drop tower surfaced in the fall of 2011 when its sister park, <a href="Busch%20Gardens%20Williamsburg">Busch Gardens Williamsburg</a>, opened <a href="M%C3%A4ch%20Tower">Mäch Tower</a> that August. <a href="Construction%20surveying">Construction surveying</a> was observed in January 2012. Two months later plans were filed with the city to build a drop tower, possibly for the 2013 season. Speculation about the new attraction's name began when <a href="SeaWorld%20Parks%20%26amp%3B%20Entertainment">SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment</a>, owners of Busch Gardens Tampa, filed trademark applications for "Desert Dive" and "Falcon's Fury" on May 2 and July 11, 2012, respectively, and bought the DesertDive.com domain name. When permits for the new ride differed from those for Mäch Tower in November 2012, rumors began that the seats would tilt forward. Due to the height of the attraction, approval from the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> was required. According to the FAA and the city of Tampa, the tower was supposed to be built in December 2012 and open to the public in 2013. For unknown reasons the project was delayed, with its construction pushed back to the second half of 2013.

On May 31, 2013, it was announced that Sandstorm would close on June 2 to make room for a new attraction. About two weeks later, on June 11, Busch Gardens Tampa announced plans for Falcon's Fury and construction began that month. During the fourth quarter of 2013, the park drove steel <a href="Deep%20foundation">piles</a> for the ride's foundation nightly for about a month.

On September 20, the tower for Falcon's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections, arriving at the park near the end of October; the ride's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries. Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night, with the last piece in place by New Year's Eve. Construction was done by the Adena Corporation, and on November 18 the first piece was installed. The ride's second piece was installed on December 2, and two more were installed by December 6. The fifth section was placed by December 21, and the sixth was erected by New Year's Day. The seventh tower piece was installed by January 3, 2014, and the eighth by January 5, reaching a height of about , and Falcon's Fury's gondola was seen at the park on January 12. The ride's <a href="counterweight">counterweight</a> was installed on January 22, and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1. Work on the ride's electrical components then began. Assembly of the gondola was completed by the end of March. Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February, but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15. Tower painting began in June, with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 hours over a three-week period.

At the end of February, Busch Gardens Tampa announced that Falcon's Fury would open on May 1, and on April 3 the park began a sweepstakes contest for its "Falcon's Fury First-to-Ride Party". A second, similar contest began on April 11, with fifty winners from each contest being among the first riders. A week later, the park announced that the ride's opening would be delayed, and several media events scheduled for April and May (including the First-to-Ride party) were cancelled. It was later disclosed that the delay was due to manufacturing and technical issues with the cables which pull the gondola up the tower. During the week of August 10, Falcon's Fury opened for park employees. On August 16 the ride soft-opened to the public, and two-and-a-half weeks later Falcon's Fury officially opened.

Falcon's Fury has two shaded queue lines: a standby line which can hold guests for about 45 minutes, and a Quick Queue for guests with passes that allow them to bypass the standby line. Although the Quick Queue system will not initially be used for the ride, it may be added later. Riders must be between and .

When the riders are seated a catch car connects to the gondola and raises it to the top of the tower, which takes about one minute. Although the tower is high, the gondola stops lower. When it reaches the maximum height the seats tilt forward, with a computer-randomized wait time from one to five seconds. When the wait time ends, the gondola is released from the catch car into a five-second free fall reaching a maximum speed of . As the gondola passes through the pre-braking section, the seats rotate back into a vertical position. After the pre-brake the gondola enters the main <a href="magnetic-brake%20run">magnetic-brake run</a>, where riders experience approximately 3.5 <a href="g-force">"g"</a> (34 m/s) of deceleration as the gondola slows. When it comes to a full stop at the base of the tower, the riders disembark. One cycle of the ride lasts about one and a half minutes. Busch Gardens Tampa placed an <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter egg</a> in the form of a painted Falcon's Fury logo on top of one of its buildings, which can be seen only from a certain side of the gondola.

The tower and gondola were manufactured by Intaride, a subsidiary of <a href="Intamin">Intamin</a>. The ride covers an area of about .

The Falcon's Fury tower is tall, the third tallest free-standing <a href="drop%20tower">drop tower</a> in North America, and can bend in any direction from the top to withstand hurricane-force winds. The tower is composed of nine sections, including the machine house. Each piece of the tower weighs up to , and the entire structure weighs about . The machine house at the top contains four <a href="DC%20motor">DC motor</a>s used to lift the gondola. Inside the tower is a counterweight, composed of hundreds of lead weights, to help raise the gondola. The tower's foundation is made up of 105 steel piles, varying in depth from to . A <a href="Eddy%20current%20brake">eddy current brake system</a> on the tower slows the gondola after its free fall. The structure is painted yellow, aqua and two shades of red.

The ride's single gondola has 32 seats, grouped octagonally around the tower. Each of the eight sides seats four riders, and each seat has an over-the-shoulder restraint and seat belt. Falcon's Fury can theoretically accommodate 800 riders per hour. Carbon-fiber wings buttress each end of a group of seats, protecting outside riders' arms and legs during the drop. The gondola reaches a height of , below the top of the tower. When it reaches its maximum height the seats tilt 90 degrees forward, with the riders facing the ground (the first use of this feature on a drop tower).

When Falcon's Fury opened it became North America's tallest free-standing drop tower. Although taller drop towers exist on the continent—such as at <a href="Six%20Flags%20Magic%20Mountain">Six Flags Magic Mountain</a> and at <a href="Six%20Flags%20Great%20Adventure">Six Flags Great Adventure</a>, which reach drop heights of and respectively—those attractions were added to existing structures. Despite its height, the ride's maximum speed of does not set a speed record. Other drop towers—such as at <a href="Kings%20Dominion">Kings Dominion</a>, which reaches —are faster. However, Falcon's Fury is the world's first drop tower whose seats tilt 90 degrees. Although tilting seats were first used by Intamin in 2001 on <a href="Acrophobia%20%28ride%29">Acrophobia</a> at <a href="Six%20Flags%20Over%20Georgia">Six Flags Over Georgia</a>, their tilt angle is smaller.

The initial reception after the ride's announcement was positive. According to Lance Hart, a theme park enthusiast from Screamscape, "Instead of selling your picture ... they should sell baby wipes and clean underwear at the exit" and the ride could be the most frightening drop tower in the world. <a href="Robb%20Alvey">Robb Alvey</a> of "Theme Park Review" called the ride the world's best drop tower, later ranking it one of the top 14 new attractions for 2014; Dave Parfitt and Arthur Levine of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" ranked Falcon's Fury in their top ten. Brady MacDonald of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" originally ranked Falcon's Fury his seventh-most-anticipated ride for 2014; on an updated list, he ranked it 17th.

For safety reasons, construction on Falcon's Fury was done primarily at night. Residents near the park complained about noise from the <a href="pile%20driver">pile driver</a> during the laying of the foundation, and complaints about the ride's operating noise continued into August 2014.

According to the park and <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> posts selected by news media, public response during the soft opening was positive; "Total Orlando" gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults. On Coaster101.com "Ashley" said that although the restraints were tight, they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides, adding: "The drop on Falcon's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden. The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach at the top of the tower, you take it with you to the bottom." According to Florida Trip Guides, the ride was a good addition to the park's attraction lineup: "Falcon's Fury is not for the faint of heart. I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different. Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous." Robert Niles of "Theme Park Insider" said that Falcon's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance; as a result, "You're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record, you're actually limiting the audience for that." Randi Nissenbaum of <a href="Bay%20News%209">Bay News 9</a> called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again. Sue Carlton of the "<a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Times">Tampa Bay Times</a>" said, "it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber-kneed and exhilarated."

For the 2014 season, Busch Gardens Tampa expected attendance to increase by three to eight percent. However (as predicted in June 2014 by IBISWorld Research), combined attendance for the second quarter of the year increased by about 0.3 percent for <a href="SeaWorld%20Orlando">SeaWorld Orlando</a>, <a href="SeaWorld%20San%20Diego">SeaWorld San Diego</a>, <a href="SeaWorld%20San%20Antonio">SeaWorld San Antonio</a>, Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Busch Gardens Tampa. Compared to the same period in 2013, combined attendance for the first half of the year dropped by just over four percent. Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon's Fury delays.

An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory

An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory is a 2010 textbook by the British political theorist <a href="Alasdair%20Cochrane">Alasdair Cochrane</a>. It is the first book in the publisher <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan">Palgrave Macmillan</a>'s Animal Ethics Series, edited by <a href="Andrew%20Linzey">Andrew Linzey</a> and <a href="Priscilla%20Cohn">Priscilla Cohn</a>. Cochrane's book examines five schools of <a href="political%20theory">political theory</a>—<a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a>, <a href="communitarianism">communitarianism</a>, <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="feminist%20political%20theory">feminism</a>—and their respective relationships with questions concerning <a href="animal%20rights">animal rights</a> and the political status of (non-human) animals. Cochrane concludes that each tradition has something to offer to these issues, but ultimately presents his own account of interest-based animal rights as preferable to any. His account, though drawing from all examined traditions, builds primarily upon liberalism and utilitarianism.

"An Introduction" was reviewed positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, and that the book would have benefited from devoting more space to it. <a href="Robert%20Garner">Robert Garner</a>, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such a broad range of literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of <a href="justice">justice</a> as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book "<a href="Animal%20Rights%20Without%20Liberation">Animal Rights Without Liberation</a>", published by <a href="Columbia%20University%20Press">Columbia University Press</a>. "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" was one of the first books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.

In the 1990s and 2000s, <a href="Alasdair%20Cochrane">Alasdair Cochrane</a> studied politics at the <a href="University%20of%20Sheffield">University of Sheffield</a> and the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a> (LSE). His doctoral thesis, supervised by <a href="C%C3%A9cile%20Fabre">Cécile Fabre</a> with <a href="Paul%20Kelly%20%28professor%29">Paul Kelly</a> acting as an adviser, was entitled "Moral obligations to non-humans". He subsequently became a <a href="research%20fellow">fellow</a> and <a href="lecturer">lecturer</a> at the LSE. During this time, Cochrane published articles in "<a href="Res%20Publica%20%28journal%29">Res Publica</a>", "<a href="Utilitas">Utilitas</a>" and "<a href="Political%20Studies%20%28journal%29">Political Studies</a>" presenting aspects of his interest-based theory of animal rights, which is defended in the final chapter of "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory". The book was Cochrane's first, and the political theorist <a href="Robert%20Garner">Robert Garner</a> acted as an important discussant during the writing process.

"An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" was first published in the UK on 13 October 2010 by <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan">Palgrave Macmillan</a> in <a href="paperback">paperback</a>, <a href="hardback">hardback</a> and <a href="eBook">eBook</a> formats. It was the first book to appear as part of the <a href="Palgrave%20Macmillan%20Animal%20Ethics%20Series">Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series</a>, a partnership between Palgrave Macmillan and the <a href="Ferrata%20Mora%20Oxford%20Centre%20for%20Animal%20Ethics">Ferrata Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics</a>. The series's general editors are <a href="Andrew%20Linzey">Andrew Linzey</a> and <a href="Priscilla%20N.%20Cohn">Priscilla N. Cohn</a>. Interdisciplinary in focus, the Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges posed by <a href="animal%20ethics">animal ethics</a>.

"An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" begins by discussing the history of animals in political theory before considering the approaches taken to the status of animals by five schools of political theory: <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a>, <a href="communitarianism">communitarianism</a>, <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="feminism">feminism</a>. The final chapter outlines Cochrane's own approach, which he situates between liberalism and utilitarianism.

Cochrane establishes the book as a work of <a href="normative">normative</a> <a href="political%20theory">political theory</a> asking to what extent animals should be included in the domain of <a href="justice">justice</a>. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as <a href="companion%20animal">companions</a>, or in some other way. Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws "should" be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual <a href="moral%20philosophy">moral</a> obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within <a href="ancient%20philosophy">ancient philosophy</a> there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in <a href="medieval%20philosophy">medieval</a> <a href="Christian%20philosophy">Christian philosophy</a> there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in <a href="modern%20philosophy">modern philosophy</a> there has been a return to disagreement.

Chapter three considers <a href="utilitarianism">utilitarianism</a>, according to which the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by the extent to which it promotes "utility"—a concept equated, by <a href="Utilitarianism%23Classical%20utilitarianism">classical utilitarians</a>, with pleasure. As a political theory, then, classical utilitarianism entails that "it is the obligation of political communities to formulate policies and institutions which promote pleasure". Utilitarianism as a whole, Cochrane argues, posed a challenge to the medieval and <a href="early%20modern%20philosophy">early modern</a> assumption that animals are owed nothing. Its focus on <a href="welfarism">welfare</a> and <a href="sentience">sentience</a>, and its <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> nature, allow the extension of justice to animals. The ideas of <a href="Peter%20Singer">Peter Singer</a> are outlined. Cochrane then defends Singer's account both against those presenting arguments in defence of <a href="speciesism">speciesism</a>, and against critics (such as <a href="Raymond%20Frey">R. G. Frey</a>) who maintain that animals do not have interests. He then considers utilitarian critics of Singer, who argue that <a href="meat-eating">meat-eating</a> maximises utility, even when animal interests are taken into account. This leads to the criticism that judging the best consequences is an extremely difficult task for political communities, but Cochrane concludes that a utilitarian consensus does at least support the abolition of factory farming. Finally, he addresses critics who argue that Singer's position offers insufficient protection for animals. <a href="Martha%20Nussbaum">Martha Nussbaum</a>'s argument that animals can suffer unfelt harms is considered, as is <a href="Tom%20Regan">Tom Regan</a>'s criticism that, under Singer's account, animals are protected only insofar as their protection maximises welfare, rather than in their own right.

Chapter four considers <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a>, a political theory which, according to Cochrane, has as its defining feature a valuation of "the free and equal individual person". Cochrane focuses primarily upon <a href="John%20Rawls">John Rawls</a>, whose <a href="social%20contract">social contract</a> account offers two reasons for the rejection of animals from issues of basic justice: questions of <a href="Reciprocity%20%28social%20and%20political%20philosophy%29">reciprocity</a>, for which animals are ill-suited, and questions of <a href="personhood">personhood</a>, as all parties to the contract must be moral persons. Cochrane criticises Rawls's exclusion of animals, before identifying the risks to animals inherent within <a href="liberal%20pluralism">liberal pluralism</a>. The possibility of a Rawlsian account including animals, such as those offered by Donald VanDeVeer and <a href="Mark%20Rowlands">Mark Rowlands</a>, is considered and rejected; Cochrane outlines problems with placing questions of species membership behind the <a href="veil%20of%20ignorance">veil of ignorance</a> and outlines Garner's fundamental criticisms of Rawls. Modified versions of personhood that include animals are discussed. Cochrane closes the chapter by arguing that personhood "and" welfare should both be considered important; in so doing, he points towards his own conception of justice for animals.

Chapter five assesses the relationship between animals and <a href="communitarianism">communitarianism</a>. Communitarians criticise liberalism's focus on a state which does not interfere with individuals, instead favouring a political order which takes a stand on moral concerns, drawing from the shared moral values of a given society. Cochrane initially argues that communitarianism, using British society as an example, can be used to expand justice to animals. He devotes the remainder of the chapter to four arguments against this line of thought. First, communitarianism is particularist; that is, the principles it expounds are wholly contingent on the values in the particular society. Second, there are difficulties inherent in finding "authentic" values within a given society. Third, societies often favour some animals over others, leaving unfavoured animals vulnerable. Fourth, there is the question of whose values within a society matter: states often contain multiple communities with very different attitudes to animals. Consideration of this fourth question involves analysis of <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a>.

Cochrane goes on, in chapter six, to consider <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>. Unlike the other political theories explored in "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory", Marxism is purportedly not a normative account but a scientific theory which predicts and explains the end of the state and the beginning of <a href="communism">communism</a>. This is understood as the inevitable conclusion of the history of the changing forms of economic relationships. Cochrane outlines the discontinuities between humans and animals that exist for <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> and considers the extent to which animal-rights thinking is an example of <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> morality. These analyses serve to illustrate how Marxist thinking can be used to exclude animals, but counterarguments are offered. Cochrane then draws upon the work of Catherine Perlow and Barbara Noske, who have argued that animals may represent an <a href="Exploitation%20%28Marxism%29">exploited</a> group in a Marxist sense, but he is critical of the argument that this exploitation is caused by <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> and that <a href="World%20revolution">overthrowing capitalism</a> would be a necessary step for achieving justice. He next considers the work of <a href="David%20Sztybel">David Sztybel</a> and Ted Benton, who have drawn upon the adage of "<a href="From%20each%20according%20to%20his%20ability%2C%20to%20each%20according%20to%20his%20need">From each according to his ability, to each according to his need</a>" in relation to animals; Cochrane is wary about the use of the phrase for three reasons. First, it is unclear how central the idea is to Marxist thought; second, it is a principle only for societies in advanced stages of communism; and third, even if we assume we can know the needs of animals, the principle would entail the extension of justice beyond sentient animals, which is an idea that Cochrane rejects. Finally, Cochrane considers Benton's proposal that liberal rights-based approaches to animal justice cannot achieve their goal, and that Marxism can be used as a resource for political achievement. This is, for Cochrane, Marxism's most important contribution in the area.

Cochrane considers <a href="feminism">feminism</a>, the final tradition he examines, in chapter seven. As with Marxism, there are historical links between feminism and animal liberation. Cochrane considers the putative interrelatedness, posited by some feminist theorists, of the oppression of animals and women, but denies that the liberation of animals and women are <a href="Logical%20truth">necessarily</a> interdependent. He suggests that there are four ways that this relationship could be grounded. The first is an idea taken from theorists drawing upon <a href="ecofeminism">ecofeminism</a>, like <a href="Josephine%20Donovan">Josephine Donovan</a>. This is the claim that the domination of women and animals are both due to a patriarchal elevation of the "rational" over the "natural". The second is <a href="Carol%20J.%20Adams">Carol J. Adams</a>'s argument that the connection of meat-eating and <a href="masculinity">masculinity</a> serves to oppress both women and animals, meaning that the liberation of both depends upon the end of meat-eating. The third is that, as identified by Adams and <a href="Catharine%20MacKinnon">Catharine MacKinnon</a>, women and animals are linked and oppressed by linguistic norms. For example, women might be called "cow", "bitch" or "dog", which serves to denigrate both woman and animals. The fourth is the way that both animals and women are <a href="objectification">objectified</a>, treated as mere things to be used towards the ends of others. Cochrane argues that women are not irrational, though animals are less rational than humans, meaning that the oppression and liberation of the two groups may differ. He challenges Adams's claims about meat by envisioning a vegetarian but misogynistic society on the one hand and a society where the genders are equal but meat continues to be eaten on the other. He challenges the claims about language by observing that some animal-based insults are gender-neutral (for example, "rat", "pig", "sheep"), and some slurs to women (for example, "witch", "jezebel", "whore") are unrelated to animals. Concerning objectification, Cochrane notes that women are not considered property under the law, though animals are. This makes their respective objectification importantly different. Next, the author rebuts five criticisms of <a href="reason">reason</a>-based approaches—epitomised, for Cochrane, by Singer and Regan—to animal liberation from thinkers supportive of feminist <a href="Ethics%20of%20care">care-based</a> approaches, before outlining and rejecting an emotionally driven, care-based approach to animal justice.

In the final chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an important contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it remains on the periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.

Cochrane argues that while each of the schools of thought he has considered has problems, they all have something important to contribute to the debate. Utilitarianism's most important contribution is its focus on sentience, but its major failing is its lack of respect for individuals. Liberalism, on the other hand, asserts the centrality of the individual. Communitarianism, though it is too ready to attribute cohesion to the values of a given society, observes that individuals can flourish only within appropriate communities, and stresses the importance of changing the views of society at large. This latter idea is shared by Marxism, which points out that legal change does not necessarily equate to effective change. While Cochrane does not agree that capitalism must be overthrown, he recognises that "fundamental shifts in the organisation, norms and institutions of society" are needed for justice to be extended to animals. Care-based feminist approaches, despite Cochrane's criticism, remind us that emotions and sympathy should not be ignored.

Cochrane's own sympathies lie most strongly with utilitarianism and liberalism; his own account is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on what can be done to them. These rights cannot be violated, even in the name of the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's "Animal Rights Without Liberation" (2012) which, though published after "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory", was based on his doctoral thesis.

"An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" was reviewed by Garner for the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Animal%20Ethics">Journal of Animal Ethics</a>", the political philosopher Steve Cooke for the "<a href="Political%20Studies%20Review">Political Studies Review</a>" and the sociologist <a href="Richard%20Seymour%20%28writer%29">Richard Seymour</a> for the LSE Review of Books. In addition, it was reviewed by C. E. Rasmussen for "". All four reviewers were broadly positive towards the work. Cooke recommended it for "readers interested both in the moral and political standing of animals and in political theory in general", the latter group because the work's methodological approach allows it to serve as a good introduction to political theory generally. Seymour considered the book a "refreshing and comprehensive overview of a highly interesting issue". Garner said that the work came "highly recommended"; he considered it "a very fine book", in which "Cochrane expertly simplifies and synthesizes a huge and complex literature in the limited space available to him, while retaining high scholarly standards". Garner also praised the fact that the book remained interesting, unlike many textbooks. Rasmussen said that the book came "highly recommended" for undergraduate and graduate students as well as non-specialist audiences.

Palgrave Macmillan advertised the book with quotes taken from Cooke and Garner's respective reviews, as well as with quotes from <a href="Daniel%20A.%20Dombrowski">Daniel A. Dombrowski</a> and <a href="Siobhan%20O%27Sullivan">Siobhan O'Sullivan</a>. Dombrowski was quoted as saying that the "book will be welcomed by all who are interested in the relationship between non-human animals and political theory, a relationship that has been underexplored by scholars. Highly recommended!" Meanwhile, O'Sullivan wrote:

Cooke considered Cochrane's own account to be "interesting and worthy of further consideration" and found his supporting arguments to be "convincing", but he worried that the account was not considered in the depth it warranted. He wrote that "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" would have benefited if more space had been given to the interest-based account. Further, Cooke noted that, in covering such a wide array of positions, Cochrane had to sacrifice depth of argument; Cooke considered this unproblematic, as readers could easily follow up the thinkers cited. Seymour was particularly critical of Cochrane's coverage of feminism, which was, for him, "an unfortunate lapse in an otherwise fascinating review". Seymour argued that Cochrane's critique was superficial or "[missed] the point entirely". Instead, he suggested, feminist approaches provide a potentially highly productive approach to the subject. Similarly, though Rasmussen praised the book's first five chapters as "providing an invaluable resource for undergraduates or scholars new to political theory", he felt that Cochrane's coverage of Marxism and feminism was somewhat less thorough.

In response to "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory", Garner raised two themes, the first of which was the use of the concept of "justice". Agreeing with Cochrane that the concept is the defining feature of a political account, as opposed to more general accounts of animal ethics, Garner nevertheless found Cochrane's account of justice to be "too broad and loose". In the book, Cochrane considers justice for animals to be "about recognising that the treatment of animals is a matter for political communities to enforce" and "recognising that the treatment of animals is something that political communities ought to enforce for the sake of animals themselves". For Garner,

Further, Garner suggests that Cochrane is "perhaps unduly uncritical of the utility of employing justice as a means to protect the interests of animals". He outlines two ways that animals might be protected without being the recipients of justice; first, they may be owed direct <a href="duty">duties</a> outside of justice, or, second, they might be protected by means of indirect duties, meaning that they are protected because of what humans owe to one another. Despite raising these themes in his review of "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory", Garner later rejected both possibilities in his own work, arguing that animals should be considered recipients of justice. Rasmussen felt that Cochrane utilised a narrow account of the political, meaning that a range of feminist, <a href="post-colonial">post-colonial</a> and <a href="post-humanist">post-humanist</a> perspectives were ignored in the book.

The second theme Garner identified was the divide between <a href="The%20Law%20of%20Peoples%23Ideal%20Vs.%20Non-Ideal%20Theory">ideal and nonideal theory</a>, which he understands as a way political theory may be used to contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to <a href="Abolitionism%20%28animal%20rights%29">abolitionism</a>, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book "A Theory of Justice for Animals". In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, "<a href="Animal%20Rights%20Without%20Liberation">Animal Rights Without Liberation</a>", which offers a lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.

The Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics described "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" as "the first introductory level text to offer an accessible overview on the status of animals in contemporary political theory", while commentators noted that it was one of the first works—previous books on the subject having been written by Garner and Nussbaum—to link the question of animal rights to the concept of justice in political philosophy. Since the book's publication, a number of works exploring animals in political theory have been published; these works have been collectively referred to as belonging to the "political turn" in animal ethics/animal rights, or the disciplines of "animal political philosophy" and "Animal Politics". Both "An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory" and "Animal Rights Without Liberation" have become an established part of this literature.

The book has been published in paperback, hardback and eBook formats.

The Chase is an American television <a href="game%20show">quiz show</a> based on the <a href="The%20Chase%20%28UK%20game%20show%29">British program of the same name</a>. The show premiered on August 6, 2013, on <a href="Game%20Show%20Network">Game Show Network</a> (GSN). It is hosted by <a href="Brooke%20Burns">Brooke Burns</a>, and features <a href="Mark%20Labbett">Mark Labbett</a> (nicknamed "The Beast") as the "chaser".

The American version of the show follows the same general format as the original UK version, but with teams of three contestants instead of four. The game is a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win money by challenging a quiz show genius known as the chaser. Each contestant participates in an individual "chase" called the Cash Builder, in which they attempt to answer as many questions as possible in 60 seconds to earn as much money as possible to contribute to a prize fund for the team. The contestant must answer enough questions to stay ahead of the chaser on the gameboard; otherwise, they lose their winnings for that round. The contestants who successfully complete their individual chases without being caught advance to the Final Chase, in which they answer questions as a team playing for an equal share of the prize fund accumulated throughout the episode.

"The Chase" received positive critical reception; Burns and Labbett earned positive reviews for their roles, and one critic praised the series for avoiding a slow pace in gameplay. Both the series and Burns received <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award">Daytime Emmy Award</a> nominations; the series was nominated in 2014 for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show">Outstanding Game Show</a>, and Burns two years later for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show%20Host">Outstanding Game Show Host</a>. Each lost to "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" and <a href="Craig%20Ferguson">Craig Ferguson</a> (host of "<a href="Celebrity%20Name%20Game">Celebrity Name Game</a>") respectively.

Three new contestants compete on each episode as a team. In the first round, each contestant in turn wins money for their team by answering as many questions correctly as possible during a one-minute rapid-fire round, entitled the "Cash Builder". Each correct answer in this round adds $5,000 to the bank; during celebrity episodes, contestants start with $5,000 already in the bank. At the end of the Cash Builder, the contestant participates in a key element of the show called a "chase". In the chase, the chaser and the contestant each answer questions; the contestant starts with an advantage, and the chaser attempts to catch up. The contestant's goal is to answer enough questions correctly to move the earned winnings along the gameboard into the team bank without being caught by the chaser, whose job is to catch them by capitalizing on their mistakes.

The chaser starts eight spaces away from the bank. The contestant has the option of starting five steps away from the bank, meaning that they must answer five questions correctly without being caught to bank the money and continue to the next round. Before the chase starts, the chaser will make two offers to the contestant: one offer will be to play for a lower amount, but start one step closer to the bank, meaning that they will have to answer one less question correctly; the other offer will be to play for a higher amount, but start one step further away from the bank. On rare occasions, if the contestant chooses the higher offer, the chaser may escalate the stakes by offering a "super offer" for an even higher amount. In this case, the contestant must answer seven questions correctly without being caught and thus start right in front of the chaser, meaning that the contestant needs to answer every question in that round correctly (assuming the chaser does so as well).

After the contestant decides for which amount to play, the prize money is displayed on the gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them; otherwise, they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves one step closer to the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.

After all three contestants have played a Cash Builder round followed by a chase, the contestants who were not caught by the chaser advance to the Final Chase, with the team bank set to the total that they won in their Cash Builder rounds. If all three contestants fail to win their individual chases, the team selects one contestant to play the Final Chase alone for a total of $15,000 ($5,000 per contestant). During celebrity episodes, contestants who are caught leave with $5,000 for their respective charities.

The Final Chase is played on a gameboard. The team receives a head start of one space for each member who advanced to this round. During the commercial break, the team chooses between two sets of questions, labeled "A" and "B". The chaser plays the other set. The contestants have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. After a question is asked, answers must be instantaneous, and contestants are only permitted to respond or pass a question after first ringing in. If a contestant rings in but another contestant answers, the answer is treated as wrong even if it was correct. If there is only one contestant in the Final Chase, then he or she does not need to ring in. Each question answered correctly within the time limit moves the team one space ahead on the board.

After time expires, the chaser is given two minutes to catch the team by correctly answering a new series of questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.

"The Chase" originated in the United Kingdom, premiering on <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> in 2009. As the series became increasingly popular in the UK, <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> ordered two pilot episodes in April 2012 to be taped in London for consideration to be added to the network's U.S. programming lineup. <a href="Bradley%20Walsh">Bradley Walsh</a>, presenter of <a href="The%20Chase%20%28UK%20game%20show%29">the British version</a>, was featured as the show's host, while UK chaser <a href="Mark%20Labbett">Mark Labbett</a> (nicknamed "The Beast", which is "la bête" in French) and "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" champion <a href="Brad%20Rutter">Brad Rutter</a> were the chasers.

After Fox passed up the opportunity to add the series to its lineup, <a href="Game%20Show%20Network">Game Show Network</a> (GSN), in conjunction with <a href="ITV%20Studios%20America">ITV Studios America</a>, picked up the series with an eight-episode order on April 9, 2013, and announced <a href="Brooke%20Burns">Brooke Burns</a> as the show's host and Labbett as the chaser on May 29. <a href="Dan%20Patrick">Dan Patrick</a> had originally been considered as the host. The first season premiered on August 6, 2013. Even though the show had not yet premiered at the time, the network ordered a second season of eight episodes on July 1, 2013, which premiered on November 5. Citing the series' status as a "ratings phenom", GSN eventually announced plans to renew it for a third season, which premiered in the summer of 2014. During the third season, the series also premiered its first celebrity edition with celebrity contestants playing for charity. GSN proceeded to renew the series for a fourth season before the end of season three; this new season began airing January 27, 2015. After the seventh episode of the season, the series went on another hiatus; new episodes from the fourth season resumed airing July 16, 2015. No new episodes have aired since the season four finale, which aired December 11, 2015.

"The Chase" was generally well received by critics. Michael Tyminski of "Manhattan Digest" reviewed the series positively, calling it "a breath of fresh air" and praising Burns and Labbett in their respective roles. Tyminski added that while each question's level of difficulty is not always on par with those on other quiz shows such as "Jeopardy!", the show avoids a "painfully slow pace". Similarly, John Teti of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" called the show a "pretty good adaptation" of its UK counterpart. While he preferred the British version of the show, saying that it had "a more varied cast and stronger production values", Teti felt that the American version "still holds its own." "The Chase" was also ranked ninth on Douglas Pucci's (of "TV Media Insights") list of best new television shows of 2013.

"The Chase" was one of two GSN originals (the other being "<a href="The%20American%20Bible%20Challenge">The American Bible Challenge</a>") to be honored at the <a href="41st%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">41st Daytime Emmy Awards</a> in 2014 with an Emmy nomination for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show">Outstanding Game Show</a>; "Jeopardy!" was the eventual winner. Two years later, Burns received an Emmy nomination at the <a href="43rd%20Daytime%20Emmy%20Awards">43rd Daytime Emmy Awards</a> for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Game%20Show%20Host">Outstanding Game Show Host</a>, losing to <a href="Craig%20Ferguson">Craig Ferguson</a> of "<a href="Celebrity%20Name%20Game">Celebrity Name Game</a>".

"The Chase" became one of the highest rated original programs in GSN's history. The series debuted to 511,000 total viewers during its premiere while maintaining 90% of its audience with 461,000 total viewers during the second episode airing that night. On January 28, 2014, "The Chase" set a new series high for total viewers and adults 18–49, with 827,000 and 234,000 viewers respectively. Although the season three premiere fell in the ratings from its series high, earning 494,000 viewers with only 73,000 in the 18–49 demographic, the premiere of the fourth season saw a sizeable rise over the previous season's premiere, earning 749,000 total viewers.

On December 18, 2013, Barnstorm Games released a mobile version of the game for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>. The only differences between the app and the show are that four choices are presented for questions in the Cash Builder and the Final Chase rounds and that no Final Chase is played if all players are caught in their individual chases. The app features Labbett (referred to by his "Beast" nickname) as a simulated chaser and can be played by up to four people.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned

Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of the Damned is a cancelled <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> that was being developed by <a href="Propaganda%20Games">Propaganda Games</a> for the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> platforms. Originally set to be published by <a href="Disney%20Interactive%20Studios">Disney Interactive Studios</a>, it was the first attempt to create an <a href="open%20world">open world</a> game based on the "<a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28film%20series%29">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" film franchise. The project was cancelled in October 2010, soon before the closure of Propaganda Games.

Set before events of , the game was to follow James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> to make a reputation for himself. Although little was unveiled about the story, it was intended to be independent from the films' main arc and include new characters. Gameplay was to have emphasized role-playing elements, including real-time combat and weapon customization.

After its announcement at <a href="E3%202009">2009's Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, the game received positive responses from most <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game journalists</a>. Daemon Hatfield from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> thought it "a promising action RPG", while <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> praised the gameplay, comparing it to the "<a href="Assassin%27s%20Creed">Assassin's Creed</a>" franchise. Journalists were disappointed when Disney cancelled the game several months before its planned release date. <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, the publisher of "Assassin's Creed", later released a similar game called "". 

"Armada of the Damned" was conceived as an <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing</a> video game played from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Third%20person%20view%20games">third-person</a> perspective and set in an <a href="open%20world">open world</a> environment based on the "<a href="Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20%28film%20series%29">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>" universe. The player was to take the role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although "Armada of the Damned" was centered on a choice system that would affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.

Although most of the character's specifications could be customized, some elements were to be determined by the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded. Choosing a type at the beginning of the game affected several gameplay and story elements. Each character type had unique features that shaped the way the game was experienced, including how the environment and <a href="non-playable%20characters">non-playable characters</a> interacted with the player.

Combat in "Armada of the Damned" was split between land and sea. Sterling had a light and a heavy attack, which could be combined to create <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a> that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack at the end of the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">curse</a> his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a <a href="finishing%20move">finishing move</a>. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.

In the game, the player was given a customizable ship named the "Nemesis", commanded by Sterling and his crew. The player's choices in the game would determine the crew they could hire, which in turn affected the ship's attributes. The vessel could be used to explore the Caribbean Sea and battle other crafts. During combat, the player could maneuver the ship, fire the cannons, or board the enemy vessel for hand-to-hand combat. If the enemy craft was boarded and the enemy crew was eliminated, the player received more <a href="Looting%20%28gaming%29">loot</a> than if it was destroyed. Loot salvaged in these battles could be sold in markets.

Little information was revealed about "Armada of the Damned" plot. Sterling had no connection with the film series' <a href="List%20of%20Pirates%20of%20the%20Caribbean%20characters">characters</a> and story arcs. The game and the films shared the same universe, but the former was to take place before the events of the latter. Sterling, raised in a poor family, was a young adventurer with dreams of fame and fortune who decided to become a pirate. Although he was killed on his first voyage, Sterling was revived by supernatural forces which gave him a second chance. After these events, the player had the option to follow two paths: become either a Legendary or a Dreaded pirate. On the Legendary path, the player would be a well-respected pirate who acted in good faith. On the Dreaded path, the player would be mysterious and feared.

<a href="Propaganda%20Games">Propaganda Games</a>, a studio founded in 2005 and owned by <a href="Disney%20Interactive%20Studios">Disney Interactive Studios</a>, developed "Armada of the Damned". The studio was established by former employees of <a href="EA%20Canada">EA Canada</a> and focused on the development of action-adventure games for Disney. Propaganda's first game, <a href="Turok%20%28video%20game%29">"Turok"</a> (2008), became a commercial success, selling more than one million copies. After "Turok" release, the studio began working on a project for the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise. Propaganda's vice president and general manager Dan Tudge said that this was because "it is a universe fans will be dying to explore". The studio revealed that they worked on several scripts to improve the gameplay focus. "Armada of the Damned" included an interactive choice system to shape the game, making choices an important feature.

According to game director Alex Peters, "Armada of the Damned" characters were developed unattached from those that appear in the film series. "We were very clear that we didn't want to be associated with being a movie game", he commented. This desire led to the creation of James Sterling, a character that would fit the studio's needs and feel familiar to the characters featured in the films. An original music score was written for "Armada of the Damned", while the musical themes from the films were "treated tastefully and only used on occasion." After the game's cancellation, the score was used in "", which was released in 2011.

During "Armada of the Damned" development, Propaganda Games also worked on "", which was released in December 2010. In October 2010, Disney Interactive Studios announced that "Armada of the Damned" development team would be laid off as part of a restructuring program. However, Propaganda would finish development of "Tron: Evolution" and its post-launch downloadable content.

The restructuring reduced the studio's staff by more than 100 people and led to the cancellation of "Armada of the Damned". The remaining development team worked to finish "Tron: Evolution", whose team was also affected by the lay offs. However, after the game failed to attain critical or commercial success, Disney cancelled its planned downloadable content and closed Propaganda Games.

After its announcement at <a href="E3%202009">2009's Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, "Armada of the Damned" was met with positive reactions from most <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video game journalists</a>. Daemon Hatfield from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named it "a promising action RPG," elaborating that "even though "Armada of the Damned" uses the "Pirates of the Caribbean" license ... [it] is its own game, an adventure that lets players create their own pirate and wander the seas of the Caribbean seeking fame and fortune." Chris Antista from <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> praised its gameplay, comparing it with "<a href="Assassin%E2%80%99s%20Creed">Assassin’s Creed</a>". He stated that "the game has spectacularly preserved the spirit of the films, and they’ve done it without parasitically clinging to moments you’ve already seen on the big screen."

An editor from the "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" speculated that since the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film was "followed by a progressive descent into mediocrity and Krakens with twirly tentacles in the sequels, any game that's set before the first movie is likely to be amazing." Matt Miller from "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" was impressed with the game, praising its "<a href="Mass%20Effect">Mass Effect</a>"-like speech and combat systems. He commented that "we didn't go into our meeting for Pirates with great expectations, but came out pleasantly amazed at the potential of the game." <a href="Joystiq">Joystiq</a>'s Mike Schramm compared the game to "<a href="Fable%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Fable</a>", noting that "what is there looks good – the combat was solid, if a little shallow, and the graphics and polish are well on their way."

Journalists expressed disappointment when Disney reduced the staff at Propaganda Games and cancelled development of the game several months before its planned release date. IGN's Ryan Clements stated that "it's a shame that ["Armada of the Damned"] potential won't be realized at this point in time." Justin Towell, writing for GamesRadar, was frustrated by Disney's decision: "It makes no sense to completely abandon work on a game that's clearly not that far off completion." "Game Informer" Jeff Marchiafava also expressed sadness about the cancellation, saying "What kind of noise does a depressed pirate make? Because we would totally be making that noise right now."

Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar

The Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar was a fifty-cent commemorative coin issued by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1936, part of the wave of commemoratives authorized by Congress and struck that year. Intended to commemorate the centennial of the founding of <a href="Elgin%2C%20Illinois">Elgin</a>, the piece was designed by local sculptor <a href="Trygve%20Rovelstad">Trygve Rovelstad</a>. The <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> depicts an idealized head of a <a href="American%20pioneer">pioneer</a> man. The reverse shows a grouping of pioneers, and is based upon a sculptural group that Rovelstad hoped to build as a memorial to those who settled Illinois, but which was not erected in his lifetime.

Rovelstad had heard of other efforts to gain authorization for commemorative coins, which were sold by the Mint to a designated group at face value and then retailed to the public at a premium. In 1935, through his congressman, he had legislation introduced into the House of Representatives for a commemorative coin in honor of Elgin's centennial that year. Rovelstad hoped that the proposed coin would both depict and be a source of funds for his memorial to the pioneers. Texas coin dealer L.W. Hoffecker heard of the effort and contacted Rovelstad to offer his assistance—Hoffecker had been a force behind the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20half%20dollar">Old Spanish Trail half dollar</a>, issued in 1935 and distributed by him.

The bill for the Elgin coin did not pass until 1936. Hoffecker was able to sell about 20,000 coins, four-fifths of the issue: the remaining 5,000 were returned to the Mint for melting. Unlike many commemorative coins of that era, the piece was not bought up by dealers and speculators, but was sold directly to collectors at the issue price. Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> considered the Elgin coin among the most outstanding American commemoratives.

<a href="Elgin%2C%20Illinois">Elgin, Illinois</a>, is located on the <a href="Fox%20River%20%28Illinois%20River%20tributary%29">Fox River</a> about west of <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>. The community was founded in 1835 by James and Hezekiah Gifford, who named it. It became a village in 1847 and a city in 1854. In the latter year, <a href="Elgin%20National%20Watch%20Company">a watch company</a> was founded there, and the city became well known for the firm's timepieces; it also was notable for the production of tools, shoes, wood products, and weekly church bulletins.

Sculptor <a href="Trygve%20Rovelstad">Trygve Rovelstad</a> (1903–1990), born to Norwegian immigrants in the United States, sought to erect a statue in his hometown of Elgin as a monument to those <a href="American%20pioneer">pioneers</a> who had settled Illinois. The city leaders approved, and in 1934, a foundation was laid for the statue in Davidson Park, the site of the Giffords' first cabin. Rovelstad was unable to raise the money to construct and erect the statue, but having learned of recent commemorative coin issues, decided this would be a good means of funding the statue. The sculptor had a bill introduced in Congress in May 1935 to authorize a half dollar to celebrate Elgin's centennial and to honor the pioneer. Nevertheless, the bill initially was not considered.

News of the bill appeared in the July 1935 "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>" (the journal of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> [ANA]), and on July 11, L.W. Hoffecker wrote to the Elgin Centennial Monumental Committee, inquiring how the coins would be distributed. Hoffecker, an <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>, coin dealer, was then leading the committee in his hometown that was selling the <a href="Old%20Spanish%20Trail%20half%20dollar">Old Spanish Trail half dollar</a> to the public. Although some recent commemoratives had sparked outcry from collectors that speculators had been allowed to buy up quantities of the new issues, Hoffecker would gain praise for equitably distributing the Old Spanish Trail piece.

In the correspondence between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips about how to deal with Congress. Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. He did not know yet that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, "These should also be 10 [inches, or 25.4 cm] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble it is to get the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said "Loans and Mortgages" under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, "It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me."

In October 1935, Hoffecker made a formal offer, based on the bill, which called for 10,000 half dollars: he would pay the Elgin committee $12,000 and sell the coins at $2.00 each. He would advance the face value of the coins to the Mint, as well as engraving and shipping charges. In selling the coins, he would try to distribute them to as many collectors as possible, leaving dealers and speculators for later. Rovelstad agreed by letter in November.

Illinois Representative <a href="Chauncey%20Reed">Chauncey Reed</a> had introduced the Elgin coin legislation at Rovelstad's behest, and both the sculptor and Hoffecker worked with him to advance the bill through Congress. In February 1936, Hoffecker, who had been appointed by ANA President T. James Clarke to lead a committee against abuses in the issuance of commemorative coins, went to Washington, passing through Chicago on his way to visit Rovelstad. The two men had hoped to keep the mintage to 10,000, to be able to sell the coins at a higher price. Congress, however, was not minded to create a low-mintage commemorative, as there had been several issues which had been struck in small numbers only to sell at high prices, and the bill was amended to provide for 25,000 half dollars. Hoffecker hoped to lower the number, urging the sculptor to lobby for a decrease. Hoffecker noted it would be much more work to sell 25,000, and they could not command as high a price. There were a large number of commemorative coin bills in Congress in 1936, and the dealer feared that President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> would start vetoing them. Hoffecker visited Washington twice more in May, once meeting Rovelstad there, where they lobbied members of Congress.

The bill finally passed, and was signed by President Roosevelt on June 16, 1936. The bill required the coins to be struck at a single mint and to bear the date "1936" regardless of when they were struck. All 25,000 would have to be paid for by the chairman of the Elgin committee (that is, Rovelstad) at one time; a lesser quantity could not be issued. The pieces were "in commemoration of the one-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city of Elgin, Illinois, and the erection of the heroic Pioneer Memorial"—Rovelstad's statue.

Hoffecker suggested that Rovelstad seek to have the mintage divided among the three mints, but conceded that unless Congress had erred in the enacted language, this gambit was not likely to succeed. He also told Rovelstad to get in touch with Assistant Mint Director <a href="Mary%20M.%20O%27Reilly">Mary M. O'Reilly</a> and seek to have the coins struck at the <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver Mint</a>, as the closest mint to El Paso, to minimize shipping charges. Nothing came of either proposal; all of the coins would be struck at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>.

After Rovelstad submitted his designs for the coin to the Mint, they were sent to the <a href="Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Commission of Fine Arts</a> for its opinion. The designs arrived on July 15, 1936, and were approved two days later, with the request that the head of the pioneer on the obverse, in three-quarter view (facing forward and to one side) as submitted by Rovelstad, be in profile instead. The sculptor complied, and submitted plaster models by mid-August; photographs were sent to the commission by the Mint on August 15. Two days later, commission chairman <a href="Charles%20Moore%20%28Commission%20of%20Fine%20Arts%29">Charles Moore</a> wrote to O'Reilly, stating that the sculptor member of the commission, <a href="Lee%20Lawrie">Lee Lawrie</a>, had viewed the designs, and complained he could not see what the object was behind the pioneers, and that the gun appeared to be held awkwardly. Lawrie also stated that some of the lettering should be strengthened, but if the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Mint director</a>, <a href="Nellie%20Tayloe%20Ross">Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, was not disturbed by these things, the coin should go forward. Moore indicated that he had no desire to delay the coin, and forwarded the commission's recommendation, on condition that the Mint do what it could to address these concerns. With the exception of possible work on the lettering, no changes were made.

Once the commission had approved the designs, they were immediately sent to the <a href="Medallic%20Art%20Company">Medallic Art Company</a> of New York, which <a href="reducing%20lathe">reduced</a> the designs to furnish hubs from which <a href="coining%20%28mint%29">coinage dies</a> could be made. In early October 1936, the Philadelphia Mint struck 25,000 coins, with 15 extra for inspection by the 1937 <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. Rovelstad went to Philadelphia to witness the initiation of production and stayed at the home of Mint Chief Engraver <a href="John%20R.%20Sinnock">John R. Sinnock</a>. The first ten pieces were handed to the sculptor, who placed them in paper envelopes and took them home to Illinois. According to his wife, Gloria, he was offered a job at the Mint by Sinnock but declined.

The obverse of the Elgin Centennial half dollar depicts a pioneer, attested to by the legend above him. The bearded visage had been previously sculpted by Rovelstad and appears, slightly modified, as the head of the rifleman on the left of the group on the reverse. The year "1673" on the obverse marks the year explorers <a href="Louis%20Jolliet">Louis Jolliet</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Marquette">Jacques Marquette</a> entered what is now Illinois. Although the coin was issued for Elgin's centennial, neither the date of founding (1835) nor that of the anniversary appears.

The reverse side depicts a group of pioneers (four adults and a baby in its mother's arms). The grouping is a <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a> of the model for the memorial that Rovelstad hoped to build. The child is the second baby to be implied, but not fully seen, on a US coin–one is sketched with the mother inside the <a href="Conestoga%20wagon">Conestoga wagon</a> on the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a>, first struck in 1926. One would be more fully depicted on the <a href="Roanoke%20Island%20half%20dollar">Roanoke Island half dollar</a> in 1937. The grouping had also appeared on Rovelstad's 1935 medal for Elgin's centennial. Rovelstad placed, both on the medal and on the base for the statue, the words, "To the men who have blazed the trails, who have conquered the soil, and who have built an empire in the land of the <a href="Illiniwek">Illini</a>." Inclusion of the various mottos required by statute, such as "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>", meant that not even part of this dedication could be placed on the coin. The name of the city was not in the original models that Rovelstad sent Hoffecker for his comments; the numismatist wrote on July 15, 1936, "I would not overlook putting the word 'Elgin' on your coin, as it would be a good ad for your city".

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a>, in his volume on the artistry of American coins, had high praise for the coin and its sculptor: "it is more difficult to find a more aesthetically satisfying, technically superior commemorative half-dollar than the Elgin, Illinois, Centennial of 1936." Vermeule observed that the figures on the reverse appear almost three-dimensional. He noted that the technique of spacing out the letters of the word "Pioneer" above the head presages that used by later Chief Engraver <a href="Gilroy%20Roberts">Gilroy Roberts</a> on the obverse of the <a href="Kennedy%20half%20dollar">Kennedy half dollar</a>. According to Vermeule, Rovelstad "has produced one of the major documents of sculptural plasticity and vibrant relief in the series of commemorative coins. His obverse is worthy of a Roman medallion, and his reverse rivals the great Neoclassic dies of England or Bavaria in the nineteenth century."

Once the authorizing legislation was enacted, Hoffecker and Rovelstad came to a new agreement. Hoffecker would advance the money for the new coins and pay for the die making and shipping costs, which were the committee's responsibility under the legislation. The coins would be sold at $1.50 each; Hoffecker would take 35 cents per coin as commission. The coins were to remain on sale through Hoffecker until January 1, 1937 or until they were sold out, whichever came first. The agreement provided that Hoffecker "use every ethical means known to him to push the sale of these coins". Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his 1937 pamphlet on commemorative coins, stated that he considered the price of $1.50 too high when there was an issue of 25,000 struck.

On July 1, 1936, Hoffecker sent 3,500 letters offering the new coins, which had not yet been struck, to people who were on his mailing list or had enquired. He claimed to have 7,000 orders already, and urged collectors not to delay. His bank offered to have the coins shipped there and to carry the coins as part of its cash on hand, which would allow him to pay for them as orders came in, but Hoffecker preferred to pay for the coins at the start. Hoffecker stated in letters that other coin dealers had offered to buy the entire issue, but he had declined. At this time, there was a boom in commemorative coins, and dealers were trying to get all the special issues they could.

The Philadelphia Mint shipped 24,990 coins (the authorized mintage less the first ten pieces, which Rovelstad had taken) to Hoffecker on October 7, 1936; they were received in El Paso four days later. Hoffecker wrote to Frank Duffield, editor of "<a href="The%20Numismatist">The Numismatist</a>", stating that he had the envelopes for already-ordered pieces all prepared, and hoped to mail the last of them out by the evening of October 13; the editor commented, "This sounds like real service". Several hundred pieces had been ordered through banks in Elgin; they received several consignments and eventually sold over a thousand. The Elgin Watch Company purchased 100 coins.

By November 1936, 16,170 pieces had been sold. Only about 2,000 more were sold in the next four months; Hoffecker's statement for March 1937 shows 18,790 sold with an additional 330 on consignment to the First National Bank of Elgin. Rovelstad had received $8,680.00 and Hoffecker $6,576.50. At this point, discussion turned to what to do with the remaining pieces, some 5,620 (a few hundred pieces were given away or otherwise disposed of). Rovelstad agreed to allow the coin dealer to purchase 250 pieces at $1 each; he was still selling them in 1948. Other dealers were uninterested in large purchases as the direct sale to collectors meant that few who wanted and could afford the Elgin coin lacked it. With demand at a standstill, Hoffecker feared that the remaining pieces would wind up in the hands of speculators. Five thousand pieces were returned to the Mint for melting.

Rovelstad used the profits from the half dollar to continue work on his statuary group. He sought direct funding from the federal government in 1938 and from the <a href="Illinois%20General%20Assembly">Illinois Legislature</a> the following year; both attempts failed. Through the half century that followed, he progressed on the statues, and by the time of his death in 1990, he had completed the group in <a href="plaster%20of%20Paris">plaster of Paris</a>, that still needed to be bronzed before display. Shortly before his death, he told his wife, "I've lived a full life and have no regrets. The Pioneer Memorial is now completed. I've done all I could. Now it's up to others to see it erected. I can do no more." Rovelstad's tenant, Steve Youngren, established a foundation to raise money to complete the project. It raised $456,000, exceeding the actual cost by nearly ten percent, and the memorial was completed and dedicated in 2001.

Hoffecker served as president of the ANA from 1939 to 1941; he died January 13, 1955 at the age of 86. According to the 2014 edition of <a href="Richard%20S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>", the Elgin Centennial half dollar lists at $250 in <a href="coin%20grading">Almost Uncirculated</a> (AU-50) condition, rising to $550 in near-pristine MS-66. According to numismatic historian <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, "nothing untoward was associated with the distribution of the Elgin Centennial half dollars, and certainly at the Illinois end of the deal sculptor Trygve A. Rovelstad's intentions and ethics were of the highest order. L.W. Hoffecker distributed the pieces in a skillfully orchestrated publicity campaign and did as well as anyone could have done at the time."

While writing the song, Leto was influenced by the culture of Los Angeles and inspired by his relationship with it. He explained that pursuing his creative ambitions in Los Angeles had led to a "love/hate relationship" with the city. Leto told "<a href="Interview%20%28magazine%29">Interview</a>" magazine, "the song is about people coming to the City of Angels to live their dreams and to make their dreams their reality. It's about how the other people they've met in the city have helped them—you know, a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders, of mavericks, of freaks, of artists. It's about coming to a place to do something different and something special."

"City of Angels" is a <a href="synthrock">synthrock</a> song with influences and elements from <a href="experimental%20music">experimental music</a>.

After the final chorus, the song reaches a drum-heavy climax. Emily Zemler from "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" cited "City of Angels" as an example of variety and experimentation in "Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams".

In an interview with "<a href="Loudwire">Loudwire</a>", Leto described "City of Angels" as a very personal song about a specific place. He said, "It's the story of my brother and I going to Los Angeles to make our dreams come true. It's a love letter to that beautiful and bizarre land."

John Gentile from "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" was impressed with the song, noticing that it is built in volume and complexity until Leto "was yelling at the top of his lungs." Reviewing the piano version of the song, Gentile commented that "it focuses on delicate piano until a breathy Leto gently enters and spins the tale of his decision to move to Los Angeles and his earliest days there." He wrote that "the song rises and falls until finally, it locks into a snapping beat and Leto exclaims, 'I am home! Alex Lai from <a href="Contactmusic.com">Contactmusic</a> gave the song a positive review, finding the band in a "less aggressive mood" as they move toward "U2-style stadium rock" and Leto tones down his vocal delivery.

She also felt that "Leto's love of U2 is no secret and displayed to full effect in this uplifting song with the piano, electronics, vocals and drums all weaving together effortlessly." In a mixed review, John Watt from <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a> called it a "soulless slab of soft-rock". Brent Faulkner from <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> wrote that the song "isn't too shabby, filled with minimalistic ideas and pummeling drums." Chris Maguire of <a href="AltSounds">AltSounds</a> criticized the influences of U2 featured in the track, while Andy Baber from <a href="musicOMH">musicOMH</a> called it a "corny ballad" which makes Thirty Seconds to Mars a "love-them-or-hate-them band". Writers of <a href="XETRA-FM">91X</a> named "City of Angels" the 33rd best song of 2013.

In August 2013, Jared Leto told <a href="MTV%20News">MTV News</a> that he was preparing to shoot a short film for "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple <a href="monolith">monolith</a>s and <a href="mural">mural</a>s. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited <a href="Michael%20Jackson">Michael Jackson</a> and <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> impersonators as well as homeless people in the production of the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, "Telling stories is a big part of what I do, so it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I think because I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the <a href="Hollywood%20Hills">Hollywood Hills</a>, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.

The short film was produced by Emma Ludbrook, Allan Wachs and Jared Leto, who also directed. Although it is billed as a "Bartholomew Cubbins Film" (Leto's longtime pseudonym), "City of Angels" is the first directorial project directly credited to Jared Leto. He explained, "It was the first time I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but it was just such a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece." Previous collaborator Devid Levlin served as director of photography. It was edited by Leto, Benjamin Entrup and Mischa Meyer. The short film included commentary from <a href="Kanye%20West">Kanye West</a>, Christopher Lloyd Dennis, <a href="Juliette%20Lewis">Juliette Lewis</a>, <a href="Brandy%20Aniston">Heather Levinger</a>, Haywood, <a href="Lindsay%20Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, <a href="Olivia%20Wilde">Olivia Wilde</a>, <a href="Steve%20Nash">Steve Nash</a>, <a href="Ashley%20Olsen">Ashley Olsen</a>, <a href="Lily%20Collins">Lily Collins</a>, <a href="James%20Franco">James Franco</a>, <a href="Selena%20Gomez">Selena Gomez</a>, <a href="Alan%20Cumming">Alan Cumming</a>, Anthony Warfield, Jovan Rameau, Holly Beavon, <a href="Shaun%20White">Shaun White</a>, <a href="Corey%20Feldman">Corey Feldman</a>, and Yosh. "City of Angels" marked the second collaboration of Thirty Seconds to Mars with Kanye West, as they first worked together on the track "<a href="Hurricane%20%28Thirty%20Seconds%20to%20Mars%20song%29">Hurricane</a>" (2010).

The short film for "City of Angels" premiered on October 12, 2013 during the Thirty Seconds to Mars concert at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a>. The show was broadcast worldwide on the internet through the online platform <a href="VyRT">VyRT</a>. Upon the video's premiere, Mary Bonney from "LA Music Blog" predicted that the short film "will surely be praised by every city-dwelling dreamer." Thirty Seconds to Mars teased a preview of the music video on October 28. The following day, the short film debuted on <a href="Vevo">Vevo</a>. It was preceded by a lyric video which premiered on August 23, 2013. Individual clips featuring previously unseen interview footage of Kanye West, James Franco and Selena Gomez debuted in the following months.

In a press release, Jared Leto explained the meaning behind the music video: City of Angels' is a short film about this wild, weird, and wonderful land, Los Angeles, California. A place that has left its mark on the world's imagination and a place where dreams can actually come true. I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs. It's not so much about this particular city but more about the people who inhabit it." He further said, "It's a story about hope and dreams. It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard. It's a story about survival and about what it takes to become who you really want to be."

The short film begins with Kanye West relating objects and people with Los Angeles, including <a href="James%20Dean">James Dean</a> and <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> as well as architecture, <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> and Marilyn Monroe. He is followed by a series of commentary from several residents discussing their relationship with Los Angeles while some of the city's most iconic landmarks are shown. From the Hollywood Hills to <a href="Hollywood%20Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a>, the short film captures the struggle of entertainers from the streets to the big screen.

A homeless man named Haywood opens up, "I didn't know it was the city of angels, I thought it was the lost angels, the city of lost souls." Tomo Miličević follows, explaining that "it's the place where I came and the dreams did come true." Jared Leto confesses, "I wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for this city", while Shannon says, "I came out here and I kind of found a life." Kanye West acknowledges conflicted feelings about Los Angeles, where his mother died and his daughter was born. Recalling her first impressions of the city, Olivia Wilde says, "I thought it was the most magical place I'd ever been. It's the promised land." After the opening sequences, the song "City of Angels" begins, with Thirty Seconds to Mars performing atop the Hollywood Hills overlooking the city.

Clips of Marilyn Monroe, James Dean and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a> are shown before the music stops with Christopher Lloyd Dennis, a <a href="Superman">Superman</a> impersonator, who proclaims, "Hollywood is a land of dreams. And it's also a land of broken dreams." Jovan Rameau, a Michael Jackson impersonator, talks about coming to the United States on a boat as a Haitian refugee hoping to achieve the <a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a>. He is followed by confessions by several personalities, including a silver man and a porn actress. Haywood explains that he arrived in Los Angeles while searching for his mother, only to find her living on the street. Lindsay Lohan reveals that she disappointed herself, while Selena Gomez addresses the role that <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney</a> has played in her life.

After the second verse of the song begins, childhood pictures of Jared and Shannon with their mother Constance are shown. Takes of the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> and other confessions follow, including clips from Corey Feldman's early work as a child actor. Feldman discusses how he started working at age three and how his family relied on him to pay the bills. Ashley Olsen opines on the fleeting nature of fame, while Juliette Lewis and James Franco talk about managing dreams and expectations. As the song ends, Christopher Lloyd Dennis sums up, "Do I think I'm gonna make it in the industry? As long as I keep believing, it will happen." The short film ends with the various personalities introducing themselves.

Upon its release, the video received universal acclaim from contemporary music critics. Lindsey Weber of <a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">Vulture</a> called the short film a "strangely moving ode to Los Angeles". Markos Papadatos from Digital Journal rated it an A+ and wrote, "Just when you thought that Jared Leto and Thirty Seconds to Mars cannot possible "[sic]" get any better, they prove us wrong" with their music video for "City of Angels". He found it "raw and captivating" and felt that "it will certainly move people." Brenna Ehrlich from <a href="MTV">MTV</a> commented that while the short film "may lack all the majestic animals" featured in the music video for "<a href="Up%20in%20the%20Air%20%28song%29">Up in the Air</a>", "it does have some exotic animals of a different sort: a whole pack of celebrities." Liza Darwin from "<a href="Nylon%20%28magazine%29">Nylon</a>" magazine opened her review by writing, "There are music videos, and then there are Thirty Seconds to Mars music videos." She stated, "Part documentary, part cinematic music video, this Jared Leto-helmed mini-film is touching, sweet, and totally worth watching in its 11-minute entirety."

Sophie Schillaci, writing for "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>", noticed the simplicity of the video and lauded its atmosphere. Anna Job from GoldenPlec commented that the "cinematography is notable, featuring panoramic shots of Jared Leto serenading the city from the same perch they used in 'Kings and Queens'." Niki Crux from "The Inquisitr" gave a positive review and wrote, "Showcasing mini profiles on Hollywood's largest icons, and lowest casualties, Jared Leto shines his camera on every facet that makes up Los Angeles. The video at times feels like a tribute to Los Angeles, but it never glosses over the turmoil that ensues in the City of Angels."

Allison Bowsher from <a href="MuchMusic">MuchMusic</a> was impressed with the video, calling it a "moving short film". She wrote, "As an ode to Los Angeles, the band brought together what is most simply described as a diverse group of people to talk about their feelings towards the famous city. From street performers to homeless youth to some of the most famous celebrities in the world, Thirty Seconds to Mars compiled a panel that concisely and visually demonstrate the extreme highs and lows of Los Angeles in eleven minutes." Luke O'Neil from MTV noted that "interspersed with the real celebrities are a series of celebrity impersonators, which only heightens the underlying conceit about the fuzzy intersection of dreams and reality. That's the idea of Los Angeles". Emily Wright from "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" noticed the "raw, personal side to some of today's most popular celebrities" featured. Scott Sterling of <a href="CBS%20News">CBS News</a> called it a "compelling examination on life in Los Angeles".

On July 17, 2014, the video received a nomination in the category of <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a> at the <a href="2014%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2014 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, but lost to "<a href="Pretty%20Hurts%20%28song%29">Pretty Hurts</a>" by <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>. It became the second consecutive nomination for cinematographer David Devlin, who also contended in 2013 for "Up in the Air". "City of Angels" received Best Rock Video at the Loudwire Music Awards on February 11, 2014. It was also nominated for Best Video at the <a href="2014%20Kerrang%21%20Awards">2014 Kerrang! Awards</a>, but lost to "Boston Square" by <a href="Deaf%20Havana">Deaf Havana</a>.

"City of Angels" was first performed at special concerts, dubbed as Church of Mars, in May 2013, shortly before the release of the album. It later became a signature part of the <a href="Love%2C%20Lust%2C%20Faith%20and%20Dreams%20Tour">Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour</a> which followed. During the tour's first three legs, the song was usually performed with musicians playing taiko drums. The set's video screen displayed shots from the song's music video, which were accompanied by the stage's LED video curtains. Fans and critics responded favorably to the song in a live setting. Curtis Sindrey, writing for the "Aesthetic Magazine", opined that the band "turned up the energy" with tracks like "City of Angels". Ben Jolley from the "<a href="Nottingham%20Post">Nottingham Post</a>" found it "inspirational", while Jay Cridlin of the "<a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Times">Tampa Bay Times</a>" called it "epic". Thirty Seconds to Mars performed "City of Angels" at multiple major festivals, including <a href="Rock%20Werchter">Rock Werchter</a>, <a href="Pinkpop%20Festival">Pinkpop</a>, <a href="Rock%20am%20Ring%20and%20Rock%20im%20Park">Rock am Ring and Rock im Park</a>, which saw the band playing as headline act.

On May 1, 2014, a piano version of the song was performed at the <a href="1st%20iHeartRadio%20Music%20Awards">1st iHeartRadio Music Awards</a> held at the <a href="Shrine%20Auditorium">Shrine Auditorium</a> in Los Angeles. Shannon Leto was not present at the ceremony; the song was performed by Jared Leto and Tomo Miličević, who were stationed on different platforms in front of multiple video screens showing clips from the music video. The performance received a <a href="standing%20ovation">standing ovation</a> from the audience; Jessica Hyndman from MTV deemed it a highlight of the show. A Digital Journal writer commented that the band delivered an "exceptional rendition" of the song and displayed "a great deal of charisma and energy that was equal in excellence to a live U2 performance". "City of Angels" was also included in the <a href="Carnivores%20Tour">Carnivores Tour</a>, a tour on which Thirty Seconds to Mars co-headlined with <a href="Linkin%20Park">Linkin Park</a>, and usually appeared approximately halfway through the set.

Blackwater Fire of 1937

On August 18, 1937, a <a href="lightning">lightning</a> strike started the Blackwater Fire in <a href="Shoshone%20National%20Forest">Shoshone National Forest</a>, approximately west of <a href="Cody%2C%20Wyoming">Cody, Wyoming</a>, United States. Fifteen firefighters were killed by the <a href="wildfire">forest fire</a> when a <a href="Dry%20line">dry weather front</a> caused the winds to suddenly increase and change direction. The fire quickly spread into dense forest, creating spot fires that trapped some of the firefighters in a <a href="firestorm">firestorm</a>. Nine firefighters died during the fire and six more died shortly thereafter from severe burns and respiratory complications and another 38 firefighters were injured. It killed more professional wildland firefighters in the U.S. than any other in the 103 years between the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%201910">Great Fire of 1910</a> and the <a href="Yarnell%20Hill%20Fire">Yarnell Hill Fire</a> in 2013.

The Blackwater Fire consumed of <a href="old-growth%20forest">old-growth forest</a> dominated by <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> trees on the west slopes of <a href="Clayton%20Mountain">Clayton Mountain</a>. At the time the firestorm occurred, the temperatures were about and the relative humidity was only 6 percent. Though most of the firefighters consisted of <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) employees, they were led by more experienced <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> (USFS) fire managers. Firefighters in the first half of the 20th century used mostly hand tools to suppress wildfires, and all gear was carried by the firefighters or by pack animals. Weather forecasting and radio communication were generally poor or nonexistent.

Investigations and analysis of the event led the USFS to develop better ways to provide a more immediate response to combat fires; one of them was the development of the <a href="smokejumper">smokejumper</a> program in 1939. Additionally, the "<a href="Ten%20Standard%20Firefighting%20Orders">Ten Standard Firefighting Orders</a>", a standardized set of wildland firefighting principles, were developed in 1957. A year after the tragedy, survivors and their fellow employees constructed several memorials at the scene of the incident.

Blackwater Creek originates on the north slope of <a href="Sheep%20Mesa%20%28Park%20County%2C%20Wyoming%29">Sheep Mesa</a> at an altitude of in <a href="Shoshone%20National%20Forest">Shoshone National Forest</a> and flows north through Blackwater Canyon. The creek is long and descends a steep gradient before it empties into the <a href="North%20Fork%20Shoshone%20River">North Fork Shoshone River</a>, across from U.S. Routes <a href="U.S.%20Route%2014">14</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2016">16</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%2020">20</a> immediately west of <a href="Mummy%20Cave">Mummy Cave</a> and east of the border of <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>. The firestorm deaths occurred on the west slopes of <a href="Clayton%20Mountain">Clayton Mountain</a>, approximately south by trail into the canyon. The canyon consists of numerous <a href="ravine">ravine</a>s and small ridges, which form a washboard landscape shaped by extensive erosion of the volcanic <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a> that constitutes the <a href="Absaroka%20Range">Absaroka Range</a>. The canyon has moderate to steep slopes with a gradient of 20 to 60 percent. The regional flora is an upper <a href="Montane%20ecology%23Montane%20forests">montane</a> mixed-conifer forest dominated by <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a> trees. When the fire swept through the area the forest was dense and mature with heavy fuel loads from dead trees, which also had dead limbs extending to the ground, providing a <a href="fuel%20ladder">fuel ladder</a> for fire to easily spread into the tree tops.

In 1937, firefighters did not have portable radios for rapid on-scene communication or helicopters to bring supplies and provide water drops. Firefighters had some access to gas-powered portable water pumps (two were set up on the Blackwater Fire), but most used backpack pumps that were manually operated and held limited water. <a href="Firebreak">Firelines</a> were dug by <a href="handcrew">handcrew</a>s using shovels, axes and <a href="Pulaski%20%28tool%29">pulaski</a>s (a tool that could be used as either an axe or a hoe). Most firefighters wore cotton and wool clothing, which provided poor protection from flames. Additionally, they did not have <a href="fire%20shelter">fire shelter</a>s, which first became available in the 1960s but were not mandatory until 1977. Later researchers believe the use of shelters might have saved lives depending on where the firefighters were when the firestorm occurred.

The steepness and ruggedness of the terrain in Blackwater Canyon meant firefighters had to access the fire on foot, carrying all their supplies. On the Blackwater Fire, pack horses were used to ferry supplies from the access roads to an upper base camp. Many of the firefighters were employed by the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">Civilian Conservation Corps</a> (CCC) and had limited training in <a href="wildfire%20suppression">wildfire suppression</a> and behavior, as the CCC was mainly engaged in construction projects. After a series of severe and deadly forest fire events in the early 20th century, officials established the "10 am rule" in 1935, which recommended aggressive attack on all fires and to have them controlled by 10 am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. A scientific publication about fire behavior that could be used for widespread training of firefighters first became available in 1951.

The Blackwater Fire was started by a <a href="lightning">lightning</a> strike on August 18, 1937, but it remained undetected until early August 20, at which time it was estimated to be about in size. By the evening, it had expanded to , and 65 firefighters from the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> (USFS), which included CCC company 1852 from the Wapiti Ranger District of Shoshone National Forest and employees of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), were constructing fire lines along two flanks of the fire. A gas-powered portable pump was delivered and set up using water from Blackwater Creek by midnight. Another pump arrived after that and firefighters installed of hose line on the north flank of the fire and another on the west flank. CCC workers from the National Park Service arrived at 2:30 am on August 21 and started construction of fire line along the north flank of the fire. Meanwhile, increasing winds had begun expanding the fire to the east.
Fire officials believed they needed more manpower, so CCC crews from <a href="Bighorn%20National%20Forest">Bighorn National Forest</a>, to the east, and other districts of Shoshone National Forest started responding by the morning of August 21. By 12:30 pm, more than 200 firefighters were on duty and involved in digging fire line or in support of the firefighting effort. Along one of the small creeks flowing into Blackwater Creek, a small dam was constructed to pocket water supplies for use in backpack water pumps. Due to a long overnight journey, the CCC members from the Tensleep District of Bighorn National Forest did not commence response to the fire until after noon on August 21. As they arrived, the Tensleep CCC unit were told to relieve the Wapiti CCC unit that had been fighting the fire since the previous evening. More than 50 firefighters commenced construction of a new fire line along Clayton Creek and Clayton Gulch, a ravine extending east from Blackwater Creek. The construction was led by USFS Rangers Alfred Clayton and Urban Post, and their crews consisted mainly of the Tensleep CCC camp and some from other entities.

Radio transmissions from <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> to a weather service office in <a href="Riverton%2C%20Wyoming">Riverton, Wyoming</a>, indicated a <a href="Dry%20line">dry weather front</a> had pushed through and was heading east. It is believed that forest managers at the Wapiti ranger station received this information, but it did not reach the men on the fire lines because of a lack of radio lines. The USFS did have spotters in an aircraft providing aerial observation of the fire behavior that was radioed to the Wapiti ranger station. At 12:40 pm on August 21, several spot fires were reported near the fire lines by aerial observers. At 1 pm, the weather at Wapiti was with an extremely low relative humidity of 6 percent. Winds blowing generally from the southwest increased to as the dry front approached at 3:30 pm. At 3:45 pm, they shifted abruptly from southwest to west, causing increased crowning and spot fires over the fire lines. Convectional winds also increased and the fire front started up the drainage heading east.

USFS fire manager Urban Post was leading the Tensleep CCC crews in and passed USFS crew fire crew boss Alfred Clayton, who had only one firefighter with him. Post left six men to assist Clayton and the other firefighter so they could help suppress small fires that were spotting over the fire lines. Post then led his crews east up a ridge but saw more spot fires below where Clayton and his crew were. Clayton also saw the spot fires and moved to suppress them. At 4 pm, the spot fires started to crown and Clayton sent a handwritten note to Post requesting additional manpower. By the time the note reached Post, the <a href="firestorm">firestorm</a> commenced, racing east up the ravines and gullies and trapping Clayton and his crew near the dam they had built. There, Clayton and six others died. The eighth firefighter in his crew was rescued but died later in the hospital.

Post led more than 40 firefighters, consisting of USFS, CCC, and BPR employees, up the ridge seeking an opening in the forest to take refuge. Spot fires blew ahead of Post and his crews preventing them from advancing further up the ridge, but they found a rocky outcropping and lay prone on the ground as the fire engulfed them. Crammed together on the outcropping, Post's men moved around to avoid the flames and USFS employee Paul Tyrrell (who later died) used his own body to keep several CCC firefighters from panicking and to shield them from the fire. The flames and heat nevertheless drove five firefighters to charge the flames in an attempt to escape to the other side of the firefront, but only one of them survived. A total of nine firefighters were killed on the fire lines and six more died later from their burns, while another 38 suffered various injuries. The Blackwater Fire is tied for fourth involving the greatest loss of life by firefighters on a wildfire in U.S. history. It killed more professional wildland firefighters in the U.S. than any other in the 103 years between the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%201910">Great Fire of 1910</a> and the <a href="Yarnell%20Hill%20Fire">Yarnell Hill Fire</a> in 2013.

News of the deaths and injuries started reaching the fire camps by 6 pm on August 21; by then the fire had calmed down as the dry front had passed and the wind decreased. Post led his party down through the burned area and calls went out for medical assistance. By that night, another 150 firefighters and rescue personnel had reached the fire. Rescue efforts commenced as soon as reports arrived and by the morning of August 22, almost 500 firefighters and rescue workers were on scene. The fire consumed but was not fully controlled until August 24. After 7 pm on August 21, the first fatalities were discovered by a team led by Paul Krueger of the USFS. They came upon a surviving member of Clayton's crew, finding him badly burned. Before succumbing to his injuries, he was able to direct rescuers to where Clayton and the other crew members were last seen. Post informed the rescue team that two of his party would have to be carried out and his men were too weary to do so; these two also died at the hospital. The following morning, the bodies of two other members of Post's crew that had tried to run through the flames were found. The rugged terrain made it necessary for the deceased to be carried out on either stretchers or slung over pack horses. The procession of pack horses carrying the recovered bodies passed through the fire camps where other firefighters were preparing to combat the fire.

The fatalities on the Blackwater Fire led the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government</a> to initiate their earliest rigorous investigation on such an event. The USFS investigation of the Blackwater fire incident was led by David Godwin, Assistant Chief of Fire Control for the USFS. His conclusions were that the firefighters were in good physical condition and most had some experience fighting forest fires. Godwin also determined that the managers on the incident were all fully trained and experienced firefighting professionals. Godwin stated that no fault should be assigned to the fire managers as the situation was beyond their control. He indicated that because of the distances involved in getting enough manpower to combat the fire while it was still relatively small (the Tensleep CCC crews had to travel ), the fire was not contained enough to prevent the rapid spread that occurred when the weather front approached. Godwin's findings indicated that rapid deployment of firefighters was critical to successful fire suppression. These findings were reinforced by A. A. Brown, head of the Division of Fire Control in the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Region, who studied the fire behavior and the responses to the Blackwater fire.

In an era when all fire was considered detrimental and with limited studies that documented the important ecological role of fire, immediate suppression using aggressive attack was considered the best way to protect the forests. Godwin believed that parachuting firefighters from airplanes as soon as fires were detected and as near to the fire as possible would provide the fastest way to get firefighters in place before a fire raged out of control. Consequently, by 1939 the first stages of the parachuting <a href="smokejumper">smokejumper</a> program were initiated at <a href="Winthrop%2C%20Washington">Winthrop, Washington</a>, and at two locations in <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. A later review of 16 fatal fires, from the Blackwater Fire in 1937 through 1956, led managers of the USFS to implement the "<a href="Ten%20Standard%20Firefighting%20Orders">Ten Standard Firefighting Orders</a>" in 1957, which were later changed to "FIREORDERS" in 1987, with each letter designating one of the ten orders. Not long after the "Ten Standard Firefighting Orders" were implemented, "18 Watchout Situations" were also developed to increase firefighter safety. Decades after the Blackwater Fire, forest managers had developed a better understanding of the ecological role of fire. Consequently, in 1977, the USFS dropped the 10 am rule from their firefighting strategic planning, and shifted their emphasis away from wildfire suppression to wildfire management.

In 1938, several monuments were erected by members of the CCC to honor those killed and injured during the Blackwater Fire. The largest and most accessible is along U.S. Route 14/16/20. Another memorial was erected the same year near the location where Alfred Clayton and his crew perished. A third memorial was placed where Urban Post and his crews waited out the firestorm on the rocky ledge that was later named Post Point. Clayton also had several geographic locations named in his honor, including Clayton Mountain. Though only the roadside monument can be reached by car, the other two monuments can be visited by trail, which is a round-trip hike.

The <a href="James%20T.%20Saban%20Lookout">James T. Saban Lookout</a> is a fire lookout tower renamed in 2015 in honor of one of the fallen firefighters.

Djaoeh Dimata

Djaoeh Dimata (; <a href="EYD">Perfected Spelling</a>: Jauh Dimata; Indonesian for "Out of Sight") is a 1948 film from what is now Indonesia written and directed by <a href="Andjar%20Asmara">Andjar Asmara</a> for the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC). Starring <a href="Ratna%20Asmara">Ratna Asmara</a> and <a href="Ali%20Joego">Ali Joego</a>, it follows a woman who goes to <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, "Djaoeh Dimata" took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a>.

The first <a href="list%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestically produced</a> feature film to be released in five years, "Djaoeh Dimata" received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by <a href="Roestam%20Sutan%20Palindih">Roestam Sutan Palindih</a>'s "<a href="Air%20Mata%20Mengalir%20di%20Tjitarum">Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum</a>" (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at <a href="Sinematek%20Indonesia">Sinematek Indonesia</a>.

A poor villager, Asrad (<a href="Ali%20Joego">Ali Joego</a>), is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri (<a href="Ratna%20Asmara">Ratna Asmara</a>) travels to the capital, <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and – unknown to Asrad – soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, "Djaoeh Dimata", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.

The first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, with over forty <a href="List%20of%20films%20of%20the%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">domestic productions</a> released. Following the <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20Indonesia">Japanese occupation</a> in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a>-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film – <a href="Rd%20Ariffien">Rd Ariffien</a>'s "<a href="Berdjoang">Berdjoang</a>" ("Struggle"; 1943) – six short films, and several <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a>s. All were <a href="Japanese%20propaganda%20during%20World%20War%20II">pro-Japanese propaganda</a>.

After the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">Japanese surrender</a> in August 1945, a number of <a href="native%20Indonesian">native Indonesian</a> employees of Nippon Eigasha formed <a href="Berita%20Film%20Indonesia">Berita Film Indonesia</a>, which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly <a href="proclamation%20of%20Indonesian%20Independence">proclaimed</a> Indonesian government. During the ensuing <a href="Indonesian%20National%20Revolution">revolution</a>, allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of <a href="newsreels">newsreels</a> at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce <a href="fictional%20film">fictional film</a>s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20Civil%20Administration">Netherlands Indies Civil Administration</a>, a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.

SPFC hired <a href="Andjar%20Asmara">Andjar Asmara</a>, a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with <a href="The%20Teng%20Chun">The Teng Chun</a>'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct "Djaoeh Dimata"; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and <a href="dialogue%20coach">dialogue coach</a>; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. <a href="Max%20Tera">Max Tera</a> served as assistant cinematographer on this <a href="black-and-white">black-and-white</a> film.

The film starred Ratna Asmara (wife of Andjar), Ali Yugo, Iskandar Sucarno, and Djauhari Effendi, all of whom had previous theatrical experience. Ratna and Ali, together with Andjar, had been members of the travelling troupe <a href="Dardanella%20%28theatre%20company%29">Dardanella</a> in the early 1930s and entered the film industry together in 1940 with "<a href="Kartinah">Kartinah</a>". Iskandar and Djauhari, meanwhile, had been active in the theatre during the occupation; both made their feature film debuts with "Djaoeh Dimata". 

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> was conducted on sets constructed by artistic director Hajopan Bajo Angin in SFPC's studio in Jakarta. The company's equipment was of good quality, but conditions were detrimental to filming; a contemporary report notes that one <a href="take">take</a>, done inside the studio, was ruined by the sound of a passing car. Filming, which took two to three months, was completed on 10 November 1948. Production costs were almost 130,000 <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a>, which was partially obtained from ethnic Chinese backers. The film included multiple songs, including <a href="Gesang%20Martohartono">Gesang Martohartono</a>'s 1940 hit "<a href="Bengawan%20Solo%20%28song%29">Bengawan Solo</a>".

A documentary detailing one day of the production, called "Er wordt een film gemaakt" (""A film is being made"") exists in the Netherlands.

"Djaoeh Dimata" was released in late 1948, the first domestic feature film since "Berdjoang". Despite this five-year gap, film critic <a href="Usmar%20Ismail">Usmar Ismail</a> writes that it did not stray from the formula which had been proven before the war, one which Indonesian film historian <a href="Misbach%20Yusa%20Biran">Misbach Yusa Biran</a> notes focused on songs, beautiful scenery and romance. <a href="Roestam%20Sutan%20Palindih">Roestam Sutan Palindih</a>'s "<a href="Air%20Mata%20Mengalir%20di%20Tjitarum">Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum</a>" ("Tears Flow in Citarum"), which had similar themes, was released shortly after "Djaoeh Dimata" by the rival Tan & Wong Bros.; it proved the greater financial success. Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled "Anggrek Bulan" ("Moon Orchid"), which was also directed by Andjar.

Reviews of the film, which was rated for all ages, were mixed. One in the Jakarta-based "Het Dagblad" found the film to have many (unspecified) weak moments as well as strong ones. It particularly praised Ali's acting as a blind man, as well as Denninghoff-Stelling's camerawork. Another reviewer, in the magazine "Mestika", described Ratna as an "unprecedented tragedienne" capable of making viewers cry "unrestrained tears of emotion". After "Djaoeh Dimata" was released in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> in June 1949, a reviewer for "<a href="The%20Straits%20Times">The Straits Times</a>" praised the film's "fine photography and almost perfect sound".

Andjar directed two further films for South Pacific, "Anggrek Bulan" and "<a href="Gadis%20Desa">Gadis Desa</a>" ("Maiden from the Village"; 1949).

Madman's Drum

Madman's Drum is a <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a> by American artist <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a> (1905–1985), published in 1930. It is the second of Ward's six wordless novels. The 118 <a href="wood%20engraving">wood-engraved</a> images of "Madman's Drum" tell the story of a slave trader who steals a demon-faced drum from an African he murders, and the consequences for him and his family.

Ward's first wordless novel was of 1929. Ward was more ambitious with his second work in the medium: the characters are more nuanced, the plot more developed and complicated, and the outrage at social injustice more explicit. Ward used a wider variety of carving tools to achieve a finer degree of detail in the artwork, and was expressive in his use of symbolism and exaggerated emotional facial expressions.

The book was well received upon release, and the success of Ward's first two wordless novels encouraged publishers to publish more books in the genre. In 1943 psychologist <a href="Henry%20Murray">Henry Murray</a> used two images from the work in his <a href="Thematic%20Apperception%20Test">Thematic Apperception Test</a> of personality traits. "Madman's Drum" is considered less successfully executed than "", and Ward streamlined his work in his next wordless novel, "<a href="Wild%20Pilgrimage">Wild Pilgrimage</a>" (1932).

A slave trader condemns his family to the curse of a demon-faced drum he steals from an African. The slave trader becomes rich and buys a mansion for his family, in which he displays the drum and the sword he used to kill the drum's original owner. He catches his son playing on the drum, beats the boy, and insists he read and study. The slave trader is lost at sea when he tries to return to Africa.

The boy devotes himself to study, while distancing himself from the vices of his peers. He embraces and then rejects religion, and a cross he tosses to the floor trips and kills his mother. He becomes a successful scientist, and in middle age marries and has two daughters, but is cold and indifferent to his family. One by one he loses them: his wife dies after having an affair with a musician, one daughter falls into depression when her labor-organizer lover is framed and hanged for murder, and the other daughter falls in love with a man who pimps her to others. Driven insane by the loss of all who were close to him, he equips himself with the forbidden drum to play music with a leering piper who has roamed his grounds for years.

<a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a> (1905–1985) was born in Chicago to <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> minister <a href="Harry%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Ward">Harry F. Ward</a>, a social activist and the first chairman of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. Throughout his career, the younger Ward's work displayed the influence of his father's interest in social injustice. He was drawn to art from an early age, and contributed images and text to high school and college newspapers.

After getting a university degree in fine arts in 1926, Ward married writer <a href="May%20McNeer">May McNeer</a> and the couple left for an extended honeymoon in Europe. Ward spent a year studying <a href="wood%20engraving">wood engraving</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Germany, where he encountered <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionist</a> art and read the wordless novel "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28wordless%20novel%29">The Sun</a>" (1919) by Flemish <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> artist <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a> (1889–1972). Ward returned to the United States and freelanced his illustrations. In New York City in 1929, he came across the wordless novel "<a href="Destiny%20%28wordless%20novel%29">Destiny</a>" (1926) by German artist <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a> (1888–1955). Nückel's only work in the genre, "Destiny" told of the life and death of a prostitute in a style inspired by Masereel's, but with a greater cinematic flow. The work inspired Ward to create a wordless novel of his own: "" (1929). In his second such work, "Madman's Drum", he hoped to explore more deeply the potential of the narrative medium, and to overcome what he saw as a lack of individuality in the characters in .

Ward made 118 woodcuts for "Madman's Drum". The black-and-white images are not uniform in size—they measure from to . Cape & Smith published the book in October 1930 in trade and deluxe editions, the latter in a signed edition limited to 309 copies. Jonathon Cape published the book in the UK in 1930. It had a Japanese publication in 2002 by , and in 2005 <a href="Dover%20Publications">Dover Publications</a> brought it back into print as a standalone edition in the US. It appeared in the collected volume "Storyteller Without Words: The Wood Engravings of Lynd Ward" in 1974, and again in 2010 in the <a href="Library%20of%20America">Library of America</a> collection "Lynd Ward: Six Novels in Woodcuts", edited by cartoonist <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a>. The original woodblocks are in the Lynd Ward Collection in the Joseph Mark Lauinger Memorial Library at <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> in Washington, DC.

"Madman's Drum" is a more ambitious work than "Gods' Man", with a larger cast of characters and more complicated plot. The book is more explicit in its far-leftist politics, and includes a subplot in which the main character's sister's communist lover is executed for his political beliefs. Late in life Ward described it as "set a hundred years or more ago ... in an obviously foreign land", but that the story's situation and characters could be encountered "almost anywhere at any time".

The art has a variety of line qualities and textures, and more detail than in "Gods' Man". Ward availed himself of a larger variety of engraving tools, such as the multiple-tint tool for making groups of parallel lines, and rounded engraving tools for organic textures. The large cast of characters is distinguished by visual details in faces and clothing, such as the main character's sharp nose and receding hairline and his wife's checked dress.

A wide range of emotions such as resentment and terror is expressed through exaggerated facial expressions. Ward broadens his use of visual symbolism, as with a young woman's purity represented by a flower she wears—she is deflowered by a young man whose vest is adorned with flowers. His house also displays a floral stucco pattern and is adorned with phallic spears and an exultant rooster as a weathervane. To French comics scripter , the "madman" in the title could be interpreted as any of a number of its characters: the laughing image adorning the drum, the subdued African, the slave trader, and even Ward himself.

The book's release in 1930 was well-received, though it did not sell as well as "". The success of Ward's first two wordless novels led American publishers to put out a number of such books, including Nückel's "Destiny" in 1930, as well as books by Americans and other Europeans. Interest in wordless novels was short-lived, and few besides Masereel and Ward produced more than a single work. Each of Ward's sold fewer copies than the last, and he abandoned the genre in 1940 after abandoning an attempt at a seventh. In 1943 psychologist <a href="Henry%20Murray">Henry Murray</a> used two images from "Madman's Drum" in his <a href="Thematic%20Apperception%20Test">Thematic Apperception Test</a> of personality traits.

A reviewer for "<a href="The%20Burlington%20Magazine">The Burlington Magazine</a>" in 1931 judged the book a failed experiment, finding the artwork uneven and the narrative hard to follow without even the chapter titles as textual guidance that "" had. Cartoonist <a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> considered Ward's second wordless novel a "sophomore slump", whose story was bogged down by Ward's attempt to flesh out the characters and produce a more complicated plot. He believed the artwork was a mix of strengths and weaknesses: it had stronger compositions, but the more finely engraved images were "harder to read", and the death of the wife and other plot points were unclear and difficult to interpret. Spiegelman considered Ward to have broken free from this slump by streamlining his work in his next wordless novel, "<a href="Wild%20Pilgrimage">Wild Pilgrimage</a>" (1932). Jérôme LeGlatin declared "Madman's Drum" Ward's first masterpiece, " at every fault, in each failure" as Ward freed himself from the restraint displayed in .

Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar

The Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar is a <a href="United%20States%20commemorative%20coin">commemorative coin</a> issue in gold dated 1903. Struck in two varieties, the coins were designed by <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Bureau of the Mint</a> Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>. The pieces were issued to commemorate the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a> held in 1904 in St. Louis; one variety depicted former president <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, and the other, the <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">recently assassinated</a> president <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a>. Although not the <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">first American commemorative coins</a>, they were the first in gold.

Promoters of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, originally scheduled to open in 1903, sought a commemorative coin for fundraising purposes. Congress authorized an issue in 1902, and exposition authorities, including numismatic promoter <a href="Farran%20Zerbe">Farran Zerbe</a>, sought to have the coin issued with two designs, to aid sales. The price for each variety was $3, the same cost whether sold as a coin, or mounted in jewelry or on a spoon.

The coins did not sell well, and most were later melted down. Zerbe, who had promised to support the issue price of the coins, did not do so as prices dropped once the fair (rescheduled for 1904) closed. This drop, however, did not greatly affect Zerbe's career, as he went on to promote other commemorative coins and become president of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a>. The coins also recovered, regaining their issue price by 1915; they are now worth between a few hundred and several thousand dollars, depending on condition.

Much of the area near the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> was explored by French explorers in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1682, <a href="Ren%C3%A9-Robert%20Cavelier%2C%20Sieur%20de%20La%20Salle">René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle</a>, claimed the entire area drained by the river for France, naming it <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">Louisiana</a> for <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a>. Although most French territory in the Western Hemisphere was lost in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> (1756–1763), the Mississippi basin did not pass to the victors in that war (primarily the British) as it had been secretly transferred to Spain by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fontainebleau%20%281762%29">1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau</a>.

<a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> came to power in 1799. Dreaming of a renewed French empire, he secured the return of the Louisiana territory from Spain via the <a href="Third%20Treaty%20of%20San%20Ildefonso">Third Treaty of San Ildefonso</a> the following year, and through other agreements. These pacts were initially secret, and newly inaugurated American President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> learned of them in 1801. Fearing that the port of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> would be closed to American shipping, he sent former Virginia senator <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> to France to assist American Minister <a href="Robert%20R.%20Livingston%20%28chancellor%29">Robert Livingston</a> in purchasing the lower Mississippi; Congress appropriated $2 million for the purpose.
When the Americans met with Napoleon, they found that the emperor desired to sell the entire territory, much of which was unmapped and unexplored by white men; Napoleon was faced with defeat in revolting <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and feared that the British would capture New Orleans, meaning he would lose Louisiana with no compensation. After some haggling, they agreed on a price of 60 million francs, plus 20 million more to pay claims by American citizens against France—a total of some $15 million, which paid for some of land. The treaty was signed on April 30, 1803, and, although there was some question as to whether there was constitutional power for such a purchase, the American Senate ratified the treaty on October 20, 1803. The United States took formal possession two months later.

The <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> doubled the size of the United States, and today forms much of the center of the country. Desirous of honoring the centennial of the purchase, Congress passed authorizing legislation for an exposition; the bill was signed by President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> on March 3, 1901. McKinley <a href="Assassination%20of%20William%20McKinley">was assassinated</a> in September of that year.

The Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar was authorized by Congress on June 28, 1902, when President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> signed an appropriations bill that included a $5,000,000 <a href="rider%20%28legislation%29">rider</a> to subsidize the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase%20Exposition">Louisiana Purchase Exposition</a>. The bill in question authorized 250,000 gold one-dollar pieces to be paid over to the exposition organizers as part of the appropriation, upon their posting a bond that they would fulfill the requirements of the legislation. The bill did not specify the wording or design to be placed on the coins, leaving that to the discretion of the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a>.

Anthony Swiatek and <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, in their encyclopedia of commemorative coins, suggested that the decision to have multiple designs was "through some unrecorded agreement". The legislation was ambiguous enough to permit such an interpretation, and numismatist <a href="Farran%20Zerbe">Farran Zerbe</a> urged the Mint to strike more than one type of coin, stating that sales would be increased if this was done. Zerbe was not only a collector (he would serve as president of the <a href="American%20Numismatic%20Association">American Numismatic Association</a> from 1908 to 1910), but he also promoted numismatics with his traveling exhibition, "Money of the World". He was involved in the distribution of commemorative coins from the <a href="Columbian%20half%20dollar">Columbian half dollar</a> of 1892 to the <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20commemorative%20coins">Panama-Pacific issue</a> of 1915, and would be the sole distributor of Louisiana Purchase dollars.

On August 12, 1902, Treasury Secretary <a href="Leslie%20M.%20Shaw">Leslie M. Shaw</a> wrote to former Missouri governor <a href="David%20R.%20Francis">David R. Francis</a>, one of the promoters of the exposition, enquiring what design exposition officials would like to see on the reverse of the coins. Although Francis's response is not extant, Mint authorities originally determined upon an olive branch surrounding a numeral "1". This was apparently disliked by the <a href="Director%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Mint">Director of the Mint</a>, <a href="George%20E.%20Roberts">George E. Roberts</a>, for on October 2, 1902, <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> Superintendent John Landis wrote to him, enclosing cardboard impressions of the original and revised proposed reverses. The new design had the value spelled out and the letter stated that the changes were being made at Roberts's suggestion. On October 13, Barber went to Washington (where the director's office was located) to confer with Roberts about the design. Roberts considered the olive branch "too conspicuous", given the size of the coin and the lettering, and asked that the branch be reduced in size. This apparently was done. By September 1902, work upon the dies for the obverses, showing the heads of McKinley and Jefferson, being worked upon by Mint Chief Engraver <a href="Charles%20E.%20Barber">Charles E. Barber</a>, was well-advanced.

In December 1902, the Philadelphia Mint struck 75,080 gold dollars. These were dated 1903, a violation of normal Mint practice to have the date of striking on the coin. This was not unprecedented; the 1900-dated <a href="Lafayette%20dollar">Lafayette dollar</a> had been struck in December 1899. It is not known which gold dollar was first struck. In January 1903, an additional 175,178 pieces were coined; the excess of 258 over the authorized mintage was set aside for testing by the annual <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>. There is no difference between those pieces struck in 1902 and those minted in 1903. Fifty thousand pieces were sent to the St. Louis sub-treasury on December 22, 1902, to await the organizing committee's compliance with other parts of the law, most likely relating to the required posting of a bond.

The first 100 specimens of each design were struck in a proof finish. These were mounted on cardboard with presentation certificates and presented to favored insiders and Mint officials; they were not available to the public. The certificates were signed by Superintendent Landis, and by Rhine R. Freed, Chief Coiner of the Philadelphia Mint. The coin was placed inside a holder with wax paper window, secured into place with heavy string with that mint's seal. These were the first commemorative gold coins struck by the United States.

Barber took the design for the Jefferson obverse from the former president's <a href="Indian%20Peace%20Medal">Indian Peace Medal</a>, created by engraver <a href="John%20Reich%20%28engraver%29">John Reich</a>, who used a bust by <a href="Jean-Antoine%20Houdon">Jean-Antoine Houdon</a> as his model. The chief engraver modeled the McKinley obverse after his own design for the fallen president's medal issued by the Mint. Barber's medal had been modeled from life; McKinley had sat for the chief engraver. The reverse, for both coins, contains the denomination, a commemorative inscription, and an olive branch above the anniversary dates.

Coin dealer B. Max Mehl deemed the issue "the most attractive of all of our commemorative gold dollars". Others disagreed; Swiatek and Breen criticized the pieces, stating that Jefferson's "facial features, inaccurately rendered by Charles E. Barber, have acquired a resemblance to Napoleon Bonaparte, the other party in the Louisiana Purchase transaction." Stating that McKinley was recognizable by his bow tie, they note of the reverse, "the olive branch—if that is the plant intended—may refer to this 828,000 square mile territory's acquisition by peaceful means". Numismatic historian <a href="Don%20Taxay">Don Taxay</a> criticized Reich's medal, stating that it "is hardly elegant, with Jefferson hunched unpleasantly in the circle as though placed there by a modern <a href="Procrustes">Procrustes</a>". Taxay noted that Barber's rendition of McKinley for that medal had attracted the insult of "deadly" from the chief engraver's longtime enemy, sculptor <a href="Augustus%20Saint-Gaudens">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>.
Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> criticized the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Exposition%20dollar">Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar</a> issued in 1904–1905: "the lack of spark in these coins, as in so many designs by Barber or [Assistant Engraver George T.] <a href="George%20T.%20Morgan">Morgan</a>, stems from the fact that the faces, hair, and drapery are flat and the lettering is small, crowded, and even." He did not believe that the problems he saw were due to the small size of the dollar, stating that the gold dollar of the Panama-Pacific issue, by <a href="Charles%20Keck">Charles Keck</a>, is far more beautiful. Vermeule noted that contemporary accounts saw the 1903 issue as an innovation; a 1904 article in the "American Journal of Numismatics" stated that they "indicate a popular desire for a new departure from the somewhat monotonous types of Liberty which have characterized our money ... If this tendency could make itself felt on the regular coinage, it would give a new zeal to collectors." Beginning in 1909 with the <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>, the Mint would depict an actual person on the circulating coinage; this would become more common with the 1932 <a href="Washington%20quarter">Washington quarter</a>.

The fair at St. Louis opened on April 30, 1904, a year later than originally planned. It was one of the largest <a href="World%27s%20Fair">World's Fair</a>s in area, set over in <a href="Forest%20Park%20%28St.%20Louis%29">Forest Park</a>. There were 15 major buildings and a host of smaller exhibits, and it is doubtful if many attendees saw more than a fraction of the attractions—seeing everything in the Agricultural Building alone required a walk of . Twenty million people attended the exposition, which inspired the popular song, "<a href="Meet%20Me%20in%20St.%20Louis%2C%20Louis">Meet Me in St. Louis</a>".

The coins were sold at $3 each. They were available in a case of issue, or could be purchased mounted in spoons and various sorts of jewelry. Some were mounted with solder, which has impaired their present-day numismatic value; others were sold with mountings that did not damage the coin. Zerbe had thought of these varied ways of selling the coin, and many of the sales at the fair were in this manner. No additional charge was made for these adornments.

Zerbe also promoted the pieces to the numismatic community. Although the $3 price was not high by later standards, triple face value was considered excessive by many coin collectors, and the coins did not sell well. Efforts by Zerbe to promote the pieces included proposing that the government produce a billion-dollar gold piece to be exhibited at the fair, and co-ordinating sales with the vendors of near-worthless replicas of tiny gold pieces struck privately in California in pioneer days, which were half price with the purchase of a dollar coin. Thomas L. Elder, a dealer coming into prominence at that time, spoke out against Zerbe, calling him a huckster whose advertising was misleading and who was bringing discredit upon coin dealers.

The organizers, including Zerbe, promised to support the $3 issue price against the possibility of price drops on the secondary market. Prices of the Columbian half dollar and Lafayette dollar had fallen and remained below their issue prices. By November 1903, only about 10,000 of the gold pieces had been sold, including sales to the fair's promoters and others interested in it. According to numismatist <a href="Q.%20David%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, fairgoers likely accounted for several thousand coins, but the bulk of the distribution was to coin dealers and collectors. Zerbe sold them at his coin exhibit for years afterwards; coin dealer B. Max Mehl bought thousands from Zerbe at just over face value. These were sold in Mehl's mail order sales through the 1920s. Despite efforts by Zerbe which Bowers finds "enthusiastic or even heroic", only about 35,000 were sold to the public; the remaining 215,000 were returned to the Mint and melted around 1914.

Numismatist David M. Bullowa in 1938 noted that the Mint kept no records of how many of each variety was melted, but that he thought that about 10% more of the McKinley issue was sold. Bowers, writing about a half century later, opined to the contrary; that in his experience and in grading service reports, the Jefferson coin was slightly more prevalent. Swiatek, in his 2012 book, prints statistics showing the number of pieces examined by the numismatic grading services, indicating more Jefferson dollars than McKinley.

Despite Zerbe's statement that he would support the issue price of the coins at $3, he did not do so and the price of the dollars fell to about $2 by late 1905. Their market price again reached $3 by about 1915, and thereafter continued to rise. The 2014 edition of <a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (the "Red Book") lists both the Jefferson and the McKinley variety at prices ranging from $500 in Almost Uncirculated (AU-50) <a href="coin%20grading">condition</a> to $2,150 in near pristine MS-66 condition, though the Jefferson is more expensive in some intermediate grades.

Zerbe stated in 1905 that he "was the only man to sell 50,000 dollars at $3 apiece". In 1923, he wrote in an article that the Louisiana Purchase dollars had always sold for $3 or more "for the particular reason that the one in charge of their sale felt a price protection obligation to every purchaser." He did not, however, identify himself as "the one in charge of their sale".

The Jin–Song Wars were a series of conflicts between the <a href="Jurchen%20people">Jurchen</a> <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29">Jin dynasty (1115–1234)</a> and <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> (960–1279). In 1115, Jurchen tribes rebelled against their overlords, the <a href="Khitan%20people">Khitan</a> <a href="Liao%20dynasty">Liao dynasty</a> (907–1125), and declared the formation of the Jin. <a href="Alliance%20Conducted%20at%20Sea">Allying with the Song</a> against their common enemy the Liao, the Jin promised to return to the Song the <a href="Sixteen%20Prefectures">Sixteen Prefectures</a> that had fallen under Liao control since 938. The Chinese agreed but Jurchens quick defeat of the Liao combined with Song military failures made the Jin reluctant to cede these territories. After a series of negotiations that embittered both sides, the Jurchens attacked the <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> in 1125, dispatching one army to <a href="Taiyuan">Taiyuan</a> and the other to Bianjing (modern <a href="Kaifeng">Kaifeng</a>), the Song capital.

Surprised by news of an invasion, Song general <a href="Tong%20Guan">Tong Guan</a> retreated from Taiyuan, which was besieged and later captured. As the second Jin army approached the capital, Song emperor <a href="Emperor%20Huizong%20of%20Song">Huizong</a> abdicated and fled south. <a href="Emperor%20Qinzong%20of%20Song">Qinzong</a>, his eldest son, was enthroned. The Jurchens laid siege to Kaifeng in 1126, but Qinzong negotiated their retreat from the capital by agreeing to a large annual <a href="indemnity">indemnity</a>. Qinzong reneged on the deal and ordered Song forces to defend <a href="History%20of%20the%20administrative%20divisions%20of%20China">the prefectures</a> instead of fortifying the capital. The Jin resumed war and again besieged Kaifeng in 1127. They captured Qinzong, many members of the <a href="House%20of%20Zhao">imperial family</a> and officials of the Song imperial court in an event known as the <a href="Jingkang%20Incident">Jingkang Incident</a>. This separated <a href="Northern%20and%20southern%20China">north and south China</a> between Jin and Song. Remnants of the Song imperial family retreated to southern China and, after brief stays in several temporary capitals, eventually relocated to Lin'an (modern <a href="Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a>). The retreat divided the dynasty into two distinct periods, <a href="Northern%20Song%20Dynasty">Northern Song</a> and <a href="Southern%20Song%20dynasty">Southern Song</a>.

The Jurchens tried to conquer southern China in the 1130s, but were bogged down by a pro-Song insurgency in the north and a counteroffensive by Song generals <a href="Yue%20Fei">Yue Fei</a>, <a href="Han%20Shizhong">Han Shizhong</a>, and others. The generals regained some territories but retreated on the orders of Southern Song emperor <a href="Emperor%20Gaozong%20of%20Song">Gaozong</a>, who supported a peaceful resolution to the war. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Shaoxing">Treaty of Shaoxing</a> (1142) set the boundary of the two empires along the <a href="Huai%20River">Huai River</a>, but conflicts between the two dynasties continued until the fall of the Jin in 1234. A war against the Song begun by 4th Jin emperor, <a href="Wanyan%20Liang">Wanyan Liang</a>, was unsuccessful. He lost the <a href="Battle%20of%20Caishi">Battle of Caishi</a> (1161) and was later assassinated by his own disaffected officers. An invasion of the Jin motivated by Song <a href="revanchism">revanchism</a> (1206–1208) was also unsuccessful. A decade later, the Jin launched an abortive military campaign against the Song in 1217 to replace territory they had lost to the <a href="Mongol%20conquest%20of%20the%20Jin%20dynasty">invading Mongols</a>. The Song allied with the Mongols in 1233, and in the next year jointly <a href="Siege%20of%20Caizhou">captured Caizhou</a>, last refuge of the Jin emperor. The Jin dynasty collapsed that year in 1234. After the demise of the Jin, the Song dynasty itself became a <a href="Mongol%20conquest%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty">target of the Mongols</a>, and fell in 1279.

The wars engendered an era of technological, cultural, and demographic changes in China. Battles between the Song and Jin brought about the introduction of various <a href="History%20of%20gunpowder">gunpowder weapons</a>. The <a href="siege%20of%20De%27an">siege of De'an</a> in 1132 was the first recorded use of the <a href="fire%20lance">fire lance</a>, an early ancestor of <a href="firearm">firearm</a>s. There were also reports of battles fought with rudimentary gunpowder bombs like the incendiary "huopao" or the exploding "tiehuopao", <a href="fire%20arrow">incendiary arrows</a>, and other related weapons. In northern China, Jurchens were the ruling minority of an empire predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Song. Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture. The Jin, a <a href="conquest%20dynasty">conquest dynasty</a>, instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties, basing their legitimacy on <a href="Confucianism">Confucian philosophy</a>. Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China. The north was the cultural center of China, and its conquest by the Jin diminished the regional stature of the Song dynasty. The Southern Song, however, quickly returned to economic prosperity, and trade with the Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare. Lin'an, the Southern Song capital, expanded into a major city for commerce.

The <a href="Jurchen%20people">Jurchens</a> were a <a href="Tungusic%20languages">Tungusic-speaking</a> group of semi-agrarian tribes inhabiting areas of northeast Asia that are now part of <a href="China%27s%20northeast">Northeast China</a>. Many of the Jurchen tribes were vassals of the <a href="Liao%20dynasty">Liao dynasty</a> (907–1125), an empire ruled by the nomadic <a href="Khitan%20people">Khitans</a> that included most of modern <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, a portion of <a href="North%20China">North China</a>, Northeast China, northern <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, and parts of the <a href="Russian%20Far%20East">Russian Far East</a>. To the south of the Liao lay the <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song Empire</a> (960–1276). The Song and Liao were at peace, but since <a href="Chanyuan%20Treaty">a military defeat to the Liao in 1005</a>, the Song paid its northern neighbor an annual indemnity of 200,000 bolts of silk and 100,000 <a href="tael">ounces</a> of silver.

In 1114, the chieftain <a href="Wanyan%20Aguda">Wanyan Aguda</a> (1068–1123) united the disparate Jurchen tribes and led a revolt against the Liao. In 1115 he named himself emperor of the <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29">Jin "golden" dynasty</a> (1115–1234). Informed by a Liao defector of the success of the Jurchen uprising, the Song emperor <a href="Emperor%20Huizong%20of%20Song">Huizong</a> (r. 1100–1127) and his highest military commander the <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a> <a href="Tong%20Guan">Tong Guan</a> saw the Liao weakness as an opportunity to recover the <a href="Sixteen%20Prefectures">Sixteen Prefectures</a>, a line of fortified cities and passes that the Liao had annexed from the <a href="Shatuo">Shatuo Turk</a> <a href="Later%20Jin%20%28Five%20Dynasties%29">Later Jin</a> in 938, and that the Song had repeatedly but unsuccessfully tried to reconquer. The Song thus sought an alliance with the Jin against their common enemy the Liao.

Because the land routes between the Song and Jin were controlled by the Liao, diplomatic exchanges had to occur by traveling across the <a href="Bohai%20Sea">Bohai Sea</a>. Negotiations for an alliance began secretly under the pretense that the Song wanted to acquire horses from the Khitans. Song diplomats traveled to the Jin court to meet Aguda in 1118, while Jurchen envoys arrived in the Song capital <a href="Kaifeng">Kaifeng</a> the next year. At the beginning the two sides agreed to keep whatever Liao territory they would seize in combat. In 1120, Aguda agreed to cede the Sixteen Prefectures to the Song in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual <a href="tribute">tributary payments</a> that the Song had been giving the Liao. By the end of 1120, however, the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital, and offered the Song only parts of the Sixteen Prefectures. Among other things, the Jin would keep the Liao Western Capital of <a href="Datong">Datong</a> at the western end of the Sixteen Prefectures. The two sides agreed that the Jin would now attack the Liao Central Capital, whereas the Song would seize the <a href="Liao%20Nanjing">Liao Southern Capital, Yanjing</a> (modern day Beijing).

The joint attack against the Liao had been planned for 1121, but it was rescheduled for 1122. In February 23 of that year, the Jin captured the Liao Central Capital as promised. The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the <a href="Western%20Xia">Western Xia</a> in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion led by <a href="Fang%20La">Fang La</a> in the south. When a Song army under Tong Guan's command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122, the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease. Another attack failed in the fall. Both times, Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng. After the first attack, Aguda changed the terms of the agreement and only promised Yanjing and six other prefectures to the Song. In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces that easily took the Liao Southern Capital. They sacked it and enslaved its population.

The quick collapse of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and the Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set the terms of the first Song–Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures (including Yanjing) would be returned to the Song, and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of 300,000 packs of silk and 200,000 <a href="tael">tael</a>s of silver to the Jin, as well as a one-time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures. In May 1123 Tong Guan and the Song armies entered the looted Yanjing.

Barely one month after the Song had recovered Yanjing, Zhang Jue (), who had served as military governor of the Liao prefecture of <a href="Lulong%20County">Pingzhou</a> about east of Yanjing, killed the main Jin official in that city and turned it over to the Song. The Jurchens defeated his armies a few months later and Zhang took refuge in Yanjing. Even though the Song agreed to execute him in late 1123, this incident put tension between the two states, because the 1123 treaty had explicitly forbidden both sides from harboring defectors. In 1124, Song officials further angered the Jin by asking for the cession of nine more border prefectures. The new Jin emperor <a href="Emperor%20Taizong%20of%20Jin">Taizong</a> (r. 1123–1135), Aguda's brother and successor, hesitated, but warrior princes <a href="Wanyan%20Zonghan">Wanyan Zonghan</a> and <a href="Wanyan%20Zongwang">Wanyan Zongwang</a> () vehemently refused to give them any more territory. Taizong eventually granted two prefectures, but by then the Jin leaders were ready to attack their southern neighbor.

Before they could invade the Song, the Jurchens reached a peace agreement with their western neighbors the <a href="Tangut%20people">Tangut</a> Western Xia in 1124. The following year near the <a href="Ordos%20Desert">Ordos Desert</a>, they captured <a href="Emperor%20Tianzuo%20of%20Liao">Tianzuo</a>, the last emperor of the Liao, putting an end to the Liao dynasty for good. Ready to end their alliance with the Song, the Jurchens began preparations for an invasion.

In November 1125 Taizong ordered his armies to attack the Song. The defection of Zhang Jue two years earlier served as the "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>". Two armies were sent to capture the major cities of the Song.

The western army, led by Wanyan Zonghan, departed from Datong and headed towards <a href="Taiyuan">Taiyuan</a> through the mountains of <a href="Shanxi">Shanxi</a>, on its way to the Song western capital <a href="Luoyang">Luoyang</a>. The Song forces were not expecting an invasion and were caught off guard. The Chinese general Tong Guan was informed of the military expedition by an envoy he had sent to the Jin to obtain the cession of two prefectures. The returning envoy reported that the Jurchens were willing to forgo an invasion if the Song ceded control of <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a> and Shanxi to the Jin. Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing. Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126. Under Wang Bing's command, Taiyuan held on long enough to stop the Jurchen troops from advancing to Luoyang.

Meanwhile, the eastern army, commanded by Wanyan Zongwang, was dispatched towards Yanjing (modern Beijing) and eventually the Song capital Kaifeng. It did not face much armed opposition. Zongwang easily took Yanjing, where Song general and former Liao governor Guo Yaoshi () switched his allegiances to the Jin. When the Song had tried to reclaim the <a href="Sixteen%20Prefectures">Sixteen Prefectures</a>, they had faced fierce resistance from the Han Chinese population, yet when the Jurchens invaded that area, the Han Chinese did not oppose them at all. By the end of December 1125, the Jin army had seized control of two prefectures and re-established Jurchen rule over the Sixteen Prefectures. The eastern army was nearing Kaifeng by early 1126.

Fearing the approaching Jin army, Song emperor Huizong planned to retreat south. The emperor deserting the capital would have been viewed as an act of capitulation, so court officials convinced him to abdicate. There were few objections. Rescuing an empire in crisis from destruction was more important than preserving the rituals of imperial inheritance. In January 1126, a few days before the <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">New Year</a>, Huizong abdicated in favor of his son and was demoted to the ceremonial role of <a href="Taishang%20Huang">Retired Emperor</a>. The Jurchen forces reached the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a> on January 27, 1126, two days after the New Year. Huizong fled Kaifeng the next day, escaping south and leaving the newly enthroned emperor <a href="Emperor%20Qinzong%20of%20Song">Qinzong</a> (r. 1126–1127) in charge of the capital.

Kaifeng was besieged on January 31, 1126. The commander of the Jurchen army promised to spare the city if the Song submitted to Jin as a vassal; forfeited the prime minister and an imperial prince as prisoners; ceded the Chinese prefectures of <a href="Hejian">Hejian</a>, Taiyuan, and Zhongshan; and offered an indemnity of 50 million taels of silver, 5 million taels of gold, 1 million packs of silk, 1 million packs of satin, 10,000 horses, 10,000 mules, 10,000 cattle, and 1,000 camels. This indemnity was worth about 180 years of the annual tribute the Song had been paying to the Jin since 1123.

With little prospect of help from afar arriving, infighting broke out in the Song court between the officials who supported the Jin offer and those who opposed it. Opponents of the treaty like <a href="Li%20Gang%20%28Song%20dynasty%29">Li Gang</a> (; 1083–1140) rallied around the proposal of remaining in defensive positions until reinforcements arrived and Jurchen supplies ran out. They botched an ambush against the Jin that was carried out at night, and were replaced by officials who supported peace negotiations. The failed attack pushed Qinzong into meeting the Jurchen demands, and his officials convinced him to go through with the deal. The Song recognized Jin control over the three prefectures. The Jurchen army ended the siege in March after 33 days.

Almost as soon as the Jin armies had left Kaifeng, Emperor Qinzong reneged on the deal and dispatched two armies to repel the Jurchen troops attacking Taiyuan and bolster the defenses of Zhongshan and Hejian. An army of 90,000 soldiers and another of 60,000 were defeated by Jin forces by June. A second expedition to rescue Taiyuan was also unsuccessful.

Accusing the Song of violating the agreement and realizing the weakness of the Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement and left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.

After the defeat of several Song armies in the north, Emperor Qinzong wanted to negotiate a truce with the Jin, but he committed a massive strategic blunder when he commanded his remaining armies to protect prefectural cities instead of Kaifeng. Neglecting the importance of the capital, he left Kaifeng defended with fewer than 100,000 soldiers. The Song forces were dispersed throughout China, powerless to stop the second Jurchen siege of the city.

The Jin assault commenced in mid December 1126. Even as fighting raged on, Qinzong continued to sue for peace, but Jin demands for territory were enormous: they wanted all provinces north of the Yellow River. After more than twenty days of heavy combat against the besieging forces, Song defenses were decimated and the morale of Song soldiers was on the decline. On January 9, 1127, the Jurchens broke through and started to loot the conquered city. Emperor Qinzong tried to appease the victors by offering the remaining wealth of the capital. The royal treasury was emptied and the belongings of the city's residents were seized. The Song emperor offered his unconditional surrender a few days later.

Qinzong, the former emperor Huizong, and members of the Song court were captured by the Jurchens as hostages. They were taken north to <a href="Huining%20Prefecture">Huining</a> (modern <a href="Harbin">Harbin</a>), where they were stripped of their royal privileges and reduced to commoners. The former emperors were humiliated by their captors. They were mocked with disparaging titles like "Muddled Virtue" and "Double Muddled". In 1128 the Jin made them perform a ritual meant for war criminals. The harsh treatment of the Song royalty softened after the death of Huizong in 1135. Titles were granted to the deceased monarch, and his son Qinzong was promoted to Duke, a position with a salary.

Many factors contributed to the Song's repeated military blunders and subsequent loss of northern China to the Jurchens. Traditional accounts of Song history held the venality of Huizong's imperial court responsible for the decline of the dynasty. These narratives condemned Huizong and his officials for their moral failures. Early Song emperors were eager to enact political reforms and revive the ethical framework of <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, but the enthusiasm for reforms gradually died after the reformist <a href="Wang%20Anshi">Wang Anshi</a>'s expulsion as <a href="Chancellor%20%28China%29">chancellor</a> in 1076. Corruption marred the reign of Huizong, who was more skilled as a painter than as a ruler. Huizong was known for his extravagance, and funded the costly construction of gardens and temples while rebellions threatened the state's grip on power.

A modern analysis by Ari Daniel Levine places more of the blame on deficiencies in the military and bureaucratic leadership. The loss of northern China was not inevitable. The military was overextended by a government too assured of its own military prowess. Huizong diverted the state's resources to failed wars against the Western Xia. The Song insistence on a greater share of Liao territory only succeeded in provoking their Jin allies. Song diplomatic oversights underestimated the Jin and allowed the unimpeded rise of Jurchen military power. The state had plentiful resources, with the exception of horses, but managed its assets poorly during battles. Unlike the expansive <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han</a> and <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang</a> empires that preceded the Song, the Song did not have a significant foothold in <a href="Inner%20Asia">Central Asia</a> where a large proportion of its horses could be bred or procured. As Song general Li Gang noted, without a consistent supply of horses the dynasty was at a significant disadvantage against Jurchen <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>: "the Jin were victorious only because they used <a href="cataphract%23Cataphracts%20in%20East%20Asia">iron-shielded cavalry</a>, while we opposed them with foot soldiers. It is only to be expected that [our soldiers] were scattered and dispersed."

The Jin leadership had not expected or desired the fall of the Song dynasty. Their intention was to weaken the Song in order to demand more tribute, and they were unprepared for the magnitude of their victory. The Jurchens were preoccupied with strengthening their rule over the areas once controlled by Liao. Instead of continuing their invasion of the Song, an empire with a military that outnumbered their own, they adopted the strategy of "using Chinese to control the Chinese". The Jin hoped a proxy state would be capable of administering northern China and collecting the annual indemnity without requiring Jurchen interventions to quell anti-Jin uprisings. In 1127, the Jurchens installed a former Song official, <a href="Zhang%20Bangchang">Zhang Bangchang</a> (張邦昌; 1081–1127), as puppet emperor of the newly established "<a href="Da%20Chu">Da Chu</a>" (Great Chu) dynasty. The puppet government did not deter the resistance in northern China, but the insurgents were motivated by their anger towards the Jurchens' looting rather than by a sense of loyalty towards the inept Song court. A number of Song commanders, stationed in towns scattered across northern China, retained their allegiance to the Song, and armed volunteers organized <a href="militia">militia</a>s opposed to the Jurchen military presence. The insurgency hampered the ability of the Jin to exert control over the north.

Meanwhile, one Song prince, Zhao Gou, had escaped capture. He had been held up in <a href="Cizhou%20%28in%20modern%20Hebei%29">Cizhou</a> while on a diplomatic mission, and never made it back to Kaifeng. He was not present in the capital when the city fell to the Jurchens. The future <a href="Gaozong%20of%20Song">Emperor Gaozong</a> managed to evade the Jurchen troops tailing him by moving from one province to the next, traveling across Hebei, <a href="Henan">Henan</a>, and <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a>. The Jurchens tried to lure him back to Kaifeng where they could finally capture him, but did not succeed. Zhao Gou finally arrived in the Song Southern Capital at Yingtianfu (; modern <a href="Shangqiu">Shangqiu</a>) in early June 1127. For Gaozong (r. 1127–1162), Yingtianfu was the first in a series of temporary capitals called "xingzai" . The court moved to Yingtianfu because of its historical importance to <a href="Emperor%20Taizu%20of%20Song">Emperor Taizu of Song</a>, the founder of the dynasty, who had previously served in that city as a military governor. The symbolism of the city was meant to secure the political legitimacy of the new emperor, who was enthroned there on June 12.

After reigning for barely one month, Zhang Bangchang was persuaded by the Song to step down as emperor of the Great Chu and to recognize the legitimacy of the Song imperial line. Li Gang pressured Gaozong to execute Zhang for betraying the Song. The emperor relented and Zhang was coerced into suicide. The killing of Zhang showed that the Song was willing to provoke the Jin, and that the Jin had yet to solidify their control over the newly conquered territories. The submission and abolition of Chu meant that Kaifeng was now back under Song control. <a href="Zong%20Ze">Zong Ze</a> (; 1059–1128), the Song general responsible for fortifying Kaifeng, entreated Gaozong to move the court back to the city, but Gaozong refused and retreated south. The southward move marked the end of the Northern Song and the beginning of the Southern Song era of Chinese history.

The descendant of <a href="Confucius">Confucius</a> at <a href="Qufu">Qufu</a>, the <a href="Duke%20Yansheng">Duke Yansheng</a> Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to Quzhou, while the newly established <a href="Jin%20dynasty%20%281115%E2%80%931234%29">Jin dynasty (1115–1234)</a> in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng. Zhang Xuan 張選, a great-grandson of <a href="Zhang%20Zai">Zhang Zai</a>, also fled south with Gaozong.

The Song disbandment of the Great Chu and execution of Zhang Bangchang antagonized the Jurchens and violated the treaty that the two parties had negotiated. The Jin renewed their attacks on the Song and quickly reconquered much of northern China. In late 1127 Gaozong moved his court further south from Yingtianfu to <a href="Yangzhou">Yangzhou</a>, south of the <a href="Huai%20River">Huai River</a> and north of the <a href="Yangtze%20River">Yangtze River</a>, by sailing down the <a href="Grand%20Canal%20%28China%29">Grand Canal</a>. The court spent over a year in the city. When the Jurchens advanced to the Huai River, the court was partially evacuated to <a href="Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a> in 1129. Days later, Gaozong narrowly escaped on horseback, just a few hours ahead of Jurchen vanguard troops. After a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup</a> in Hangzhou almost dethroned him, in May 1129 he moved his capital back north to Jiankang (modern <a href="Nanjing">Nanjing</a>) on the south bank of the Yangtze. One month later, however, Zong Ze's successor <a href="Du%20Chong">Du Chong</a> () vacated his forces from Kaifeng, exposing Jiankang to attack. The emperor moved back to Hangzhou in September, leaving Jiankang in Du Chong's hands. The Jin eventually captured Kaifeng in early 1130.

From 1127 to 1129, the Song sent thirteen embassies to the Jin to discuss peace terms and to negotiate the release of Gaozong's mother and Huizong, but the Jin court ignored them. In December 1129, the Jin started a new military offensive, dispatching two armies across the Huai River in the east and west. On the western front, an army invaded <a href="Jiangxi">Jiangxi</a>, the area where the Song <a href="dowager%20empress">dowager empress</a> resided, and captured Hongzhou (, present-day <a href="Nanchang">Nanchang</a>). They were ordered to retreat a few months later when the eastern army withdrew.

Meanwhile, on the eastern front, <a href="Wuzhu">Wuzhu</a> commanded the main Jin army. He crossed the Yangtze southwest of Jiankang and took that city when Du Chong surrendered. Wuzhu set out from Jiankang and advanced rapidly to try to capture Gaozong. The Jin seized Hangzhou (January 22, 1130) and then <a href="Shaoxing">Shaoxing</a> further south (February 4), but general <a href="Zhang%20Jun%20%28general%29">Zhang Jun</a>'s (1086–1154) battle with Wuzhu near <a href="Ningbo">Ningbo</a> gave Gaozong time to escape. By the time Wuzhu resumed pursuit, the Song court was fleeing on ships to <a href="Zhoushan">islands</a> off the coast of <a href="Zhejiang">Zhejiang</a>, and then further south to <a href="Wenzhou">Wenzhou</a>. The Jin sent ships to chase after Gaozong, but failed to catch him. They gave up the pursuit and the Jurchens retreated north. After they plundered the undefended cities of Hangzhou and <a href="Suzhou">Suzhou</a>, they finally started to face resistance from Song armies led by <a href="Yue%20Fei">Yue Fei</a> and <a href="Han%20Shizhong">Han Shizhong</a>. The latter even inflicted <a href="Battle%20of%20Huangtiandang">a major defeat on Jurchen forces</a> and tried to prevent Wuzhu from crossing back to the north bank of the Yangtze. The small boats of the Jin army were outmatched by Han Shizhong's fleet of seagoing vessels. Wuzhu eventually managed to cross the river when he had his troops use incendiary arrows to neutralize Han's ships by burning their sails. Wuzhu's troops came back south of the Yangtze one last time to Jiankang, which they pillaged, and then headed north. Yet the Jin had been caught off guard by the strength of the Song navy, and Wuzhu never tried to cross the Yangtze River again. In early 1131, Jin armies between the Huai and the Yangtze were repelled by bandits loyal to the Song. Zhang Rong (), the leader of the bandits, was given a government position for his victory against the Jin.

After the Jin incursion that almost captured Gaozong, the sovereign ordered pacification commissioner <a href="Zhang%20Jun%20%28Song%20chancellor%29">Zhang Jun</a> (1097–1164), who was in charge of <a href="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a> and <a href="Sichuan">Sichuan</a> in the far west, to attack the Jin there to relieve pressure on the court. Zhang put together a large army, but was defeated by Wuzhu near <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a> in late 1130. Wuzhu advanced further west into <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a>, and drove as far south as Jiezhou (, modern <a href="Wudu%20District">Wudu</a>). The most important battles between Jin and Song in 1131 and 1132 took place in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. The Jin lost two battles at Heshang Yuan in 1131. After failing to enter Sichuan, Wuzhu retreated to Yanjing. He returned to the western front again from 1132 to 1134. The Jin attacked <a href="Hubei">Hubei</a> and Shaanxi in 1132. Wuzhu captured Heshang Yuan in 1133, but his advance was halted by a defeat at Xianren Pass. He gave up on taking Sichuan, and no more major battles were fought between the Jin and Song for the rest of the decade.

The Song court returned to Hangzhou in 1133, and the city was renamed Lin'an. The imperial ancestral temple was built in Lin'an later that same year, a sign that the court had in practice established Lin'an as the Song capital without a formal declaration. It was treated as a temporary capital. Between 1130 and 1137, the court would sporadically move to Jiankang, and back to Lin'an. There were proposals to make Jiankang the new capital, but Lin'an won out because the court considered it a more secure city. The natural barriers that surrounded Lin'an, including lakes and rice paddies, made it more difficult for the Jurchen cavalry to breach its fortifications. Access to the sea made it easier to retreat from the city. In 1138, Gaozong officially declared Lin'an the capital of the dynasty, but the label of temporary capital would still be in place. Lin'an would remain the capital of the Southern Song for the next 150 years, growing into a major commercial and cultural center.

<a href="Qin%20Hui">Qin Hui</a>, an official of the Song court, recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130, saying that, "If it is desirable that there will be no more conflicts <a href="Tianxia">under Heaven</a>, it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north." Gaozong, who considered himself a northerner, initially rejected the proposal. There were gestures toward peace in 1132, when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat, and in 1133, when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal, but a treaty never materialized. The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement.

The continuing insurgency of anti-Jin forces in northern China hampered the Jurchen campaigns south of the Yangtze. Reluctant to let the war drag on, the Jin decided to create <a href="Da%20Qi">Da Qi</a> (the "Great Qi"), their second attempt at a puppet state in northern China. The Jurchens believed that this state, nominally ruled by someone of Han Chinese descent, would be able to attract the allegiance of disaffected members of the insurgency. The Jurchens also suffered from a shortage of skilled manpower, and controlling the entirety of northern China was not administratively feasible. In the final months of 1129, <a href="Liu%20Yu%20%28puppet%20emperor%29">Liu Yu</a> (; 1073–1143) won the favor of the Jin emperor Taizong. Liu was a Song official from Hebei who had been a prefect of <a href="Jinan">Jinan</a> in Shandong before his defection to the Jin in 1128. Da Qi was formed late in 1130, and the Jin enthroned Liu as its emperor. <a href="Daming%20County">Daming</a> in Hebei was the first capital of Qi, before its move to Kaifeng, former capital of the Northern Song. The Qi government instituted military <a href="conscription">conscription</a>, made an attempt at reforming the bureaucracy, and enacted laws that enforced the collection of high taxes. It was also responsible for supplying a large portion of the troops that fought the Song in the seven years following its creation.
The Jin granted Qi more autonomy than the first puppet government of Chu, but Liu Yu was obligated to obey the orders of the Jurchen generals. With Jin support, Da Qi invaded the Song in November 1133. Li Cheng, a Song turncoat who had joined the Qi, led the campaign. <a href="Xiangyang">Xiangyang</a> and nearby prefectures fell to his army. The capture of Xiangyang on the <a href="Han%20River%20%28Shaanxi%20%26amp%3B%20Hubei%29">Han River</a> gave the Jurchens a passage into the central valley of the Yangtze River. Their southward push was halted by the general Yue Fei. In 1134, Yue Fei defeated Li and retook Xiangyang and its surrounding prefectures. Later that year, however, Qi and Jin initiated a new offensive further east along the Huai River. For the first time, Gaozong issued an edict officially condemning Da Qi. The armies of Qi and Jin won a series of victories in the Huai valley, but were repelled by Han Shizhong near Yangzhou and by Yue Fei at Luzhou (, modern <a href="Hefei">Hefei</a>). Their sudden withdrawal in 1135 in response to the death of Jin Emperor Taizong gave the Song time to regroup. The war recommenced in late 1136 when Da Qi attacked the <a href="Huainan">Huainan</a> <a href="Circuit%20%28administrative%20division%29">circuits</a> of the Song. Qi lost a battle at Outang (), in modern <a href="Anhui">Anhui</a>, against a Song army led by <a href="Yang%20Qizhong">Yang Qizhong</a> (; 1102–1166). The victory boosted Song morale, and the military commissioner <a href="Zhang%20Jun%20%28Song%20chancellor%29">Zhang Jun</a> (1097–1164) convinced Gaozong to begin plans for a counterattack. Gaozong first agreed, but he abandoned the counteroffensive when an officer named Li Qiong () killed his superior official and defected to the Jin with tens of thousands of soldiers. Meanwhile, <a href="Emperor%20Xizong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Xizong</a> (r. 1135–1150) inherited the Jin throne from Taizong, and pushed for peace. He and his generals were disappointed with Liu Yu's military failures and believed that Liu was secretly conspiring with Yue Fei. In late 1137, the Jin reduced Liu Yu's title to that of a prince and abolished the state of Qi. The Jin and Song renewed the negotiations towards peace.

Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the <a href="Censorate">Censorate</a>, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a "subject" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by <a href="Wuzhu">Wuzhu</a> invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general <a href="Liu%20Qi%20%28general%29">Liu Qi</a> () won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang (modern <a href="Fuyang">Fuyang</a> in Anhui). Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive. Yue captured <a href="Zhengzhou">Zhengzhou</a> and sent soldiers across the <a href="Yellow%20River">Yellow River</a> to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Yancheng">Battle of Yancheng</a>, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang. Later in 1140, Yue was forced to withdraw after the emperor ordered him to return to the Song court.

Emperor Gaozong supported settling a peace treaty with the Jurchens and sought to rein in the assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.

After his execution, Yue Fei's reputation for defending the Southern Song grew to that of a national folk hero. Qin Hui was denigrated by later historians, who accused him of betraying the Song. The real Yue Fei differed from the later myths based on his exploits. Contrary to traditional legends, Yue was only one of many generals who fought against the Jin in northern China. Traditional accounts have also blamed Gaozong for Yue Fei's execution and submitting to the Jin. Qin Hui, in a reply to Gaozong's gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations, told the emperor that "the decision to make peace was entirely Your Majesty's. Your servant only carried it out; what achievement was there in this for me?"

On October 11, 1142, after about a year of negotiations, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Shaoxing">Treaty of Shaoxing</a> was ratified, ending the conflict between the Jin and the Song. By the terms of the treaty, the <a href="Huai%20River">Huai River</a>, north of the Yangtze, was designated as the boundary between the two states. The Song agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 250,000 taels of silver and 250,000 packs of silk to the Jin.

The treaty reduced the Southern Song Dynasty status to that of a Jin vassal. The document designated the Song as the "insignificant state", while the Jin was recognized as the "superior state". The text of the treaty has not survived in Chinese records, a sign of its humiliating reputation. The contents of the agreement were recovered from a Jurchen biography. Once the treaty had been settled, the Jurchens retreated north and trade resumed between the two empires. The peace ensured by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Shaoxing">Treaty of Shaoxing</a> lasted for the next 70 years, but was interrupted twice. One military campaign was initiated by the Song and the other by the Jin.

<a href="Wanyan%20Liang">Wanyan Liang</a> led a coup against Emperor Xizong and became fourth emperor of the Jin dynasty in 1150. Wanyan Liang presented himself as a Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In 1158, Wanyan Liang provided a "casus belli" by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that was the source of widespread unrest in the empire. Anti-Jin revolts erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's indecisiveness. Gaozong's desire for peace made him averse to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched in the direction of the Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi (south of <a href="Ma%27anshan">Ma'anshan</a> in modern Anhui) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou.

The Song official <a href="Yu%20Yunwen">Yu Yunwen</a> was in command of the army defending the river. The Jurchen army was defeated while attacking Caishi between November 26 and 27 during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Caishi">Battle of Caishi</a>. The <a href="paddle%20steamer%23East%20Asia">paddle-wheel ships</a> of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty%23China%27s%20first%20standing%20navy">Song navy</a>, armed with <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a>s that fired <a href="gunpowder">gunpowder</a> bombs, overwhelmed the light ships of the Jin fleet. Jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed. The bombs launched by the Song contained mixtures of gunpowder, lime, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>. Traditional Chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war, characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern China from the northern invaders. The significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fei%20River">Battle of Fei River</a> in the 4th century. Contemporaneous Song accounts claimed that the 18,000 Song soldiers commanded by Yu Yunwen and tasked with defending Caishi were able to defeat the invading Jurchen army of 400,000 soldiers. Modern historians are more skeptical and consider the Jurchen numbers an exaggeration. Song historians may have confused the number of Jurchen soldiers at the Battle of Caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang. The conflict was not the one-sided battle that traditional accounts imply, and the Song had numerous advantages over the Jin. The Song fleet was larger than the Jin's, and the Jin were unable to use their greatest asset, cavalry, in a naval battle.

A modern analysis of the battlefield has shown that it was a minor battle, although the victory did boost Song morale. The Jin lost, but only suffered about 4,000 casualties and the battle was not fatal to the Jurchen war effort. It was Wanyan Liang's poor relationships with the Jurchen generals, who despised him, that doomed the chances of a Jin victory. On December 15, Wanyan Liang was assassinated in his military camp by disaffected officers. He was succeeded by <a href="Emperor%20Shizong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Shizong</a> (r. 1161–1189). Shizong was pressured into ending the unpopular war with the Song, and ordered the withdrawal of Jin forces in 1162. Emperor Gaozong retired from the throne that same year. His mishandling of the war with Wanyan Liang was one of many reasons for his abdication. Skirmishes between the Song and Jin continued along the border, but subsided in 1165 after the negotiation of a peace treaty. There were no major territorial changes. The treaty dictated that the Song still had to pay the annual indemnity, but the indemnity was renamed from "tribute", which had implied a subordinate relationship, to "payment".

The Jin were weakened by the pressure of the rising Mongols to the north, a series of floods culminating in a <a href="1194%20Yellow%20River%20flood">Yellow River flood in 1194</a> that devastated Hebei and Shandong in northern China, and the droughts and swarming locusts that plagued the south near the Huai. The Song were informed of the Jurchen predicament by their ambassadors, who traveled twice a year to the Jin capital, and started provoking their northern neighbor. The hostilities were instigated by chancellor <a href="Han%20Tuozhou">Han Tuozhou</a>. The Song <a href="Emperor%20Ningzong%20of%20Song">Emperor Ningzong</a> (r. 1194–1224) took little interest in the war effort. Under Han Tuozhou's supervision, preparations for the war proceeded gradually and cautiously. The court venerated the <a href="irredentist">irredentist</a> hero Yue Fei and Han orchestrated the publishing of historical records that justified war with the Jin. From 1204 onwards, Chinese armed groups raided Jurchen settlements. Han Tuozhou was designated the head of national security in 1205. The Song funded insurgents in the north that professed loyalist sympathies. These early clashes continued to escalate, partly abetted by <a href="revanchist">revanchist</a> Song officials, and war against the Jin was officially declared on June 14, 1206. The document that announced the war claimed the Jin lost the <a href="Mandate%20of%20Heaven">Mandate of Heaven</a>, a sign that they were unfit to rule, and called for an insurrection of Han Chinese against the Jin state.

Song armies led by general <a href="Bi%20Zaiyu">Bi Zaiyu</a> (; d. 1217) captured the barely defended border city of Sizhou (on the north bank of the Huai River across from modern <a href="Xuyi%20County">Xuyi County</a>) but suffered large losses against the Jurchens in Hebei. The Jin repelled the Song and moved south to besiege the Song town of Chuzhou on the Grand Canal just south of the Huai River. Bi defended the town, and the Jurchens withdrew from the siege after three months. By the fall of 1206, however, the Jurchens had captured multiple towns and military bases. The Jin initiated an offensive against Song prefectures in the central front of the war, capturing <a href="Zaoyang">Zaoyang</a> and Guanghua (; on the <a href="Han%20River%20%28Shaanxi%20%26amp%3B%20Hubei%29">Han River</a> near modern <a href="Laohekou">Laohekou</a>). By the fall of 1206, the Song offensive had already failed disastrously. Soldier morale sank as weather conditions worsened, supplies ran out, and hunger spread, forcing many to desert. The massive defections of Han Chinese in northern China that the Song had expected never materialized.

A notable betrayal did occur on the Song side, however: <a href="Wu%20Xi%20%28general%29">Wu Xi</a> (; d. 1207), the governor-general of Sichuan, defected to the Jin in December 1206. The Song had depended on Wu's success in the west to divert Jin soldiers away from the eastern front. He had attacked Jin positions earlier in 1206, but his army of about 50,000 men had been repelled. Wu's defection could have meant the loss of the entire western front of the war, but Song loyalists assassinated Wu on March 29, 1207, before Jin troops could take control of the surrendered territories. <a href="An%20Bing">An Bing</a> (; d. 1221) was given Wu Xi's position, but the cohesion of Song forces in the west fell apart after Wu's demise and commanders turned on each other in the ensuing infighting.

Fighting continued in 1207, but by the end of that year the war was at a stalemate. The Song was now on the defensive, while the Jin failed to make gains in Song territory. The failure of Han Tuozhou's aggressive policies led to his demise. On December 15, 1207, Han was beaten to death by the Imperial Palace Guards. His accomplice Su Shidan () was executed, and other officials connected to Han were dismissed or exiled. Since neither combatant was eager to continue the war, they returned to negotiations. A peace treaty was signed on November 2, 1208, and the Song tribute to the Jin was reinstated. The Song annual indemnity increased by 50,000 taels of silver and 50,000 packs of fabric. The treaty also stipulated that the Song had to present to the Jin the head of Han Tuozhou, who the Jin held responsible for starting the war. The heads of Han and Su were severed from their exhumed corpses, exhibited to the public, then delivered to the Jin.

The <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a>, a nomadic confederation, had unified in the middle of the twelfth century. They and other steppe nomads occasionally raided the Jin empire from the northwest. The Jin shied away from punitive expeditions and was content with appeasement, similar to the practices of the Song. The Mongols, formerly a Jin tributary, ended their Jurchen vassalage in 1210 and attacked the Jin in 1211. In light of this event, the Song court debated ending tributary payments to the weakened Jin, but they again chose to avoid antagonizing the Jin. They refused Western Xia's offers of allying against the Jin in 1214 and willingly complied when in 1215 the Jin rejected a request to lower the annual indemnity. Meanwhile, in 1214, the Jin retreated from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zhongdu">besieged capital of Zhongdu</a> to Kaifeng, which became the new capital of the dynasty. As the Mongols expanded, the Jin suffered territorial losses and attacked the Song in 1217 to compensate for their shrinking territory. Periodic Song raids against the Jin were the official justification for the war. Another likely motive was that the conquest of the Song would have given the Jin a place to escape should the Mongols succeed in taking control of the north. <a href="Shi%20Miyuan">Shi Miyuan</a> (; 1164–1233), the chancellor of Song <a href="Emperor%20Lizong%20of%20Song">Emperor Lizong</a> (r. 1224–1264), was hesitant to fight the Jin and delayed the declaration of war for two months. Song generals were largely autonomous, allowing Shi to evade blame for their military blunders. The Jin advanced across the border from the center and western fronts. Jurchen military successes were limited, and the Jin faced repeated raids from the neighboring state of Western Xia. In 1217, the Song generals Meng Zongzheng () and Hu Zaixing () defeated the Jin and prevented them from capturing Zaoyang and <a href="Suizhou">Suizhou</a>.

A second Jin campaign in late 1217 did marginally better than the first. In the east, the Jin made little headway in the Huai River valley, but in the west they captured <a href="Xihe%20County">Xihezhou</a> and Dasan Pass (; modern Shaanxi) in late 1217. The Jin tried to captured Suizhou in Jingxi South circuit again in 1218 and 1219, but failed. A Song counteroffensive in early 1218 captured Sizhou and in 1219 the Jin cities of <a href="Dengzhou">Dengzhou</a> and <a href="Tanghe">Tangzhou</a> were pillaged twice by a Song army commanded by <a href="Zhao%20Fang">Zhao Fang</a> (; d. 1221). In the west, command of the Song forces in Sichuan was given to An Bing, who had previously been dismissed from this position. He successfully defended the western front, but was unable to advance further because of local uprisings in the area. The Jin tried to extort an indemnity from the Song but never received it. In the last of the three campaigns, in early 1221, the Jin captured the city of Qizhou (; in Huainan West) deep in Song territory. Song armies led by Hu Zaixing and <a href="Li%20Quan%20%28general%29">Li Quan</a> (; d. 1231) defeated the Jin, who then withdrew. In 1224 both sides agreed on a peace treaty that ended the annual tributes to the Jin. Diplomatic missions between the Jin and Song were also cut off.

In February 1233, the Mongols <a href="Mongol%20siege%20of%20Kaifeng">took Kaifeng after a siege</a> of more than 10 months and the Jin court retreated to the town of <a href="Runan%20County">Caizhou</a>. In 1233 <a href="Emperor%20Aizong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Aizong</a> (r. 1224–1234) of the Jin dispatched diplomats to implore the Song for supplies. Jin envoys reported to the Song that the Mongols would invade the Song after they were done with the Jin—a forecast that would later be proven true—but the Song ignored the warning and rebuffed the request. They instead formed an alliance with the Mongols against the Jin. The Song provided supplies to the Mongols in return for parts of Henan. The Jin dynasty collapsed when Mongol and Song troops <a href="Mongol%20conquest%20of%20the%20Jin%20dynasty">defeated the Jurchens</a> at the <a href="siege%20of%20Caizhou">siege of Caizhou</a> in 1234. General <a href="Meng%20Gong">Meng Gong</a> () led the Song army against Caizhou. The penultimate emperor of the Jin, Emperor Aizong, took his own life. His short-lived successor, <a href="Emperor%20Mo%20of%20Jin">Emperor Mo</a>, was killed in the town a few days later. The Mongols later turned their sights towards the Song. After decades of war, the Song dynasty also <a href="Mongol%20conquest%20of%20the%20Song%20dynasty">fell</a> in 1279, when the remaining Song loyalists lost to the Mongols in a naval battle near <a href="Guangdong">Guangdong</a>.

Jurchen migrants from the northeastern reaches of Jin territory settled in the Jin-controlled lands of northern China. Constituting less than ten percent of the total population, the two to three million ruling Jurchens were a minority in a region that was still dominated by 30 million Han Chinese. The southward expansion of the Jurchens caused the Jin to transition their decentralized government of semi-agrarian tribes to a bureaucratic Chinese-style dynasty.

The Jin government initially promoted an independent Jurchen culture alongside their adoption of the centralized Chinese imperial bureaucracy, but the empire was gradually <a href="Sinicization">sinicized</a> over time. The Jurchens became fluent in the Chinese language, and the philosophy of <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> was used to legitimize the ruling government. Confucian state rituals were adopted during the reign of Emperor Xizong (1135–1150). The Jin implemented <a href="imperial%20examination">imperial exams</a> on the <a href="Four%20Books%20and%20Five%20Classics">Confucian Classics</a>, first regionally and then for the entire empire. The Classics and other works of <a href="Chinese%20literature">Chinese literature</a> were translated into Jurchen and studied by Jin intellectuals, but very few Jurchens actively contributed to the classical literature of the Jin. The <a href="Khitan%20script">Khitan script</a>, from the <a href="Chinese%20family%20of%20scripts">Chinese family of scripts</a>, formed the basis of a national writing system for the empire, the <a href="Jurchen%20script">Jurchen script</a>. All three scripts were <a href="working%20language">working language</a>s of the government. Jurchen clans adopted Chinese personal names with their Jurchen names. Wanyan Liang (Prince of Hailing; r. 1150–1161) was an enthusiastic proponent of Jurchen sinicization and enacted policies to encourage it. Wanyan Liang had been acculturated by Song diplomats from childhood, and his emulation of Song practices earned him the Jurchen nickname of "aping the Chinese". He studied the <a href="Chinese%20classics">Chinese classics</a>, drank <a href="tea">tea</a>, and played <a href="Chinese%20chess">Chinese chess</a> for recreation. Under his reign, the administrative core of the Jin state was moved south from Huining. He instated <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> as the Jin main capital in 1153. Palaces were erected in Beijing and Kaifeng, while the original, more northerly residences of Jurchen chieftains were demolished.

The emperor's political reforms were connected with his desire to conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang's edicts. He sanctioned new policies with the intent to slow the assimilation of the Jurchens. Shizong's prohibitions were abandoned by <a href="Zhangzong%20of%20Jin">Emperor Zhangzong</a> (r. 1189–1208), who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the Song and Tang dynasties. Despite cultural and demographic changes, military hostilities between the Jin and the Song persisted until the fall of the Jin.

In the south, the retreat of the Song dynasty led to major demographic changes. The population of refugees from the north that resettled in Lin'an and Jiankang (modern Hangzhou and Nanjing) eventually grew greater than the population of original residents, whose numbers had dwindled from repeated Jurchen raids. The government encouraged the resettlement of peasant migrants from the southern provinces of the Song to the underpopulated territories between the Yangtze and the Huai rivers.

The new capital Lin'an grew into a major commercial and cultural center. It rose from a middling city of no special importance to one of the world's largest and most prosperous. During his stay in Lin'an in the <a href="Yuan%20dynasty">Yuan dynasty</a> (1260–1368), when the city was not as wealthy as it had been under the Song, <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a> remarked that "this city is greater than any in the world". Once retaking northern China became less plausible and Lin'an grew into a significant trading city, the government buildings were extended and renovated to better befit its status as an imperial capital. The modestly sized imperial palace was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.

The loss of northern China, the cultural center of Chinese civilization, diminished the regional status of the Song dynasty. After the Jurchen conquest of the north, <a href="Goryeo">Korea</a> recognized the Jin, not the Song, as the legitimate dynasty of China. The Song's military failures reduced it to a subordinate of the Jin, turning it into a "China among equals". The Song economy, however, recovered quickly after the move south. Government revenues earned from taxing foreign trade nearly doubled between the closing of the Northern Song era in 1127 and the final years of Gaozong's reign in the early 1160s. The recovery was not uniform, and areas like Huainan and Hubei that had been directly affected by the war took decades to return to their pre-war levels. In spite of multiple wars, the Jin remained one of the main trading partners of the Song. Song demand for foreign products like fur and horses went unabated. Historian believes that Song commerce with the north was profitable enough that it compensated for the silver delivered annually as an indemnity to the Jin.

The battles between the Song and the Jin spurred the invention and use of gunpowder weapons. There are reports that the <a href="fire%20lance">fire lance</a>, one of the earliest <a href="history%20of%20the%20firearm">ancestors of the firearm</a>, was used by the Song against the Jurchens <a href="Siege%20of%20De%27an">besieging De'an</a> (; modern <a href="Anlu">Anlu</a> in eastern Hubei) in 1132, during the Jin invasion of Hubei and Shaanxi. The weapon consisted of a spear attached with a flamethrower capable of firing projectiles from a barrel constructed of bamboo or paper. They were built by soldiers under the command of Chen Gui (), who led the Song army defending De'an. The fire lances with which Song soldiers were equipped at De'an were built for destroying the wooden <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s of the Jin and not for combat against the Jin infantry. Song soldiers compensated for the limited range and mobility of the weapon by timing their attacks on the Jin siege engines, waiting until they were within range of the fire lances. Later fire lances used metal barrels, fired projectiles farther and with greater force, and could be used against infantry.

Early rudimentary bombs like the "huopao" fire bomb () and the "huopao" () bombs propelled by <a href="trebuchet">trebuchet</a> were also in use as incendiary weapons. The defending Song army used "huopao" () during the first Jin siege of Kaifeng in 1126. On the opposing side, the Jin launched incendiary bombs from <a href="siege%20tower">siege tower</a>s down onto the city below. In 1127, "huopao" () were employed by the Song troops defending De'an and by the Jin soldiers besieging the city. The government official Lin Zhiping () proposed to make incendiary bombs and arrows mandatory for all warships in the Song navy. At the battle of Caishi in 1161, Song ships fired "pili huoqiu" (), also called "pili huopao" bombs (), from trebuchets against the ships of the Jin fleet commanded by Wanyan Liang. The gunpowder mixture of the bomb contained powdered <a href="lime%20%28material%29">lime</a>, which produced blinding smoke once the casing of the bomb shattered. The Song also deployed incendiary weapons at the <a href="battle%20of%20Tangdao">battle of Tangdao</a> during the same year.

Gunpowder was also applied to <a href="fire%20arrow">arrows</a> in 1206 by a Song army stationed in Xiangyang. The arrows were most likely an incendiary weapon, but its function may also have resembled that of an <a href="Rocket%23History%20of%20rockets">early rocket</a>. At the Jin siege of Qizhou () in 1221, the Jurchens fought the Song with gunpowder bombs and arrows. The Jin "tiehuopao" (, "iron "huopao""), which had <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> casings, are the first known bombs that could explode. The bomb needed to be capable of detonating in order to penetrate the iron casing. The Song army had a large supply of incendiary bombs, but there are no reports of them having a weapon similar to the Jin's detonating bombs. A participant in the siege recounted in the "Xinsi Qi Qi Lu" (辛巳泣蘄錄) that the Song army at Qizhou had an arsenal of 3000 "huopao" (), 7000 incendiary gunpowder arrows for crossbows and 10000 for bows, as well as 20000 "pidapao" (), probably leather bags filled with gunpowder.

William Harper (Rhodesian politician)

William John Harper (22 July 1916 – 8 September 2006) was a politician, <a href="general%20contractor">general contractor</a> and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> fighter pilot who served as a <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Rhodesia">Cabinet</a> minister in <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> (or <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>) from 1962 to 1968, and <a href="signatories%20of%20Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">signed</a> that country's <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Unilateral Declaration of Independence</a> (UDI) from Britain in 1965. Born into a prominent <a href="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> merchant family in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, Harper was educated in India and England and joined the RAF in 1937. He served as an officer throughout the Second World War and saw action as one of "<a href="The%20Few">The Few</a>" in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>, during which he was wounded in action. Appalled by Britain's granting of independence to India in 1947, he emigrated to Rhodesia on retiring from the air force two years later.

Harper contended that British rule in the subcontinent should never have ended, and took a similar stance regarding his adopted homeland, reportedly declaring that it, South Africa and the neighbouring Portuguese territories would "be under white rule forever". He entered politics with the <a href="Dominion%20Party">Dominion Party</a> in 1958 and became Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF) government in 1962. The head of a far-right group within the RF, he called for Rhodesia to abolish black representation in parliament and adopt "a form of political apartheid". When the Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> resigned in 1964, Harper was a front-runner to succeed him, but lost out to <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, who moved him to the <a href="INTAF">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a>.

Each breakdown or setback during the early years of Smith's premiership prompted press speculation that Harper might replace him. In 1966, when Smith brought a working document back from the <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a> talks with the British Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, Harper led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to their rejection. Harper resigned from the Rhodesian Front in 1968, soon after Smith dismissed him from the Cabinet, reportedly because Harper had had an extramarital affair with a British agent. He subsequently became a vocal critic of the Prime Minister, greeting each step Smith made towards settlement with black nationalists during the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Bush War</a> with public indignation. By the time majority rule began in <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in 1979, following the <a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a> of the previous year, Harper had left for South Africa. He died in 2006 at the age of 90.

William John Harper was born on 22 July 1916 in <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a>, <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>, scion of an old and prominent <a href="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> merchant family that had been based in the subcontinent for generations, working with the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> during the 18th and 19th centuries. He was educated at <a href="St.%20Joseph%27s%20School%2C%20Darjeeling">North Point</a> in <a href="Darjeeling">Darjeeling</a>, India, and in the English town of <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a>. He grew into a short but tough man who spoke with clipped diction. <a href="Nathan%20Shamuyarira">Nathan Shamuyarira</a> wrote of him in 1966 that "his tight mouth rarely relaxes into a smile, so ... he seems always on the point of losing his temper".

Harper joined the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) in 1937, and was commissioned as an acting <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> on 5 September. He was promoted to <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> on 12 February 1940, and attached to <a href="No.%2017%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 17 Squadron</a>. On 18 May 1940 he shared in the destruction of a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20110">Messerschmitt Bf 110</a> heavy fighter, and a week later he destroyed a <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Ju 87</a> "Stuka" <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>. He was appointed B Flight commander, with the rank of acting <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>, on 26 May. He destroyed another Bf 110 over <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> three days later, during the <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">evacuation of Allied forces</a>, and continued as flight commander until 8 June 1940, reverting to the rank of flying officer. He was again promoted to acting flight lieutenant on 4 July, when he was given command of A Flight.

From July 1940, still flying with No. 17 Squadron, Harper was one of "<a href="The%20Few">The Few</a>", the Allied pilots of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Britain">Battle of Britain</a>. On 11 August he shared in the probable destruction of a Bf 110 and damaged a <a href="Messerschmitt%20Bf%20109">Messerschmitt Bf 109</a> fighter. Four days later, after taking off as part of a group of six <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Hurricane</a>s assigned to intercept more than 20 <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> aircraft, Harper contacted the German planes alone and probably destroyed a Bf 109 before being shot down. He crash-landed in a field near the <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> seaside town of <a href="Felixstowe">Felixstowe</a>, and convalesced in hospital there with wounds to his face and leg. He soon rejoined No. 17 Squadron and continued his command of A Flight from the ground—he returned to the skies on 1 November 1940. A week later he destroyed a Ju 87 and probably another. Harper received the <a href="war%20substantive">war substantive</a> rank of flight lieutenant on 12 February 1941. A month later he was posted to No. 57 Operational Training Unit RAF, based at <a href="Hawarden%20Airport">RAF Hawarden</a> in Wales, as an instructor.

In September 1941, Harper was seconded to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) to command <a href="No.%20453%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 453 Squadron RAAF</a>, which was based at Singapore and operated <a href="Brewster%20F2A%20Buffalo">Brewster Buffalo</a> fighters. After suffering heavy losses during the <a href="Malayan%20Campaign">Malayan Campaign</a> in December, No. 453 Squadron was temporarily amalgamated with another Buffalo unit, <a href="No.%2021%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 21 Squadron RAAF</a>, to form No. 21/453 Squadron under Harper's command. By February 1942, No. 453 Squadron was denuded of aircraft and its remaining personnel were evacuated to Australia. Harper assumed command of <a href="No.%20135%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 135 Squadron RAF</a> in India in April 1942. In January 1943 he took command of <a href="No.%2092%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 92 (East India) Squadron RAF</a> in North Africa, and was promoted to temporary <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a> with seniority backdated to March 1942. He was transferred to England in September 1943 and commanded the <a href="University%20Air%20Squadron">University Air Squadron</a> at <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> until 1944. He remained with the RAF following the end of hostilities.

Harper was appalled when Britain made India independent in 1947—he held that the British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands and should have continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of <a href="Wing%20commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>, and the same year emigrated to <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>, a British colony in southern Africa that had been <a href="responsible%20government">self-governing</a> since 1923. He settled in the central town of <a href="Kadoma%2C%20Zimbabwe">Gatooma</a>, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving <a href="General%20contractor">contractor</a>'s business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland">Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland</a> alongside <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> and <a href="Nyasaland">Nyasaland</a>. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.

Harper entered politics when he contested the Gatooma seat in the 1958 <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201958">general election</a>, running for the opposition <a href="Dominion%20Party">Dominion Party</a> (which called for full "<a href="dominion">dominion</a>" or <a href="Commonwealth%20realm">Commonwealth realm</a> status). The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote—the criteria were applied equally regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and colonial <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a> were overwhelmingly drawn from the <a href="white%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white minority</a> (about 5% of the population). Harper won in Gatooma with 717 out of 1,300 votes. Holding strongly conservative views, he soon became seen as the voice of the party's right wing. He was elected president of the Dominion Party's Southern Rhodesian arm in October 1959, and by 1960 he was the official <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a> in the Southern Rhodesian parliament.

Amid <a href="decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonisation</a> and the <a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>, the Federation was looking ever more tenuous and the idea of "<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>" was gaining considerable ground in British political circles. Harper called for Southern Rhodesia to abandon the Federation and "go it alone". In June 1960 he and the Southern Rhodesian branch of the Dominion Party adopted the policy of "Southern Rhodesia first", prompting strong protests from the party's Northern Rhodesian division; the Dominion Party splintered into separate Federal and territorial entities a month later. When black nationalist riots broke out in the townships in October 1960, Harper condemned the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister <a href="Edgar%20Whitehead">Sir Edgar Whitehead</a> and the governing <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Federal Party</a> (UFP) as too lenient on the protesters, and argued that giving concessions following political violence would make black Rhodesians believe that "trouble pays dividends". Arguing against black representation in the Legislative Assembly, he said that if there were black MPs "they will share the restaurant with us and they will share the bars with us. We will be living cheek by jowl with them, and what sort of legislation can the people of this country expect when we ourselves are being conditioned to living cheek by jowl with Africans?"

In 1962 Harper was a founding member of the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF), an alliance of conservative voices centred around the former Dominion Party and defectors from the UFP. The party's declared goal was independence for Southern Rhodesia without radical constitutional change and without any set timetable for the introduction of majority rule. After the RF won a surprise victory in the November 1962 <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">general election</a>—Harper comfortably retained his seat in Gatooma, and elsewhere the country's first black MPs were elected—the new Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> made him Minister of Irrigation, Roads and Road Traffic in the new government. Over the next few years, Harper became one of the main agitators in the Cabinet for a <a href="unilateral%20declaration%20of%20independence">unilateral declaration of independence</a> (UDI); equating Southern Rhodesia to India, he saw this as a way to prevent a repeat of "the same mistake".

The RF grew dissatisfied with Field during late 1963 and early 1964 because of his failure to win independence on Federal dissolution at the end of 1963. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, by contrast, were both independent under black majority governments within a year, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi. Harper, who had been assigned the additional portfolios of Transport and Power in November 1963, was one of two frontrunners to replace Field. The other was the Deputy Prime Minister <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, formerly of the UFP, who was also Minister of the Treasury. Harper, described in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" as "an ambitious politician and single-minded upholder of white supremacy", was generally considered the more hardline choice, and the man more likely to go through with UDI. When the Cabinet forced Field to resign in April 1964, it was Smith who was nominated by the ministers to become the new Prime Minister. Accepting the premiership, Smith reshuffled the Cabinet a few days later and moved Harper to the <a href="INTAF">Ministry of Internal Affairs</a>. Harper was deeply disappointed not to have succeeded Field.

As <a href="Minister%20of%20Internal%20Affairs%20%28Rhodesia%29">Minister of Internal Affairs</a>, Harper oversaw the "<a href="indaba">indaba</a>" (conference) of chiefs and headmen at <a href="Domboshawa">Domboshawa</a> in October 1964, at the end of which the tribal leaders unanimously announced their support for the government's line on independence. He continued to be linked with the premiership. During Smith's negotiations with the British government, each breakdown or setback was accompanied by speculation in Rhodesia ("Southern" was dropped in late 1964) that Harper might step up to take his place. As the dispute with Britain intensified and white Rhodesians clamoured for independence, Harry Franklin reported in "The Spectator" in August 1965 that if Smith proved unwilling to go through with UDI, "it is widely believed that ... Harper will emerge from the wings, no longer an understudy, to dare what Mr Smith dare not." Harper was one of four ministers chosen by Smith to accompany him to London for talks in October 1965, the others being <a href="John%20Wrathall">John Wrathall</a> (Finance), <a href="Desmond%20Lardner-Burke">Desmond Lardner-Burke</a> (Justice) and the Deputy Minister of Information <a href="P.%20K.%20van%20der%20Byl">P K van der Byl</a>. Agreement was not reached and a month later, on 11 November 1965, Smith and his Cabinet <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">declared Rhodesia independent</a>.

At the time of UDI, Harper reportedly kept a map of southern Africa on the wall of his office, on which he had coloured South Africa, South-West Africa, Rhodesia, Mozambique south of the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a> and Angola red; he told visitors that "the red area will be under white rule forever." While insisting that Rhodesia would continue regardless of international opinion, he publicly demonised the UK government, describing it in January 1966 as "an enemy ... [that] must be brought down". He also vilified black nationalist guerrilla fighters opposed to the Rhodesian government, calling them "gangs of terrorists" and "criminals". Comments such as these helped to cement Harper's reputation as a hardline right-winger and rival to Smith's leadership. The strong personalities of Harper and other ministers such as the <a href="James%20Graham%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Montrose">Duke of Montrose</a> (generally known in Rhodesia by his former title Lord Graham) were perceived by the British Prime Minister <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and his compatriots as a great influence on Smith's political decision-making, an opinion also expressed by Harper himself.
Although Harper was considered an intelligent and capable minister by peers and reporters—a 1965 report in "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" called him "by far the best brain" in the Rhodesian Cabinet—his views were often perceived as overly reactionary. He led a phalanx of far-right voices within the RF calling for "a form of political <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>" in Rhodesia, and while the party line was gradual advancement of black political representation, Harper called not only for the cessation of such moves, but for the abolition of black MPs altogether. He thus became something of an obstacle to an Anglo-Rhodesian settlement. Indeed, when Smith brought a working document back from the <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a> talks with Wilson in October 1966, it was Harper who led opposition to the terms in Cabinet, contributing to its ultimate rejection. Harper considered himself to have been overlooked when Smith gave the office of Deputy Prime Minister (which had been vacant since UDI) to the more moderate Wrathall the month before the "Tiger" conference. The South African newspaper "<a href="Beeld">Die Beeld</a>" reported in December 1966 that the RF's right wing was poised to oust Smith in favour of Harper, but this did not occur.

On 4 July 1968, Harper resigned from the Cabinet at Smith's request. He was the first minister to be dismissed during Smith's premiership. The government released a statement explaining that Harper had been removed "for reasons entirely unrelated to differences of opinion over constitutional or other political issues", and saying simply that Harper had been deemed "a security risk". Harper publicly claimed that he had been fired for political reasons and because of the threat he posed to Smith's leadership. Smith was reticent but told reporters he was prepared to tell "the whole sorry tale" if Harper wished.

According to the memoirs of <a href="Ken%20Flower">Ken Flower</a>, then the director of Rhodesia's <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Organisation">Central Intelligence Organisation</a> (CIO), Harper's downfall was the result of an extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">MI6</a>. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers at the time as the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.

Harper officially resigned his parliament seat and left the Rhodesian Front on 11 July 1968. Wilson publicly welcomed his departure as a "step in the right direction", prompting a retort from Smith that he did not appoint or sack ministers to please the British government. Smith said that Harper had been depicted as more extreme than he really was, and denied that he had obstructed a settlement. In retrospect, Smith said he had been glad to be rid of Harper, who he considered underhand and devious. Harper ignored an approach from the ultra-right-wing Rhodesian National Party, offering the leadership, and for a time withdrew from public affairs. Montrose and the ministers Arthur Phillip Smith and Phillip van Heerden briefly threatened to follow Harper out of the government, but backed down within a few days. After a fresh dispute Montrose resigned on 11 September 1968 in protest against Smith's proposed constitutional and racial policies, which he deemed too liberal. A week later the RF's <a href="Albert%20Mells">Albert Mells</a> easily won the by-election to fill Harper's former seat in Gatooma.

By the time of the <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201974">July 1974 general election</a>, amid the <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Bush War</a>, Harper had formed a small bloc of <a href="Independent%20politician">independents</a> called the "Harper Group". In an attempt to co-ordinate opposition to the Rhodesian Front, the group made an election agreement with the Rhodesia Party (RP), which had been formed two years earlier; according to "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Bulletin</a>" it was "seriously hampered by lack of established leadership" but nevertheless offered "the only real resistance [to the RF] in the polls". Shortly before election day, Harper told a meeting of 300 people that under the present system, which was geared to eventually bring parity between black and white Rhodesians, racial tension would increase and "the white man will be forced out of the country." He said that while he was not prepared to let black Rhodesians take control of the government, he understood that some form of power-sharing between the races was imperative to the country's future. The RF won all 50 white roll seats, denying the RP any representation in parliament; Harper himself lost decisively in the southern Salisbury constituency of <a href="Hatfield%2C%20Harare">Hatfield</a>.

By the end of 1974, Harper had formed the United Conservative Party, which called for separate black and white legislatures. He subsequently reacted with revulsion each time Smith moved towards settlement with black nationalist factions. In December that year he described Smith's announcement of a ceasefire in the run-up to the <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Conference%20%281975%29">Victoria Falls Conference</a> as a "ghastly capitulation". In 1976, when Smith announced his acceptance of unconditional majority rule by 1978, Harper accused the Prime Minister of "selling us out". "The mind boggles at the enormous impertinence and audacity of this man Smith," he said.

In December 1975, two months after the disappearance of the prominent lawyer and black nationalist leader Edison Sithole from the middle of Salisbury, along with his secretary Miriam Mhlanga, Harper stepped forward claiming that the Rhodesian state had kidnapped them. In what became known as the "Harper Memorandum", the ex-minister stated that <a href="Special%20Branch%23Rhodesia">Special Branch</a> had interrogated Sithole at <a href="Goromonzi">Goromonzi</a> prison and then shuttled him between holding points around the country. The Rhodesian government denied that it was holding Sithole, adding that he was not under any form of restriction. Sithole and Mhlanga were never seen again, and their fate has never been explained. In modern Zimbabwe it is generally accepted that they were abducted and killed by agents of the Rhodesian government.

Smith and non-militant nationalists agreed what became the <a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a> in March 1978, and in January the following year whites backed the new majority rule constitution by 85% in a national <a href="Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201979">referendum</a>. <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia%20general%20election%2C%201979">Multiracial elections</a> were held in April 1979 with the country due to be reconstituted as <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> afterwards. By this time Harper had already left the country; "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" reported shortly before the elections that he was "already settled in South Africa". Zimbabwe Rhodesia, with Bishop <a href="Abel%20Muzorewa">Abel Muzorewa</a> as Prime Minister, failed to win international acceptance and following the <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House Agreement</a> of December 1979, the UK oversaw a process leading to <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201980">fresh elections</a> in which the guerrilla leader <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> was elected Prime Minister. Britain granted independence to the country as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Harper died on 8 September 2006, at the age of 90.

Allah jang Palsoe (; <a href="EYD">Perfected Spelling</a>: Allah yang Palsu; Malay for "The False God") is a 1919 stage drama from the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> that was written by the <a href="Chinese%20Indonesian">ethnic Chinese</a> author <a href="Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">Kwee Tek Hoay</a> based on <a href="E.%20Phillips%20Oppenheim">E. Phillips Oppenheim</a>'s short story "The False Gods". Over six acts, the <a href="Vernacular%20Malay">Malay-language</a> play follows two brothers, one a devout son who holds firmly to his morals and personal honour, while the other worships money and prioritises personal gain. Over more than a decade, the two learn that money (the titular false god) is not the path to happiness.

Kwee Tek Hoay's first stage play, "Allah jang Palsoe" was written as a <a href="realism%20%28literature%29">realist</a> response to whimsical contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly and the play was deemed difficult to perform, "Allah jang Palsoe" found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered a body of work by authors such as <a href="Lauw%20Giok%20Lan">Lauw Giok Lan</a>, <a href="Tio%20Ie%20Soei">Tio Ie Soei</a>, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the <a href="Lontar%20Foundation">Lontar Foundation</a>.

Brothers Tan Kioe Lie and Tan Kioe Gie are preparing to leave their <a href="Cicurug">Cicuruk</a> home to find work: Kioe Lie will go to <a href="Bandung">Bandung</a>, while Kioe Gie will go to Batavia (now <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>) and become a <a href="Typesetting">letter-setter</a>. As they are packing, Kioe Lie's fiancée Gouw Hap Nio visits. She leaves some snacks with their father, the poor farmer Tan Lauw Pe, before going home, promising to take care of Pe while his sons are away. The brothers finish packing, say goodbye to their father, and head for the train station.

Three years later, Kioe Lie visits his brother in the latter's Batavia home. Kioe Gie has become an editor of the newspaper "Kamadjoean" and is known as a generous philanthropist. Kioe Lie, meanwhile, has become the manager of a <a href="tapioca">tapioca</a> factory, but is planning to leave for competing business run by Tjio Tam Bing, who has offered him twice the salary. Kioe Gie asks him to reconsider, or at least not take any customers, but Kioe Lie is set on his goals. Before Kioe Lie leaves, the brothers discuss marriage: since Kioe Lie has no intent to marry Hap Nio soon, Kioe Gie asks permission to marry first. Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees.

Another four years pass, and Kioe Gie has become editor-in-chief of "Kemadjoean" and married Ijan Nio. He is concerned, however, over the newspaper's new political orientation: the owner, Oeij Tjoan Siat, is aiming to make the paper pro-<a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>, a stance that Kioe Gie considers a betrayal to the ethnic Chinese. When Tjoan Siat comes to Kioe Gie's home to ask him to follow the former's new political leanings, heavily influenced by a monthly payment of 2,000 <a href="Netherlands%20Indies%20gulden">gulden</a> offered by an unnamed political party, Kioe Gie refuses and resigns.

During the following week Kioe Gie and his wife sell their belongings and prepare to move back to Cicuruk. This departure is delayed by a visit from Kioe Lie, who reveals that he will be marrying Tam Bing's widow Tan Houw Nio – Tam Bing having died the year before. Kioe Gie is horrified, both because the widow has the same <a href="Chinese%20surname">surname</a> and because Kioe Lie had promised their father on his deathbed to marry Hap Nio. After an extensive argument, Kioe Lie <a href="Family%20estrangement">disowns</a> his brother and leaves.

Five years later, Kioe Lie and Houw Nio's marriage is failing. Owing to poor investments (some made with embezzled money), Houw Nio's gambling, and Kioe Lie's keeping of a mistress, they have lost their fortune. Kioe Lie tries to convince his wife to sell her jewellery, thus allowing him to return the stolen money. Houw Nio, however, refuses, tells him to sell the house and his mistress' jewellery, and then leaves. Soon afterwards, Kioe Lie's friend Tan Tiang An warns him that he will be arrested by the police unless he flees the colony. Together they rent a car and Kioe Lie heads for the <a href="Tanjung%20Priok">port</a> at Batavia.

Passing through Cicuruk, the car breaks down and, while the chauffeur attempts to fix it, Kioe Lie takes shelter in a nearby home. He learns that it belongs to Kioe Gie and Hap Nio, who have built up a vast farm, garden, and orchard that provide them with ample income. The two philanthropists are friends with the area's elite, and Hap Nio is happily married to a rich plantation administrator. When Kioe Gie and his companions return from playing tennis, they discover Kioe Lie hiding shamefully under a piano. Kioe Lie admits that he was wrong to be greedy. When a police officer arrives, Kioe Lie confesses to poisoning Tam Bing, then runs outside and shoots himself.


"Allah jang Palsoe" was the first stage play by the journalist <a href="Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">Kwee Tek Hoay</a>. Born to an <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">ethnic Chinese</a> textile merchant and his wife, Kwee was raised in <a href="Chinese%20culture">Chinese culture</a> and schools that focused on modernity. By the time he wrote the drama, Kwee Tek Hoay was an active proponent of <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> theology. However, he also <a href="List%20of%20works%20by%20Kwee%20Tek%20Hoay">wrote extensively</a> on themes relating to the <a href="native%20Indonesians">native population</a> of the archipelago and was a keen social observer. He read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay, and drew on these readings after becoming a writer.

According to the historian <a href="Nio%20Joe%20Lan">Nio Joe Lan</a>, "Allah jang Palsoe" was the first stage drama in Malay by a Chinese writer. The six-act work was written in <a href="vernacular%20Malay">vernacular Malay</a>, the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of the Indies, and was based on <a href="E.%20Phillips%20Oppenheim">E. Phillips Oppenheim</a>'s short story "The False Gods". Though in his foreword Kwee Tek Hoay apologised for the quality of the stage play, writing that "the content and arrangement of this book are far from what you could call neat", Sumardjo praises his language, feeling that the story flowed well.

At the time "Allah jang Palsoe" was written, stage performances were heavily influenced by <a href="oral%20literature">orality</a>. Contemporary theatres, such as "<a href="bangsawan">bangsawan</a>" and "<a href="stamboel">stamboel</a>", were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it "better to say things as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. "Allah jang Palsoe" was intended to be the first published stage play in this new tradition.

Kwee Tek Hoay made numerous recommendations for the play's casting, costuming, setting, and music. He wrote that if sufficiently talented actors to portray Kioe Lie and Kioe Gie could not be found, "it would be better to not perform this show", and that Ijan Nio needed to show "a perfect woman or wife", as opposed to the "fierce and rough" Houw Nio. He provided four set designs, to be used at appropriate points in the plot, and gave suggestions for setting up the needed backgrounds and props. Kwee recommended that the play include only one song, <a href="John%20Howard%20Payne">John Payne</a> and <a href="Henry%20Bishop%20%28composer%29">Henry Bishop</a>'s "<a href="Home%21%20Sweet%20Home%21">Home! Sweet Home!</a>", which was to be performed in the sixth act with either English or Malay vocals and a <a href="Trio%20%28music%29">trio</a> of piano, viola, and guitar or <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>.

The title "Allah jang Palsoe" is a reference to money, with an underlying <a href="didactic">didactic</a> message that money is not everything in the world, and that an unquenchable thirst for it would turn one into "a money animal". Throughout the dialogue, money is referred to as the false God, with Lie as a character who deifies money to the point of ignoring his other duties and only realising his error after it is too late. Gie, although he does become rich, does not consider money a god, but is a philanthropist and holds to his morals. The Indonesian literary critic <a href="Sapardi%20Djoko%20Damono">Sapardi Djoko Damono</a> writes that such a message would have been popular among ethnic Chinese of the contemporary Indies, and as such the play would have been a favourite of social organisations.

The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo likewise notes money as the central issue of "Allah jang Palsoe", writing that the play shows individuals doing anything to earn it—even sacrificing their values. He writes that the corrupting nature of money remains present in the best of times, and considers Kwee Tek Hoay's message to have been too heavily based in morality rather than considerations of social and human factors. As a result, he writes, readers are brought to understand the lust for money as a "human illness" which must be overcome: they should follow the example of Tan Kioe Gie, not Tan Kioe Lie. John Kwee of the <a href="University%20of%20Auckland">University of Auckland</a>, citing Gie's departure from "Kamadjoean", suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press, then becoming increasingly commercial.

"Allah jang Palsoe" also contains themes unrelated to money. The <a href="sinologist">sinologist</a> Thomas Rieger notes the presence of a Chinese national identity, pointing to Gie as a young man "excelling in all <a href="Confucianism">Confucianist</a> values", leaving his comfortable job rather than becoming an apologist for the Dutch colonial government to the detriment of his ethnic Chinese peers. Another sinologist, <a href="Myra%20Sidharta">Myra Sidharta</a>, looks at Kwee Tek Hoay's view of women. She writes that his depiction of an ideal woman was not yet fully developed in "Allah jang Palsoe", though she finds Houw Nio to be a depiction of how a woman should not act: selfish and addicted to gambling.

In a preface to his 1926 drama "Korbannja Kong-Ek" ("The Victim of Kong-Ek"), Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that he had drawn inspiration from the <a href="realism%20%28literature%29">realist</a> Norwegian playwright <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in "Allah jang Palsoe". He compares the <a href="stage%20directions">stage directions</a> in "Allah jang Palsoe" to those in Ibsen's "<a href="Hedda%20Gabler">Hedda Gabler</a>" and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.

The script for "Allah jang Palsoe" was released by the Batavia-based publisher Tjiong Koen Bie in mid-1919. This edition included a foreword from the author, four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline of the state of the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay paid for this printing, a run of 1,000 copies, out of his own pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the <a href="Enhanced%20Indonesian%20Spelling%20System">Perfected Spelling System</a>, as part of the first volume of the <a href="Lontar%20Foundation">Lontar Foundation</a>'s anthology of Indonesian stage dramas.

"Allah jang Palsoe" was well received and broadly adopted. Troupes were allowed to perform the play as a charity opera, though proceeds were to go to the branch in <a href="Bogor">Bogor</a>. One performance is recorded as garnering 10,000 gulden. According to an advertisement, by 1930 the play had been performed "tens of times" and was popular with ethnic Chinese theatre troupes. 

Kwee Tek Hoay received numerous letters from fans of "Allah jang Palsoe", spurring him to continue writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel "<a href="Boenga%20Roos%20dari%20Tjikembang%20%28novel%29">Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang</a>" ("The Rose of Cikembang"). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, "Korbannja Kong-Ek", was inspired by a friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading "Allah jang Palsoe".

In 1926 Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that, after "Allah jang Palsoe", the quality of stage performances in the Indies had increased noticeably. Nio notes that the quantity of stage plays by ethnic Chinese authors likewise increased. Though not many were ultimately published, the body of work pioneered by "Allah jang Palsoe" included plays by Kwee Tek Hoay ("Korbannja Kong-Ek", "Mait Hidoep", "Plesiran Hari Minggoe"), <a href="Lauw%20Giok%20Lan">Lauw Giok Lan</a> ("Pendidikan jang Kliroe"), <a href="Tio%20Ie%20Soei">Tio Ie Soei</a> ("Jan Tio"), and Tjoa Tjien Mo ("Beng Lee Koen", "Hsi Shih").

Sumardjo writes that, though "Allah jang Palsoe" was published seven years before the <a href="Rustam%20Effendi">Rustam Effendi</a>'s "Bebasari" (generally considered the first canonic Indonesian stage drama), Kwee Tek Hoay's writing shows all the hallmarks of a literary work. Though the drama is not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, performances have continued into the 21st century. In May 2003, the Jakarta-based put on an abridged performance directed by E. Sumadiningrat. Another Jakarta-based troupe, Teater Bejana, has included it in their repertoire.

The Million Second Quiz

The Million Second Quiz is an American <a href="game%20show">game show</a> that was hosted by <a href="Ryan%20Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a> and broadcast by <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. The series aired from September 9 to September 19, 2013. For a titular million seconds (11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds), contestants attempted to maintain control of a "money chair" by winning trivia matches against other contestants, earning money for every second they occupied the chair. At any given moment, the four highest-scoring contestants other than the one in the chair were sequestered together. When time ran out, the four top scorers received the money they had accumulated and competed in a stepladder playoff for a top prize of $2,000,000.

Executive produced by <a href="Stephen%20Lambert%20%28media%20executive%29">Stephen Lambert</a>, <a href="Eli%20Holzman">Eli Holzman</a>, and David Hurwitz, "The Million Second Quiz" was positioned as a live, multi-platform <a href="Event%20television">television event</a>, which Lambert dubbed "the <a href="Olympics">Olympics</a> of quiz", that would help to promote NBC's lineup for the 2013–14 television season. The series was cross-promoted through several <a href="NBCUniversal">NBCUniversal</a> properties, and NBC broadcast a live prime time show for each night of the competition (except for September 15, due to "<a href="NBC%20Sunday%20Night%20Football">Sunday Night Football</a>") and a two-hour finale. Using a <a href="mobile%20app">mobile app</a>, viewers could play the game against others and potentially earn a chance to appear as a contestant during the prime time episodes. Outside the prime time episodes, the program was also <a href="webcast">webcast</a> throughout the competition by means of the "Million Second Quiz" app and <a href="NBC.com">NBC.com</a>.

Critics argued that the confusing format of "The Million Second Quiz", along with its lack of drama and technical issues with the show's app during the first days of the series, caused viewers to lose interest in watching it on air. Although peaking at 6.52 million viewers for its premiere, ratings steadily dropped during the show's run before rising again near the finale.

The quiz was set in an "<a href="hourglass">hourglass</a>-shaped structure" located on a roof in midtown <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. An indoor set in the same building was also constructed for use during the non-<a href="prime%20time">prime time</a> portions of the game and for any inclement weather situations, as occurred on Day 4. Contestants played in a quiz competition that ran 24 hours a day for 1,000,000 seconds, literally 11 days, 13 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds.

At any given time, one contestant sat in the "Money Chair" and accumulated money while defending his/her position against a series of challengers in head-to-head quiz bouts. Each bout lasted a set number of seconds; after a question was read, the contestants had five seconds to secretly lock in their answers on separate keypads. The contestant in the chair earned money at a rate of $10 per second, even when bouts were not being played and during the prime time commercial breaks. When this contestant lost a bout, he/she stopped earning money and the challenger took control of the chair. Only the four contestants with the highest total winnings kept their money once the countdown clock ran out of time.

Each prime time broadcast hour consists of three bouts: the "Challenger" bout, the "Line Jumper" bout, and the "Winner's Defense" bout. Questions start at one point each, with the value increasing by one every 100 seconds. At any time, either contestant may choose to "double" instead of answering; doing so doubles that question's value and forces the opponent to act. A doubled opponent may either answer or "double back," quadrupling the point value and forcing the original contestant to answer. If a doubled or doubled-back contestant answers incorrectly or fails to act within five seconds, the points are awarded to his/her opponent. Contestants may double as often as they wish during a bout.

At the end of the bout, the contestant with the higher score wins and either retains the Money Chair or replaces its current occupant. If the bout ends in a tie score, a tiebreaker question is asked; the contestant who locks in the correct answer first is the winner. If both of them miss, the contestant who has accumulated more money wins the bout. If a question is in play when the clock runs out, it is completed under the normal rules.

The "Challenger" bout features a person who has successfully completed an on-site tryout process. The "Line Jumper" bout of each episode features a contestant who has achieved a sufficiently high score on the official "Million Second Quiz" app, allowing him/her to skip the tryouts and advance directly onto the show.

At any given time, the four contestants who have accumulated the most money in their bouts live in "Winners' Row," an area of living quarters set up next to the hourglass. They are at risk of being displaced if someone else outscores them. During a "Winner's Defense" bout, the current "Power Player" chooses one of the four Winners' Row occupants (including himself/herself) to face off against the current Money Chair occupant. The winner claims the loser's entire winnings in addition to his/her own and assumes control of the Money Chair, while the loser is eliminated. In episode one, the Power Player was the contestant with the most winnings; starting with episode two, it was the contestant who had the highest number of correct answers from playing along in Winners' Row that day. Contestants who are defeated in the Winner's Defense bouts lose all winnings they have accumulated. All other defeated contestants, including those displaced from Winners' Row by being out-scored, may try out again for a chance to win their way back into the Money Chair.

Outside the one-hour television segments, all bouts last 500 seconds (eight minutes and twenty seconds). Each question is worth one point, and no doubling is allowed. Contestants outside of prime time play non-stop save for a ten-minute bathroom break every hour, and their bouts are live-streamed on NBC's website.

Once the countdown clock reaches zero, the four contestants with the highest totals throughout the game keep all of their credited winnings and compete in a series of three elimination bouts; the fourth and third-place winners face off in a 400-second bout, the victor of the first bout faces the second-place winner (400 seconds), and the victor of the second bout faces the first-place winner (500 seconds). The victor of the final bout receives a further $2,000,000.

In the season finale, Andrew Kravis defeated Brandon Saunders to win the grand prize, for an overall total of $2,326,346. Seacrest then announced that Kravis's winnings would be increased to $2,600,000 to make him the all-time highest-earning regular-season contestant on a single American game show, surpassing <a href="Ken%20Jennings">Ken Jennings</a>'s $2,522,700 run on "<a href="Jeopardy%21">Jeopardy!</a>" in 2004.

The concept of "The Million Second Quiz" was intended to make the show a national event; while pitching the format to NBC, creator <a href="Stephen%20Lambert%20%28media%20executive%29">Stephen Lambert</a> compared the game to a <a href="tennis">tennis</a> match and called it "the <a href="Olympics">Olympics</a> of quiz." To promote the series, NBC relied on a cross-platform promotional strategy similar to what it had used in the past for "<a href="The%20Voice%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The Voice</a>"; including appearances by host <a href="Ryan%20Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a> on other NBC programs, such as the network's <a href="NFL">NFL</a> pre-game show, "<a href="Football%20Night%20in%20America">Football Night in America</a>". to support the show, and tie-in advertisements for programs airing across other <a href="NBCUniversal">NBCUniversal</a> properties (such as <a href="USA%20Network">USA Network</a>). The program itself also served as a vehicle for promoting NBC's then-upcoming lineup for the 2013–14 television season.

NBC wanted the game's prime time portions aired live from an outdoor location in Manhattan with the city skyline for background. Production designer Anton Goss, who also designed the set for NBC's "The Voice", came up with a three-story bent-steel structure in the shape of a giant hourglass laced with lights and containing the custom-made Money Chair - "...on a rooftop with the city behind us...we have to do something significant...It's like we're building our own little skyscraper." Because of the 18,000 lb weight of the hourglass structure in addition to bleachers full of audience members during show times, the building's rooftop required shoring so that the second floor could help carry the large loads. <a href="Geiger%20Engineers">Geiger Engineers</a> provided the structural engineering for the hourglass and other rooftop structures as well as the required rooftop shoring. Two years after the U.S. version of the show was broadcast, an international version of the show aired on China's <a href="Hunan%20TV">Hunan TV</a> in September 2015, entitled .

"The Million Second Quiz" premiered on September 9, 2013; the non-prime time quiz began a day earlier at 7:17 AM <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EDT</a>. The first episode started with 867,826 seconds remaining. The show ran for ten episodes before it concluded on September 19, 2013.

"The Million Second Quiz" received negative reviews from television critics, and ratings went down over time: its premiere and finale were seen by 6.52 and 4.95 million viewers respectively, but fell lower in between. The ratings were generally seen as poor; "<a href="TVWeek">TVWeek</a>" described the show as "ratings-challenged," and while NBC president of alternative and late-night programming Paul Telegdy was satisfied with the debut episode's ratings, Michael O'Connor of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" described it as a "ratings disaster." O'Connor attributed the poor ratings to the show's confusing format and also quoted a network executive as saying: "I don't know how much worse it can get."

"<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Mike Hale believed that the general failure of the series was a result of its unclear format, the "banal" subject matter of many of its questions (citing examples which ranged from American history to the name of <a href="Kim%20Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>'s cat), the fact that <a href="second%20screen">second screen</a> interactions with game shows were not a new concept, and that the show and its interactive components were not "convergent" enough. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>"s Brian Lowry argued that NBC was "a little too desperate to turn "The Million Second Quiz" into 'an event,'" and also stated "having watched the opening 2,600 seconds of actual "Million Second Quiz" content, hey, wake me when it’s "almost" over."

Writing for "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>", Sonia Saraiya felt that "The Million Second Quiz", in contrast to other major reality shows such as "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28U.S.%29">Big Brother</a>", was a "hyped show about hype" that was "so deeply flawed and so universally unpopular that it is not going to remain in anyone's memory for long. ... In this wildly expensive failure, it’s possible to see so many of NBC's flaws, all in the same package." However, she was pleased the show's production for featuring contestants who were "friendly" and "relatable," rather than "chosen for their reprehensibility." "<a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a>"s Catriona Wightman doubted the series would be able to retain viewership: "Even while I sort of enjoyed the first episode despite myself, I can't imagine becoming obsessed with it to that extent - is there really enough there to sustain that kind of interest?"

Writing from a non-prime time contestant's perspective, Seth Stevenson, a journalist for "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>", personally took part in a nighttime slot and was critical of the show's handling of contestants, revealing, "Production assistants whispered that a few contestants who'd pounded <a href="5-Hour%20Energy">5-Hour Energy</a> shots—in an effort to stay alert—had been registering terrifyingly rapid resting pulse rates." Stevenson also added: "I stumbled out onto 11th Avenue at 2:15 a.m. this morning, two calendar days after my internment began, and...hadn't won any money. I hadn't met Ryan Seacrest. And my unhinged "Story" interview will now live in NBC's video vaults for perpetuity, in any and all media formats now existing or ever to be devised throughout the known and unknown galaxy. At least I'm pretty sure that's what the release said. I'm still too amped up on 5-Hour Energy to be sure."

Not My Life

Not My Life is a 2011 American <a href="Independent%20film">independent</a> documentary film about <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a> and <a href="contemporary%20slavery">contemporary slavery</a>. The film was written, produced, and directed by <a href="Robert%20Bilheimer">Robert Bilheimer</a>, who had been asked to make the film by <a href="Antonio%20Maria%20Costa">Antonio Maria Costa</a>, executive director of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20on%20Drugs%20and%20Crime">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a>. Bilheimer planned "Not My Life" as the second installment in a trilogy, the first being "<a href="A%20Closer%20Walk">A Closer Walk</a>" and the third being the unproduced "Take Me Home". The title "Not My Life" came from a June 2009 interview with <a href="Molly%20Melching">Molly Melching</a>, founder of <a href="Tostan">Tostan</a>, who said that many people deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, saying, "No, this is not my life."

Filming of "Not My Life" took four years to complete, and documented human trafficking in 13 countries: <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20India">India</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Uganda">Uganda</a>, and the <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States</a>. The first and last scenes of the film take place in Ghana, and show children who are forced to fish in <a href="Lake%20Volta">Lake Volta</a> for 14 hours a day. The film also depicts sex trafficking victims, some of whom are only five or six years old.

Fifty people are interviewed in the film, including investigative journalist <a href="Paul%20Radu">Paul Radu</a> of <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, <a href="Katherine%20Chon">Katherine Chon</a> of the <a href="Polaris%20Project">Polaris Project</a>, and <a href="Iana%20Matei">Iana Matei</a> of <a href="Reaching%20Out%20Romania">Reaching Out Romania</a>. <a href="Don%20Brewster">Don Brewster</a> of <a href="Agape%20International%20Missions">Agape International Missions</a> says that all of the girls they have rescued from <a href="child%20sex%20tourism">child sex tourism</a> in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to <a href="Richard%20Young%20%28cinematographer%29">Richard Young</a>, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a> in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing <a href="Ashley%20Judd">Ashley Judd</a>'s voice with that of <a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a>. The version of the film that was aired by <a href="CNN%20International">CNN International</a> as part of the <a href="CNN%20Freedom%20Project">CNN Freedom Project</a> was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.

"Not My Life" addresses many forms of slavery, including the <a href="military%20use%20of%20children">military use of children</a> in Uganda, <a href="involuntary%20servitude">involuntary servitude</a> in the United States, forced begging and <a href="garbage%20picking">garbage picking</a> in India, <a href="sex%20trafficking%20in%20Europe">sex trafficking in Europe</a> and Southeast Asia, and other kinds of child abuse. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking. The film asserts that most victims of human trafficking are children. Actress <a href="Lucy%20Liu">Lucy Liu</a> said that people who watch "Not My Life" "will be shocked to find [human trafficking] is happening in America." Lucy Popescu of CineVue criticized the film for focusing on the victims, arguing that the perpetrators of trafficking should have been dealt with more prominently. "Not My Life" was named Best World Documentary at the <a href="Harlem%20International%20Film%20Festival">Harlem International Film Festival</a> in September 2012.

"Not My Life" is a documentary film about <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a> and <a href="contemporary%20slavery">contemporary slavery</a>. It addresses many forms of slavery, including the <a href="military%20use%20of%20children">military use of children</a> in Uganda, <a href="involuntary%20servitude">involuntary servitude</a> in the United States, <a href="Unfree%20labour">unfree labor</a> in Ghana, forced <a href="begging">begging</a> and <a href="garbage%20picking">garbage picking</a> in India, <a href="sex%20trafficking%20in%20Europe">sex trafficking in Europe</a> and Southeast Asia, and other kinds of child abuse. The focus of the film is on trafficking victims, especially women and children, the latter of whom are often betrayed by adults that they trust. The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking, including members of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), <a href="Free%20the%20Slaves">Free the Slaves</a>, <a href="Girls%20Educational%20and%20Mentoring%20Services">Girls Educational and Mentoring Services</a> (GEMS), <a href="International%20Justice%20Mission">International Justice Mission</a> (IJM), the <a href="Somaly%20Mam%20Foundation">Somaly Mam Foundation</a>, <a href="Terre%20des%20hommes">Terre des hommes</a>, <a href="Tostan">Tostan</a>, <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>, <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20on%20Drugs%20and%20Crime">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC), and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> (US DoS). "Not My Life" has been called "a cautionary tale". It depicts the <a href="commodification">commodification</a> of millions of people and identifies the practices of traffickers as undermining international economics, security, sustainability and health.

"Not My Life" calls attention to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for <a href="human%20trafficking%20in%20the%20United%20States">human trafficking</a> is less severe than for <a href="Illegal%20drug%20trade%20in%20the%20United%20States">drug trafficking</a>. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, <a href="Robert%20Bilheimer">Robert Bilheimer</a> encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.

According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of "<a href="Stone%20Canoe">Stone Canoe</a>", a U.S. literary journal, the film's audiences are likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> and <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word "slavery" in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to "reclaim the original term [slavery] and convince us that what is happening now is what happened then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and ... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." Rhodes says that the word "slavery" has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as "<a href="Hustle%20%26amp%3B%20Flow">Hustle & Flow</a>" (2005) and "<a href="Black%20Snake%20Moan%20%28film%29">Black Snake Moan</a>" (2007). The <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning "Hustle & Flow" portrays a pimp as the hero, while "Black Snake Moan" features <a href="Christina%20Ricci">Christina Ricci</a> as a young <a href="Hypersexuality">nymphomaniac</a>; the marketing for "Black Snake Moan" centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer "rescue[s] modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals in the context of their communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.

Fifty people are interviewed in "Not My Life", including <a href="Katherine%20Chon">Katherine Chon</a> of the <a href="Polaris%20Project">Polaris Project</a>, investigative journalist <a href="Paul%20Radu">Paul Radu</a> of <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, Vincent Tournecuillert of Terre des hommes, <a href="Iana%20Matei">Iana Matei</a> of <a href="Reaching%20Out%20Romania">Reaching Out Romania</a>, UNICEF Director of Programmes <a href="Nicholas%20Alipui">Nicholas Alipui</a>, <a href="Susan%20Bissell">Susan Bissell</a> of UNICEF's Child Protection Section, Antonio Maria Costa of UNODC, <a href="Somaly%20Mam">Somaly Mam</a> of the Somaly Mam Foundation, Molly Melching of Tostan in Senegal, and <a href="Suzanne%20Mubarak">Suzanne Mubarak</a>, who was <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20Egypt">First Lady of Egypt</a> at the time. The sex trafficking victims shown in the film include children as young as five and six years old.

"Not My Life" begins with a black screen on which the words "Human trafficking is slavery" appear in white. A sequence filmed in Ghana follows, showing children who are forced to fish in <a href="Lake%20Volta">Lake Volta</a> for 14 hours a day. Many of the children die as a result of the working conditions. A 10-year-old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera, looking into it, and holds his breath underwater while trying to unsnarl a fishing net. Next, Senegalese <a href="talibe">talibe</a>s, <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> boys who attend <a href="Quran">Quran</a>ic schools, appear. There are approximately 50,000 talibes in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten. Many of these children suffer from <a href="Cutaneous%20condition">skin</a> and <a href="stomach%20disease">stomach disease</a>s because of their diet of <a href="Food%20spoilage">spoiled food</a>—one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera, only for an adult to pull him away by the ear. The film then moves to India and depicts children, mostly wearing flip-flops, illegally sorting through hazardous waste in <a href="Ghazipur%2C%20Delhi">Ghazipur</a> and <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> landfills. <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a> families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe, and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging, and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as <a href="Prostitution%20of%20children">child prostitutes</a>. The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking "are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet's youth."

In Zoha Prison in Romania, there are interviews with traffickers serving prison sentences that the film suggested were too short in light of the severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.

Radu is interviewed in this portion of the film, as is Tournecuillert, who speaks about his experiences in Albania, where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls. He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy. He further explains that, normally, before they leave Albania, the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others—usually by burning or shooting—to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape. Matei adds that, for the sake of amusement, some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground. <a href="Eugenia%20Bonetti">Eugenia Bonetti</a>, a <a href="nun">nun</a>, speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy.

Another interview is with a <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> woman named Angie who was prostituted with another girl, Melissa, in the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">American Midwest</a> when they were teenagers. Angie recounts how they were expected to have sex with truck drivers and steal their money. She describes an incident when, after Melissa found pictures of a man's grandchildren in his wallet, they realized he was old enough to be their own grandfather. "I wanted to die," she says, close to tears. Outside the film, Bilheimer said that Angie's trafficker expected her to engage in forty sex acts a night, and threatened to kill her if she refused. "It's not just truck drivers," FBI agent <a href="Mike%20Beaver%20%28FBI%20agent%29">Mike Beaver</a> says. "We're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals." This statement segues into a <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, scene wherein two girls in their early teens are shown by a curb on <a href="K%20Street%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">K Street</a>, changing into prostitutes' attire.

Angie was rescued during <a href="Operation%20Stormy%20Nights">Operation Stormy Nights</a>, an anti-human-trafficking operation carried out by the FBI, in 2004. Bilheimer said that, while there is no way of being certain how many girls like Angie are being sexually trafficked in the U.S., "diligent people out there have arrived at a bare minimum figure of ... one hundred thousand girls, eight to fifteen [performing] ten sex acts a day" adding up to "a billion unpunished crimes of sexual violence on an annual basis."

Another American victim of sexual trafficking, <a href="Sheila%20White%20%28human%20trafficking%20victim%29">Sheila White</a>, describes an incident in 2003 when she was beaten up next to the <a href="Port%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. She says that nobody even asked her if she needed help. White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with GEMS to raise awareness on the issue in New York. In 2012, after the film was released, <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>, President of the United States, recognized White's work and told her story during a speech to the <a href="Clinton%20Foundation%23Clinton%20Global%20Initiative%20%28CGI%29">Clinton Global Initiative</a>.

The next scenes in the film depict <a href="child%20labour%20in%20Nepal">child labour in Nepal</a>, and indicate that child workers in the textile industry are commonly targeted by sex traffickers. A brothel raid in India, led by <a href="Balkrishna%20Acharya">Balkrishna Acharya</a> of the Rescue Foundation in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, is then shown. Ten young girls are rescued from a four-by-three-foot closet and a crawl space. The <a href="Procuring%20%28prostitution%29">madam</a> reacts furiously, perceiving the raid as taking away her livelihood. Then, the <a href="trafficking%20of%20children">trafficking of children</a> into the <a href="sex%20industry">sex industry</a> is depicted in Cambodia. Some scenes take place in <a href="Svay%20Pak">Svay Pak</a>, <a href="Phnom%20Penh">Phnom Penh</a>, one of the cheapest <a href="sex%20tourism">sex tourism</a> destinations in the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a>. Women of the Somaly Mam Foundation are depicted working with girls who have been sexually trafficked. A large number of these girls are pictured one by one, each child fading into the next against the backdrop of a doorway. An interview with one of the Somaly Mam Foundation workers, Sophea Chhun, reveals that her daughter, Sokny, was kidnapped in 2008 at age 23. "Most likely Sokny too was sold," Chhun says, claiming that "the police treated it like she wasn't important"—perhaps, she suggests, because Sokny was an adopted child. <a href="Don%20Brewster">Don Brewster</a> of <a href="Agape%20International%20Missions">Agape International Missions</a> is interviewed, and says that all of the girls they have rescued from <a href="child%20sex%20tourism">child sex tourism</a> in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. Bilheimer agreed with this assertion in an interview outside the film.

In <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a>, Guatemalan trafficker Efrain Ortiz is shown being arrested, and the film indicates that he was later given a prison sentence of 95 years. Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with. Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo Villeda, Amy Roth, and <a href="Gary%20Haugen">Gary Haugen</a> as they and the local police arrest Ortiz; he is charged with exploitation of children and <a href="violence%20against%20women">violence against women</a>. Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed. Haugen, President of IJM, went on to be named a Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Hero in the 2012 US DoS <a href="Trafficking%20in%20Persons%20Report">TIP Report</a>.

<a href="Grace%20Akallo">Grace Akallo</a>, a Ugandan woman who was once <a href="Aboke%20abductions">abducted</a> by <a href="Joseph%20Kony">Joseph Kony</a> to be used as a child soldier in the <a href="Lord%27s%20Resistance%20Army">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA), is interviewed, saying that "this kind of evil must be stopped." She was forced to kill another girl as part of her initiation into the LRA, a very common practice among armies that employ child soldiers. The film states that she was ultimately rehabilitated and became a mother.

Bishop <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a>, who Bilheimer had previously interviewed for "The Cry of Reason", appears towards the end of the film, saying, "Each of us has the capacity to be a saint." Bilheimer included Tutu in "Not My Life" because he felt that audiences might be in need of <a href="pastoral%20counseling">pastoral counseling</a> after watching the film. The final scene of "Not My Life" returns to the boy holding his breath underwater in Ghana. His name is revealed to be Etse, and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued. Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: "I can't see a good life while there are people living like animals. Not because I'm a good person, not because it's my duty, but because they are human—like me."

The project that became "Not My Life" was initiated by the executive director of the UNODC, <a href="Antonio%20Maria%20Costa">Antonio Maria Costa</a>, who wanted to commission a film that would "bring the issue of modern slavery to the attention of public opinion, globally—especially the well-meaning, law-abiding and God-fearing people who do not believe something so horrible is happening in their own neighborhood." With this goal in mind, Costa approached Worldwide Documentaries, an <a href="East%20Bloomfield%2C%20New%20York">East Bloomfield, New York</a>-based organization that had produced two films with which he was familiar: "<a href="The%20Cry%20of%20Reason">The Cry of Reason</a>", which documents <a href="internal%20resistance%20to%20South%20African%20apartheid">internal resistance to South African apartheid</a> by way of <a href="Beyers%20Naud%C3%A9">Beyers Naudé</a>'s story; and "<a href="A%20Closer%20Walk">A Closer Walk</a>", which is about the <a href="epidemiology%20of%20HIV/AIDS">epidemiology of HIV/AIDS</a>. Costa e-mailed Bilheimer, Director of Worldwide Documentaries, asking him to create the film he envisioned. Costa said that he choose Bilheimer because the director had developed a "solid reputation [for] addressing difficult topics... combining artistic talent, a philosophical view about development and a humanitarian sentiment about what to do about the issues."

Bilheimer accepted Costa's proposition, and subsequently wrote, produced, and directed "Not My Life" as an <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a>. Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for "The Cry of Reason", said that "the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization we have ever seen." Bilheimer's wife, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-produced "Not My Life" with him. She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because "people do not want to talk about this issue." Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of "A Closer Walk" were also useful when producing "Not My Life" because the poor and the outcast are at the greatest risk of both <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions. Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film in such a way that every part of it would illustrate a statement made by <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>: "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong."

When making this film, Bilheimer held that a <a href="Abolitionism%23Contemporary%20abolitionism">contemporary abolitionist</a> movement did not yet exist. He described his purpose in creating the film as to raise awareness and initiate such a movement. He also wished to communicate to his audiences that not all human trafficking is sexual. Traffickers "commit unspeakable, wanton acts of violence against their fellow human beings," he said, "and are rarely punished for their crimes." Production of "Not My Life" was supported by the <a href="United%20Nations%20Global%20Initiative%20to%20Fight%20Human%20Trafficking">United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking</a> (UN.GIFT), UNICEF, and UNODC, providing Worldwide Documentaries with $1 million in funding secured by Costa.

Bilheimer said that the level of cruelty he saw in shooting "Not My Life" was greater than anything he had seen when documenting <a href="apartheid%20in%20South%20Africa">apartheid in South Africa</a> for "The Cry of Reason". Bilheimer attested to becoming more aware of the global extent of human trafficking as he went about making "Not My Life". The film's title came from a June 2009 interview with <a href="Molly%20Melching">Molly Melching</a>, founder of Tostan, an organization dedicated to <a href="human%20rights%20education">human rights education</a> operating in ten African countries. As Bilheimer and Melching spoke in <a href="Thi%C3%A8s">Thiès</a>, Senegal, discussing how people often deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, Melching said, "People can say, 'No, this is not my life.' But my life can change. Let's change together."

Filming of "Not My Life" took place over four years in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America documenting human trafficking in thirteen countries: <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20India">India</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Senegal">Senegal</a>, <a href="Human%20trafficking%20in%20Uganda">Uganda</a>, and the United States. Shooting in Ghana took place over four 18-hour days, during which the film crew had to travel over <a href="Washboarding">washboard roads</a> in <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a>s and did not sleep. Filming in Svay Pak took place in March 2010, and shooting in <a href="Abusir%20%28Lake%20Mariout%29">Abusir</a>, Egypt took place the following month.

In Guatemala, Bilheimer facilitated the arrest of trafficker Ortiz by renting a car for the police to use, in order to film the arrest as part of "Not My Life". Bilheimer said that, during the making of the film, he and his crew were surprised to discover that traffickers employ similar methods of intimidation across the globe, "almost as if there were ... unwritten bylaws and tactics ... The lies are the same."

<a href="Susan%20Tedeschi">Susan Tedeschi</a>, <a href="Derek%20Trucks">Derek Trucks</a>, and <a href="Dave%20Brubeck">Dave Brubeck</a> performed the theme song for "Not My Life", <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="Lord%20Protect%20My%20Child">Lord Protect My Child</a>", which was produced by <a href="Chris%20Brubeck">Chris Brubeck</a>. After the initial screenings in early 2011, the film went through a series of revisions, taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups. Later that year, the narration was completely rerecorded; Bilheimer replaced <a href="Ashley%20Judd">Ashley Judd</a>'s voice with that of <a href="Glenn%20Close">Glenn Close</a>, who had previously worked with him on "A Closer Walk". The version of the film that was aired by <a href="CNN%20International">CNN International</a> was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. An even shorter version, only 30 minutes long, was created with school audiences in mind.

Content relating to the Egyptian <a href="Mixed-sex%20education">mixed-sex</a> schools instituted by Suzanne Mubarak was gathered, but Bilheimer eventually removed much of this content from the film because the <a href="Arab%20Spring">Arab Spring</a> made the information in this portion of the film outdated, despite the continued existence of most of these schools. Much of the interview with Molly Melching was removed as well. During the editing of "Not My Life", Bilheimer cut the interview with Tutu, but later re-added a single quotation. In this interview, Bilheimer told Tutu about meeting normally reasonable, compassionate women who, when speaking about human traffickers, say things like "Hang him up by his balls and then cut 'em off!" Tutu, head of the <a href="truth%20and%20reconciliation%20commission">truth and reconciliation commission</a>, surprised Bilheimer with his response, saying that "these people have committed monstrous acts," but that, according to Christianity, traffickers can still be <a href="Redemption%20%28theology%29">redeemed</a> and become saints.

As had occurred with Bilheimer's previous film, "A Closer Walk", "Not My Life" had several preview screenings before its official release. The <a href="United%20States%20Agency%20for%20International%20Development">United States Agency for International Development</a> (USAID) hosted a preview screening at the <a href="Willard%20InterContinental%20Washington">Willard InterContinental Washington</a> in September 2009 as part of a day-long symposium on human trafficking. A preview screening in Egypt, including the material shot in that country that was later removed, took place in December 2010 at the International Forum against Human Trafficking in <a href="Luxor">Luxor</a>.

Later that month, on December 15, the film's cinematographer and co-director <a href="Richard%20Young%20%28cinematographer%29">Richard Young</a> died. "Not My Life" was subsequently dedicated to him. Bilheimer said that Young had believed in the film far more than he himself had.

The film had its official premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts</a> in New York City on January 19, 2011. <a href="Melanne%20Verveer">Melanne Verveer</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador-at-Large%20for%20Global%20Women%27s%20Issues">United States Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women's Issues</a>, gave a speech, saying, "Each and every one of us is called to act. I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment." Additional screenings were held in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> later that month. That October, "Not My Life" had its international premiere in <a href="London">London</a>. CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the <a href="CNN%20Freedom%20Project">CNN Freedom Project</a>. The Swedish premiere was attended by <a href="Victoria%2C%20Crown%20Princess%20of%20Sweden">Crown Princess Victoria</a>. Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources, so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of "Not My Life", ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings. On November 1, an 83-minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries, which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses. <a href="LexisNexis">LexisNexis</a>, the governments of <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, and the <a href="U.S.%20Fund%20for%20UNICEF">U.S. Fund for UNICEF</a> all purchased licenses. The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti-human-trafficking campaign.

"Not My Life" was screened at the 2012 <a href="UNIS-UN%20Conference">UNIS-UN Conference</a> in New York City, the theme of which was human exploitation. Segments from the film were included in "Can You Walk Away?", a 2012 exhibition on contemporary slavery at <a href="President%20Lincoln%27s%20Cottage%20at%20the%20Soldiers%27%20Home">President Lincoln's Cottage at the Soldiers' Home</a> in Washington, DC. A hotel chain presented the film to its staff in London in preparation for the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> to raise awareness about the types of human trafficking that might take place in conjunction with the events. Bilheimer initiated an <a href="Indiegogo">Indiegogo</a> <a href="crowdfunding">crowdfunding</a> campaign in 2012 to allow local organizations opposing human trafficking to screen the film. That same year, he expressed a willingness to release fifteen-minute excerpts from the film to help its message reach more people.

In a 2012 interview, Bilheimer said that he considered "A Closer Walk" and "Not My Life" to be the first two installments in a trilogy; he intended to make an <a href="Environmental%20issues%20in%20film%20and%20television">environmental film</a> called "Take Me Home" as the third installment. As of 2013, however, the Worldwide Documentaries website stated that Bilheimer was considering different subjects for his next film, including <a href="poverty%20in%20the%20United%20States">poverty in the United States</a>, the aftermath of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, and <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a> among <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> veterans of the wars in <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq</a> and <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a>. Bilheimer said in 2013 that "Not My Life" "is not a perfect film by any means, but it is having an impact." He said that he would like to be moving on to a new film project, but that he would continue promoting "Not My Life" because he thought it could help combat human trafficking.

Throughout 2013, the <a href="World%20Affairs%20Councils%20of%20America">World Affairs Councils of America</a> hosted "Not My Life" screenings in a variety of cities across the United States, funded by the <a href="Carlson%20Companies">Carlson</a> Family Foundation. That same year, the <a href="Swedish%20International%20Development%20Cooperation%20Agency">Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency</a> gave Worldwide Documentaries a grant to do anti-human trafficking work over a three-year period. "Not My Life" was screened at the Mexican <a href="film%20festival">film festival</a> <a href="Oaxaca%20FilmFest">Oaxaca FilmFest</a> in November 2012; BORDEReview in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, Poland, in May 2013; and the Pasadena International Film & New Media Festival in February 2014.

In May 2014, the Somaly Mam Foundation released a statement that Somaly had resigned from her leadership of the organization as a result of investigations regarding allegations about her personal history. The following month, Bilheimer released a statement in response, saying that he had re-edited the film in order to remove the scenes depicting Somaly and that the new version would be available shortly. Bilheimer wrote that "the storytelling in the Cambodia segment of "Not My Life" remains intact and is still very moving, with an even sharper focus, now, on the girls themselves." In this statement, Bilheimer requested that people screening previous versions of the film tell their audiences that the presence of Somaly in the film is understandably a distraction, that the film is not primarily about Somaly but rather about the millions of children in slavery in the world, and that this focus is what is most important about the film.

For the 2014 re-release of the film, Bilheimer added new content relating to India, including an interview with <a href="Kailash%20Satyarthi">Kailash Satyarthi</a>, founder of the non-governmental organization <a href="Bachpan%20Bachao%20Andolan">Bachpan Bachao Andolan</a> which opposes <a href="Child%20labour">child labor</a>. This content emphasizes that there are more human trafficking victims in India than in any other country in the world. The new version of the film, which was co-produced with the Delhi-based Riverbank Studios, was 56 minutes long and premiered at the <a href="India%20International%20Centre">India International Centre</a> in New Delhi on June 26. Satyarthi was one of the panelists in a panel discussion accompanying the screening, as was Indian filmmaker <a href="Mike%20Pandey">Mike Pandey</a>, who had managed Riverbank Studios' side of the co-production. The film was scheduled to air on <a href="Doordarshan">Doordarshan</a> (DD) in Hindi three days later. In July, Bilheimer called his continued work on the film "a labor of love" and said that "far too much silence still surrounds the issue" of human trafficking.

At the USAID preview screening, actress <a href="Lucy%20Liu">Lucy Liu</a>, who has worked with <a href="MTV%20EXIT">MTV EXIT</a> and produced the documentary film "<a href="Redlight%20%28film%29">Redlight</a>", said that people who watch "Not My Life" "will be shocked to find [human trafficking] is happening in America"; she said that there were 80,000 women being sexually assaulted daily and she called human trafficking the "cannibalization of the planet's youth." According to UN.GIFT, before "Not My Life", there was "no single communication tool that effectively depict[ed] the problem as a whole for a mass audience." Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film "takes a close look at the underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [and] it will change the way we see our lives, in some very fundamental ways." She also said that "Not My Life" is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from "<a href="Medical%20News%20Today">Medical News Today</a>" praised the film for "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," arguing that these activities "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses."

Lucy Popescu of CineVue called the film "a powerful indictment of the global trade in human beings and the abuse of vulnerable people," but criticized the film for focusing on human trafficking victims, arguing that the perpetrators should have been dealt with more prominently. She commended Bilheimer on the few interviews with traffickers that he did include, but she condemned as inadequate the "only passing reference to the thousands of men who engage in sexual tourism, like those who travel to Cambodia to 'buy' traumatized children who they can then abuse for weeks at a time." Popescu also called the film "simplistic", arguing that it should have more clearly expressed that sex trafficking victims are not able to provide legitimate consent for sexual activity because they are afraid that their lives might be in danger if they do not comply. John Rash of the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>" called the film "a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern-day scourge." Rash praised the film for its global scope, but suggested that this geographical breadth allows American audiences to ignore the fact that the trafficking of children is prevalent in the United States and not just in other countries.

"Not My Life" was named Best World Documentary at the <a href="Harlem%20International%20Film%20Festival">Harlem International Film Festival</a> in September 2012. Nancy Keefe Rhodes of "Stone Canoe" called it a "highly-distilled ... remarkable film," describing Bilheimer as "committed to strong story-telling and film-as-craft." She commends Bilheimer on alternating between American sequences and scenes in other countries, allowing "the experiences of young women with whom an American audience may more readily identify [to] become one among many woven into the fabric of global trafficking." Tripurari Sharan, Director General of DD, said that his organization was pleased to air the film and hoped that doing so would bring about greater awareness across India about human trafficking in the country. He called the film "both an eye-opener and a profoundly moving call to action".

The Negro Motorist Green Book

The Negro Motorist Green Book (also The Negro Motorist Green-Book, The Negro Travelers' Green Book , or simply the "Green Book") was an annual <a href="guide%20book">guidebook</a> for <a href="African%20Americans">African-American</a> <a href="Road%20trip">roadtrippers</a>. It was originated and published by African American, New York City mailman <a href="Victor%20Hugo%20Green">Victor Hugo Green</a> from 1936 to 1966, during the era of <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a>, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against African Americans especially and other non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging <a href="African-American%20middle%20class">African-American middle class</a> bought automobiles as soon as they could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.

Many Black Americans took to driving, in part to avoid segregation on public transportation. As the writer <a href="George%20Schuyler">George Schuyler</a> put it in 1930, "all Negroes who can do so purchase an automobile as soon as possible in order to be free of discomfort, discrimination, segregation and insult." Black Americans employed as athletes, entertainers, and salesmen also traveled frequently for work purposes.

African-American travelers faced hardships such as white-owned businesses refusing to serve them or repair their vehicles, being refused accommodation or food by white-owned hotels, and threats of physical violence and forcible expulsion from whites-only "<a href="sundown%20town">sundown town</a>s". Green founded and published the "Green Book" to avoid such problems, compiling resources "to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable." The maker of a 2019 documentary film about the book offered this summary: "Everyone I was interviewing talked about the community that the Green Book created: a kind of parallel universe that was created by the book and this kind of secret road map that the Green Book outlined".

From a New York-focused first edition published in 1936, Green expanded the work to cover much of North America, including most of the United States and parts of Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. The "Green Book" became "the bible of black travel during Jim Crow", enabling black travelers to find lodgings, businesses, and gas stations that would serve them along the road. It was little known outside the African-American community. Shortly after passage of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, which outlawed the types of racial discrimination that had made the "Green Book" necessary, publication ceased and it fell into obscurity. There has been a revived interest in it in the early 21st century in connection with studies of black travel during the Jim Crow era.

Four issues (1940, 1947, 1954, and 1963) have been republished in facsimile (as of December 2017), and have sold well.

Before the legislative accomplishments of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, black travelers in the United States faced major problems unknown to most whites. <a href="White%20supremacy">White supremacists</a> had long sought to restrict black mobility, and were uniformly hostile to black strangers.

As a result, simple auto journeys for black people were fraught with difficulty and potential danger. They were subjected to <a href="racial%20profiling">racial profiling</a> by police departments ("<a href="driving%20while%20black">driving while black</a>"), sometimes seen as "uppity" or "too prosperous" just for the act of driving, which many whites regarded as a white prerogative. They risked harassment or worse on and off the highway. A bitter commentary published in a 1947 issue of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>'s magazine, "<a href="The%20Crisis">The Crisis</a>", highlighted the uphill struggle blacks faced in recreational travel:

Thousands of communities in the US had enacted Jim Crow laws that existed after 1890; in such <a href="sundown%20towns">sundown towns</a>, African Americans were in danger if they stayed past sunset. Such restrictions dated back to colonial times, and were found throughout the United States. After the end of legal slavery in the North and later in the South after the Civil War, most freedmen continued to live at little more than a subsistence level, but a minority of African -Americans gained a measure of prosperity. They could plan leisure travel for the first time. Well-to-do blacks arranged large group excursions for as many as 2,000 people at a time, for instance traveling by rail from <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> to resorts along the coast of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>.

In the pre-Jim Crow era this necessarily meant mingling with whites in hotels, transportation and leisure facilities. They were aided in this by the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>, which had made it illegal to discriminate against African-Americans in <a href="public%20accommodations">public accommodations</a> and public transportation.

They encountered a white backlash, particularly in the South, where by 1877 white Democrats controlled every state government. The Act was declared unconstitutional by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> (SCOTUS) in 1883, resulting in states and cities passing numerous segregation laws. White governments in the South required even interstate railroads to enforce their segregation laws, despite national legislation requiring equal treatment of passengers.

SCOTUS ruled in "<a href="Plessy%20v.%20Ferguson">Plessy v. Ferguson</a>" (1896) that "<a href="separate%20but%20equal">separate but equal</a>" accommodations were constitutional, but in practice, facilities for blacks were far from equal, generally being of lesser quality and underfunded. Blacks faced restrictions and exclusion throughout the United States: if not barred entirely from facilities, they could use them only at different times from whites or in (usually inferior) "colored sections".
In 1917, black writer <a href="W.%20E.%20B.%20Du%20Bois">W. E. B. Du Bois</a> observed that the impact of "ever-recurring race discrimination" had made it so difficult to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now "a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations".

It was a problem that came to affect an increasing number of black people in the first decades of the 20th century. Tens of thousands of southern African-Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel.

The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the "Jim Crow cars" – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages.

One black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile, "it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. We feel like Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh."

Middle-class blacks throughout the United States "were not at all sure how to behave or how whites would behave toward them", as Bart Landry puts it. In <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, the African-American newspaper editor <a href="Wendell%20Dabney">Wendell Dabney</a> wrote of the situation in the 1920s that "hotels, restaurants, eating and drinking places, almost universally are closed to all people in whom the least tincture of colored blood can be detected."

Areas without significant black populations outside the South often refused to accommodate them: not one hotel or other accommodation was open to blacks in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> in the 1920s. Black travelers were stranded if they had to stop there overnight. Only six percent of the more than 100 motels that lined <a href="U.S.%20Route%2066">U.S. Route 66</a> in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque</a>, admitted black customers. Across the whole state of <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, only three motels in 1956 served African-Americans.

George Schuyler reported in 1943, "Many colored families have motored all across the United States without being able to secure overnight accommodations at a single tourist camp or hotel." He suggested that black Americans would find it easier to travel abroad than in their own country. In <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> in 1945, <a href="St.%20Clair%20Drake">St. Clair Drake</a> and Horace A. Cayton reported that "the city's hotel managers, by general agreement, do not sanction the use of hotel facilities by Negroes, particularly sleeping accommodations." One incident reported by Drake and Cayton illustrated the discriminatory treatment meted out even to blacks within racially mixed groups:

While automobiles made it much easier for black Americans to be independently mobile, the difficulties they faced in traveling were such that, as Lester B. Granger of the <a href="National%20Urban%20League">National Urban League</a> puts it, "so far as travel is concerned, Negroes are America's last pioneers." Black travelers often had to carry buckets or portable toilets in the trunks of their cars because they were usually barred from bathrooms and rest areas in service stations and roadside stops. Travel essentials such as gasoline were difficult to purchase because of discrimination at gas stations.

To avoid such problems on long trips, African-Americans often packed meals and carried containers of gasoline in their cars. Writing of the road trips that he made as a boy in the 1950s, Courtland Milloy of the "Washington Post" recalled that his mother spent the evening before the trip frying chicken and boiling eggs so that his family would have something to eat along the way the next day.

One black motorist observed in the early 1940s that while black travelers felt free in the mornings, by the early afternoon a "small cloud" had appeared. By the late afternoon, "it casts a shadow of apprehension on our hearts and sours us a little. 'Where,' it asks us, 'will you stay tonight?'"

They often had to spend hours in the evening trying to find somewhere to stay, sometimes resorting to sleeping in haylofts or in their own cars if they could not find anywhere. One alternative, if it was available, was to arrange in advance to sleep at the homes of black friends in towns or cities along their route. However, this meant detours and an abandonment of the spontaneity that for many was a key attraction of motoring.

The civil rights leader <a href="John%20Lewis%20%28Georgia%20politician%29">John Lewis</a> has recalled how his family prepared for a trip in 1951:
Finding accommodation was one of the greatest challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves "<a href="sundown%20town">sundown town</a>s," which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African-Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were an estimated 10,000 sundown towns across the United States – including large suburbs such as <a href="Glendale%2C%20California">Glendale, California</a> (population 60,000 at the time); <a href="Levittown%2C%20New%20York">Levittown, New York</a> (80,000); and <a href="Warren%2C%20Michigan">Warren, Michigan</a> (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of <a href="Anna%2C%20Illinois">Anna, Illinois</a>, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". 

Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African-Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled: 

African-American travelers faced real physical risks because of the widely differing rules of segregation that existed from place to place, and the possibility of extrajudicial violence against them. Activities that were accepted in one place could provoke violence a few miles down the road. Transgressing formal or unwritten racial codes, even inadvertently, could put travelers in considerable danger.

Even driving etiquette was affected by racism; in the <a href="Mississippi%20Delta">Mississippi Delta</a> region, local custom prohibited blacks from overtaking whites, to prevent their raising dust from the unpaved roads to cover white-owned cars. A pattern emerged of whites purposely damaging black-owned cars to put their owners "in their place".

Stopping anywhere that was not known to be safe, even to allow children in a car to relieve themselves, presented a risk; Milloy noted that his parents would urge him and his brother to control their need to use a bathroom until they could find a safe place to stop, as "those backroads were simply too dangerous for parents to stop to let their little black children pee". Racist local laws, discriminatory social codes, segregated commercial facilities, racial profiling by police, and sundown towns made road journeys a minefield of constant uncertainty and risk.

Road trip narratives by blacks reflected their unease and the dangers they faced, presenting a more complex outlook from those written by whites extolling the joys of the road. Milloy recalls the menacing environment that he encountered during his childhood, in which he learned of "so many black travelers ... just not making it to their destinations."

Even foreign black dignitaries were not immune to the discrimination that African-American travelers routinely encountered. In one high-profile incident, <a href="Komla%20Agbeli%20Gbedemah">Komla Agbeli Gbedemah</a>, the finance minister of newly-independent <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, was refused service at a <a href="Howard%20Johnson%27s">Howard Johnson's</a> restaurant at <a href="Dover%2C%20Delaware">Dover, Delaware</a>, while traveling to Washington, D.C., even after identifying himself by his state position to the restaurant staff. The snub caused an international incident, to which an embarrassed President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> responded by inviting Gbedemah to breakfast at the White House.

Repeated and sometimes violent incidents of discrimination directed against black African diplomats, particularly on <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040">U.S. Route 40</a> between New York and Washington, D.C., led to the administration of President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> setting up a Special Protocol Service Section within the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> to assist black diplomats traveling and living within the United States. The State Department considered issuing copies of "The Negro Motorist Green Book" to black diplomats, but eventually decided against steering them to black-friendly public accommodations as it wanted them to be treated equally to white diplomats.

<a href="John%20A.%20Williams">John A. Williams</a> wrote in his 1965 book, "This Is My Country Too", that he did not believe "white travelers have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America." He achieved it with "nerve, courage, and a great deal of luck," supplemented by "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and "Travelguide", a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse."

He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible on the front seat and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars." There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, "[black] people have a way of disappearing on the road."

Segregation meant that facilities for African-American motorists were limited, but entrepreneurs of both races realized the lucrative opportunities in marketing goods and services to black patrons. The challenge for travelers was to find such oases in the middle of a desert of discrimination. To address this problem, African-American writers produced a number of guides to provide travel advice.

These included directories of hotels, camps, road houses, and restaurants which would serve African-Americans. Jewish travelers, who had long experienced discrimination at many vacation spots, created guides for their own community, though they were at least able to visibly blend in more easily with the general population. African-Americans followed suit with publications such as "Hackley and Harrison's Hotel and Apartment Guide for Colored Travelers", published in 1930 to cover "Board, Rooms, Garage Accommodations, etc. in 300 Cities in the United States and Canada".

"The Negro Motorist Green Book" was one of the best known of the African-American travel guides. It was conceived in 1932 and first published in 1936 by <a href="Victor%20H.%20Green">Victor H. Green</a>, a <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> veteran from New York City who worked as a mail carrier and later as a travel agent. He said his aim was "to give the Negro traveler information that will keep him from running into difficulties, embarrassments and to make his trip more enjoyable." According to an editorial written by Novera C. Dashiell in the 1956 edition of the "Green Book", "the idea crystallized when not only [Green] but several friends and acquaintances complained of the difficulties encountered; oftentimes painful embarrassments suffered which ruined a vacation or business trip."

Green asked his readers to provide information "on the Negro motoring conditions, scenic wonders in your travels, places visited of interest and short stories on one's motoring experience." He offered a reward of one dollar for each accepted account, which he increased to five dollars by 1941. He also obtained information from colleagues in the U.S. Postal Service, who would "ask around on their routes" to find suitable public accommodations. The Postal Service was and remains one of the largest employers of African-Americans, and its employees were ideally situated to inform Green of which places were safe and hospitable to African-American travelers.

The "Green Book's" motto, displayed on the front cover, urged black travelers to "Carry your Green Book with you – You may need it". The 1949 edition included a quote from <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>: "Travel is fatal to prejudice", inverting Twain's original meaning; as Cotten Seiler puts it, "here it was the visited, rather than the visitors, who would find themselves enriched by the encounter." Green commented in 1940 that the "Green Book" had given black Americans "something authentic to travel by and to make traveling better for the Negro."

Its principal goal was to provide accurate information on black-friendly accommodations to answer the constant question that faced black drivers: "Where will you spend the night?" As well as essential information on lodgings, service stations and garages, it provided details of leisure facilities open to African Americans, including beauty salons, restaurants, nightclubs and country clubs. The listings focused on four main categories – hotels, motels, tourist homes (private residences, usually owned by African-Americans, which provided accommodation to travelers), and restaurants. They were arranged by state and subdivided by city, giving the name and address of each business. For an extra payment, businesses could have their listing displayed in bold type or have a star next to it to denote that they were "recommended".

Many such establishments were run by and for African-Americans and in some cases were named after prominent figures in African-American history. In North Carolina, such black-owned businesses included the <a href="George%20Washington%20Carver">Carver</a>, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, and <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> hotels, the Friendly City beauty parlor, the Black Beauty Tea Room, the New Progressive tailor shop, the Big Buster tavern, and the Blue Duck Inn. Each edition also included feature articles on travel and destinations, and included a listing of black resorts such as <a href="Idlewild%2C%20Michigan">Idlewild, Michigan</a>; <a href="Oak%20Bluffs%2C%20Massachusetts">Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts</a>; and <a href="Belmar%2C%20New%20Jersey">Belmar, New Jersey</a>. The state of <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> was particularly recommended as a place where most motels would welcome "guests on the basis of ‘cash rather than color.'"

The "Green Book" attracted sponsorship from a number of businesses, including the African-American newspapers "<a href="Call%20and%20Post">Call and Post</a>" of <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a>, and the "<a href="Louisville%20Leader">Louisville Leader</a>" of <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>. <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a> (later <a href="Esso">Esso</a>) was also a sponsor, owing to the efforts of James "Billboard" Jackson, a pioneering African-American Esso sales representative. Esso's "race group", part of its marketing division, promoted the "Green Book" as enabling Esso's black customers to "go further with less anxiety". By contrast, <a href="Shell%20Oil%20Company">Shell</a> gas stations were known to refuse black customers. 

The 1949 edition included an Esso endorsement message that told readers: "As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recommend the "Green Book" for your travel convenience. Keep one on hand each year and when you are planning your trips, let Esso Touring Service supply you with maps and complete routings, and for real 'Happy Motoring' – use Esso Products and Esso Service wherever you find the Esso sign." Photographs of some African-American entrepreneurs who owned Esso gas stations appeared in the pages of the "Green Book".

Although Green usually refrained from editorializing in the "Green Book", he let his readers' letters speak for the influence of his guide. William Smith of <a href="Hackensack%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hackensack, New Jersey</a>, described it as a "credit to the Negro Race" in a letter published in the 1938 edition. He commented:

Earl Hutchinson Sr., the father of journalist <a href="Earl%20Ofari%20Hutchinson">Earl Ofari Hutchinson</a>, wrote of a 1955 move from Chicago to California that "you literally didn't leave home without [the "Green Book"]." <a href="Ernest%20Green">Ernest Green</a>, one of the <a href="Little%20Rock%20Nine">Little Rock Nine</a>, used the "Green Book" to navigate the from Arkansas to Virginia in the 1950s and comments that "it was one of the survival tools of segregated life".

According to the civil rights leader <a href="Julian%20Bond">Julian Bond</a>, recalling his parents' use of the "Green Book", "it was a guidebook that told you not where the best places were to eat, but where there was "any" place." Bond comments:

While the "Green Book" was intended to make life easier for those living under Jim Crow, its publisher looked forward to a time when such guidebooks would no longer be necessary. As Green wrote, "there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go as we please, and without embarrassment."

Los Angeles is now considering offering special protection to the sites that kept black travelers safe. Ken Bernstein, principal planner for the city's Office of Historic Resources notes, "At the very least, these sites can be incorporated into our city's online inventory system. They are part of the story of African Americans in Los Angeles, and the story of Los Angeles itself writ large."

The "Green Book" was published locally in New York, but its popularity was such that from 1937 it was distributed nationally with input from <a href="Charles%20McDowell">Charles McDowell</a>, a collaborator on Negro Affairs for the U.S. Travel Bureau, a government agency. With new editions published annually from 1936 to 1940, the "Green Book's" publication was suspended during World War II and resumed in 1946.

Its scope expanded greatly during its years of publication; from covering only the New York City metropolitan area in the first edition, it eventually covered facilities in most of the United States and parts of Canada (primarily Montreal), Mexico and Bermuda. Coverage was good in the eastern United States and weak in <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> states such as <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>, where there were few black residents. It eventually sold around 15,000 copies per year, distributed by mail order, by black-owned businesses and <a href="Esso">Esso</a> service stations, some of which—unusual for the oil industry at the time—were franchised to African Americans.

It originally sold for 25 cents, increasing to $1.25 by 1957. With the book's growing success, Green retired from the post office and hired a small publishing staff that operated from 200 West 135th Street in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. He also established a vacation reservation service in 1947 to take advantage of the post-war boom in automobile travel. From 10 pages in its first edition, by 1949 he had expanded the "Green Book" to more than 80 pages, including advertisements.

The 1951 "Green Book" recommended that black-owned businesses raise their standards, as travelers were "no longer content to pay top prices for inferior accommodations and services". The quality of black-owned lodgings was coming under scrutiny, as many prosperous blacks found them to be second-rate compared to the white-owned lodgings from which they were excluded. In 1952, Green renamed the publication "The Negro Travelers' Green Book", in recognition of its coverage of international destinations requiring travel by plane and ship.

Although segregation was still in force, by state laws in the South and often by practice elsewhere, the wide circulation of the "Green Book" had attracted growing interest from white businesses that wanted to tap into the potential sales of the black market. The 1955 edition noted: 
A few years after its publication ... white business has also recognized its ["The Green Book"’s] value and it is now in use by the Esso Standard Oil Co., The American Automobile Assn. and its affiliate automobile clubs throughout the country, other automobile clubs, air lines, travel bureaus, travelers aid, libraries and thousands of subscribers.

By the start of the 1960s, the "Green Book"s market was beginning to erode. Even before the passage of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, African-American civil rights activism was having the effect of lessening racial segregation in public facilities. An increasing number of middle-class African Americans were beginning to question whether guides such as the "Green Book" were accommodating Jim Crow by steering black travelers to segregated businesses rather than encouraging them to push for equal access.

Black-owned motels in remote locations off state highways lost customers to a new generation of integrated interstate motels located near freeway exits. The 1963 "Green Book" acknowledged that the activism of the civil rights movement had "widened the areas of public accommodations accessible to all," but it defended the continued listing of black-friendly businesses because "a family planning for a vacation hopes for one that is free of tensions and problems."

The final edition was renamed, now called the "Travelers' Green Book: 1966-67 International Edition: For Vacation Without Aggravation"; it was the last to be published after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made the guide effectively obsolete by outlawing racial discrimination in public accommodation. That edition included significant changes that reflected the post-Civil Rights Act outlook. As the new title indicated, it was no longer just for the Negro, nor solely for the motorist, as its publishers sought to widen its appeal. 

Although the content continued to proclaim its mission of highlighting leisure options for black travelers, the cover featured a drawing of a blonde Caucasian woman water skiing, – a sign of how, as Michael Ra-Shon Hall puts it, "the Green Book ‘whitened’ its surface and internationalized its scope, while still remaining true to its founding mission to ensure the security of African-American travelers both in the U.S. and abroad."

In the 2000s, academics, artists, curators, and writers exploring the history of African-American travel in the United States during the Jim Crow era revived interest in the "Green Book". The result has been a number of projects, books and other works referring to the "Green Book". The book itself has acquired a high value as a collectors' item; a "partly perished" copy of the 1941 edition sold at auction in March 2015 for $22,500. Some examples are listed below.
